0,CVS,"Stock futures were lower Monday morning for the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100, heading into the start of the second quarter. Walmart (WMT) reportedly is in talks with Humana (HUM), President Trump continued to hammer Amazon (AMZN) and make new threats to scrap the Nafta trade agreement. Tesla (TSLA) faced more negative headlines ahead of Model 3 production figures.Meanwhile, China began implementing tariffs on 128 U.S. products. They are officially in retaliation for U.S. steel tariffs, but coming as Trump has announced plans for penalties on $60 billion in Chinese goods.The stock market entered a correction last week as the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones tested their 200-day moving averages and many leading tech stocks suffered serious damage. But the major averages rebounded. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones surged more than 2% for the week while the Nasdaq composite gained 1%.For the first quarter, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones fell while the Nasdaq advanced.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStock futures pointed to a 0.3% decline vs. fair value for the S&P 500 index. Dow Jones futures were off 0.15%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.8% in the stock market today.Keep in mind that extended trading often doesn't carry over to the regular session. Stock futures did not predict last Tuesday's sell-off. Stock futures did point to a solid open on Thursday, but didn't see the magnitude of the regular session's gains.Walmart is talks with health insurer Humana, according to multiple reports. That could mean deepening an existing partnership or possibly a takeover.That would follow several other big health care deals, including the pending CVS Health-Aetna takeover and the Cigna purchase of Express Scripts. Those deals reflect in part concerns over Amazon's moves into health care.Walmart-Humana would have some of the same logic as the CVS Health-Aetna deal. Walmart has thousands of pharmacies in its stores. A deal with Humana could direct more people to its pharmacies, boosting sales and perhaps curbing costs. Humana also has a sizable pharmacy benefit manager operation, much as pharmacy giant CVS is also a huge PBM.Walmart stock fell 1% in late Thursday trading while Humana jumped 10%. Humana leapt 8% in Monday's premarket while Walmart was not yet active. How they react in regular trading may depend on whether the companies confirm or deny talks, and whether investors see a takeover as likely.Amazon tumbled through its 50-day line Wednesday on a report that Trump wants to ""go after"" the e-commerce giant. The White House denied any anti-Amazon move was on the way. But on Thursday, Trump on Twitter accused Amazon of paying little in taxes and paying too-low rates to the U.S. Postal Service. Amazon initially fell further, but closed higher as the stock market rallied strongly. But Amazon held below its 50-day/10-week line.On Saturday, Trump continued his anti-Amazon claims on Twitter. He also hammered The Washington Post, owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that ""the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned,"" and that...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018 ...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a ""lobbyist"" and should so REGISTER. If the P.O. ""increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion."" This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018Amazon stock was down 1% early Monday.Tesla confirmed Friday that Autopilot was engaged during a recent Model X crash that killed the human driver. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board last week said it was probing the accident. On Sunday, the NTSB said it was ""unhappy"" that Tesla disclosed details about the crash. Late Thursday, Tesla recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles for a possible flaw in its power steering.Also last week, Moody's downgraded Tesla over its heavy cash burn and Model 3 production woes.Tesla should release first-quarter production and delivery figures for the Model 3, Model S and Model X this week. The focus will be on Model 3 output, which has repeatedly missed company targets, which have cut and pushed back several times.The automaker, once again, raced to boost vehicle output and deliveries at the end of the quarter. Tesla encouraged Model S and Model X production workers to volunteer to help on the Model 3. But that highlights how Tesla hasn't worked out how to ramp up production in a steady, sustainable way.The Autopilot and Model 3 woes are more glaring now because Tesla no longer has such a huge technological edge. Major automakers are rapidly introducing electric vehicles. General Motors (GM) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Waymo are among those planning to roll out robotaxi services.As for Tesla? Sister company SpaceX put an old Tesla Roadster into space.Tesla stock, despite a Thursday rebound, tumbled 12% for the week and 22% in March. Shares fell 3% early Monday.The stock is at 52-week lows, but really has not made much progress since 2014. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since last June. The RS line is at its lowest levels since the start of 2017.Even if Tesla beats low-ball Model 3 production estimates and the stock gets a nice pop, that won't change the stock's overall laggard trend.Tesla CEO Elon Musk cracked April Fools' Day jokes, tweeting that Tesla was bankrupt.Tesla Goes Bankrupt

2,CVS,"Pfizer (PFE) and President Donald Trump are playing a game of chicken over drug price increases — and a number of other pharmaceutical companies could follow suit.On its face, it appears Pfizer, a Dow Jones component, acquiesced to Trump's push against drug price increases. In reality, though, Pfizer only said it would defer price hikes. It will wait until the president's blueprint for reform goes into effect, or the end of the year — whichever is first.Height Capital Markets analyst Andrea Harris says this amounts to a thinly veiled threat from Pfizer to Trump. The drugmaker wants Trump to either ""put up or shut up"" when it comes to hitting middlemen like pharmacy benefit managers, also known as PBMs.Pharmaceutical companies can offer rebates on their drug so patients don't have to pay high list prices. PBMs act as middlemen between drugmakers and insurance companies to negotiate these rebates. Their customers include large employers plus Medicare and Medicaid.But PBMs — like Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and UnitedHealth (UNH) — are under fire. Some are questioning whether these middlemen pass on as much of the savings as they can to patients. Not doing so could keep drug prices artificially high.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""If the Trump Administration takes Pfizer's threat more seriously than the pharmaceutical industry is taking the administration's threats, this could pressure the Department of Health and Human Services to issue new regulations that either reform the current use of PBM rebates or ban them outright,"" she said.The former is more likely, Harris said in a report to clients. On Friday, shares of pharmaceutical companies were up slightly. Biotech stocks slipped a fraction on the stock market today.The enthusiasm followed news late Tuesday that Pfizer would back off drug price increases. Those were to take effect July 1 following ""extensive discussions with President Trump."" Trump had previously accused Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies of enacting drug price increases without reason.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin called Pfizer's drug price increases in July ""a calculated risk that did not succeed."" On average, the company put forth an average 7%-8% increase on 40 out of 400 drugs, Rubin said.In the current political climate, that takes chutzpah. Trump has called out pharmaceutical companies for ""getting away with murder"" on how they price drugs. In May, Trump claimed his blueprint would force pharmaceutical companies to cut their drug prices.Analysts say it's still not clear how the blueprint will decrease prices. Height's Harris describes it as ""dozens of questions for public comment"" vs. actual policy.""Most biopharma companies have eliminated the practice of semiannual price increases and only take increases at the beginning of the year,"" Rubin said in a report to clients. ""Pfizer has been the only U.S. company with a second increase this year.""Globally, Roche (RHHBY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) took a second price increase in 2018. Among biotech companies, Celgene (CELG) went through with 5% increases. Those were on blockbuster cancer drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report this week.But even the Celgene hikes remain in line with medical inflation for 2018, at 5.3%. RBC's Abrahams and Goldman's Rubin expect pharmaceutical companies to self-police when it comes to drug price increases. Guidance across companies will be key in the second quarter.""We think the more realistic outcome of (the Pfizer) news will be that companies will have to be even more conservative with their next round of price increases,"" Rubin said. ""A second round (of increases) will essentially become verboten.""RELATED:Can You Make Roaring Stock Profits With A Little Cash?

3,CVS,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Friday: What you need to know as an investor for the coming day. The June jobs report, often a stock market mover, could take a back seat to big news of the day — possibly the first big shots in the China trade war as Trump tariffs are set to hit at the stroke of midnight.If the Trump tariffs do kick in at midnight Eastern Time, adding 25% to $34 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports, Beijing is set to immediately retaliate — dollar for dollar — with tariffs on U.S. autos and agriculture.Stocks have fallen in recent weeks on Trump trade war fears. So it's unclear how the major averages and key sectors will react if the China tariffs go into effect, or not.But the broader implications are huge. If the tariffs take effect, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off the table or on hold, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina right now is set to slap a further 25% tariff on U.S.-built cars and SUVs. That will hit Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and others. Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) already warned that profits on Alabama-built SUVs will suffer. Chinese tariffs on U.S. agriculture, including soybeans, would indirectly hit Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers rake in profits.LED maker Cree will be among the U.S. companies hit by the Trump tariffs after the Trump administration turned down its request for an exemption. Cree (CREE) warned that the tariffs would limit its R&D spending and planned manufacturing expansion.Trump tariffs hitting U.S. semiconductor makers will come in the next batch of $16 billion worth of goods targeted. Those tariffs still face a final review, but their likelihood will rise markedly if the first round of tariffs takes effect.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL). China has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Economists expect the June employment report to show the U.S. added 190,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate held at 3.8%. The Labor Department report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.Average hourly earnings is the big number to watch. Expect annual wage growth to tick up to 2.8%. That would match the best pay gain since 2009.Costco (COST) boosted its starting wage by $1 and other wages by 25-50 cents an hour effective June 11. That followed wage hikes earlier this year by Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Kroger (KR) and more.Rising wage growth would offer more evidence that the historical link between lower unemployment and higher pay is still intact. Higher wages, in turn, are expected to fuel higher inflation. Any upside surprise in wages will boost odds of a third and fourth Fed hike this year, as long as rising trade war fears don't curb economic enthusiasm.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Trump Tariffs Hit, The U.S. Is Losing The China Trade War — Big TimeThese Auto Stocks Rev Higher; Is Trump Tariffs 'Ploy' Working?Breakout Watch: IBD 50 List Stock With 171% Growth Stock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

4,CVS,"Walmart (WMT) is early talks with Humana (HUM) about a possible takeover, according to multiple reports late Thursday. A Walmart-Humana deal would push the world's largest retailer deep into health care, which is in the midst of a major consolidation binge to gain scope and cut costs.Humana stock shot up 10% in late trading on the initial Wall Street Journal report. Reuters also confirmed talks for closer links or even an acquisition.

5,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue Wednesday as drugstore rivals CVS Health (CVS) and Rite Aid (RAD) are in the midst of big mergers as part of a wave of health care consolidations. Walgreens also raised full-year guidance.Walgreens earned $1.73 a share, up 27% vs. a year earlier. Revenue grew 12.1% to $33.02 billion. Analysts had expected the drugstore chain to earn $1.55 on sales of $31.993 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.

6,CVS,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite retreated in a volatile market as Trump trade war fears waxed and waned, with Nike (NKE) and bank stocks fueling a Friday rebound. Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy.

The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles.

But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion.

Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS.

AT&T closed the $85 billion merger on Friday. The landmark ruling boosted share prices in media firms CBS (CBS), Lionsgate (LGF), and Discovery Communications (DISCA). The decision is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media firms by telecom giants. The deal also bodes well for big vertical health care mergers, including CVS Health (CVS) buying Aetna (AET).Comcast (CMSCA), as expected, launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company, a 19% premium over the Walt Disney (DIS) offer. Disney in November agreed to buy Fox — including its stake in broadcaster Sky — for $54.4 billion in stock. Fox's board is expected to withdraw its recommendation for Disney's offer. The companies are unlikely to carve up Fox, analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Esports were a major topic at this year's show with tournaments for games such as ""Fortnite: Battle Royale"" from Epic Games and ""Super Smash Bros."" from Nintendo. The rise of subscription services, such as Electronic Arts (EA) Origin Access Premier and Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox Game Pass, also was a hot topic, as was the future of streaming for video games. EA and Activision cleared buy zones while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) broke out.The Fed hiked its key interest rate, as expected, for the second time this year. Somewhat surprisingly, policymakers penciled in two more hikes this year. Chairman Jerome Powell declared the economy to be in ""great shape,"" and expressed no sense that the a hawkish shift in policy would be any risk.May retail sales rose 0.8%, their best gain in six months, backing up Powell's assessment. That spurred some Wall Street firms to boost second-quarter GDP growth projections to 4% or more. Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation picked up to 2.2% from a year ago, the highest since early 2017, and further increases are likely.Adobe Systems (ADBE) earned an adjusted $1.66 a share in its fiscal Q2, up 63% year over year, on sales of $2.20 billion, up 24%. Analysts expected the Digital media and marketing software firm to earn an adjusted $1.54 a share on sales of $2.16 billion. For its current fiscal third quarter, Adobe guided modestly higher. Adobe shares pulled back 2.4% on Friday after a big run in 2018 and over the last few years.Shares of Etsy (ETSY) soared 26% Thursday after the arts and crafts online retailer raised 2018 revenue guidance and announced new subscription packages and higher seller fees, among other initiatives. It now sees revenue of $582 million to $591 million. That's growth of 32% to 34%, up from prior guidance of 22% to 24%. Etsy raised the transaction fees on sellers to 5% from 3.5%. It will spend $110 million on direct marketing in 2018, up 40% from last year. Etsy has 2 million active sellers on its platform and 35 million active buyers.Earnings more than doubled to $1.10 a share, smashing estimates for 87 cents a share. KMG Chemicals (KMG), which makes chemicals used in chips, solar panels and consumer electronics, also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares rocketed 11% for the week, blasting into and beyond a buy zone.Canada Goose (GOOS) swung to a profit of 7 cents a share from a loss of 12 cents per share a year ago. Revenue more than doubled to $98.8 million. Analysts expected loss of 8 cents on sales of $61 million. The outerwear company typically makes money in the fall and winter but loses money in the warmer months. Canada Goose sees fiscal 2019 EPS growth of at least 25% and revenue 20% or more. Canada Goose stock soared 33% Friday.RH (RH), the furniture purveyor formerly known as Restoration Hardware, grew earnings per share 27-fold to $1.33 vs. views for $1.01. Revenue dipped 0.9% to $557 million surprising analysts who expected $564 million. Enhanced earnings guidance for 2018 and a strong Q2 outlook drove investor confidence. Shares soared 31% on Tuesday, adding to RH's history of wild stock swings after earnings reports.Arcade-restaurant chain Dave & Buster's (PLAY) topped Q1 views, as EPS grew 19.5% to $1.04 and revenue rose 9% to $332 million. Same-store sales fell 4.9%, a narrower decline than expected. Dave & Buster's is rolling out a new virtual reality game tied to the new movie ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" and some analysts see that as a game changer.

The International Energy Agency warned that economic turmoil in Venezuela and renewed sanctions on Iran could lead to a supply gap late next year if OPEC can't make up for lost production.

9,CVS,"Investors are running for the exit in anticipation of federal action against drug companies blamed for the opioid crisis.Drug distributors including Cardinal Health (CAH), AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and McKesson (MCK) extended losses for a second day as President Donald Trump pledged to lower drug prices ""very substantially in the not-so-distant future."" He said the Justice Department is considering ""major"" federal litigation against the companies involved in the crisis.Trump threatened to ""get tough"" on drug dealers, including using the death penalty in certain cases, while speaking yesterday in New Hampshire, one of the states hardest hit by opioid addiction. The Justice Department will decide by early April whether to join local governments suing makers of opioid painkillers.Endo International (ENDP), whose shares plunged as much as 11% on Tuesday, is among those being investigated by various U.S. states.

10,CVS,"President Trump just rolled out his ""American Patients First"" strategy to bring down drug prices. The plan includes several promising reforms that could sharply reduce out-of-pocket costs.Already, the administration has made progress in curbing the nation's drug spending.After FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb won Senate confirmation last spring, he introduced a Drug Competition Action Plan to streamline the approval process for generic drugs.  Last year alone, the FDA approved over 1,000 generics — an all-time record. Thanks to the newly available, cheaper treatments, Americans saved nearly $9 billion.Now, the administration is turning its attention towards pharmacy benefit managers. These middlemen work on behalf of insurers, corporations, unions, municipalities, and other entities that sponsor health plans. PBMs act as the arbiter for all things drug-related in these plans. They determine which medicines are covered and how much patients will pay at the pharmacy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePBMs use their gatekeeper role to demand large rebates from drug companies. If manufacturers don't acquiesce, PBMs can blacklist their products. Three PBMs — OptumRx, CVS Caremark, and Express Scripts — control over 80% of the market, so they have enormous leverage.On average, PBMs receive rebates and discounts that reduce medicines' list prices by about one-third.  But they only pass about 10% of these rebates to patients.  They share the rest with their clients — or pocket the savings for themselves. And they keep these figures under wraps. So neither patients nor health plans know the full scope of the rebates.Anthem, one of the nation's largest health insurers, actually sued its PBM in 2016 for allegedly overcharging by $3 billion each year and failing to pass on rebates.  Patients have filed numerous class-action lawsuits against PBMs, alleging that the middlemen overcharged them.President Trump wants PBMs to be more transparent about the rebates they secure. His administration may mandate that PBMs in the Medicare Part D program pass one-third of the rebates along to Medicare beneficiaries.  This would save patients more than $19 billion over the coming decade.He also floated another major reform — requiring PBMs to act as ""fiduciaries"" to their health plan clients.  This would legally obligate PBMs to negotiate the best deal possible for their clients — rather than structuring rebates in a way that primarily benefits the PBM.President Trump also wants to eliminate the pharmacist ""gag rule"" — a restriction imposed by PBMs and insurers.Here's how it works. In many cases, a patient's co-pay exceeds the total cost of a drug. For instance, a 30-day generic prescription might only cost $10, yet the patient faces a $15 co-pay.The rule prohibits pharmacists from informing patients that it'd be cheaper to just pay the $10 directly — without using their insurance cards.  This forced silence costs American patients millions of dollars in unnecessary spending. Overpayments impacted one in four patients and totaled $135 million in 2013, according to a recent study from the University of Southern California.Of course, the president's plan isn't perfect. It proposes price caps on Medicare Part B drugs, which include most chemotherapies and other intravenous medications. The proposal would require manufacturers to pay a rebate to Medicare when the price of their drugs increases faster than inflation.Price controls deter researchers from developing new treatments. They trade short-term savings for patients' long-term health.With a few exceptions, the American Patients First agenda is full of smart, practical reforms. The sooner it's implemented, the sooner people will enjoy lower prices at the pharmacy counter.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

11,CVS,"A Federal Reserve rate hike on Wednesday is a near certainty, so the focus will be on Fed policymakers' projections of future policy, especially whether they see a fourth hike in the cards in 2018.If Fed members don't step up their expectation for three quarter-point hikes on Wednesday, they're very likely to by June — even if inflation remains tame.The Fed's most influential dove in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely-seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBrainard echoed new Fed Chair Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Yet once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will adjust rate-hike expectations upward, if they don't do so on Wednesday.Stocks overall have paused in recent weeks, with the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average all falling more than 1% Monday as Facebook (FB) triggered selling. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are both below their 50-day moving averages. But the major averages have rallied sharply over the last several years. The major averages rose modestly on Tuesday.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019 which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending. That's the recipe for a big economic slowdown late next year or in the first half of 2020.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowTrump Triple-Witching Week: The Fed, Tariffs And MuellerThese 5 Top Stocks Stood Out Monday

This is up from 18.9 million ADRs worth $358 million the previous quarter.Health insurers shares slumped after Buffett, Amazon (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced January a joint venture whose aim is to cut U.S. health care costs.""We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder's meeting earlier this month. ""The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.""However rivals are betting against the plan, with power player Jana Partners revealing Tuesday new positions in Anthem and Cigna (CI), while Omega Advisors and billionaire investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management have taken new positions in UnitedHealth, according to their regulatory filings.Teva had been under pressure since Mylan's (MYL) generic version of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone was approved in October and amid challenges facing the U.S. generic medicines industry.To contend, Teva announced a restructuring plan to trim $3 billion in spending by closing plants and cutting drug programs. In February, Teva said it was well on its way to realizing half those savings by year's end.One Buffett decision that hedge fund managers seem to agree with is his increased Apple holding. Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners has a new position in the tech giant, though it has sold all its shares in Facebook (FB).

13,CVS,"Biotech stocks and pharmaceutical companies added to recent market gains Monday after Trump's top health aide delivered a speech that largely spared them the brunt of drug-pricing reform.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar delivered his speech on drug-pricing reform Monday. Like Trump, his speech was light on its impact for biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies. Instead, the White House is considering changes to Medicare and caps on out-of-pocket spending.Most proposals will impact so-called middlemen including pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs and drug distributors. They include the likes of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC). But Azar was critical of pharmaceutical companies' high list prices and a lack of transparency in direct-to-consumer advertising.""We look forward to working with industry to build a better system,"" he said.

The Nasdaq Biotechnology (NBI) was flat while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) index rose 1%.Among the proposals, RBC analysts see changes to Medicare Part B and Part D as having the biggest impact on biotech stocks. Still, they wrote in a note to clients even that will still be ""relatively benign overall.""Part B covers physician-administered drugs whereas Part D covers prescription drugs. Under the proposal, negotiation from some Part B drugs would be more similar to Part D negotiation. More broadly, the president is calling for Part B to merge into Part D, Azar said.""Inflation-capped price increases in Part B is likely most impactful proposal in biotech, as well as out-of-pocket transparency for Part B vs. Part D drugs (infusions vs. self-injectables) and unifying Part B billing codes,"" RBC analysts said.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) has the largest exposure among large-cap biotechs to Part B through its eye disease drug called Eylea. Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Amgen (AMGN) also are exposed. Further, Sage Therapeutics (SAGE), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Dynavax (DVAX) face difficulties.Azar also suggested changes to how PBMs issue and negotiate rebates. He proposed an end so-called ""gag clauses"" on pharmacists. These prevent pharmacists from telling consumers when they'd actually save money by paying out of pocket for their medicines.""Right now, we're asking a pretty straightforward question: What if, instead of the current system where drug companies get paid rebates and middlemen take a cut, we just had fixed-price discounts?"" Azar said. ""This would fix the situation where even the pharmacy benefit manager, who is hired to help keep prices low, makes money from higher list prices.""He also suggested pharmaceutical companies include their list prices in advertising that goes out directly to consumers. Further, Azar said he and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are developing incentives to lower list prices.But most of these changes are long-term ""further actions,"" Raymond James analyst Michael Baker said in a note. Changes to Part D contracts that prevent pharmacists from explaining when out-of-pocket costs are cheaper ""will likely not have a meaningful impact.""RELATED:Biotech Stocks Fly As Trump Speech Seen As 'More Bark Than Bite'Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

While political support for the tax cuts has strengthened, polling shows that only about 1 in 4 registered voters noticed an increase in their paychecks. Some of the tax-cut dividends will come via a bigger child tax credit that is paid at tax time.Positive news continued to roll in from the response to corporate tax cuts, with CVS Health (CVS) hiking its minimum wage to $11 an hour, following earlier pay-hike announcements from Walmart (WMT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Starbucks (SBUX) and dozens of other companies since the tax cuts were passed.President Trump on March 1 announced plans to impose a 25% steel tariff and a 10% aluminum tariff on all imports.

After the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures extended gains, with the major averages opening modestly higher on the stock market today. The 10-year Treasury yield pointed lower.The overall consumer price index rose 0.2% on the month and 2.2% from a year ago, matching expectations.The Fed is expected to hike rates three times this year, with quarter-point moves, as the economy looks headed for relatively strong growth and the jobless rate could sink to a multidecade low. Fed policymakers expect that wage pressures will rise as unemployment falls, leading companies to pass on some of their higher wage bills in the form of price increases.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Yet even doves on the Fed are beginning to sound more hawkish.

To some extent, Cigna may be jumping into the frying pan.Cigna will pay $48.75 plus 0.2434 share for each Express Scripts share.

Shares of Cigna closed down 11% at 172.00 on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Express Scripts jumped 8.6% to 79.72. Among competitors, UnitedHealth (UNH) dipped 0.8%, CVS Health rose 1.3%, while Humana (HUM) lost 1.4%.Cigna sees the combination as giving it the scale and skill sets to deliver value to customers, hold down health costs and compete in a world in which its competitors like UnitedHealth and CVS, after it completes its merger with Aetna, own an increasingly formidable array of health care assets.Cigna told analysts on Thursday that the deal would immediately add to earnings and provide a significant boost in the intermediate term. The company raised its EPS target for 2021 to $20-$21 per share from $18.Yet some industry analysts worry that Amazon.com (AMZN) will disrupt the prescription industry.

20,CVS,"If the February jobs report out Friday morning comes in as strong as Wall Street expects, it will set financial markets up for another Fed interest-rate scare later this spring.X Here's the reason: Economists expect the new jobs data to match January's 2.9% hourly annual wage gain — the best since 2009. That's even though that surprising data point appeared inflated by a dive in the work week that disproportionately reduced hours for low-wage workers. But even bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which won't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Wall Street also expects that the jobless rate dipped to 4.0% in February for the first time since 2000, as the economy added a robust 205,000 jobs.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Start NowThe combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains fits perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.That's why an interest-rate scare is looking increasingly likely, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.Yet the competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018. Already those odds are about 1 in 3, up from about 20% a month ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These Three Dow Jones Stocks Are Near Buy Points As 2 FANGs Make Bullish MoveThe Big Picture: This Is The Real News For InvestorsHere Are 10 Chip Stocks Breaking Out, Hitting New Highs Or Setting UpWhat Do Facebook, Grubhub, Salesforce And Epam Have In Common?

24,CVS,"The Fed meeting ended with no rate hike, as expected. The no news briefly boosted stocks, but they quickly reversed lower. Higher interest rates, inflation and the dollar won't let the Dow Jones and the broader stock market snap out of their recent funk.Wall Street expected the Fed statement to recognize that the pickup in core inflation has suddenly brought it close to the 2% inflation target. The Commerce Department reported Monday that the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 1.9% from a year ago in March.""On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2%,"" the Fed statement said. The Fed also signaled it was willing to let inflation rise above 2%, stating that it's a ""symmetric"" target.With no press conference or update of policymakers' economic projections, any hawkish or dovish shift won't be known until Fed meeting minutes come out on May 23.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDespite healthy earnings from Apple (AAPL), the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index were both close to the flat line just before the Fed meeting announcement, while the Nasdaq composite was barely higher. Apple is the largest component of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq.After the 2 p.m. ET announcement, the Nasdaq expanded modest gains, but only briefly. Heading into the close, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones and S&P 500, after briefly turning positive, fell 0.7%. All finished near session lows.Investors won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike concerns. The Labor Department's April employment report out on Friday is expected to show that the jobless rate fell to 4.0% last month. Average hourly wage growth above the 2.7% expected also is a threat, with major employers like CVS Health (CVS), Target (TGT) and Starbucks (SBUX) announcing that wage hikes would take effect this spring.The latest culprit for the sluggish stock market is the dollar. The U.S. dollar index hit a new high for the year on Wednesday, continuing its recent resurgence against other major currencies. The greenback's roughly 3% rise since the end of March will have a dampening effect on earnings for U.S. multinationals with broad international exposure like Dow Jones stocks Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and Merck (MRK). Earnings in foreign currencies are worth less in dollar terms when the dollar strengthens.The dollar's strength stems from the pickup in inflation and growing expectations that the Fed will hike rates four times this year. Meanwhile, central banks in Europe and Japan are in no rush to tighten. The widening gap between interest rates in the U.S. and overseas has made the dollar more of a draw.Higher interest rates and inflation also could squeeze earnings in coming quarters. Higher interest rates also raise borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and can crimp the affordability of major purchases like autos and housing. Further, two-year Treasury yields have climbed more than 10-year yields, and the flatter yield curve pinches net interest margins for the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).After the Fed meeting, the 10-year yield was at 2.972%, while the two-year was at 2.496%. Those were little changed, but the yield spread is near its lowest level in years.Meanwhile, more companies are beginning to note profit-margin pressure from rising input costs, higher fuel and transportation costs, and rising wages.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Squeeze: Why The Stock Market's Bull Run Faces Its Biggest Threat In YearsIf You Like Apple, You'll Love These 6 Market-Beating Stock PlaysHere's One Way To Play Netflix And Other Hot Internet StocksAmazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The trend suggests a pickup in national average hourly wage gains in coming months, which is likely to raise concerns about a faster pace of Fed rate hikes.CEO Brian Cornell on Tuesday also reiterated Target's  commitment to raise its minimum wage all the way to $15 an hour by the end of 2020, which ""establishes Target as an employer of choice.""Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

Analysts expressed concern that the company's investments in store remodels and labor will limit the earnings uplift from better sales trends.Shares of Target tumbled 4.5% to 71.79 on the stock market today, plunging through the 50-day line for the first time since late November.Walmart stock slipped 1%. Walmart tumbled last month after also coming up light on per-share profit in holiday quarter and 2018 earnings guidance.

At a minimum, Amazon would surely face enormous pressure to embrace Target's $15 minimum wage commitment.In perhaps a reflection of Wall Street's concern about the earnings impact of Target's investments, the company said the wage hike will apply to current associates, suggesting the minimum wage for new workers will remain $11 an hour for now.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Skid, But Nasdaq Rises On Three Pieces Of Good NewsThese 5 Top Financial Stocks Just Carved This 'Super-Growth' PatternWhy Air Force Is Rushing To Fly A Sixth-Generation Fighter JetFed Inflation Gauge Stays Tame, But Here's 6 Reasons Why Investors Are NervousAmazon Vs.

27,CVS,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that he still sees evidence of modest slack in the labor market, meaning the economy still has room to grow without rising inflation pressures.X ""Nothing (in the data) suggests to me that wage inflation is at a point of acceleration,"" Powell said.Powell's remarks were at least somewhat soothing to Wall Street, coming after the main takeaway from his Tuesday appearance before a House panel was that the economy will grow at a faster pace this year than Fed policymakers had anticipated when they penciled in three rate hikes by the end of 2018.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported early Thursday that the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose a tame 1.5% from a year ago in January, as expected.Although the Institute of Supply Management reported that national factory activity in February grew at its fastest pace since 2004 and jobless claims hit a 48-year low, Powell's less-hawkish testimony left Treasury yields little changed in early afternoon trading. Treasury yields dipped by the close as the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on the stock market today as President Trump vowed to impose a 25% steel tariff, raising trade war fears.Inflation has been undershooting expectations for years, so it may seem odd that markets are so focused on the threat now. Yet there's good reason to think that 2018 will be the year when price pressures begin to surface, at least to a moderate extent.That's not to say inflation is about to spike. The war for retail dominance between Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT), the transparency in pricing afforded by the internet and disruptive business models like Airbnb are a legitimate game-changer. A push by the FDA to expedite generic drug approvals is likely to continue to help keep a lid on prescription prices.While such disinflationary fundamentals aren't going away, a host of forces are lining up this year that have potential to finally push inflation up to the Fed's 2% goal.The combination of the $1.5 trillion tax cut and $300 billion spending package is expected to shift an economy that had already picked up speed into still-higher gear.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersStepping on the fiscal accelerator in the ninth year of an economic expansion amid solid growth is an experiment that's never been tried, and it's likely to add to upward cyclical pressure to inflation that tends to emerge when demand for labor and resources rises.With economic optimism on the rise and more dollars in their pocket, consumers may be, on the margins, more receptive to price hikes. Companies that have recently announced price increases include Amazon, which hiked fees for monthly Prime members; Disney (DIS), which raised theme park ticket prices for single-day guests; and Wendy's (WEN), which said on its latest earnings call that it raised prices by 1% in January to offset higher wages and commodity costs.Whether or not the tax cuts really deserve the credit, companies such as Walmart, CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Wells Fargo (WFC) gave a nod to the tax legislation when they subsequently announced pay hikes.Wage growth looks like it will take another step up from the Goldilocks-like 2.5% gain in average hourly wages that prevailed for most of 2017.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Fed policymakers often talk about full employment, the lowest that unemployment can go before inflation starts to accelerate. No one knows exactly where it is and some economists, citing the experience of Japan, have doubts about the theory. Still, some economists expect unemployment to get as low as 3.5% this year, and new Fed chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that 3.5%, in his view, is the lowest imaginable rate of full employment, though he think it might be quite a bit higher.Some industries, such as trucking, are seeing above-average wage gains because the job market for hiring and retaining drivers is especially competitive. Those extra wages tend to get passed along. While transportation makes up a relatively small fraction of a retailer's costs, those extra costs, along with higher retail wages, could affect the end consumer — even if it only results in less discounting.Most inflation tends to be services inflation, so even flat prices for goods would be inflationary.Fed policymakers have said for much of the past year that transitory factors may have only temporarily lowered inflation. One such factor was Verizon (VZ) changing its cell-phone service pricing to provide unlimited data. Because that change began to lower inflation data in March 2017, that temporary factor will drop out of the picture this coming March,Crude oil prices, at about $61.50 per barrel, are about $7 higher than a year ago, boosting the price of gasoline. While the Fed's core gauge of inflation excludes energy prices, higher energy prices can get passed along to consumers. Delta Air Lines (DAL) is among a number of airlines that have tried to pass along higher fuel costs to customers through price hikes recently. So far, those hikes haven't taken hold, but stayed tuned.The U.S. dollar is more than 10% cheaper than it was a year ago, relative to a basket of other currencies from advanced economies. That raises the price of industrial commodities and a range of imported goods. At the least, a rising dollar is no longer working to hold down inflation in the U.S. by making foreign goods cheaper in dollar terms. A weakening dollar, at least at the margins, adds to inflation pressures. Import prices rose for German cars, French cheese and Italian wine, though it's not clear the extent to which end consumers will face higher prices, since consumers have the option of buying nonimports.President Trump has until mid-April to make up his mind over whether to impose tariffs on steel imports, as recommended the Commerce Department. Investors in U.S. Steel (X) appear to be betting that Trump will pull the trigger. Higher steel prices would add costs to cars made in the U.S., though it's not clear how automakers will respond when it comes to auto prices.Another question is how foreign governments will retaliate if the U.S. enacts punitive trade measures that they believe are unwarranted under World Trade Organization rules.The possibility of a trade war that then forfeits some of the disinflationary effects of globalization is among the biggest wild cards in the inflation outlook.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED INInflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowWhat Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon Vs.

28,CVS,"The health care industry is focused on moving care to the lowest-cost setting, with CVS Health (CVS) planning to reinvent its drug stores to offer a broader range of services after merging with Aetna (AET). Yet there's no more convenient or lower-cost place than a cell-phone app.X Teladoc (TDOC) shares have a hit a buy zone this week as the fast-growing telemedicine company said that it's seeing as many as 1,000 flu patients a day this season.Most of Teladoc's appointments are conducted via smartphone app, but they can also be done via computer or over the phone. Doctors can prescribe medicine too, if appropriate.Common conditions include sinus problems, respiratory infection, allergies, urinary tract infection, cold and flu symptoms and many other non-emergency illnesses, according to Teladoc, which also notes the CDC ""strongly encourages patients in communities facing an extreme outbreak of flu to call their doctor before running to an inpatient setting.""General medical ""visits"" cost $40, or about 50% less than a standard doctor's office visit. Teladoc appointments are covered by some plans from Aetna (AET) and other insurers, though limited reimbursement has been a central industry challenge.Teladoc reports earnings after the close on Tuesday, Feb. 27. In January, the company updated its 2018 outlook, saying it expects revenue to grow just over 50% to $350 million-$360 million, with total visits rising by one-third to 1.9 million-2.0 million. Teladoc shares are on a win streak, rising even as the stock market rebound has hit a bit of turbulence.Shares closed above a 38.50 buy point on Wednesday. Shares added another 0.4% to 38.80 on the stock market today. Teladoc has a 93 Relative Strength rating from IBD, meaning the performance and momentum of its stock tops 93% of other companies.IBD'S TAKE: When a stock hits a buy point, a rule of thumb is that investors should only buy the stock within 5% of the breakout point.

29,CVS,"New Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress that he sees ""at most modest risk"" from high asset prices, despite the generally buoyant stock market. But investors sold shares on concerns that Powell and fellow policymakers will raise interest rates more than three times in 2018 due to stepped-up economic growth forecasts.Asked whether low interest rates have fueled ""dangerous risk-taking,"" Powell noted no real build-up of leverage among households or the emergence of other significant risks to financial stability.Wall Street reacted somewhat negatively to Powell's first monetary policy testimony to Congress since taking the helm of the U.S. central bank, focusing on his outlook for stronger economic growth and what that might mean for the number of Fed rate hikes in 2018.Yet the overall tenor of his testimony probably should be taken as positive, because it suggests a lack of urgency to raise interest rates. The Fed, in other words, remains data-dependent and won't move to tighten policy more quickly due to tax cuts and fiscal stimulus unless inflation gathers momentum. On the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite closed at session lows, down more than 1%.Bank stocks fell somewhat amid the broad sell-off. Shares of Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) lost a fraction, though JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and PNC Financial Services (PNC) were down 1% or more. Banks can reap higher net interest margins as interest rates rise, especially when the long-term yields rise more than short-term yields.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 2.90%, off session peaks but not far off last week's four-year high of 2.95%.""At the December meeting, the median participant called for three rate increases in 2018,"" Powell said in response to a question over what it would take for the Fed to hike rates more than three times this year. ""Now since then — we will submit another projection, all of us, in three weeks  — but since then, what we've seen is incoming data that suggests that strengthening in the economy. We've seen continuing strength in the labor market. We've seen some data that will, in my case, add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target. We've also seen continued strength around the globe, and we've seen fiscal policy become more stimulative. So I think each of us is going to be taking the developments since the December meeting into account and writing down our new rate paths as we go into the March meeting.""Powell added that it was his ""personal outlook"" as well as the overall committee that ""the economy has strengthened since December,"" when Fed policymakers last offered their economic and policy projections for 2018.Powell's upgrading of the outlook is hardly a surprise, coming after Congress backed a $300-billion-plus increase in federal spending earlier in February. Even before that, some Fed policymakers had been marking up their economic projections, as noted in the minutes from their Jan. 30-31 meeting.Asked about whether ""profligate fiscal policy"" might require higher interest rates than otherwise by a Democratic committee member, Powell said that the Fed will keep its on eye on the economy, not on the actions of Congress, but he allowed that ""all things equal,"" the appropriate interest rate would be higher when fiscal policy becomes more stimulative.The Q&A seemed to cancel out the seemingly positive reaction to his published testimony. In prepared remarks released before the market open, Powell said that the Fed policymaking committee sees the risks to the economy as balanced between upside and downside risks, even as ""some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,"" especially fiscal policy.The takeaway from the Q&A is that the assessment of balanced risks might date back to the January meeting, before the latest fiscal stimulus.Yet in discussing a possibility that the Fed might discuss adopting an inflation range, instead of its specific 2% target, as a guide for policy, Powell underscored that there's not much reason to worry about an upsurge in inflation.""Generally speaking inflation has been low or stable for 15 years now,"" Powell said.IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. Indeed, core inflation, as measured by the Fed's favored personal consumption expenditures price index, hasn't touched 2.5% since 1995. The past two economic expansions weren't tripped up by the Fed having to tamp down an inflation outbreak, but by the bursting of the dot-com and housing bubbles.So when Powell expresses confidence that few troubling signs of excess have emerged, as well as confidence about a stable inflation outlook, investors should see the potential for this economic expansion running for several more years.In prepared testimony, Powell said, ""In gauging the appropriate path for monetary policy over the next few years, the FOMC will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis.""Powell's testimony comes as firms including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are predicting one more rate hike this year than the Fed's own policymakers projected in December. Passage of a $310 billion budget deal in early February, after the Fed's last meeting, also has led economists to mark up their GDP growth estimates and added to concerns that inflation could make a comeback.Inflation and the risk of a hawkish Fed has come back on the radar of investors after the January jobs report showed average hourly wages growing 2.9% from a year ago, up from the Goldilocks readings near 2.5% that persisted in 2017.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, saying they would spend part of their tax windfall on higher compensation, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Although a faster pace of rate hikes can't be ruled out if wage gains and inflation exhibit momentum, Powell's remarks suggest that the Fed isn't predisposed to a faster pace of rate hikes and will continue to give the economy some running room.Arguably, financial markets are leading the Fed and not the other way around. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a four-year high last week after the Fed minutes from the January meeting noted that ""a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?LGI Homes, Toll Bros.

The deal would likely have been valued at more than $25 billion, as Amerisource has a market cap of around $22 billion.AmerisourceBergen stock fell 2.9% to 97.64 on the stock market today, but well off session lows of 93.16 and settling above its 50-day moving average line.Walgreens stock lost 2.1%.

Albertsons, privately held for several years, will go public via this deal.Health care companies see the need for bigger size and scope to rein in costs and compete. CVS last year announced a still-pending $69 billion acquisition of health insurance giant Aetna (AET).

32,CVS,"Stock market futures rose strongly Tuesday morning after blowout subscriber growth and bullish guidance from Netflix (NFLX) late Monday, with the major market averages likely to test or surpass a key support level.Fellow FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) showed fractional gains, while Netflix's China partner, iQiyi (IQ), continued to add to its recent breakout. But Lam Research's (LRCX) earnings on Tuesday may be more important for the stock market rally.During Monday's session, the Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.9% gain but was unable to close above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index advanced 0.8%, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.7%.Stock market futures jumped. Nasdaq 100 futures, boosted by Netflix, advanced 0.9% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.7%. Dow Jones futures were up 0.75%, helped as UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) edged higher after topping views early Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt those gains, the Dow Jones would clear the 50-day line at the open, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 coming to that level.Leaderboard stock Netflix earned 64 cents a share in the first quarter, up 60% vs. a year earlier, meeting or just beating views depending on what consensus forecast is used. The internet TV giant added 7.41 million streaming subscribers, above its target for 6.35 million. Netflix jumped nearly 7% in premarket trading.Netflix may not have huge coattails, though. Amazon (Amazon Prime Video), Alphabet (Google YouTube) and Facebook (Facebook Watch) all have competing video products, but those aren't their primary revenue and profit drivers. All three FANG stocks rose less than 1% in the premarket.Baidu (BIDU)-unit iQiyi, which came public at 18 in late March, rose 1.3% in the premarket. The so-called ""Netflix of China"" actually licenses Netflix content for its streaming service. The stock cleared a very short IPO-base buy point at 18.30 last week and is now extended, rising 2.1% to 19.74 on Monday.Keep in mind that overnight trading in individual stocks or Dow Jones futures often doesn't translate into how the stock market will trade in the next regular session.Lam Research reports earnings after Tuesday's market close. Analysts expect a 56% earnings gain to $4.36 a share, with revenue soaring 32% to $2.85 billion. Lam has topped EPS targets in each of the past six quarters.Lam shares fell 0.1% to 203.55 in the stock market today, holding above its 50-day line. The stock is working on a new consolidation, but does not yet have a proper buy point.It's a top-rated big-cap tech stock, but why is it so important?Lam Research kicks off earnings for the semiconductor sector, which typically is a leader or contributor in tech rallies. Chips account for a big share of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index. Chips also are in just about every tech product. So if chip stock stocks are faring well, there's a good bet that chip demand is strong, and thus demand for a variety of tech gear is also strong.And yet, chip stocks have been lagging the S&P 500 index since the market peaked just over a month ago. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, or Philly Sox, is finding resistance at its 50-day moving average, like the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq.Not all semiconductors are struggling. Chip giant Intel (INTC) has formed a flat base with a 53.88 buy point.

33,CVS,"Tuesday's premarket trading received several shots in the arm. First was Netflix (NFLX), which surged after reporting strong first-quarter results late Monday. Then a cohort of blue chip names kicked in and posted early advances, following above-expectation quarterly results.The result: futures for the Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 1%. The S&P 500 traded 0.8% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures pressed 1.1% higher.Netflix was the premarket trading powerhouse, up more than 7% and easily the largest gainer among Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 stocks. Merck (MRK) bolstered the Dow in early trade, following an analyst upgrade. But the drugmaker quickly surrendered its lead as investors waded into an early batch of blue-chip earnings reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The positive premarket trading poised the week-old uptrend to hurdle resistance. The uptrend is in good standing, carrying no distribution days. But the 50-day moving average remains the key test for all three major indexes. The Dow failed to hold above its 50-day line on Monday, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have yet to break back above the critical level of support.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePremarket action suggested the Dow and the S&P 500 would open above their 50-day lines. Keep in mind that futures-driven premarket trading does not always translate to action during the regular session.On the Dow, UnitedHealth rolled up an early 2.5% gain on first-quarter results that were stronger than expected. The stock retook its 50-day line of support with a 2.6% gain on Monday, attempting to start up the right side of a four-month consolidation.Also on the Dow, Merck buzzed ahead 2.1%, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight, from equal weight. The drugmaker surged 2.6% in heavy trade Monday, after the company's lung-cancer treatment outperformed competitors in clinical trials. Merck is up 11% from an early April low and, like the overall Dow index, stands poised to test resistance at its 50-day moving average.Further down the list of early Dow advancers, Johnson & Johnson trimmed its early gain to 0.3%. The medical products leader reported first-quarter results in which earnings and revenue topped analysts' targets, and full-year guidance met or beat expectations.Goldman Sachs reversed an early loss, stepping up 0.9% after clobbering first-quarter earnings expectations and raising its quarterly dividend nearly 7%.  The stock has spent three days fighting resistance at its 50-day moving average.IBD Leaderboard stocks churned out some strong early moves, drafting Netflix's early advance. The streaming entertainment leader reported first-quarter sales and earnings only narrowly above consensus targets. But a blowout beat in subscriber growth surprised investors and launched shares higher in premarket trading. Netflix shares remain extended after a rebound from support at their 10-week moving average.Planet Fitness (PLNT) popped 1.6% ahead of the open.  The gym network ended Monday a bit more than 2% below a 40.14 buy point in a second-stage flat base.Leader peer Lululemon Athletica (LULU) pared its early surge back to 0.3% in premarket trading. The company late Monday named Patrick Guido its chief financial officer, effective April 30. The stock has jumped 18% over the past three weeks.China-based stocks were mixed, as after markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai ended lower Tuesday, despite data showing the country's GDP expanded 6.8% during the first quarter. Retail sales surged 35.4%, while investment in education soared 26.9%. China's Commerce Ministry also announced its would impose 179% tariffs on sorghum imported from the U.S. The ministry said an investigation found the grain was unfairly subsidized by the U.S. government.March IPO IQiyi (IQ) jumped 2.3% in premarket trading. Shares of the Netflix-like platform advanced over the past six sessions, rising 9.7% above their March 29 IPO price.Housing starts jumped in March to an annualized rate of 1.32 million, the Commerce Department reported. That was a healthy uptick from February's disappointing 1.295 rate of home starts, startling economists who had projected a rate of 1.264 million new projects.Building permits, which gauge upcoming activity, posted an even larger increase — to an annualized rate of 1.354 million. February's permits clocked a 1.321 million pace. Economists had expected March permits issued at a 1.315 million rate.Industrial production numbers from the Federal Reserve are set for release at 9:15 a.m. ET.A busy slate for Tuesday's after-hours session includes quarterly reports from railroad CSX (CSX), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and United Airlines (UAL).  Lam Research (LRCX) also reports after the close, kicking off the first-quarter reporting season for the chip sector.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Why Strength In This Sector Is Good For The BullsUnitedHealth, Lam Research, IBM Earnings Due: Investing Action PlanAmazon Report Sends CVS, Walgreens, These Drug Distributors Soaring

34,CVS,"The Dow Jones and small-cap stocks led a stock market rally Monday as major stock indexes started off the week on solid ground. X But it wasn't the greatest of closes for the blue-chip index. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average early in the session but ended below the line. The Dow added 0.9%,…
"
35,CVS,"The Phillips curve theory at the heart of the Federal Reserve's approach to raising interest rates as the economic expansion marches ahead is that lower unemployment gives rise to faster wage growth.X Fed policymakers figure that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.Yet those assumptions central to proactive monetary policy — the steady diet of Fed rate hikes even when inflation remains below the Fed's 2% target — have taken some knocks lately.With the jobless rate expected to sink below 4% this year and fall to 3.5% or lower in 2019, one of the biggest questions for financial markets is how much the link between unemployment, wages and inflation will finally assert itself?Soon after tax reform passed in December, dozens of major companies — including Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Bank of America (BAC) and Starbucks (SBUX) — announced wage hikes, a reflection of a tightening labor market. It's a good bet that wage growth is heading higher, but how much pricing power will companies really have?Here are five keys to understanding the outlook for inflation and Fed rate-hike policy:To understand why the link between wages and inflation isn't as clear as it once was, Target (TGT) is a good place to start. In September 2017, the discount retailer announced a big wage hike and broad-based price cuts just three weeks apart.The price cuts on thousands of items came shortly after Amazon.com (AMZN) celebrated the close of its Whole Foods acquisition by cutting the upscale natural foods grocer's prices as much as 43% on select items like avocados and kale.Then, in a bid to limit employee turnover and attract 100,000 seasonal workers in a tight labor market, Target hiked its minimum wage from $10 to $11 an hour and committed to a $15 hourly wage by the end of 2020.Higher wages may not feed through to higher prices in the near term when a few huge companies have significant market power and incentives to put market share over profit. Amazon has been rewarded with a massive valuation because of sales growth and the growing reach of its Prime membership, even when its profits disappointed.Internet-enabled transparency also keeps a lid on prices, and that's not just true of retail. Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson has explained that the hotel group doesn't have as much ability to raise prices as it had in past cycles. While home-sharing via Airbnb has some impact on leisure travelers, he sees the bigger issue as ""radical transparency in pricing.""IBD'S TAKE: Stock market volatility has returned, so it's more important than ever to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. With just a few relatively modest trend reversals, inflation has been moving in only one direction since 1980: lower.After sinking from more than 10% in 1980, core consumer price inflation, which excludes the sometimes-volatile food and energy categories, hasn't touched 3% since 1995. Aggressive Fed rate hikes under Paul Volcker pushed back inflation in the early 1980s, while pre-emptive Fed rate increases in the mid-1990s under Alan Greenspan ushered in the current low-inflation environment.Amid technological advances that empower the consumer and the globalization of manufacturing supply chains, in part to capitalize on lower-wage labor, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index hasn't even touched 2.5% in decades and sat at 1.5% at the end of 2017.Even if tight labor markets and near-3% GDP growth foster a bit more inflation, perspective is in order: Neither investors nor Fed policymakers are likely to get overly concerned.You might guess that the Apple (AAPL) iPhone X, which raised eyebrows with its near-$1,000 starting price when it was released in November 2017, sent the price index for phone equipment surging after its release, and you'd be right — to a point. The Labor Department, which adjusts price changes to account for technological advances, said that phone equipment costs fell 2.6% in January 2018 vs. a year earlier, which was the smallest decline since 2011.The combination of quality improvements, productivity gains in manufacturing and global competition goes a long way to explaining why most inflation is in services. In the year through January, services inflation was running at 2.6%, while goods inflation was just 1.2%. Excluding food and energy, goods inflation was -0.7%.An exception in the goods category is prescription drugs, whose prices always rise, bringing political scrutiny. But prescription-drug prices rose just 2.4% in January vs. a year earlier, roughly half the increase seen in the prior three years. Prescription benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said average per-member prescription costs of the employer plans it serves rose 1.5%, the lowest since 1993. One key: Generic fill rates rose 86% over the prior year. That likely reflects, in part, the FDA's new expedited generics approval approach, so the gains may be sustained.Likewise, health care services prices rose a historically tame 2% in January. In regulated industries like health care, where prices are rarely transparent and government plays an especially large role, the power to raise prices is limited by the regulator.The Fed's favored PCE price index, unlike the CPI, reflects prices that individuals pay, both directly and indirectly, such as for health care that is subsidized by government and employers. Health care accounts for just over 20% of the PCE index vs. about 9% of the CPI's weight. Meanwhile, housing accounts for a similar 20% of the PCE index, but more than 30% of the CPI. With shelter costs rising 3.2% from a year ago in January, that difference goes a long way to explaining why core CPI inflation typically exceeds core PCE inflation.As labor markets tighten and workers have more opportunity to quit and find greener pastures, companies pressured to raise wages have three possibilities for dealing with their higher compensation costs: increase prices, accept lower profits or offset the higher wage bill by increasing worker output or finding other efficiencies.To some extent, the earnings boost from the Trump tax cuts, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21%, could make companies more willing to swallow higher wages without passing those costs on to customers. Incentives in the tax bill allowing for immediate expensing of equipment purchases could increase investment to make workers more productive.A key question will be whether heightened wage pressures and bigger investment incentives can combine to get the U.S. out of the productivity rut it's been in for much of the past decade. If so, that could raise the growth ceiling on the economy without stoking inflation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWhy A Bull Market Rally Is The Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

40,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS), whose pending acquisition of Aetna (AET) will make it one of the biggeset U.S. companies based on sales, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday that topped Wall Street expectations, while guiding lower for 2018 due to its more aggressive spending plans.X The higher investment spending comes as CVS looks to reinvent its stores with a greater emphasis on providing health care services. Minute Clinics, of which there are now more than 1,100, may be equipped to draw blood, CEO Larry Merlo told analysts.Meanwhile, Merlo downplayed the threat from the Jan. 30 announcement that Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) were joining together to try and  lower health care costs and improve transparency.""What that group aspires to is what we're going to deliver"" through the combination of CVS and Aetna, he said, adding that CVS is adopting an ""open-source"" model and is willing to partner with anyone, including Amazon.Estimates: Profit of $1.89 a share, up 10.5% from a year ago, on revenue growth of 3.4% to $47.54 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS of $1.92, up 12%, on revenue of $48.4 billion, growing 5.3% from a year ago.Outlook: CVS updated guidance, noting it will get ""$1.2 billion in cash benefits"" from the tax legislation and dedicate at least $275 million ""to additional investments in employees, data analytics, care management solutions, and service offering enhancements.""CVS also will spend ""at least half of the benefits on debt reduction as we look to lower our leverage ratio.""Due to its investments, CVS lowered its 2018 operating profit guidance from up 1%-4% to down 1.5% to up 1.5%.Stock: CVS opened slightly higher, then reversed lower and closed down 5.1% at 70.58 on the stock market today. The stock had been closing in on a 52-week high and a buy point, but got tripped up by Wall Street's seeming overreaction to the vague Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire news. The broad market pullback also has been a factor.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Analysts aren't quite sure if the new Amazon venture is a prelude to its entry into the retail prescription industry, the threat of which was seen as one of the motivating forces behind the CVS acquisition of Aetna. On its third-quarter earnings call in November, CVS announced that it would begin same-day delivery of prescriptions in certain metro areas this year and next-day delivery across the country, which could be a negative for store traffic and nonprescription sales.CVS said its additional investments paid for by tax cuts would initially focus on wage increases for its retail workers, such as pharmacy technicians, who will be relied upon to provide a greater range of services under the new retail model the company is developing. The combination of CVS and Aetna is a new take on the model pioneered by Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which combines the largest health insurer, prescription benefit management and a growing health-services empire that it's adding to with the pending purchase of the medical unit of DaVita for $4.9 billion, its fourth big deal in 2017.Merlo said that CVS and Aetna have begun integration planning and that the deal is on track to close in the second half of 2018.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

41,CVS,"The favored Fed inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.2% on the month and 1.6% from a year ago in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Core inflation came in a tad hotter than the 1.5% annual rate expected. Including food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% on the month and 1.8% from a year ago vs. expectations of 0.2% and 1.7% increases.After the report, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index futures rose a little more, while the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed around 2.77%.If the inflation data stay tame, and core PCE inflation remains well below the Fed's 2% inflation target, the U.S. central bank probably won't hike its key interest rate four times this year. At last week's Fed meeting, policymakers' projections saw core inflation rising to 1.9% this year as the Fed hikes three times.Policymakers are getting more confident that inflation will start to firm. Their projections point to 2.1% core inflation in 2019, just above their target.The Fed still believes in the Phillips curve, which predicts rising wage growth as unemployment falls. Before too long, wage pressures put upward pressure on consumer prices.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.As those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. Earlier this month, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.The competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Still, inflation is likely to remain near the top of investors' concerns this year. Fed policymakers expect to hike rates another three times in 2019 and two more in 2020, which is far more than financial markets think can or should happen.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchWill Techs Drive Stock Market Into Bear Territory?

That trigger a sharp rebound, with the Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closing up 1.4%-1.5%.Bond and stock markets are suddenly concerned that interest rates will vault higher as the Fed gradually reverses government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis, Treasury issuance balloons to fund the return of trillion-dollar deficits, and the economy shifts into overdrive. It's no help that the deficit outlook will continue to worsen, with $2 trillion annual deficits on their way within a decade.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is now in a correction. Read our weekly cover story on why stocks sold off and what you should do now.On Friday, Moody's said that the ""pre-eminent"" financial and economic position of the U.S. will preserve its triple-A credit. But Moody hinted that its deteriorating fiscal position could jeopardize the U.S. rating amid evidence of ""declining growth potential, coupled with emerging aversion to open trade and foreign labor.""One interesting aspect of JPMorgan's forecast is that even after the bank's economists boosted their forecast of GDP growth by 0.4 percentage point this year to reflect the budget deal, they're still expecting less-than-stellar 2.6% growth this year. In 2019, they see the budget deal lifting growth by 0.3 percentage point above their earlier forecast, but still only to 2.2%.In other words, they suspect that the economy may not have to grow all that fast to generate the kind of wage and inflationary pressures which haven't been seen since before the last recession and which most financial market participants seemed to think were history.It's possible that JPMorgan will be proved wrong by faster productivity growth and labor force growth than it expects. Yet the bank's forecast highlights why Wall Street may no longer be comfortable counting on benign economic outcomes.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the latest budget deal, the balance of economic risks has pretty clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the January employment report suggested that the reported acceleration in wage gains was misleading, it does appear that faster wage growth is on the way.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Did Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Market Outlook Changes AgainAmazon Ready To Move On UPS And FedEx
"
44,CVS,"Just about the last thing the stock market needed as it tries to recover from the Dow Jones industrial average's 4.6% plunge to start the week was a $300 billion deficit-boosting budget deal.X The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off sharply as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped all the way back to 2.88%, within a whisker of last week's four-year high. By the close on the stock market today, the Dow sank 4.15%, the S&P 500 3.75% and the Nasdaq 3.9%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq undercut Tuesday's intraday lows. Yet the renewed weakness in the stock market only dragged the 10-year Treasury yield moderately lower to 2.83%.The S&P 500 and other major averages had already reversed lower Wednesday in part as the increased spending agreement took hold, lifting yields.The trading action makes it look as if the stock market isn't just climbing a wall of worry, it's climbing a wall of debt, and that wall just got steeper. Already, Wall Street had been expecting $1 trillion in Treasury issuance in 2018, nearly double last year's total. Now, the deal to boost spending on defense and domestic programs, while sending more money to hurricane-hit regions, could raise that total by $150 billion or more, with no letup in years to come.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The heavier load of Treasury debt that needs to be issued to fund widening deficits comes as the Federal Reserve has begun gradually reversing government bond purchases it made to aid recovery from the financial crisis. The rise in Treasury yields needed to clear all of the new supply is generally seen as a negative for stocks, because higher interest rates can curb borrowing appetites and make stocks look like less of a bargain.After Friday's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear, fueled by the Trump tax cuts.Now, after the Senate budget deal that got a stamp of approval from House Speaker Paul Ryan, markets have reason to double down on those concerns. Whether or not Fed policymakers come right out and say it when they next meet in March, and New York Fed President William Dudley's comments on Thursday suggest they probably will,  the balance of economic risks has now clearly shifted to the upside, meaning the risk is that growth will come in too hot.While details of the monthly employment report suggested the concern about accelerating wage gains was premature, it does appear that faster wage growth is coming. Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. On Thursday, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies credited the tax cuts for their decision, though the competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation has appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon.com (AMZN) to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.Yet now the risk of investors being caught flat-footed by a rise in inflation is growing as Washington prepares to unleash a second dose of fiscal firepower.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

45,CVS,"The Fed hiked its key interest rate on Wednesday, surprising no one, while signaling no rush to step up its gradual pace of monetary tightening this year. The S&P 500 index and other major averages, after initially extending modest pre-announcement gains, then weakened as Jerome Powell held his first post-meeting news conference as Federal Reserve chairman.The initial market focus was on the Fed's near-term policy trajectory, but the takeaway may not be quite so positive once investors digest the more hawkish long-term outlook which hints at concern that there's greater risk of the economy overheating.As in December, the quarterly economic projections reflecting the individual views of each Federal Reserve policymaker pointed to a likelihood of three quarter-point rate hikes in 2018, not four, as Goldman Sachs and some other Wall Street firms anticipate. But the Fed did step up its rate-hike outlook for 2019.Fed policymakers now expect three quarter-point rate hikes in 2019, up from two in December, as the jobless rate falls to 3.6% in 2019 and core inflation rises to 2.1%, just above the Fed's target.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Fed's patience could give stocks a bit of running room as policymakers await evidence that faster economic growth, fueled by the big Trump tax cut and spending increases that have yet to hit, will boost wage growth and inflation.Powell said that if the Fed hikes too fast, ""inflation doesn't get up to 2%.""The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially extended moderate gains following the 2 p.m. ET policy statement. But after Powell began speaking at 2:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq  led the averages into negative territory in the stock market today. The Dow Jones and S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq lost 0.3%. However, the small-cap Russell 2000 managed to climb 0.6%.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones remain below their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq recently found support at that key level. Bank stocks were among the gainers after the Fed meeting, thanks to signals that policymakers are willing to let the economy run at least a little hotter.The 10-year Treasury yield initially slipped after the announcement, then turned higher to about 2.92%, before backtracking as stocks weakened. The yield is not too far off the key 3% threshold that hasn't been breached in more than four years.If there's one reason why stocks turned lower as Powell spoke, it could be because of his discussion of the significance of the Fed, for the first time, expecting above-target core inflation of 2.1%. The forecast raises the question of whether the Fed may really think of the 2% inflation target as symmetric — meaning that the current undershoot should be balanced out by a future overshoot.Yet Powell, in his press conference, said policymakers will aim to avoid any ""sustained or persistent deviations.""""We're always going to be seeking 2%.""Investors probably shouldn't be too reassured by a largely status-quo announcement on 2018 policy from the Fed. There's good reason to expect policymakers to step up their expectations to four 2018 Fed rate hikes by June — even if inflation remains tame.Once a pickup in wage growth materializes — and it's very likely to this spring after wage hikes by Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), FedEx (FDX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and others — Fed members will likely adjust rate-hike expectations upward.The Fed's most influential dove, Lael Brainard, in 2017 explained earlier this month why low inflation won't prevent a more hawkish policy turn: Policymakers need to stay ""vigilant"" to contain any financial-system excesses.Unemployment appears on course to fall to rarely seen levels that tend to come with ""elevated risks of imbalances, whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent decades,"" Fed Governor Brainard said, alluding to the dot-com and housing bubbles.Brainard echoed new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's congressional testimony last month that economic headwinds have turned to tailwinds. Powell said there was still no evidence in the data that stronger growth has led to an acceleration in wage gains, which Fed theory sees as a precursor of upward price inflation.Brainard noted, ""While asset valuations appear to be elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household borrowing is moderate"" and the banking system is ""well-capitalized"" after financial reforms. Still, she said, ""We will need to be vigilant"" because a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards.Vigilance is code for being proactive, raising rates if the economy runs hot, even before any acceleration of inflation. Yet there's a risk that the Fed will overreact to faster growth this year and into 2019, which is fueled by a one-time fiscal boost from tax cuts and a big increase in federal spending. That's the recipe for a big economic slowdown late next year or in the first half of 2020.Bank of America, Wells Fargo and other bank stocks, which can benefit from higher short-term rates, especially when long-term interest rates rise even more, were only slightly higher before the Fed meeting statement on Wednesday, though JPMorgan Chase saw healthier gains. Bank of America and JPMorgan rose a little more after the announcement.Even though the 10-year yield was slightly lower, the 2-year yield fell a little more. A wider yield spread is good for bank profits.E-brokers are among financial stocks that benefit from a higher Fed interest rate, in part because  floating-rate margin loans for trading accounts are based on short-term rates that move in tandem with Fed policy. TD Ameritrade (AMTD) CFO Stephen Boyle said on the Jan. 23 earnings call that the next 25-basis-point increase to the Fed's target rate could yield an estimated $60 million to $110 million in pretax income. Shares of Ameritrade were up slightly ahead of the Fed announcement and rose a little more later.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Inflation And The Fed Rate-Hike Outlook: What You Need To KnowTrump's China Trade War Could Start To Get Real ThursdayForget Facebook: Why These 5 Chip Stocks Are Stock Market Bullish'China's Amazon' JD.com Has These Futuristic Projects In The Works

Adobe Systems (ADBE) jumped to the head of the Nasdaq 100, while Facebook posted the index's worst loss. Oracle (ORCL) dived more than 9% after its fiscal third-quarter report, the worst early loss among S&P 500 stocks.Monday's session showed the S&P 500 breaking below its 50-day line and the Dow backing away from its attempt to regain support. The Nasdaq — with Facebook as a driving force — will act as the more crucial gauge for the stock market today. Facebook's deep dive Monday helped drag the Nasdaq to a test of its 50-day level and to close only narrowly above the line.

The company claimed political data company Cambridge Analytica had agreed to an audit to confirm that data from 50 million Facebook users accounts had been erased, according to news reports early Tuesday, which also said Cambridge executives had been filmed suggesting bribing politicians.Tuesday's loss sent Facebook below its 40-week moving average in very heavy trade.Oracle crumbled more than 9% after reporting late Monday its fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 20% to top analyst targets, while a 6% revenue gain just met views.

47,CVS,"Donald Trump's presidency has been pretty great for stock investors, but it carries three big risks that all are in focus this week: The Fed, a trade war and the investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election.XThe Trump wall of worry helped get stocks off to a poor start on Monday, as Facebook (FB) led markets lower over how the social network permitted a third party to access user data that helped the Trump campaign. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index fell 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively, on the stock market today. The Nasdaq slid 1.8%, but off intraday lows of more than 2%.All the fiscal stimulation from tax cuts and a big spending increase raises the risk of a more hawkish Fed. Federal Reserve policymakers are virtually certain to announce a 25-basis-point hike in the key overnight lending rate to banks on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET. The risk this week is that they'll pencil in a tighter path for future policy than markets currently expect.Meanwhile, President Trump's 15-day grace period for trading partners to negotiate their way out of tariffs comes to an end on Friday, when levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports go into effect.The White House said last week that it's negotiating with a number of countries, but provided no detail. The European Union said last week that it's not negotiating, but making a case that the tariffs are a poor way to treat a security partner, even as it detailed a list of $3.4 billion worth of American products that could face retaliatory tariffs, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, Jack Daniels whiskey and Florida orange juice.The third risk hanging over stocks as the week starts comes from the broadening Russia probe, which has now expanded to cover Trump Organization business deals before the election. Trump amped up his Twitter attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe over the weekend, calling it a witch hunt, while his attorney John Dowd called for an end to the investigation that he said was ""manufactured"" by ex-FBI Director James Comey based on ""a fraudulent and corrupt dossier.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNone of these three risk hanging over stocks will come to a head this week, but all three risks are growing and are likely to occupy investors for months to come.The Mueller investigation ""appears to be on the verge of a major inflection point,"" wrote Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments. Mueller reportedly has submitted some of the questions he would like Trump to answer under oath. There's speculation that more indictments could be coming soon and major uncertainty over how Congress would react if Trump engineers Mueller's firing as GOP lawmakers have shown a tepid response to proposed legislation that would protect Mueller.At the Fed, inflation concerns haven't gone away, even with some favorable recent data. Despite expectations of faster economic growth this year, the tame consumer price index reading for February makes it an even bet whether Fed policymakers will pencil in a fourth rate hike in 2018, up from three, in their economic projections that are released at the same time as the policy statement.Yet as wage growth accelerates in coming months — and there's every reason to expect it will after wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX), Bank of America (BAC) and dozens of other big employers — a more hawkish Fed is likely.On trade, Trump's indefinite exemptions for Canada and Mexico from tariffs have contained the potential fallout from his duties on steel and aluminum, and the White House may be open to other approaches to reducing global steel overcapacity that comes mainly from China, even though China accounts for just 2% of U.S. steel imports.Still, the risk of a trade war is rising. If steel and aluminum tariffs don't spark one, it may come from a U.S. crackdown on China's intellectual property practices. On Monday, Reuters reported that Walmart, Target, Best Buy (BBY) and other retailers sent a letter to Trump asking him to reconsider an emerging plan to hit Beijing with $60 billion in tariffs on American imports of apparel, electronics and other goods.

52,CVS,"Despite the sell-off in health stocks Tuesday, a joint venture by Amazon.com (AMZN), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to wring out cost savings from the health care system appears very unlikely to impact industry earnings over the next couple of years, according to analysts.X Figuring out how to rein in health costs without the participation of big health care players looks like a near-impossible task, Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo said. ""We note that the cost to implement systems, adjudicate patient data, and partner with hospitals, doctors, pharmacies on a national basis is onerous.""Caliendo adds that the scale of the big three new partners wouldn't be big enough to squeeze discounts out of providers by steering patients their way, compared to the purchasing power of UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM). ""The new company will have to align itself with all these other providers in some way to provide the best care for its employees,"" Caliendo concludes.In fact, Caliendo gave CVS a big vote of confidence earlier Tuesday, saying its planned combination with Aetna positions it to create savings for the government and private employers. Needham raised its rating on CVS to strong buy with a 100 target.Caliendo does think that ""profits in the industry, especially at the underwriting level, are excessive,"" and there are improvements to the current care delivery model that can be made. He sees that as a prime reason behind the CVS-Aetna deal.CVS is looking to shift more health care services to the lowest-cost location: its in-store clinics. That's a different take on UnitedHealth's playbook of expanding into urgent care and other outpatient locales to drive savings for customers.But no such path forward was evident in the announcement from Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire. The plan to establish an independent company ""is in its early planning stages,"" according to a statement by the trio.""Our group does not come to this problem with answers,"" acknowledged Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett.""Success is going to require talented experts, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation,"" said Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Yet it's unclear at this point who any of those talented experts will be.As Wall Street weighed the long-term nature of the effort and the dearth of substantive details, the initial shock wave that rippled across Wall Street subsided. Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer, sank 4.35% to 236.65 on the stock market today, after diving as much as 6.2% earlier. CVS Health, which is in the process of buying Aetna, pared losses to a 4.1% drop.Drug distributors Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) were down 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Prescription benefit management firm Express Scripts (ESRX) sank 3.2%, but had tumbled 11.4% earlier. Both CVS and UnitedHealth also operate PBMs, which manage the prescription side of health insurance contracts.Pharmaceuticals and biotech stocks also lost ground, though the hit didn't look much worse than the broader market downdraft on Tuesday. Merck (MRK) shed 1.6%, Allergan (AGN) 1.6% and Gilead Sciences (GILD) 1.7% Pfizer (PFE) lost 3.1% despite topping earnings views and offering bullish guidance.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is ranked No. 2 by IBD in the Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leaders in each category. Insurers have been solid performers, ranked No. 43 out of 197 groups. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks in leading groups that break above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.The knee-jerk reaction among investors is surely a reflection of the unsustainably high cost of health care in the U.S., and the fact that Amazon, which has been itching to disrupt the retail prescription business, is attached to the effort.Traditionally, the fear among health care investors has been that government — not the private sector — will impose cost controls to get a handle on runaway budget deficits, thinning out industry profits in the process. Medicare negotiating drug costs is one such fear, but industry experts say that the government is unlikely to produce much in the way of savings unless it is willing to deny patients access to certain drugs, which could create a political backlash.But Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire aren't the first big employers to join forces to attack health costs. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte noted on Tuesday that the Health Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 large self-insured employers that launched last year, also hopes to find savings and improve employee satisfaction, though it's working with CVS and UnitedHealth to achieve its aims. Initial reports indicated that alliance members expected to save a combined $600 million in prescription costs over three years.Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire say their initial focus will be on ""technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost."" The new corporate entity, they say, will be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""Just what form those technology solutions would take is far from clear. Caliendo supposes that ""Berkshire might bring some underwriting skills (although they've never underwritten healthcare) and AMZN might make pharmacy and medical procurement contributions and provide IT expertise.""Leerkink's Gupte says she's unclear whether Amazon wading deeper into solving the health care mess will accelerate its move into the supply chain of the prescription industry.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Trump's State Of The Union Might Move Markets Up — Or DownStocks Fall As Market Shows 3 Signs It May Be Ready For A BreakGrubhub, Redhat Lead These Three IBD 50 Stocks In Buy RangeHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

Cigna said it expects the deal, which includes $15 billion in debt, to close by the end of the year. A year ago, the courts blocked a proposed $48 billion merger between Cigna and fellow health insurer Anthem (ANTM).Still, the move continues a recent round of massive reorganization in the sector, which included CVS Health's (CVS) $68 billion purchase of Aetna (AET), the launch of Apple (AAPL) health clinics for its employees and a joint venture between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM) to more efficiently provide healthcare services to their 1 million employees.Cigna shares dropped 7% in opening trade.In earnings news, Burlington Stores buttoned up an early 9% gain.

Micron Technology (MU), which already topped a double-bottom buy point, cleared an alternate entry and soared to a 17-year high amid continued strong memory-chip demand and pricing. .Target (TGT), which plans to hike its minimum wage to $12 an hour, missed profit views and fell short of consensus for EPS guidance.

57,CVS,"Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), seeking to curb opioid abuse, will offer its pharmacy customers a product that disposes of unwanted or expired prescription drugs.X Customers filling a new Class II opioid prescription at any of Wal-Mart's 4,700 U.S. pharmacies will now receive a packet of DisposeRx, a powder that — when mixed into a pill bottle with warm water — creates a safe, biodegradable gel, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Those with refillable opioid prescriptions will get a free sachet every six months, and customers can request a free packet at any time.The move comes as the U.S. grapples with the scourge of opioid addiction, an affliction that often begins when chronic-pain sufferers fill a prescription at a retail pharmacy chain like Wal-Mart, CVS Health (CVS) or Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). More than two out of three people misusing prescription opioids get them from family and friends, according to federal data. Opioid overdose deaths rose 28% in 2016, to 42,000 men, women and children.Wal-Mart touted the DisposeRx offering as the ""first of its kind"" because it allows patients to dispose of unwanted or expired pills at home. CVS and Walgreens currently offer medication-disposal kiosks at hundreds of locations, a service that Wal-Mart doesn't provide. Wal-Mart does sells a drug-deactivation product called Deterra, which is made by Verde Technologies.""The best part is that patients don't have to take the drugs back to a location,"" Marybeth Hays, Wal-Mart's head of consumables and health and wellness in the U.S., said in an interview. ""It can all happen at home.""The DisposeRx product has been in use for about six months in hospitals and other locations, according to John Holaday, the company's co-founder and chief executive officer.

The consensus called for a 0.3% monthly and 2.0% annual rise in the broad CPI.After the report, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite reversed from solid gains to down more than 1% at one point. The major averages fell modestly at the open but the Nasdaq led an upside reversal.Menawhile, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.88%, back at four-year highs.

JPMorgan economists are now expecting the jobless rate to fall to 3.2% by the end of 2019, and they think the Fed could raise rates eight times by then.After January's jobs report showed that average hourly wage growth accelerated to 2.9% in January from a year ago, after being stuck around 2.5% for most of 2017, markets suddenly started to price in a risk that dormant wage and price inflation may shift into higher gear.Wage growth is seen a prelude to higher inflation, and there is reason to expect better wage gains, even if the wage acceleration that showed up in January's employment report was a misleading product of a shorter workweek.Walmart (WMT) announced in January that it was hiking base pay to $11 an hour, three years after it last announced a boost in starting pay to $9 an hour. Last week, CVS Health (CVS) said it also will adopt an $11 minimum wage in April. Both companies tied their wage hikes at least loosely to their tax cuts, but that's only part of the story. Competition for quality workers led Target (TGT) to boost its wage to $11 starting last October, when tax reform was still up in the air. At the time, Target made a commitment to raise its base wage to $15 an hour by the end of 2020. Starbucks (SBUX), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) also are among the dozens of big employers who have hiked wages in the wake of tax cuts.Even with tax cuts, the risk that wage growth will feed through to higher inflation had appeared modest enough for investors to mostly discount, as consumers have grown to expect internet price transparency and the ever-expanding reach of Amazon to keep inflation in check.Those competitive dynamics and the need to boost productivity help explain why Walmart, even as it hiked its minimum wage in January, also shut dozens of Sam's Clubs employing about 10,000 workers, cut 3,500 store co-manager positions and thinned the ranks at its headquarters.If companies don't have the luxury of raising prices to offset higher wages, pay hikes stand to cut into profits, which is among the reasons that CVS shares traded lower after announcing wage increases.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowThis Shock Economic Outlook May Keep Stock Market On EdgeHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

63,CVS,"The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite managed decent gains by the close Tuesday in a session short on volatility as indexes kept to a relatively tight intraday range.X FANG names were generally sluggish, but Amazon.com (AMZN) outperformed again, rising 2%. It's performed well after paying a visit to the 50-day moving average Friday. Facebook (FB) lost more than 1.8% after finding support at the 200-day moving average Friday.The Nasdaq notched its third straight gain, rising nearly 0.5%. It's getting closer to the 50-day moving average near 7,081, a potential resistance level to watch. The S&P 500 added 0.3% and the Dow gained 0.2%. Preliminary data showed volume on both exchanges coming in lower than Monday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, March U.S. crude oil futures eased 0.2% to $59.19 a barrel after the International Energy Agency raised its global demand growth outlook. The 10-year Treasury yield, meanwhile, eased 3 basis points to 2.82%.In the stock market today, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) jumped 9.3% after a report in the Wall Street Journal said Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) is interested in buying the drug distributor. The news comes on the heels of the proposed merger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) announced late last year.Inside the IBD 50, Weibo (WB) was the star of the day, soaring 9.7% on strong earnings. It was a muscular move, but Weibo recently flashed a sell signal from a handle entry at 122.31 as well as an alternate entry at 123.10. Note that its latest breakout was from a later-stage base. The company operates a social-media platform in China.Sina (SINA), which spun off Weibo in 2014 but remains a majority shareholder, jumped 6%, also on solid earnings.Elsewhere, after a failed breakout over a 52.97 cup-with-handle buy point, IBD 50 name HealthEquity (HQY) is still in buy range from a new handle entry at 52.53. Note that HealthEquity still has its recent high to contend with at 55.31.RingCentral (RNG) turned out to be a good earnings option play as shares jumped 7%. Late Monday, the enterprise software name reported another quarter of triple-digit earnings growth, along with a 34% increase in sales to $140.5 million.When shares were trading around 53.25 on Monday, a monthly call option with a 55 strike price (Feb. 16 expiration) came with a premium of around 1.40, presenting a trade with downside risk of 2.6% (1.40/53.25). One contract gave the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of RingCentral at 55 for a cost of around $140. If the company's earnings had disappointed, the most that could've been lost on a one-contract trade was $140, the amount paid for the contract.RELATED:Weibo Earnings, Revenue Top; Parent Sina Reports Strong Top-Line GrowthMarket-Leading Cisco, Hotel Earnings On Tap, But Inflation Data Key: Investing Action Plan Twitter Short Sellers Keep Increasing Stakes Even As Stock Rises

64,CVS,"While Bank Of America (BAC), Cigna (CI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) all once again earned a spot on the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, the most noteworthy name may be the one that didn't return: Apple (AAPL).X Apple had made the list for two consecutive months as the stock continued its climb from a bottom it reached in May 2016. In January's report, 65 top funds invested a total of nearly $1.8 billion in the tech giant.But with analysts seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales, institutional investors may fear the explosive growth of the past may be coming back down to earth as the company settles in to its new headquarters nicknamed Apple Spaceship in Cupertino, Calif.For the December quarter, Apple beat estimates for sales and earnings, but came up short on iPhone sales and guided lower for the current quarter. Apple's stock has now fallen sharply below its 10-week line in heavy volume, a sign of institutional selling. Apple is currently testing support at its 40-week line.Four stocks on the list received over an estimated $1 billion each in investments from the top funds over the past three months: Bank of America, medical sector stocks UnitedHealth (UNH) and Abbott (ABT), and semiconductor pioneer Texas Instruments.BofA is up more than 20% from a breakout in September, and has shown resilience – and support at its 50-day line – in the face of increased volatility and selling pressure in the general market.Abbott has given back much of the 13% gain in made from the buy point it cleared in December. The maker of generic pharmaceuticals and diagnostic systems is now trading 2% above the entry.UnitedHealth broke out earlier this month, but has pulled back and is now 3% below the 231.87 buy point.Texas Instruments has also been retreating, although it remains about 19% above the 84.34 entry it cleared in September.With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 showing  increased selling pressure and volatility, many stocks on the list, such as Orbotech (ORBK) and DMC Global (BOOM), have seen their recent breakouts fail.Others, such as the New York Times (NYT), have managed to keep climbing. The ""Paper of Record"" broke out of a double bottom on Jan. 12 and is now more than 20% above the buy point after jumping over 11% on today's earnings beat.After pulling back in recent days, defense stock Hexcel (HXL) is testing support at the 64.03 entry it cleared on Jan. 8.Louisiana Pacific (LPX), which provides engineered wood products for home construction, has splintered recently and is now back below the 29.54 buy point it first cleared on Jan. 24.Modine (MOD) has been holding up better than many other names on the list, although it's had its share of wild price swings. It's currently still trading just within the 23.25-24.41 buy zone.Modine, which makes thermal management systems for the building, industrial and refrigeration markets, initially sank on its recent earnings report, but bounced back into buy range in heavy volume last week.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of stocks being sold, with 59 net sellers (127 funds selling minus 68 buying). Despite that, just like its banking rival BofA, JPMorgan has continued to climb higher.No. 2 on the sell side was Aetna (AET), which had 58 net sellers (96 funds selling minus 38 buying).

65,CVS,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views.

AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion.

Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share.

Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

74,CVS,"Health Reform: The CVS Health bid to buy Aetna will ""reshape"" health care, or so headlines would have us believe. Actually, it's a sign that the health care landscape is already being reshaped — by consumers, instead of central planners.Every merger comes with promises that the merger will produce ""synergies"" and that consumers will ultimately benefit, and CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) are no exception.""We know we can make health care more affordable and less expensive,"" is the way CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo put it.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveWhether the merger lives up to those promises is something the market should determine. But, unfortunately, there's one thing standing in the way: a handful of antitrust regulators who can block the merger if they think it will prove anti-consumer.Despite its pro-business, deregulatory inclinations, the Trump administration has been far from hands off when it comes to antitrust enforcement. The Justice Department is suing to block AT&Ts acquisition of Time Warner, despite the fact that this is a vertical merger that normally gets blessed by antitrust enforcers.Unlike the previous horizontal merger attempts between Aetna and Humana and Anthem and Cigna — which were largely a response to ObamaCare and which would have consolidated the insurance industry — the CVS and Aetna deal would be vertical in nature.The combined company would have a stronger hand when negotiating discounts with drugmakers, and against the threat of new competitors like Amazon  (AMZN), which clearly has an interest in getting into the health care delivery business.What's most interesting about this merger, however, is that it's a sign of the increasing clout of consumers in the health care marketplace.This consumer empowerment has been the untold story of a successful health reform, most likely because it was based on free market principles and pushed by Republicans against fierce Democratic opposition.X The GOP's Health Savings Account reform let people set up tax-exempt accounts that are tied to high-deductible health plans.The HSA reform was meant to accomplish two things: reduce the imbalance in the tax code that favored employer-provided health benefits over out-of-pocket spending, and reduce health costs by giving consumers more skin in the game.It's worked better than even advocates could have hoped. Just 12 years after HSAs were introduced, these plans now command almost 30% of the employer market. Overall, more than 20 million people are enrolled — twice as many as were enrolled in 2010, according to the insurance industry trade group American Health Insurance Plans.These accounts now have some $37 billion in assets, according to HSA investment advisor and consultant, Devenir, which expects assets to top $50 billion by the end of next year.Unleashing an army of cost-conscious consumers is what's been driving the industry to offer more low-cost alternatives. One study found that employer costs are 7% to 22% lower with HSAs than they would have been with traditional insurance.This is how health care should work, and would work more effectively if the government would get out of the way. Consumers would be free to shop around for the best deals in health care, and keep any savings they realize. Doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, pharmacies would compete to provide the best quality at the lowest cost. Innovators like Amazon would find ways to disrupt the market.And rather than stand pat, companies like CVS would refashion their business to meet the needs of today's consumers.The government should be encouraging this trend by among other things repealing ObamaCare's central planning, opening the insurance market to cross-state sales, expanding HSAs and the like.At the very least, the federal government shouldn't squelch market-driven innovations with misguided antitrust actions.RELATED:ObamaCare's Perverse Economics: Massive Rate Hikes = Lower Premiums For Millions Here's A Health Reform That, Unlike ObamaCare, Is Actually Working CVS-Aetna Deal Approval May Hinge On Trump Antitrust Approach Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

75,CVS,"The $67.5 billion CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) will test the Trump administration's approach to far-reaching corporate takeovers, just weeks after the U.S. government sued to block a major telecommunications merger.X The health-care deal unveiled Sunday would create an industry giant with over $240 billion in annual sales with a hand in insurance, prescription drug plan administration, retail pharmacies and corner clinics. The companies said the combination will save $750 million in costs and bring consumers better, more efficient health care.In the past, deals combining companies up and down a chain of business — such as a supplier and a distributor — have been viewed as posing less anticompetitive risk than combinations of direct rivals. Last month, however, the Justice Department sued to block just such a ""vertical"" merger between AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), saying it would harm consumers and limit their media content options.""We are obviously going to get some scrutiny,"" said Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini. ""We are prepared to deal with whatever comes along to make this work.""Aetna shares were trading at $184.84 at 6:33 a.m. in New York, well below CVS's $207-a-share offer for the company — a sign investors are skeptical the deal will close at the current price.How much scrutiny the deal gets from the government may depend on which federal agency reviews the takeover — the Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission.Both scenarios present obstacles.The FTC has typically handled mergers of retail businesses like CVS. While it allowed Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to buy more than 1,900 Rite Aid (RAD) stores earlier this year, the deal had to be significantly scaled down to gain the regulator's approval. The Justice Department, meanwhile, successfully sued to block insurance mergers between Anthem (ANTM) and Cigna (CI), and Aetna and Humana (HUM).In the past, vertical deals have typically won approval after companies agree to restrictions on how they operate.That may be changing. The Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has criticized past settlements that allowed vertical deals with behavioral restrictions. In a speech last month, Delrahim said such conditions don't work and force antitrust enforcers to become regulators.That view was behind Delrahim's decision on Nov. 20 to sue to block AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner, a vertical deal that would bring together Time Warner content like HBO with AT&T's pay-TV and wireless distribution.""Most vertical deals don't raise antitrust concerns, and the ones that do generally get approval to close with an agreement containing behavioral conditions,"" said Jennifer Rie, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who follows antitrust issues, in an email. ""But the Justice Department appears to be rejecting this kind of remedy given its approach to the AT&T-Time Warner deal.""That doesn't mean there's heightened hostility toward vertical deals at the Justice Department, but CVS might prefer the Aetna deal to go to the FTC given Delrahim's criticism of behavioral fixes, said David Kully, an antitrust lawyer at Holland & Knight in Washington and a former Justice Department attorney.""Delrahim was very clear in his concerns about behavioral decrees and then put his money where his mouth is when he brought the AT&T case,"" Kully said.One point in favor of the CVS-Aetna deal is that there's already another large insurer with many of the characteristics of a combined health companies. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) offers health insurance, administers drug benefits and runs a growing network of doctors and clinics.But the CVS-Aetna combination takes integration to a new level with its 9,700 retail drugstores. It would also allow CVS to expand its 1,100 walk-in clinics, saving Aetna's insurance customers money by steering patients away from expensive hospital emergency rooms.A condition to an approval could be measures preventing Aetna from steering patients to CVS pharmacies over competitors such as Walgreens, said Rie, who noted that CVS may be better off if the FTC takes the review.One of the few areas where the companies directly overlap is in the Medicare drug business. CVS is already the largest provider of Medicare drug plans, and Aetna is the fifth largest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug-benefits business in a CVS merger. He anticipates a deal would likely go through in the end no matter who reviewed it.The deal ""would definitely be scrutinized, but ultimately we still see a path for it to get through,"" Newshel said in an email. Evercore worked on the deal and Newshel said he's suspending his analyst coverage of Aetna.RELATED:CVS Will Buy Aetna, Reshaping Health Care As Amazon Looms

76,CVS,"Consumer prices rose 0.4% in November and 2.2% from a year ago, as expected, lifted by a rise in energy prices, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday.X The core consumer price index, excluding food and energy, rose 0.1%, while the annual rate of inflation ticked down to 1.7%.Wall Street expected the core CPI to rise 0.2% on the month and a steady 1.8% from a year ago.After the report, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average futures moved a bit higher on the stock market today, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell.The Federal Reserve is a lock to announce a quarter-point hike to its key overnight lending rate at 2 p.m. ET, sticking with its original plan of three hikes in 2017. Inflation will have to pick up from here for the Fed to continue hiking at its current pace, much less raise rates an accelerated pace in 2018, as some are expecting. The CPI data cast some doubt on that outlook and may encourage the Fed to be patient.Prices for food consumed at home, which fell in August as Amazon.com (AMZN) closed its Whole Foods acquisition by slashing some prices and were flat in September and October, slipped 0.1% amid a new round of price cuts in November.Prices of medical commodities, such as prescription drugs, rose 0.6% on the month and were up 1.8% from a year ago, a historically tame rise that has helped curtail overall inflation. CVS Health (CVS) said in a November earnings call that pharmacy same-store sales fell 3.4% in the third quarter, dragged down by generic drug introductions. The profit squeeze on both its retail business and prescription benefit management unit, along with the looming threat of competition from Amazon, is behind CVS' acquisition of Aetna (AET).Apparel prices fell 1.3% in November, the biggest monthly drop since 1998. The 1.6% annual drop was the most in two years.As the Fed meets, the key question is whether policymakers expect the injection of tax stimulus to make the economy run hot enough next year that an additional rate hike will be needed.Policymakers' quarterly projections in September signaled three rate hikes in 2018, when tax-cut prospects looked dubious. But Goldman Sachs and some other Wall Street firms are now predicting four quarter-point rate hikes next year, now that tax cuts are on the verge of passage, and we'll find out on Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET if a majority of Fed committee members share that view. Five of 16 policymakers projected four rate hikes next year, so another handful would have to make a hawkish shift to move the needle.Because the GOP has few votes to spare and complications could still arise, Fed policymakers may hold off factoring in the impact of tax cuts.At least in the short term, a signal from the Fed that four hikes are on the way is likely to be negative news for markets, particularly for banks. Net interest margins of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the rest of the banking sector are pinched when the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates narrows, and that's what happens when markets worry that the Fed is being too aggressive in raising rates.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Shares of Bank of America and JPMorgan rose more than 1% on Tuesday amid signs of optimism from the GOP that its tax bill would come to a vote next week.Hawkish Fed signals could further flatten the yield curve at a time when the gap between the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yield is already close to its narrowest point since shortly before the 2007 recession began.Yet while UBS sees the Fed hiking four times in 2018, the firm doesn't think that outcome is any reason for alarm. To the contrary, it has a bullish view for both the stock market and the economy. The key is that UBS expects the Fed to be done hiking rates at the end of 2018, when the Fed's overnight lending rate would be 2.375%. By comparison, Fed policymakers projected that rates would ultimately rise to 2.7% in September and 2.9% back in June.The thinking is that an acceleration in economic growth courtesy of tax cuts and a favorable global economic backdrop could speed up the Fed's timetable but only a modest pickup in inflation will allow policymakers to stand pat after that.RELATED:Trump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeThese 3 Dow Stocks Have Entered Buy ZonesHome Depot Follows BofA, Mastercard In Announcing Share BuybacksIBD's Investing Action Plan For The Next Trading DayStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

77,CVS,"Express Scripts (ESRX) on Thursday offered profit guidance that outstripped Wall Street estimates, as Amazon (AMZN) and CVS Health (CVS)-Aetna (AET) threaten to shake up the drug sector.X The pharmacy benefits manager expects adjusted earnings of $7.67-$7.87 per share for 2018, above consensus estimate of $7.66 among analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.That would represent 9% to 12% growth from the midpoint of Express Scripts' new guidance for 2017 of $7.00-$7.08, which was revised up from its previous estimated range of $6.97-$7.05 and above the Zacks consensus of $7.01.Next year's earnings growth should benefit from the pending eviCore acquisition. The eviCore purchase will generate EBITDA of $265 million to $285 million in 2018, Express Scripts said. That purchase, as well as a pending sale of United BioSource, are expected to be complete by December, the company added.Shares of Express Scripts rose 0.7% to 69.02 on the stock market today after hitting 71.25 intraday. their highest level since March. Among other drug-related stocks, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fell 1.9%, CVS Health gave up 1.1% and Aetna dipped 0.35%, while Amazon rose 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: The medtech space has been less affected in 2017 by drug-pricing worries than the pharma and biotech spaces. Can the space climb higher still this year? This Industry Snapshot takes a closer look at the group and strong stocks within it.Pharma stocks got whacked in October on reports that Amazon could wade into online prescription drug sales. In another blow to Express Scripts that month, health insurer Anthem (ATHM) said it will tie up with CVS on pharmacy benefit management in 2020, after its current contract with Express Scripts ends.Express Scripts stock has since recovered amid speculation that Amazon may be hunting for a pharmacy benefits manager to gain a foothold in the $300 billion business.On Nov. 30, Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said he would be open to a deal at the right price, though he wasn't actively looking for one, telling Bloomberg that, ""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have.""He added that a partnership with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement is also possible.But CVS, which is a major pharmacy benefits manager in its own right, said earlier this month that it will buy health insurer Aetna for $69 billion, with the deal coming as it braces for Amazon to enter the retail prescription business.Some analysts also say the deal would give the combined company an edge over rivals, with stronger negotiating leverage vs. drug manufacturers.RELATED:Amazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

80,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) will buy Aetna (AET) for about $67.5 billion, creating a health-care giant that will have a hand in everything from insurance to the corner drugstore.X CVS will pay $207 a share for Aetna, with $145 a share in cash and the rest in stock, the companies said in a statement Sunday. That's a 29% premium to Aetna's share price on Oct. 25, the day before the companies were reported to be in talks.The deal is among the biggest health-care mergers of the past decade, combining the largest U.S. drugstore chain with the third-biggest health insurer. CVS also manages drug-benefits plans for employers and insurers, a business that could help steer some of Aetna's 22 million customers into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription. The deal will give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.Including CVS's assumption of Aetna's debt, the deal will be valued at $78 billion. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said.In a joint interview, CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo and Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said combining the companies would help CVS expand a variety of retail medical services, from vision care to nutrition advice to audiology, making basic care more convenient and less costly for consumers. Aetna will be operated as a separate business unit, and any new services will be designed to appeal broadly to customers of other insurance companies as well, the executives said.The immediate financial benefits of the deal are projected to be relatively modest. The companies said they expect $750 million in synergies, and profit improvements in the low-to-mid single digits the second full year after the merger is completed. The companies are betting on longer-term profit from reshaping how their customers get care, by creating what the executives are calling ""10,000 new front doors for the health-care system'' at CVS's stores and clinics.""Think of these stores as a hub of a new way of accessing health-care services across America,'' Merlo said in the joint interview. ""We're bringing health care to where people live and work.''s into CVS drugstores when they fill a prescription through CVS's drug plans. It will also give Aetna's insurance plans a closer on-the-ground tie to where customers get care.The deal will be financed with a mix of cash and debt. Barclays, Goldman Sachs. and Bank of America have committed to provide $49 billion of financing, the person said. It's expected to close in the second half of 2018 and create cost savings of about $750 million, said the person.After the deal closes, Aetna will operate as a separate unit run by members of the current management. Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini will join the CVS board, along with two other Aetna directors.It comes as the health sector is looking over the horizon at Amazon.com (AMZN), and how the company could shake up the business of buying, distributing and selling drugs and medical products if it gets into health care. The retail industry has been battered by the online giant. Amazon hasn't revealed its plans.""One of the problems with the health-care system is it's so fragmented and there's so little coordination,"" said Steve Kraus, who invests in health firms at Bessemer Venture Partners. ""A better vertically integrated less-siloed system is a good thing in my mind.""It could also set off a new round of takeovers as CVS and Aetna's competitors look at the reshaped landscape. On Nov. 30, the CEO of Express Scripts (ESRX) said the pure-play pharmacy benefits manager would be open to a deal at the right price, though wasn't actively looking for one.""We don't need to sell to be very successful in the future, but we are always open to others who may all of sudden conclude they want what we have,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said in an interview. He also mentioned the possibility of partnering with Amazon on a drug distribution arrangement.Express Scripts is just one company in a universe of independent drug plans, insurers and supply-chain middlemen. WellCare Health Plans (WCG), Humana (HUM) and Centene (CNC) could become merger targets after the CVS-Aetna deal, according to Matthew Borsch, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Drug distributors like Cardinal Health (CAH) or McKesson (MCK), and retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) could also face pressure to find partners.CVS, which operates about 9,700 retail stores and 1,100 walk-in medical clinics, has been moving beyond it drugstore roots for years. In 2007, it bought pharmacy-benefits manager Caremark Rx — a business that made up almost half of the Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company's operating profit in the third quarter. In 2014, CVS stopped selling cigarettes and added ""Health"" to its name.""Aetna has emphasized its desire to move care closer to the consumer,"" Brian Tanquilut, an analyst at Jefferies, said on Oct. 26. ""CVS's capabilities, including Minute Clinic and the Coram home infusion business, could enable the health plan to improve health outcomes and reduce cost trend.""Consolidation is picking up among health-care suppliers and administrators, as insurers seek more control over how their consumers get care. But two proposed megamergers among insurers — including a deal between Aetna and Humana — were blocked this year on antitrust grounds, leading the companies to look beyond rival insurers to different types of health-care companies for potential deals.The CVS-Aetna deal antitrust prospects may depend on which U.S. regulator is tasked with reviewing it, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Rie. The Federal Trade Commission has been less critical of consolidation among companies in adjacent businesses, known as vertical consolidation. The Justice Department, on the other hand, last month sued to block the merger of AT&T (T) and Time Warner (TWX), a vertical deal.Michael Newshel, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said the DOJ effort to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal does raises concerns but a CVS-Aetna deal does have a path forward. Aetna would likely need to divest some or all of its Medicare drug plan business, he said.The biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), is also the most diversified. United owns doctor clinics and an outpatient surgery chain, and also has a pharmacy-benefits management, called OptumRx, built on the acquisition of Catamaran Corp. in 2015

Penney (JCP) in reporting stronger-than-expected holiday retail sales, while several other retailers in the beleaguered sector also anticipate an overdue bump from the holiday season.X Retail stocks were on the move in early trade, as both Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Darden Restaurants (DRI) raised guidance, while Dave and Buster's (PLAY) cut and Five Below (FIVE) issued downbeat guidance. Meanwhile, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) expects a 5% boost to its 2018 profit outlook thanks to recently enacted tax reform.Kohl's November-December same-store sales surged 7% from a year ago, allowing the department-store chain to raise its estimates for the fiscal year ending in January.  It now sees diluted earnings per share of $4.10-$4.20 vs. a previous estimate of $3.72-$3.92. Analysts consensus called for Kohl's to report a profit of $3.64 a share for the year, according to Thomson Reuters.""We are very pleased with our holiday-period sales, which were consistently strong through November and December,"" said Kevin Mansell, Kohl's CEO. He reported positive comps across ""all lines of business and all regions,"" as well as growth in online sales and stronger foot traffic in the holiday period.Shares of Kohl's gained 4.7% to 56.90 on the stock market today, pulling back from a 13-month high of 59.09 soon after the open. Kohl's briefly cleared a 57.38 cup-with-handle buy point intraday.

Kohl's releases its Q4 and fiscal 2017 results March 1.Macy's fell 0.2% while J.C. Penney climbed 3%. The department-store chains said last week that November-December same-store sales grew 1% to 3%.

But Wall Street is still worried about brick-and-mortar retailers' long-term prospects in the age of Amazon.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) hasn't given a holiday sales update, but is generally seen as a viable challenger to Amazon. Wal-Mart shares rose 1.5% to 101.61, nudging past a 100.23 buy point. But the RS line isn't confirming the move, which also is coming on so-so volume. Wal-Mart hasn't yet given a holiday sales update.Lululemon Athletica raised its Q4 earnings and revenue guidance on the back of strong holiday sales. It now expects adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.25 to $1.27  for Q4 vs. a previous range of $1.19 to $1.22.  It forecasts revenue of $905 million to $915 million vs. a previous $870 million to $885 million.Darden upgraded its outlook for adjusted diluted net EPS from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 to $4.70-$4.78, from $4.45-$4.53 previously. The revised estimate includes plans to invest roughly $20 million in its workforce. It continues to see same-restaurant sales growth of 2%, but now expects an approximately 18% effective tax rate vs. a previous 25%.However, Dave and Buster's lowered its fiscal 2017 outlook as it reported comparable-store sales were down 5.1% in the fourth quarter through Jan. 6. It expects total revenue for fiscal 2017 of $1.138 billion to $1.142 billion vs. a prior $1.148 billion to $1.155 billion, and sees comparable-store sales ranging from -1.0% to -0.7% vs. a prior 0% to 0.75%. Net income for the year is now seen at $108 million to $110 million vs. a prior $110 million to $112 million.Five Below reported a 26.7% jump in holiday net sales to $442.6 million, with comp sales growing 6.7%. Despite the holiday bump, the specialty discounter expects Q4 and full-year fiscal 2017 earnings for the period ended Feb. 3 ""near the high end"" of its previous guidance. The period includes a noncomparable week, or ""53rd week,"" in the fourth quarter, it added.Five Below, whose products cater to teens and tweens, now expects net sales of $491 million to $503 million in Q4, and $1.264 billion to $1.276 billion in fiscal 2017. Comparable-store sales should increase 4% to 6% in Q4, and 5.7% to 6.5% in fiscal 2017. It sees diluted income per common share of $1.09 to $1.16 in Q4, and $1.72 to $1.79 in fiscal 2017.Walgreens disclosed Monday it foresees a tax benefit of $200 million for fiscal 2018 from the recent tax reform, MarketWatch reported.

Walgreens added 0.3% to 73.10.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is a curated list of potential stock market winners.Many retailers are upgrading their financial outlooks as an improving global economy instills confidence in consumers.

United Airlines (UAL) also raised its unit revenue outlook and announced a $3 billion buyback.

85,CVS,"The U.S. economy is about to get an injection of rocket fuel.Many economists have argued that ""this is as good as it gets"" for U.S. economic growth. But President Trump's $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could kick economic growth into high gear and give a further boost to the long, strong stock market rally.X Now in the ninth year of an underwhelming recovery, the economy was long held back by an overhang of debt and speed bumps from China to the oil patch. It's finally hit its stride and seems set to step up its pace in 2018.""We've got a global synchronized boom with low inflation,"" said strategist Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. He called it an ideal ""Goldilocks scenario"" for investors, with the economy neither too hot or too cold.If it continues until June 2019, the U.S. economic expansion will break the record 120-month run of the 1991-2001 expansion.With the jobless rate at a 17-year-low 4.1%, seemingly the only worry on the horizon is that a Trump tax fiscal boost now may be too much of a good thing, leading the economy to overheat and the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes.But inflation remains in hiding. Part of the credit goes to Amazon.com (AMZN) for injecting intense price competition into one industry after another. Evermore powerful tech titans like Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Google don't need massive investment, or payrolls, to generate enormous profits. Aging demographics, meantime, acts as a restraint on excessive growth.There's even reason to think that the extra firepower from the Trump tax cuts, will reinforce the U.S. economy's strength, rather than jeopardize its growth streak.Global central banks are pulling back on massive monetary stimulus while China aims to wean itself off another burst of debt-induced growth. U.S. business investment and productivity growth have been lackluster. Tax reforms like lower corporate levies would help counter these economic headwinds.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should pay attention to big economic and news events, but don't let them distract you from how markets are behaving. Read The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the major market averages and leading stocks, letting you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The Republican tax plans being merged by the House and Senate would, in addition to cutting the corporate tax rate to 20%, let businesses immediately deduct the cost of new investments. The bills would set rules aiming to create a more level playing field for U.S. multinationals. For individuals, tax reform would lower rates, nearly doubling the standard deduction and hiking the child tax credit. That would be offset, especially for high-tax blue states, by fewer deductions.A year ago, Federal Reserve Chief Janet Yellen seemed to throw cold water on the tax reform plans being hatched by President-elect Trump and the Republican Congress. ""Fiscal policy is not obviously needed to provide stimulus to help us get back to full employment,"" she said.Now, with the unemployment rate a half-point lower thanks to 2 million new jobs, the Fed will likely weigh in on Wednesday (Dec. 13) to determine what the tax cuts will mean for monetary policy. Policymakers telegraphed three 2018 increases in its key overnight lending rate in their September projections, and it's possible that they will update their projections to hint at four hikes next year.New York Fed President William Dudley, who is stepping down soon, said Dec. 1 that it's ""probably not the best time"" for more fiscal stimulus.Yet Wall Street doesn't seem concerned. Markets still are pricing in just two quarter-point rate increases in 2018, following a near-certain hike on Wednesday.The risk of an overaggressive Fed — the usual suspect in curtailing an economic expansion — can't be dismissed. But policymakers have traveled a fair distance this year in accepting that the Phillips curve — the link between lower unemployment and higher inflation — may no longer be as predictive as they once thought.Policymakers have long argued that inflation would rise as unemployment fell below 4.5%, but the opposite happened this year, even as growth picked up. The core personal consumption expenditures deflator, the Fed's favorite inflation gauge, registered just 1.4% in October, down from 1.8% in February. It hasn't hit the central bank's 2% target in five years.Minutes of the Fed's November meeting revealed that most members of the Fed's policymaking committee saw a meaningful chance that low inflation will have staying power: ""Many participants observed, however, that continued low readings on inflation, which had occurred even as the labor market tightened, might reflect not only transitory factors, but also the influence of developments that could prove more persistent.""In a way, the Trump tax cuts are a bet that low inflation will endure. While no sure thing, Republicans are putting their chips on some powerful trends.This month's megamerger between CVS Health (CVS) and Aetna (AET) is a case in point. Spurred by the threat of Amazon joining the prescription drug business, CVS plans to remake drugstores into low-cost medical-service shops.CVS's plan is in line with the push to move health care to the most cost-efficient setting. Health care inflation, which historically outpaced overall inflation, has become a moderating force. Growing government budget pressures suggest that will persist.Marriott International (MAR) CEO Arne Sorenson explained in August why the hotel group has more trouble raising prices than it did in past cycles. While home-sharing via disrupters such as Airbnb has some impact, the bigger issue is ""radical transparency in pricing"" thanks to the internet.""With each passing year, it becomes simpler and simpler to know the rates at every single hotel,"" he said.Joachim Fels, managing director of Pimco, cites the rise of superstar tech firms as a key reason why ""super-low natural interest rates are likely here to stay.""Titans led by Facebook, Apple and Google ""make higher profits, save more than they invest and pay out a smaller share of their value-added to labor,"" he wrote in August. Their growing dominance helps explain the seemingly broken link between unemployment and wages.The retirement of baby boomers also is curbing wage growth. Higher-paid workers are exiting in large numbers, replaced by lower-paid, younger hires. Aging demographics go a long way toward explaining the persistence of low interest rates, Fed researchers contend.If Goldilocks sticks around, even as tax cuts juice the economy and corporate profits, the current bull market in stocks may continue to surprise to the upside.Solid earnings gains, fueled by the best global economic growth since 2010, could be supersized by a 20% corporate tax rate. The combination of earnings with ""the perception that this expansion has a lot longer to go"" could lift the S&P 500 to 3150 by the end of 2018, a 20% rise, Yardeni says. The S&P 500 closed Thursday at about 2637  now.His outlook envisions investors bidding stocks to a ""meltup multiple"" of 20 times earnings. S&P 500 earnings should grow 7.2% to $141 a share, from $131.50, he says. That includes $6 per share via the tax cut (assuming the 20% corporate rate kicks in immediately, as in the House bill, instead of delayed to 2019 in the Senate version).Economists at Goldman Sachs and UBS are among those who expect the Fed to signal four rate hikes in 2018, but even that is unlikely to derail their bull market thesis.UBS thinks tax cuts could push the S&P 500 as high as 3300 next year. Its analysts assume the Fed will be done raising rates for this cycle after four hikes in 2018. UBS sees the PCE deflator's annual gain of just 1.75% by the end of next year. That's comfortably below the Fed's 2% target.Goldman equity strategist David Kostin's ""rational exuberance"" outlook comes with a 2018 S&P 500 target of 2850, assuming the 10-year Treasury yield rises to 3%. Stocks could rise further if yields and inflation undershoot, and Kostin doesn't rule out a touch of 1990s-style ""irrational exuberance.""Goldman's alternative scenario has the S&P falling to 2450 in 2018, about 7% below current levels, if expectations for corporate tax cuts came to naught.An economy with a head of steam can surely withstand a moderate stock market downturn. But this long-in-the-tooth economic expansion might look more fragile if Republicans weren't on the verge of a major legislative victory.However, that's not the consensus view. Many, if not most economists, have concerns about the Trump tax cuts. Moody's Analytics calls the GOP tax bill a ""fiscal mistake"" that will likely push the economy into a ""boom-bust cycle"" and cut short the late-stage expansion.Yet Lakshman Achuthan, co-founder of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, told IBD that this is a good time for fiscal stimulus. ECRI's forward-looking indicators point to ""a slowdown that most don't see coming."" Those include rising junk bond yields and softer industrial commodity prices, he says.Already the U.S. has been through three decelerations and reaccelerations during this expansion, Achuthan says. He thinks it's on the cusp of a fourth one, possibly mild.Yet a timely fiscal boost from tax cuts, which could begin to show up in individual paychecks via lower withholding starting in January, ""can bolster confidence, if it's viewed positively,"" Achuthan said.The roots of the most recent global reacceleration started in China in early 2016 when Beijing unleashed $1 trillion in credit, helping to restore calm to world financial markets, alongside the actions of various central banks.Now China's growth is gradually cooling as the government seeks to curb unsustainable credit growth. Meanwhile, the Fed has begun slowly reversing its financial-crisis-driven asset purchases. The eurozone economy has finally gained a little momentum, but the European Central Bank will soon start scaling back its bond buying.These clouds in the economic outlook look a lot less worrisome with an injection of tax stimulus set to hit the world's largest economy.Just how much of a boost the GOP tax cuts will deliver is unclear. Wall Street firms generally have modest expectations. Goldman Sachs predicts 2.6% GDP growth in the U.S. and 4% growth worldwide.Goldman economists expect a 0.3-percentage-point boost to U.S. growth in 2018 and again in 2019 on the assumption that the bulk of the tax cut tilted to corporations and higher earners will be saved, not spent. Even a modest Trump tax-cut boost could have a significant impact on labor markets, boosting wage gains and drawing more people into the workforce.Doubts about the tax reform impact reflect the plan's government debt increase, which could push up bond yields. Economists also are unsure how businesses will respond to lower tax rates.At least until recently, business investment has been among the weaker aspects of the expansion despite healthy corporate profits.Herein lies the real test for the Trump economic revolution's investment focus, says George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen.The ""near-obsessive drive"" to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% ""will very likely attract a significant amount of foreign investment,"" he wrote.After a long investment drought, he thinks that ""supercharging investment might help build clusters of excellence, boosting innovation, wages and eventually tax revenue.""RELATED:Why Innovation Isn't Fueling Growth In Economy, WagesBefore You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

X Weight Watchers (WTW) and Planet Fitness (PLNT) are both coming off a big 2017, which saw steep rallies in their shares, but one may offer more potential in 2018 than the other. Meanwhile, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and…

87,CVS,"After strong 2017 gains, the S&P 500 index and other major averages rose sharply to new highs to start 2018. Chip stocks were strong even with Intel (INTC) disclosing a big flaw in many processors. Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) were among many breakouts, but often with some issues. Tesla (TSLA) struggled to get Model 3 out the factory gate while other auto stocks rallied despite U.S. auto sales capping their first annual decline since the financial crisis. Bitcoin had a relatively calm week of solid gains as rival cryptocurrencies surged ahead. Economic data were solid but shouldn't spook the Federal Reserve.X The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow industrials rose sharply to start 2018, with oil, steel and chip groups among the big winners, while utilities sold off. Facebook, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) were among those breaking out, but many were in low volume or had other notable flaws. Crude futures rose to a three-year high. The Treasury yield spread continued to narrow.Intel (INTC) fell as low as 42.69 after a security issue was revealed on its PC and server processors but rallied to close down 3.1% at 44.74.  The security issue could allow hackers to gather sensitive data from the memory of computing devices, but not modify, delete or corrupt data through the exploit, Intel said. The chipmaker said it has developed and is rapidly issuing software patches and firmware updates to correct the problem. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its shares rally because its processors reportedly are not vulnerable to the same security exploit.Bitcoin prices rose to above $16,000 on Friday, capping a solid weekly gain in what was a relatively calm period for the fast-moving cryptocurrency. Alternative digital currencies Ripple and Ethereum surged to new highs. Founders Fund, co-founded by early Facebook investor Peter Thiel, invested $15 million-$20 million in Bitcoin — an investment worth hundreds of millions now, according to the Wall Street Journal reported. The Journal also reported that Merrill Lynch barred its financial advisors from making trades for clients in Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) or proposing any Bitcoin related investments. Russia is looking at creating its own cryptocurrency after President Vladimir Putin meet with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of Ethereum, to figure out how to regulate them. China is reportedly looking to regulate power usage for Bitcoin mining after closing exchanges last year to reduce spreading financial risks.Nearly all automakers saw U.S. vehicle sales fall in December despite heavy incentives and a year-end sales push, but Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) topped estimates, with Ford eking out a 0.9% gain. For 2017, U.S. auto sales fell 1.8% to 17.2 million vehicles, according to Autodata, marking the first decline in eight years. Both analysts and carmakers see a drop below 17 million in 2018. Despite weak auto sales, auto stocks continue to perform well, as investors expect the momentum in higher-margin SUV and truck sales to continue. GM rose 7.4% for the week, Ford 5.7% and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) 22%.Tesla continues to struggle with production on its Model 3 sedans, with overall vehicle output stagnant in recent quarters. Tesla made 2,425 Model 3 sedans in the quarter, vs. consensus of 4,100. Tesla claimed it made ""major progress"" on bottlenecks but now expects to reach production of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the second quarter, instead of the first quarter as previously planned. Tesla shares rose 1.7% but are still near seven-month lows.Shares of BlackBerry (BB) jumped 24% to their best levels since June 2013 in large part as the one-time smartphone leader signed a deal with Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to work together on automotive software for self-driving vehicles.A Goldilocks jobs report for December quieted talk that labor markets are at risk of overheating. Payrolls rose a moderate 148,000, well below the 190,000 expected, as the jobless rate held at 4.1% and average hourly wage gains remained stuck at 2.5%. The data may help Federal Reserve policymakers follow a slow pace of interest rate hikes, at least for now. Yet other indications suggest the economy ended the year with a strong head of steam.

93,CVS,"As investors and Warren Buffett followers ponder what Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) will do with its swelling, record-high pile of cash, analysts say options include a major acquisition, buying more stocks like Apple (AAPL), doing nothing, or even a first-ever dividend.X The holding company held $109.3 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter and will grow by some $3 billion more in December thanks to a bet on the burger business years ago. The record cash hoard is more than five times the $20 billion that CEO Buffett likes to keep on hand, and many shareholders want to see Berkshire put the money to greater work.Hopes are high that Berkshire could shake things up with a deal to rival its $37 billion Precision Castparts purchase in 2016 or its $26 billion Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad purchase in 2010, especially since an attempt this year to buy electric utility Oncor fizzled, while investments in a real estate investment trust and a Canadian mortgage lender hardly made a dent in Berkshire's cash.Buffett even acknowledged to Berkshire shareholders in May that it had been a while since he had pressed his ""foot to the floor"" on an acquisition, and rued keeping so much cash just lying around. But he said the question is: ""Are we going to be able to deploy it?""One challenge facing a Berkshire megadeal is stiff competition among U.S. companies looking to grow through acquisitions. Just in the last month, CVS Health (CVS) agreed to buy Aetna (AET) for $69 billion and Disney (DIS) reached a deal to buy most of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) assets for $66 billion. The number of U.S. deals totaled 9,999 through Dec. 26, up 4.5% vs. all of 2016, according to Dealogic. And while deal values have slipped 14% to $1.492 trillion so far this year, they top the yearly average of approximately $1.137 trillion since 1995.Cathy Seifert, an equity analyst at investment research firm CFRA, thinks a key deal — or two — is likely. What she described as Berkshire's ""embarrassing"" Oncor loss may have left Buffett with the itch to prove his deal making chops, though she doesn't expect him to buy some hot tech company.""My sense is, valuation aside, there is still definitely an appetite to do deals,"" Seifert told Investor's Business Daily.A famously value-driven, opportunistic investor, Buffett's likely to scout for acquisition candidates in underperforming sectors as well as those that tend to do well late in the economic cycle. So think consumer staples, industrials, energy and telecom, Seifert said, adding that Buffett could also look abroad for acquisitions, especially Europe given the healthy recovery in many economies there.As for individual names that Berkshire could target, FactSet Research suggested Nike (NKE), Cognizant (CTSH), BlackRock (BLK), SAP (SAP) and Public Storage (PSA) among other companies. These companies check off Buffett's main acquisition criteria: sizable businesses, solid returns on equity, stable profits, low debt, able management, well-loved brands and simple business models.But any megadeal may be done with 3G Capital, which has teamed up with Buffett lately, including on the Kraft-Heinz (KHC) merger and the Burger King deal that eventually created Restaurant Brands (QSR).Actually, a splashy new deal is unlikely in the year ahead, said Robert Miles, the author of several books on Buffett. After a long bull market and stocks at record highs, a good deal is hard to find, and Buffett is ""a Walmart (WMT) shopper when it comes to stocks and companies"" — meaning, he looks long and hard at valuations.Miles said the 87-year-old Berkshire chief could bide his time ""until the next calamity in financial markets"" to jump on a megadeal.Meanwhile, the insurance segment remains Berkshire's cash cow and is its most important segment, notwithstanding this year's series of disasters that will force hefty payouts.The insurance operations require keeping a safe cushion for catastrophe claims, but it also produces a float — cash holdings from premiums collected ahead of claims that the company invests.Last year, Berkshire posted a combined $6.6 billion in underwriting profits and investment income tied to its prized and expanding float. So basically, Buffett ""got paid about 6%"" for holding his billions, Miles said. This puts the CEO in an enviable situation.""Buffett doesn't have to be in a hurry to go out and make silly investments,"" he added. ""He is getting paid to wait.""It's Berkshire's portfolio of stock holdings that draws especially intense interest, as Buffett fans try to mimic these investments. In Miles' view, Buffett could hand the cash pile over to Berkshire money managers like Todd Combs and Ted Weschler to buy more shares of Apple or smaller-cap equities.When it comes to stocks, Seifert thinks Buffett is more likely to continue to make equity investments in technology and financials.One thing he won't do? Speculate on some investment driving others to a fever pitch. ""He's not going to buy Bitcoin, I can pretty much guarantee you that,"" Miles said.Morningstar sector strategist Gregory Warren suggests Berkshire should try something new with its growing cash hoard: share repurchases and dividends.But that would mark a change of heart for Buffett. He is famously skeptical of such uses for excess cash, preferring to see it reinvested to grow businesses. But Warren argues that with more than $100 billion on its balance sheet, Berkshire should at least consider ""a large one-time special dividend"" soon.The windfall that will be seen on corporate ledgers after the GOP's tax cuts is expected to result in more repurchases and fatter dividends. And Berkshire stands to gain handsomely from lower taxes too.In September, when Congress was still discussing a 20% rate vs. the 21% that eventually passed, Barclays analyst Jay Gelb wrote that a cut to 20% could add $27 billion to Berkshire's book value by lowering its deferred tax liability and raise its earnings power by about 15%.MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read This

94,CVS,"The House re-approved the $1.5 trillion Trump tax cuts Wednesday after the Senate OK'd the measure in the morning with a 51-48 vote. The bill now heads to President Trump's desk. The House had to revisit Tuesday's vote due to procedural issues.X Now the focus on Wall Street is figuring out just how big of a bonanza the new 21% corporate tax rate will be for corporate America and how much of a boost to earnings investors should expect.On Monday, Goldman Sachs said that Wells Fargo (WFC) stands to gain the most among the biggest U.S. banks from the tax package, with a 17% earnings boost. Beyond the corporate rate cut, the legislation also limits the deductibility of FDIC premiums and limits the ability of companies to deduct past losses, which would hit Citigroup the hardest. After Wells Fargo, Goldman sees PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Bank of America (BAC) as the biggest winners, with expected earnings increases of 15% and 14%.BofA Merrill Lynch analyst Kenneth Bruce upgraded credit-card issuers Capital One Financial (COF), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) to neutral from buy on Monday and reiterated a buy rating on American Express (AXP), saying tax legislation wasn't fully priced in to the stocks. Bruce sees a 15%-25% boost to EPS, with Discover and Synchrony near the top of the range and Capital One and AmEx both poised for a 17% EPS increase.Delta Air Lines (DAL) CEO Ed Bastian told analysts last week that a 21% corporate tax rate would cut its tax bill by $800 million a year, the Financial Times reported. The tax legislation would boost Delta's 2018 earnings by $1 per share above current guidance of $5.35 to $5.70 per share. That amounts to roughly an 18% EPS bump. Beyond the lower corporate rate, airlines will benefit from being able to immediately deduct the cost of aircraft purchases. Data from IBD's parent corporation, William O'Neil & Co., show that Alaska Air Group (ALK) has the highest effective tax rate, 38%, among U.S. airlines.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.""Companies with businesses that are primarily domestic-focused tend to have higher tax rates on average. Similarly, small-cap stocks, which are generally more U.S.-centric, could see strong earnings revisions,"" wrote William O'Neil chief investment strategist Randy Watts and senior equity analyst Romeo Alvarez. Among S&P 500 sectors, ""Energy currently has the highest corporate tax rate and would see major relief.""The data show Marathon Oil (MRO) with a 49.9% effective tax rate and ConocoPhillips (COP) paying a 46.9% rate.Energy stocks were big winners Thursday. Conoco Philips jumped 3%, nearly breaking out to a buy zone on the stock market today. Marathon Oil was among the many energy stocks moving toward entry points. Diamondback Energy (FANG) did blast out into buy range in strong volume.CVS Health (CVS) has a 38.9% effective tax rate, tops among consumer staples companies, according to William O'Neil data. Aetna (AET), another high-tax company, is being acquired by CVS as it braces for the entry of Amazon.com into the retail prescription business. CEO Larry Merlo said recently that CVS would take some of its tax windfall and reinvest it in reconfiguring its stores to provide more health services.RELATED:6 Big Rule Changes For Individuals In The New Tax BillTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info TechHere's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Will Boost Profits At These Banking GiantsFederal Reserve Gives Trump Tax Cuts A Green LightFive Reasons Why JPMorgan, Citigroup, Other Financials Are Seizing Market Leadership

97,CVS,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation.

98,CVS,"The Federal Reserve stuck to script on Wednesday, raising its key overnight lending rate and maintaining a projection of three more rate hikes in 2018. Fed policymakers, including chief Janet Yellen, didn't wave red flags over Trump tax cuts being finalized in Congress.X The good news is that Fed policymakers, factoring in imminent tax cuts, boosted their projection of 2018 economic growth to 2.5% from September's 2.1% forecast without increasing inflation estimates. That signals they expect the economy to pick up speed without causing monetary policymakers to hit the brakes.Ahead of the news, shares of Apple (AAPL) and Caterpillar (CAT) helped push the S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average into record territory on the stock market today, thanks to Republican momentum toward finalizing tax legislation and a benign inflation report.Stocks got a lift as policymakers kept all signs of hawkish talons out of view, but gains faded heading into the close.The S&P 500 index closed fractionally lower. The Dow industrials rose 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%, off intraday highs after the Fed decision and Yellen's final quarterly press conference.Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) saw slim losses after core consumer prices came in cooler than expected, rising just 1.7% from a year ago. JPMorgan and Bank of America fell a bit more after the Fed decision, trading down 1.25% and 1.6%.Net interest margins of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and the rest of the banking sector are pinched when the gap between short-term interest rates and long-term rates narrows, and that's what happens when markets worry that the Fed is being too aggressive in raising rates.After the Fed announcement, 10-year Treasury yields slipped further.Fed Chair Janet Yellen noted that while tax cuts are likely to boost demand in the economy, she also expects a lower corporate rate and tax incentives for investment to boost supply and, potentially, productivity, curbing their inflationary impact.Yellen did raise a longer-term concern about tax cuts adding to U.S. public debt, ""taking what is already a significant problem and making it worse."" She added that Congress may have less ""fiscal space"" for stimulus to help lift the economy out of future recessions.Yellen also touched on Bitcoin, noting that it is not a ""stable asset."" Bitcoin futures were already down sharply Wednesday.The Labor Department reported early Wednesday that overall consumer prices rose 2.2% from a year ago in November, as expected, amid higher energy prices. Meanwhile, prices for food consumed at home slipped 0.1% on the month, continuing the weak stretch that began in August as Amazon.com (AMZN) closed its Whole Foods acquisition by slashing some prices.IBD'S TAKE: The bull market won't go on forever, so read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point are more likely than not to have the wind at their backs. Here's a good place to start looking for stocks that may be poised to move higher.Historically tame health care price increases also have helped curtail overall inflation.  Prices of medical commodities, such as prescription drugs, rose 0.6% in November, but were still up just 1.8% from a year ago. CVS Health (CVS) said in a November earnings call that pharmacy same-store sales fell 3.4% in the third quarter, dragged down by generic-drug introductions. The profit squeeze on both its retail business and prescription benefit management unit, along with the looming threat of competition from Amazon, is behind CVS' acquisition of Aetna (AET).Leading up to Wednesday's Fed policy statement, markets were pricing in just two rate hikes in 2018. In the short term, soft inflation readings and hawkish Fed signals could further flatten the yield curve at a time when the gap between the two-year and 10-year Treasury yield is already close to its narrowest point since shortly before the 2007 recession began.Yellen said yield curve inversion, with short-term rates exceeding long-term rates, might not mean recession this time.Yet there's reason to expect 10-year Treasury yields to rise amid solid growth and tax cuts, as well as simple supply and demand. In October, the Fed began to let its mortgage securities and Treasuries, which were accumulated to aid the recovery from the financial crisis, gradually run off its balance sheet as they mature. In addition, larger deficits thanks to tax cuts should create more issuance.RELATED:House, Senate Reach Tax Deal, Settle On 21% Corporate RateTrump Tax Cuts Will Fuel Economic Growth At Just The Right TimeJD.com, Alibaba Seen Cruising In China E-Commerce With Amazon OutStocks Mixed, Bitcoin ETF Shatters 2,000 Mark; Can Tesla Break Out?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

99,CVS,"Companies got into the holiday shopping spirit, with several M&A deals Monday morning. Mall operator GGP (GGP) rejected a buyout offer, 3M (MMM) sold its communications unit, LKQ (LKQ) expended its presence in Europe and two hospital operators reportedly mulled a deal.X GGP, the shopping center operator, rejected a $14.8 billion buyout offer from Brookfield Property Partners (BPY), its largest shareholder, sources told Reuters. Brookfield wants to buy the 66% of the mall operator that it doesn't own and offered $23 per share for GGP.But Brookfield's CEO Bruce Flatt told Bloomberg that talks were still active.GGP shares closed down 0.2% at 23.39 on the stock market today. GGP traded at 19.01 on Nov. 6, just before Brookfield buzz. Brookfield fell 1.3%.Corning (GLW) will buy nearly all of 3M's communication markets business for $900 million in cash as it looks to spend $1 billion to $3 billion on acquisitions.The deal is expected to close next year and will add 7-9 cents to Corning's earnings per share in total. 3M said it would add 40 cents per share.3M shares edged up 0.5% to 239.30 after briefly hitting 240.31. The Dow component fell below a 239 buy point on Friday.Corning climbed 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.LKQ Corp., the U.S. auto parts maker, will buy Germany's Stahlgruber for $1.8 billion, including debt, as it looks to expand its foothold in the European market as U.S. firms head abroad.The deal is expected to close in the first-quarter or early Q2, pending on regulatory reviews.LKQ shares rose 0.3%.The deal comes as U.S. based Genuine Parts (GPC) entered the European auto parts market with its $2 billion purchase of  Alliance Automotive Group in September.Genuine Parts fell 1.4%.Nonprofits Ascension Health and Providence St. Joseph Health are reportedly in merger talks, according to the Wall Street Journal.The deal would create the largest hospital operator in the U.S. with a combined 191 hospitals in 27 states.The healthcare space has been consolidating as healthcare providers await major changes with the Affordable Care and drug prices rise.Last week, CVS Health (CVS) announced it would buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for $69 billion and Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health signed a definitive agreement to form a large regional network.RELATED: Chevron Leads These Five Industrial Stocks Trading Near Buy PointsDon't Give Up On These Five Top Stocks Just Below Buy PointsWhy You Should Put Microsoft, 3M, CAT On Your Watch List NowUnitedHealth Buys DaVita's Medical Unit Amid Big Sector Shakeup
"
100,CVS,"In the wake of a solid month for the broad market and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, some fund managers are tilting toward value-oriented stocks.X Having lagged growth stocks, value stock valuations are increasingly attractive, says Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). Yet their prospects are bright as the U.S. and key foreign economies continue to grow, Galvin added.In November, the broad market got a lift from such Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).With the S&P 500 climbing 3.07% last month, the broad stock market made it 13 straight month of gains, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rode along, advancing 2.62% on average, their 15th monthly gain in the past 16 months and third positive month in a row. That lifted their year-to-date gain to 17.40%.Both the S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs to that point on Nov. 30.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesWhy Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To InvestWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?The November gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, generally better-than-expected corporate profits, benign inflation and heightened prospects for U.S. tax reform with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, said Galvin, whose fund finished among the top 16% in large-cap growth fund performance last month.Wall Street's approval of reforms that lighten corporate regulatory burdens also boosted the stock market last month, said John Rogers, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Ariel Investments and lead manager of flagship $2.2 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX).But market leadership is poised to shift to value-oriented categories of stocks and mutual funds in the coming months, away from growth-oriented ones, added Rogers, whose fund's 7.01% return last month topped 98% of its midcap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.That tilt toward value already seemed underway in November. With a 3.27% gain on average, midcap value funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small- to midsize companies tend to derive a larger portion of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., so they're likely to benefit more than large-cap companies from tax reform. ""There was a rotation into smaller stocks and value stocks as the prospect for successful passage of tax reform grew,"" Galvin said.That tax-reform tilt was also why U.S. diversified stock funds outpaced world stock funds, which averaged just a 1.03% gain last month. Japanese funds, averaging a 2.95% advance, led foreign stock funds.Industrials funds averaged a 3.10% gain in November, leading all major sector categories. They were driven by the rotation into value-oriented stocks.U.S. taxable bond funds were slightly above break even on average in November. U.S. Treasury funds led other categories, averaging a 0.08% gain. World income funds averaged a 0.54% gain. Muni bond funds lost ground overall last month.While GDP growth, corporate profits, tax reform and regulatory reform should benefit all corporations, longtime outperformance by growth stocks has left value stocks more attractively valued, Rogers said.The Russell 2500 Value index was trading at 18 times next year's earnings as of the first week of December. In contrast, the Russell 2500 Growth index was trading at a lofty 32 times. ""It's one of the biggest gaps I've seen in my career between value and growth,"" Rogers said. ""And there will be an inevitable reversion to the mean when things go too far.""In addition, the Federal Reserve's widely expected tax hikes should boost margins for banks, which generally are categorized as value stocks, Rogers said.Already, his firm's researchers are getting bullish input from industrial companies. ""A lot are describing recoveries and business momentum building,"" Rogers said.Further, Amazon's (AMZN) widespread competitive influence is helping to keep retail prices low, which is preventing inflationary pressure from growing, he said.In at least the near term, one area in which he expects to see many investment opportunities is among industrials, what he calls light cyclicals and manufacturers. In that group, he holds Kennametal (KMT). ""It's a favorite,"" he said. ""They make cutting tools and cutting blades that are used for everything from coal mines to rebuilding highways and infrastructure. They should be a prime beneficiary whenever we get an infrastructure (spending) bill through Congress.""Going forward, financial services should also outperform, ""especially money managers and private equity funds that are public,"" he said, adding, ""They're cheap because they're not in popular indexes.""Among those, he cites KKR (KKR). ""They are a large private equity firm run by Henry Kravis,"" he said. ""They're cheap and private equity is one of the best performing asset classes.""Rogers also owns Lazard (LAZ). ""They're an investment banking franchise,"" he said. ""They have money management and mutual fund subsidiaries that focus on emerging markets and international investing.""He also likes the beleaguered media space. Many investors are afraid that cable companies are suffering subscriber attrition, which creates downward pressure on fees to content providers. Rogers nevertheless like MSG Networks (MSGN). The New York City-area sports network broadcasts games for nine sports teams including the professional basketball Knicks. ""The fear has been overdone,"" Rogers said. ""Live sports, whether seen on smartphones, computers or TV, one way or another that content will be viewed and monetized.""Health care is his fourth-largest sector. He prefers systems and instruments maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). ""We're not involved in the riskier, more complicated parts of health care,"" he said.Growth-oriented fund managers still see opportunities on their side of the market ledger.""In the consumer space, where we're overweighted, Costco (COST) continues to demonstrate very strong traffic gains and sales growth,"" Galvin said. ""Roughly one-third of their customers are small-to-medium size businesses, which could benefit from tax reform.""Galvin also likes apparel maker Nike (NKE) and coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX). After lagging in 2017, both ""could be potential winners in 2018,"" Galvin said. ""Each has issues, but each could benefit from accelerating GDP growth, helped by fiscal stimulus, stronger consumer confidence fueled by lower consumer tax rates and better jobs growth.""In health care, the CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) could signal that ""more consolidation is forthcoming,"" Galvin said. Also, a looser regulatory environment and tax reform that motivates companies to repatriate profits held outside the U.S. could increase the attractiveness of more health care companies.And new opportunities could emerge in the tech sector if tax reform and corporate profit escalation encourage more companies to spend on technology. ""For example, Salesforce.com (CRM): it was the fastest company to get to $10 billion in revenues, and it's likely to be the fastest to double revenues within five years as they continue to go broader and deeper in (finding customers among) Fortune 1000 companies at home and abroad,"" Galvin said. ""Salesforce is already by far the market leader in cloud dominance.""The firm's cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.And take $1.5 billion Champlain Small Company Fund (CIPSX) — an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner in the growth, small-cap and diversified equities categories. The growth-oriented fund owned Innospec (IOSP) as of July 31, a specialty chemicals firm that has a 92 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Earnings per share rose 8%, 13% and 28% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Innospec's SMR Rating means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

104,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) announced same-day pharmacy delivery in certain metro areas starting next year and in New York starting next month as it girds for an approaching onslaught from Amazon.com (AMZN). Next-day delivery will be available across the country in 2018.Meanwhile, CVS reported slightly better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Monday amid reports that it could finalize a blockbuster deal to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) before the end of the year.Although expanding into health insurance seemed like a radical way for the drugstore operator to protect its turf, same-day and next-day delivery may be even more of a last resort for CVS. That's because giving customers a seamless way to get their medicine without popping into one of about 9,700 stores could deal a blow to nonprescription sales.""CVS would rather not go down this path but needs to,"" noted Matt Sargent, senior vice president of retail at the Magid research firm. The move is a reflection of its ""level of concern"" about the threat from Amazon.Shares fell 3.5% to 66.80 on the stock market today, hitting their worst levels since February 2014.Aetna shares rose 1 cent Monday to 177. Aetna climbed 2.7% Friday after a Reuters report that CVS could lift its offer price for Aetna to $70 billion and that terms could be announced in December.CVS earnings fell 8.5% to $1.50 a share as revenue grew $3.5% to $46.18 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $1.49 on sales of $46.17 billion according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales fell 3.2%, slightly better than expectations. Pharmacy same-store sales fell 3.4%, depressed by introductions of generic medicines.CVS narrowed its guidance range for full-year earnings to $5.87-$5.91 from $5.83-$5.93, lifting the midpoint by a penny to $5.89. Analysts had expected $5.88 before CVS' 1-cent beat in Q3, according to Zacks Investment Research.CVS management noted that 1,600 locations now provide home delivery, but characterized that volume as ""fairly small."" Asked about the potential cost of a broad expansion in delivery, the company said it had been able to use its scale to negotiate an attractive rate. Many of the details are still apparently being drawn up, as management noted a possibility that delivery might be free to customers with the purchase of front-store merchandise.CVS has been under pressure amid soft front-end store sales and worries about a looming competitive threat from Amazon, which numerous analysts now expect to enter the $300 billion prescription retail market.

105,CVS,"Aetna (AET) easily topped Wall Street's third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday even as it fell short on revenue. But the health insurer said it won't comment on reports that it is in talks to be acquired by CVS Health (CVS). The drugstore giant and pharmacy benefit manger is mulling a reported $66 billion as tries to position itself for the entry of Amazon.com (AMZN) into the retail prescription business.XMeanwhile, rival health insurer WellCare Health (WCG) soared back into a buy zone on its blowout earnings.Aetna earnings per share rose 18% to $2.45 as revenue fell 5% to $14.99 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of $2.08 and revenue of $15.11 billion. Aetna raised its full-year 2017 EPS guidance to $9.75 from the $9.45 to $9.55 range offered in early August and the $9.49 analyst consensus. But given the 27-cent beat in Q3, that implies Q4 EPS roughly in line.WellCare Health earned $4.08 a share, up 150% vs. a year earlier and more than doubled the expected $1.90. Revenue grew 25% to $4.403 billion though that was just below the consensus for $4.411 billion.Aetna shares fell 0.7% to 170.05 on the stock market today, continuing to slip from Thursday's 11.5% spike to 180.70 when news of CVS merger talks hit.WellCare shares jumped 9.1% to 197.67, hitting a record high and retaking a 184.98 buy point.Meanwhile, CVS shares rose 0.1%, but that's after tumbling more than 9% over the prior three sessions to their lowest levels since early 2014 on the buzz that it was offering $66 billion for Aetna.Amazon shares, which surged Friday on better-than-expected earnings, edged higher early, continuing to rally after  surging 13.2% Friday on its blowout Q3 earnings.Aetna highlighted Medicare as the company's primary growth driver, with 23,000 new members added in the quarter and plans to expand its geographic footprint in 2018. Aetna ended the period with 22.2 million insured members.The revenue decline reflected a one-year suspension of the Affordable Care Act health insurer fee that is tacked on to premiums, a pullback from the ObamaCare individual market and Medicaid contract losses.Management said the restoration of the health insurance fee would knock 25 cents off of 2018 EPS.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 23,400 on Friday, up more than 1,500 points since IBD changed its market trend indicator to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a yellow light turning green.

Some analysts say the deal would give the combined company negotiating leverage with drug manufacturers and but others worry that health insurer companies could distance themselves from the pharmacy.

108,CVS,"The big news in health care last week was the disclosure that CVS Health Corp. — owner of a vast network of drugstores — is considering buying Aetna Inc., one of the nation's largest health insurers, for roughly $66 billion. It's undeniably important, but why?Clearly, economic concentration in health care is growing. The possible CVS-Aetna hookup is just a gigantic example. Hospitals have been consolidating; so have physician groups. A study published recently in Health Affairs, a journal of public policy, reported that hospitals were ""highly concentrated"" in 90% of the country's metropolitan areas.The consequences, warns Alan Weil, Health Affairs' editor, include a ""narrowing of (consumer) choices"" and ""outsized market power"" of hospitals and physician specialists. But are there also benefits? Could we be glimpsing the future of health care? Could the changes ultimately overshadow the significance of ObamaCare?To make some sense of all this, I turned to Dan Mendelson, the president of Avalere, a health care consulting company that he founded in 2000. I submitted questions to Mendelson; his replies, edited for brevity, are printed below.Q: Why is a major retail drug chain (CVS) thinking of merging with a big insurer (Aetna)?A: Health care is increasingly about the ability of medical enterprises to deliver improved patient care through technology. All insurers are interested in developing a strong presence in data analytics. This in turn encourages mergers and acquisitions. Why? CVS is a diversified health care company with operations in pharmacy benefit management, post-acute care and a strong network of health care clinics — it's not just a drugstore chain. By merging with CVS, Aetna gains access to these rich data sources to drive better health care practices. The same is true for CVS in reverse. It gets to tap Aetna's databases and discover, say, which of its policyholders haven't received their flu shot and could be solicited by CVS.Q: Do you expect more big mergers and acquisitions?A: Yes. The pace of big combinations will accelerate in coming years. All health care companies will need to reposition themselves to accommodate the fundamental trends of the health care system — which will continue irrespective of political change.Q: What are those trends?A: First, payers — private insurers and government through Medicare and Medicaid — are paying more for value (good patient outcomes) as opposed to the volume of services (the number of tests and procedures). Medicare and Medicaid have led the way, but private insurers are catching up. This has driven consolidation in the provider sectors (hospitals and doctors), because it's easier to measure and improve quality as a system as opposed to influencing sole proprietor or small group practices. This has also driven the acquisition of providers by insurers, because the key to improving quality is getting a better alignment between the interests of patients and providers.A second major trend is related: the increasing role of information technology and data analytics in improving patient care. A lot of the basic wiring of the health care system is now complete — a result of federal investment and lower technology prices. The need now is to harness the power of analytics to improve care. As noted, this drives mergers and acquisition.A final trend that seems likely to continue is the looming threat that some of the large tech firms — Amazon, Google and the like — will enter the health care markets. The existing health care providers and payers think they need to get larger to compete with these mega-firms.Q: Will consolidation help cost control by eliminating duplication and by creating new economies of scale? Or will the loss of competition and the market power of the survivors boost prices and health care spending?A: Of course, regulators will scrutinize proposed combinations to answer that question. But the increasing focus on patient outcomes also has the possibility of controlling costs. We've seen this in the Medicare Advantage program, where quality-based payments have also improved patient well-being with lower cholesterol levels and better blood sugar readings for diabetic patients. There is no question that increased consumer access to health care and new technology have a tremendous potential to take inefficiencies out of the system. Still, we should not be naive. At the local level, regulators need to ensure that provider networks remain competitive. A hospital with monopoly power can be expected to raise costs for consumers.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Aetna's report comes just days after news that it's in takeover talks with CVS…
"
110,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) isn't taking the threat from Amazon.com (AMZN) lying down.XNews that the drugstore chain is reportedly in talks to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) for more than $200 per share hit just after reports that Amazon has obtained wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least a dozen states.Aetna shares vaulted 11.5% to close at 178.60 on the stock market today. CVS shares fell 2.9%, recovering somewhat after the Aetna news followed the Amazon report. Amazon shares changed little during regular trading but surged 7.8% late after reporting quarterly results that sailed past estimates.Meanwhile, news about Amazon's pharmacy licenses sent Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) down 3.2%, while a host of drug distributors also got whacked. AmerisourceBergen (ABC) lost 4.2%, McKesson (MCK) 5.2% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.CVS and Aetna, which serves 22 million members, already had close ties, with Aetna signing up the drugstore giant's Caremark unit as its pharmacy benefit management partner this spring.In June, Tarun Mehra of the Fuld & Co. consultancy wrote that CVS should buy Aetna: ""CVS has an impressive suite of assets already, but if it were to add a health plan to its portfolio, it would create a truly large-scale integrated platform across retail, PBM, MCO (managed care organization), and a distributor joint venture (with Cardinal Health, providing CVS with a strategic advantage over UnitedHealth Group (UNH)-OptumRx.""Yet in just a few months, the potential entry of Amazon has shaken up the $300 billion prescription-dispensing industry, and analysts are now speculating that UnitedHealth could partner with Amazon. UnitedHealth shares close up 0.8% and added 1.4% after hours.RELATED:Anthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

111,CVS,"Anthem (ANTM) shares broke above a buy point to an all-time high on Wednesday, powered by better-than-expected earnings and a strategic acquisition.XThe for-profit operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans reported a third-quarter profit of $2.65 per share, up 8% from a year ago and 22 cents ahead of estimates. Revenue rose 4.8% to $22.43 billion vs. estimates of $22.05 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Anthem offered full-year EPS guidance of $11.90 to $12.00, not far ahead of the $11.83 consensus, considering its Q3 earnings beat.Still, shares of Anthem jumped 5.4% to 205.71, clearing a buy point at 199.08, though off its new intraday record high of 208.74. Shares of other insurers were mixed, with UnitedHealth Group (UNH) off 0.3%, Cigna (CI) up about 1% and Centene (CNC) down 2.4%.IBD'S TAKE: When a stock clears a buy point, it offers investors their most reliable opportunity for near-term gains. Take Caterpillar, which cleared a buy zone on the strength of Q1 earnings in April and advanced close to 40% in six months. But investors should be discriminating about which stock breakouts they jump on. Learn IBD's rules for maximizing your profit chances and start here in searching for stocks poised for near-term gains.Anthem shares took off as investors applauded the insurer for its second major strategic move in as many weeks.Anthem announced the acquisition of America's 1st Choice, a privately held insurer offering Medicare Advantage plans, while touting the company's proprietary technology tools that help it deliver cost-effective care. The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, is expected to close early in 2018 and be slightly accretive to earnings in fiscal 2018.Last week, Anthem said that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year deal with CVS, which will take effect in 2020, brings Anthem closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth, which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a pharmacy-benefits manager to gain entry into the $300 billion business.Centene shares fell for second straight session, tumbling below its 50-day line after losing 5.1% on Tuesday. While the leading ObamaCare-exchange insurer topped earnings estimates on Tuesday, it warned that EPS in the coming quarter might face a hit of 7 to 12 cents if the White House immediately follows through on its threat to cut cost-sharing subsidies, which are paid to insurers in order to lower deductibles and out-of-pocket bills for low-income members.RELATED:Anthem Jumps Into Prescription Business As Amazon Speculation SwirlsUnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLeaderboard: Daily Updates On Stocks With Potential For Big Gains

112,CVS,"Anthem (ANTM), the second-largest U.S. health insurer, said on Wednesday that it will launch its own pharmacy-benefit management business, relying heavily on CVS Health (CVS) for both back-end processing and retail distribution.The five-year Anthem-CVS deal will take effect in 2020, after Anthem's current contract with Express Scripts (ESRX) expires.Anthem's move brings it closer to resembling the model established by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which bought pharmacy-benefits manager Catamaran for $12.8 billion in 2015. Cigna (CI) also has established its own pharmacy-benefits management business.Amazon.com (AMZN) reportedly is close to entering the prescription-dispensing field, with several analysts speculating that Amazon might acquire a PBM to gain entry into the $300 billion business.CVS Health, the No. 2 U.S. drugstore operator, has served as a PBM since its 2006 acquisition of Caremark.Shares of Anthem closed up 2.4% at 191.79 on the stock market today, rising earlier to 199.23, briefly topping a 199.08 buy point. CVS Health gained 2% to 74.07.Express Scripts, which expressed disappointment at losing Anthem's business, opened lower but reversed higher, settling with a 1% gain at 57.77. The reason for the rebound wasn't immediately clear, though analysts have speculated that Express Scripts could be a target for Amazon.Cigna rose 1.1%, while UnitedHealth added 0.7% after hitting a record high on Tuesday following release of strong third-quarter earnings. Amazon dipped 1.2% to 997, back below the 1,000 level.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Anthem are closing in on a buy point at 199.08. That's the point at which investors have the best odds of seeing near-term gains. Anthem is ranked No. 8 among IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see who the leaders are and find out how your stocks rank in each of 197 industry groups.A PBM essentially does for prescription benefits what managed-care companies do in managing nonprescription health benefits and claims. PBMs seek to lower the costs of pharmacy benefits by using their expertise and buying power to direct the most appropriate medicines to patients at the lowest cost.While Amazon wants to get into the retail prescription business, it faces a big challenge in dealing with the regulatory-compliance and claims-processing aspects of the business. That's where a PBM's expertise and processing systems come in. However, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes has said that the most logical path forward for Amazon would be to form a partnership with UnitedHealth, the nation's largest insurer.When asked, on UnitedHealth's earnings call on Tuesday, about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, management said they are ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""RELATED:UnitedHealth Signals Openness To Amazon Partnership; Earnings BeatAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

113,CVS,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) toppled Monday along with retailers Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), continuing to slide on the potential that Amazon.com (AMZN) could disrupt the pharma world by venturing into online prescription drug sales, prodding an analyst to downgrade Express Scripts.XOn the stock market today, Express Scripts dove 5% to 59.22, touching a six-month low intraday. CVS fell 3.4% to an 11-month low. Walgreens sank 3.2% to its lowest in nearly three years. On Friday, Express Scripts lost 2.6% while CVS and Walgreens plunged 4.9%.Raymond James analyst Michael Baker downgraded Express Scripts to underperform from a market perform rating, citing ""escalating competitive pressures"" given its pure-play model as a pharmacy benefits manager and the possibility that ""wild card"" Amazon could enter the market.""The 2019 selling season is shaping up to be more competitive than 2018,"" Baker wrote in a note to clients. ""Commentary suggests that some opportunities were pushed from 2018 to 2019 with about $1.5 billion scripts 'in play' for 2019-20 combined.""Competitor Prime Therapeutics is unlikely to win a contract with Anthem (ANTM), meaning it will likely go after Blue Cross Blue Shield contracts held by Express Scripts totaling $10 billion to $12.5 billion in total drug spending, Baker said.IBD'S TAKE: The medtech space has been less affected in 2017 by drug-pricing worries than the pharma and biotech spaces. Can the space climb higher still this year? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the group and strong performers within it.Express Scripts also has four Blue Cross Blue Shield contracts up for bid in 2019, worth about $8.5 billion in drug spending, he estimated.Adding to that pressure, web giant Amazon is rumored to be considering an entrance into the online prescription drug sales market with a decision expected before Thanksgiving. In an email on Friday, Amazon declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily.""We see two potential routes if it decided to enter: Team up with a distributor to target the cash-pay market, or make a bigger splash by going after the insured market,"" Baker said. ""There are two different ways to penetrate the insured market: Partner with existing PBMs or purchase a PBM.""Baker trimmed his adjusted earnings per share view to $7.55 from $7.60 for Express Scripts in 2018. He kept his $7 estimate for 2017 and issued a $8.33 model for 2019. The latter forecast is 23 cents below the consensus.RELATED:Amazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

123,CVS,"Even though CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) have repeatedly thrown cold water on the idea that Amazon.com (AMZN) will take on the $300 billion prescription dispensing industry, the idea just won't die.XOn Thursday, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes seemed to up the ante on Amazon's rumored interest in the sector, saying he expects it to happen. According to a write up from TheFly.com, Wilkes sees Amazon either buying or partnering with a pharmacy benefit management company, which would help drive volume and navigate industry regulations.Wilkes has been working in and covering the health care services arena for a quarter century, so his perspective that Amazon is well positioned to disrupt the industry may carry weight with investors. He noted his concern that Amazon's entry could negative effect PBM industry earnings.The report about Amazon is likely a longer run concern for investors, so the pharmacy focus Thursday was on weak sales from Rite Aid (RAD), which cited ""a challenging reimbursement rate environment"" and new generics holding down prescription prices as it reported earnings.Amazon shares added 0.6%, heading back toward its 50-day moving average. Rite Aid shares tumbled 11% to 2.03, hitting a four-year low on the stock market today. CVS, which is both drugstore and PBM, slipped 0.3%, while Walgreens lost 0.8%. Walgreens this month won FTC approval to buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores after a long battle to buy all of its smaller rival fell apart due to regulatory objections.Dow component UnitedHealth Group (UNH), which operates the OptumRx pharmacy benefit management company, rose 0.8% but lagged behind the solid gains seen by other managed care players. Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest pure-play PBM, was 0.2% higher.The health care group suffering the most on Thursday were drug distributors. McKesson (MCK) fell 1.4%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 1.75% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 1.7%.If Amazon were to enter the pharmaceutical industry, some industry watchers have speculated that it might cut out distributors and deal directly with drug manufacturers.IBD'S TAKE: IBD premium features are free through Oct. 8.

""In an environment where there's a migration to more value-based care, those clinical capabilities are going to continue to grow in importance.""Merlo said the ""highly regulated"" industry has high barriers to entry, and noted all the work required between pharmacists, payers and physicians. He added that patients put trust in their retail pharmacists, adding that mail-order pharmacy has declined in recent years.Some have speculated that Amazon could use Whole Foods locations as a place for in-store pharmacy pickups.RELATED:This $300 Billion Market Could Be Amazon's Next Casualty — Or NotRite Aid Stock Crashes On Same-Store DeclineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

124,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) on Thursday said it would limit some opioid prescriptions to seven days and cap daily dosage based on an opioid's strength, part of the pharmacy giant's efforts to deal with a nationwide opioid crisis.X""Prescription and nonprescription opioid misuse is now considered among the most urgent health crises in our country,"" the company said in a statement. ""The opioid epidemic touches all of the communities we serve, and as a pharmacy innovation company, we are in a unique position to make a difference.""The company also said that it would add in-store disposal units in 750 pharmacies to allow consumers to get rid of leftover medication they don't want. Those additions would follow the company's donation of more than 800 medication disposal units to police departments nationwide in recent years. The company also said it would strengthen a variety of counseling and awareness efforts.CVS currently offers opioid prescriptions that last at least 20 days to many patients with acute pain that the company covers, CVS' chief medical officer told the Wall Street Journal.Painkillers remain a multibillion-dollar industry for pharmaceutical companies. As a recent IBD article noted, the FDA has approved some ""abuse-deterrent"" opioids, which can be more difficult to crush and snort. But the extra tests required for such drugs can be costly, while cheaper generic alternatives are available and addicts can still find ways to abuse the drugs regardless.Biotechs like Cara Therapeutics (CARA) are among those trying to develop products that aren't as addictive.Meanwhile, the cannabis industry has increasingly tried to market itself as an alternative to opioid painkillers. GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) has developed a seizure-fighting drug based on cannabidiol, or CBD, a component of the marijuana plant that is used as a relaxant.Shares of CVS fell 1.4% to 79.56 in the stock market today, a day after falling 2.9% on a report that Amazon.com (AMZN) may be getting into the pharmacy benefit-management market. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which is acquiring nearly 2,000 Rite Aid (RAD) stores, lost 0.8%. Cara Therapeutics dipped 0.2%. GW Pharmaceuticals slipped 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As the cannabis industry booms, CBD, a non-psychoactive part of marijuana, could lead the way in mainstream adoption of the plant. Companies like GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) remain ways into the industry. For more on CBD products, read this story.The announcement Thursday from CVS comes as addiction to oxycodone, heroin, fentanyl and other drugs become entrenched in communities and the broader economy.Heroin use more than doubled between 2002 and last year, while deaths linked to the drug jumped more than six times over that period, government data show. Opioid use by men alone could have helped drive some 20% of the drop in their participation in the national labor force, a Princeton University economist recently estimated, according to a Bloomberg story this monthRELATED:Is Big Pharma Addicted To Opioid Painkillers?Marijuana Investing Goes Wall Street: More Ties, Less Tie-Dye

125,CVS,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH) signaled openness to partnering with Amazon (AMZN), which is reportedly considering a push into the prescription-dispensing business, after beating Q3 earnings forecasts.XThe insurer's Optum business, a provider of health services, prescription benefit management and technology services, has been a growth driver and helps the company stand apart from the rest of the managed-care market.Asked about the potential for Amazon to enter the prescription-dispensing business, OptumRx unit CEO John Prince said that the company is ""willing to partner with anybody that drives value"" with the goal of meeting consumers ""how and where they want.""Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes wrote earlier in October that he sees a partnership with UnitedHealth as the most logical path forward for Amazon as it targets the prescription business.Shares of UnitedHealth jumped 5.5% to close at a record high of 203.89 on the stock market today, bouncing off support at their 50-day average and helping the Dow Jones industrial average climb toward 23,000. Amazon edged up 0.3%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) rose 0.7%, and drug distributor McKesson (MCK) dipped 0.1%. CVS Health (CVS), which also has a PHM unit, added 0.3%.UnitedHealth is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, behind Centene (CNC) and Cigna (CI), based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance trends. Centene rose 3.2% and Cigna 1.2% Tuesday, helped by a bipartisan deal to fund ObamaCare subsidies for insurers.IBD'S TAKE: Get ready for each earnings season day by reading IBD's daily Investing Action Plan, which highlights stocks that are in buy range or close to it. UnitedHealth's EPS surged 23% to $2.66, beating views for $2.57, as revenue climbed 8.7% to $50.322 billion, matching forecasts. Optum revenue rose 8.4% to $22.89 billion.The company raised its guidance for full-year earnings to about $10 per share vs. its prior range for $9.75-$9.90. Analysts had expected $9.87.Because the insurer has extricated itself from the ObamaCare exchanges and GOP efforts to target Medicaid have run into trouble, it's well positioned to deal with shifting political winds.In fact, UnitedHealth markets the type of short-term medical plans that Trump wants to make widely available as a less-costly alternative to ObamaCare plans.Management noted on the earnings call that they'll consult with the Trump administration as officials write rules governing short-term plans and other areas targeted by Trump's executive order last week.RELATED:Trump Executive Order Hits ObamaCare InsurersAmazon: Your New Online Drug Retailer?

127,CVS,"Just when it looked like the Trump agenda might be getting back on track, Arizona Sen. John McCain may have done more damage than most people realize.In the coming week, Congress was expected to take one more shot at repealing ObamaCare as Republicans release a more detailed and unified vision of where tax reform is going.Now, after McCain's rejection of the last-ditch TrumpCare effort — the Graham-Cassidy bill — it looks like ObamaCare is here to stay and the path to tax reform just got a lot more treacherous.TrumpCare's demise could be bad news for the likes of Apple (AAPL), which would benefit from a low rate for repatriating its $260 billion in profits held overseas. Shares of Apple faltered in the past week amid light crowds for the iPhone 8. While few, if any, analysts think anything close to the 15% corporate tax rate Trump has eyed is feasible, tax reform still holds big potential rewards for companies like CVS Health (CVS) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that pay high U.S. tax rates and earn most of their money domestically.Congress has until Sept. 30 to pass TrumpCare using a filibuster-proof budget reconciliation procedure that expires at the end of the fiscal year. In theory, Republicans could just start the process over in fiscal 2018, but that's seen as unlikely because the GOP can only use reconciliation once per fiscal year, and the 2018 budget resolution is needed to accommodate tax reform. Probably the fastest way to sink tax cuts would be to attach them to the political anchor known as ObamaCare repeal.So why does the death of TrumpCare matter if Republicans will aim to pass tax cuts by themselves?The answer has everything to do with budget aesthetics and the divide between GOP moderates and conservatives over appropriate spending levels.In that regard, consider how much of a difference it would have made to have a running start toward deficit reduction courtesy of TrumpCare. Independent estimates suggest that the latest bill from GOP Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy would have cut about $200 billion in federal health outlays from 2020-2026.On top of that, there's a Graham-Cassidy provision that left many wonks scratching their heads. Instead of continuing to gradually curb the health funds to states in place of ObamaCare, Graham-Cassidy would eliminate that funding starting in 2027, cutting spending by about $230 billion in that single year on top of nearly $50 billion in Medicaid cuts, according to Avalere Health.IBD'S TAKE: Despite a hawkish Federal Reserve and saber-rattling North Korea, the stock market has been enjoying a strong month, and IBD readers were ready. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While no one sees such a sudden and drastic cut as credible, the appearance of such a reduction might take pressure off the GOP to find other spending cuts. Without those cuts, the risk is that it will look like Republicans, far from being fiscally disciplined, are blowing up the deficit and debt.The failure to repeal ObamaCare looks even more consequential for tax reform after President Trump and top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi agreed on a deal to keep the government funded and hike the debt ceiling through Dec. 8. Come December, it's hard to imagine that Democrats will agree to grease the skids for GOP tax cuts that are coming down the pike.The upshot is that Republicans, who have never been able to summon enough votes to keep the government operating without relying on Democrats, may have to do so to keep tax reform moving forward. After the deal between Trump and Democrats, Goldman Sachs downgraded the odds of a 2018 tax cut to 40%. Goldman cited the possibility that the next government funding deal will collide with tax reform, along with a hefty federal bill for hurricane recovery.RELATED:McCain Pulls Plug On GOP Health Bill; Insurers, Hospitals RallyTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

128,CVS,"Just as President Trump's tax reform push was supposed to start getting serious, Republicans are setting their sights on a tax cut that looks way too be good true.Experts say that the bare bones plan details, which were leaked to news outlets over the weekend and largely confirmed by the White House on Monday, point to total tax cuts worth $5.5 trillion over 10 years. The framework includes a 20% corporate tax (down from 35%); a top individual tax rate of 35% (now 39.6%); a 25% rate for smaller firms and partnerships whose business income passes through the owners' individual tax return; and a doubling of the standard deduction.The wish list looks more than a little rich when compared to the $1.5 trillion in net tax cuts that Senate Republican negotiators agreed to target last week. The implication is that there are some $4 trillion worth of offsetting tax cuts, loophole closures and spending cuts that Republicans are ready to embrace at the same time.While conceivable, so far the only pay-for that seems like a reasonably safe bet for inclusion in the package is elimination of the tax deduction for state and local taxes, which could raise about $1.5 trillion over a decade. That would have a bigger impact on high-tax blue states such as California and New York.The upshot is that something — about $3 trillion worth of taxes — will have to give, either in tax cuts or offsets, which will slow and complicate the path to tax reform.Trump is set to head to Indiana on Wednesday to promote his tax plan, but financial markets were hardly bowled over on Monday by early reports, partly because so few details have been figured out. Passage, if it happens, seems likely to slide well into to 2018. Terry Haines, senior political strategist at Evercore ISI wrote Monday that chances of tax cuts going through are about 50%.The hopeful news for financial markets counting on a tax-driven boost to earnings is that cutting the corporate tax rate is a White House priority that it's reluctant to give ground on. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he still wants the statutory corporate rate cut to 15%, however unlikely.Trump also seems adamant about bringing back home a few trillion dollars' worth of U.S. corporate profits that have been held overseas to avoid paying tax. A bargain rate on repatriating foreign earnings could provide a windfall to companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which could use some of the cash for a share buyback.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8. Popular features include exclusive stock lists, IBD Stock Checkup, which ranks the leaders in 197 industry groups based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance; and The Big Picture daily update of the underlying market trend. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green.  Shares of companies like CVS (CVS) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that derive most of their income from within the U.S. also could be winners under tax reform. Homebuilders might be an exception. The National Association of Realtors has warned that killing the state & local tax deduction, while doubling the standard deduction (as both the House GOP and Trump have proposed), could sink home prices by 10%. Under this scenario, the Realtors group says that only about 5% of households would itemize, down from 30%, so the mortgage deduction would offer little incentive for buying a home vs. renting.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote last week that their base case for tax reform would result in a 25% corporate tax rate that's phased in over several years, along with only modest, temporary individual rate cuts. ""We continue to expect a modest deficit expansion that delivers little near-term stimulus,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Michael Zezas.Since Trump has been insisting his tax cuts will help the middle class, a slimmed-down package might end up scrapping tax cuts for higher-income households.The looming likely failure of ObamaCare repeal this week will further complicate the path to tax reform, noted Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Horizon Investments. That's because the GOP was counting on savings from cutting spending on health entitlements to help make the Republican fiscal program look more fiscally responsible. So far the GOP has been unable to implement any spending cuts under Trump, and the annual budget deficit is already projected to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2027.RELATED:McCain Killed ObamaCare Repeal, Wounded Tax Reform In One BlowThese Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax ReformTrump's Debt Deal With Democrats Sinks Tax-Cut Hopes: Goldman SachsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

129,CVS,"The consumer price index rose 0.5% in September and 2.2% vs. a year earlier, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Core prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.1% on the month and 1.7% from a year ago.Wall Street expected the headline CPI to rise 0.6% on the month and 2.3% from a year ago, thanks to a hurricane-inflicted boost in energy prices. The core CPI was expected to rise 0.2% and 1.8% from a year ago. Hurricane effects also raised the risk of an uptick in core inflation, as the owners of damaged homes and destroyed vehicles began repairs and shopped for replacements, but new and used vehicle prices fell.After the report, the 10-year Treasury yield moved lower. The CPI data likely doesn't change the near-term outlook for Federal Reserve policy, with markets expecting a December rate hike, but it could lower the odds that the Fed will stick to its plan of three rate hikes in 2018.Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials held onto gains on the stock market today after the inflation report. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other financials lost ground as the data dampened prospects for wider net interest margins that can come from higher long-term interest rates. BofA reported better-than-expected earnings early Friday, while Wells Fargo missed on revenue.Prices for food consumed at home didn't budge in September after a 0.2% drop in August that may have partly reflected price cuts at Whole Foods after Amazon.com (AMZN) closed its acquisition. Target (TGT) announced price cuts in early September. Prices for food consumed away from home rose 0.4%.Prices for telephone hardware and related consumer information gear fell 1.2%, showing no obvious shift from its steady downward trend after Apple (AAPL) released its pricey iPhone 8.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of major banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America are in buy range, less than 5% above buy points cleared in recent weeks.

Prescription drug prices fell 0.6% on the month.CVS Health (CVS) said in August that it saw flat same-store prescription volumes in the second quarter, but pharmacy same-store sales fell 2.8%, dragged down by recent generic introductions.

It's a worry for media companies because they garner per-subscriber programming fees.AT&T tumbled 7.5% to 35.70, dropping below the ""collar"" in its proposed acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX).

133,CVS,"Zogenix (ZGNX) rocketed to its highest point in nearly seven years Monday after it announced a public offering of 4.3 million shares — one trading day after it topped GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) with an epilepsy drug.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Zogenix had surged 11% to finish at 38.90, after earlier rising as much as 18.8% to touch a high last seen in March 2011. Biotechs broadly lifted 1.5% to a high last seen in January 2016.

134,CVS,"Goldman Sachs has been firmly in the tax-cuts-are-coming column — until now.The combination of a hefty federal bill for hurricane recovery and, now, a looming fight over raising the debt ceiling that could collide with tax reform have shifted the odds slightly against it, the Wall Street powerhouse says.XGoldman, which has two former partners running the White House's tax-reform push in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, downgraded the odds of a 2018 tax cut to 40% on Wednesday, following President Trump's deal with Democrats for a 3-month debt-ceiling hike and government-funding extension through Dec. 15.Republican leaders in Congress had been pushing Democrats to agree to an 18-month debt-ceiling hike, pushing the next deadline beyond the 2018 election, or — at worst — a 6-month deal, which would have provided a feasible window for passing tax legislation.The 3-month timeline, by contrast, risks setting up Democrats to use those must-pass bills as leverage to try and frustrate any efforts to pass any tax cuts for wealthy Americans.GOP majorities in both the House and Senate give them the ability to raise the debt ceiling, fund the government and pass tax cuts without help from Democrats. That's why there's still no small chance tax cuts will be forthcoming. Yet, in practice, Republicans haven't been able to bridge the wide disagreement between moderates and conservatives over federal spending levels.Trump hit the road to North Dakota on Wednesday to stump for his virtually detail-free tax plan. Few, if any, analysts think anything close to the 15% corporate tax rate Trump is still eyeing is feasible, but tax reform still holds big potential rewards for the likes of Apple (AAPL), which could benefit from a low rate for repatriating its $260 billion in profits held overseas. Meanwhile, companies like CVS Health (CVS) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) that pay high U.S. tax rates and earn most of their money domestically, also stand to be big winners.IBD'S TAKE: Despite dimming hopes for tax cuts and North Korea's increasingly dangerous signals, the stock market remains in an uptrend. On Aug. 22, IBD shifted its market trend gauge to ""confirmed uptrend"" from ""uptrend under pressure,"" the equivalent of a flashing yellow light turning green. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Even before Trump stunned Republicans by siding with ""Chuck and Nancy"" — Charles Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in the Senate and House — Goldman had lowered tax-cut odds to roughly 50-50.""Harvey has made tax reform slightly more difficult,"" Goldman noted, with hurricane relief expected to add upward of $100 billion in red ink — excluding the cost of Hurricane Irma.Further widening the deficit in the near term may lead conservatives to insist upon deeper spending cuts to offset the cost of reform than moderate Republicans can stomach. Moderates have already been pushing back against plans to package $200 billion in spending cuts over 10-years along with tax cuts.As it is, the Congressional Budget Office already expects the annual federal budget deficit to widen to $1.5 trillion by 2027.The particulars of tax reform could sow further dissension within the GOP ranks if, as expected, the effort targets the state and local tax deduction that disproportionately helps relatively wealthy blue states.One wild card is the outcome of the GOP bid to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which could spring back to life. If Republicans can snatch victory out of the jaws of defeat, that could give renewed momentum to the wider Trump agenda, but the clock is ticking fast. The budget resolution that allows the GOP to pass health care legislation with just 51 votes in the Senate is set to expire on Sept. 30.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksMarkets Are 'Too Negative' On Trump Tax-Cut Odds: GoldmanThese Are The Biggest Losers From Trump's Tax Reform

135,CVS,"Zogenix (ZGNX) shares nearly tripled, rocketing to their highest point in nearly four years Friday, after the company reported Phase 3 data on a drug that targets forms of epilepsy seen primarily in children and young adults — and widely topping earlier results from rival GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH).XAt one point on the stock market today, Zogenix shares catapulted higher by 191.5% to 37.55. By the closing bell, shares were up 172.2% to $35.05. Meanwhile, GW Pharma toppled 9.6% to close at 101.49.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich called the results from Zogenix ""extremely positive"" and reiterated his sell rating on GW Pharma, which could now face difficulty in getting a share of the epilepsy market despite being ahead of Zogenix in the development process.""We believe investors previously ignored the threat from Zogenix because its program was only supported by a small (12 patients), open-label study conducted in Europe,"" he wrote in a note to clients.But on Friday, Zogenix said the low dose of its drug, dubbed fenfluramine, reduced monthly seizures by a median 72.4% vs. a 17.4% reduction in patients treated with a nondrug placebo. Zogenix's drug aims to treat a rare condition known as Dravet syndrome and is undergoing testing for another form of epilepsy known as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, both of which begin in childhood.In its Phase 3 trial presented in March 2016, GW Pharma's drug called Epidiolex achieved a monthly median seizure reduction of 39% compared with a 13% reduction in patients treated with a placebo.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are outmuscling the broader stock market, but is it time to invest in one of their exchange traded funds? Head to IBD's ETFs page for a closer look at how and when might be the best time to jump.Both trials treated patients over the course of 14 weeks, though Zogenix observed patients for six weeks prior to treatment whereas GW Pharma used a four-week observation period to establish their baselines for seizures.Trbovich acknowledged that there are no head-to-head studies between the two, and there are significant differences between the patient populations treated in both trials. But he noted that Zogenix's drug could potentially also rival GW Pharma's in treating other seizure disorders.GW Pharma has completed Phase 3 trials of Epidiolex in Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Epidiolex is an oral drug created from plant-derived cannabidiol.""We expect low-dose fenfluramine represents a significant competitive threat to GW Pharma's Epidiolex across both indications for which GW Pharma is first seeking Food and Drug Administration approval,"" Trbovich said.Zogenix plans to submit an application for low-dose fenfluramine with the FDA in the second half of 2018. Trbovich notes that the filing could come sooner depending on feedback from the FDA following this first Phase 3 study.The firm is also planning to start a Phase 3 study of low-dose fenfluramine to treat Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in the fourth quarter, Trbovich said.RELATED:How CVS Head Is Fighting The Opioid Addiction EpidemicMarijuana Investing Goes Wall Street: More Ties, Less Tie-DyeWhy This Biotech Is Jumping Today On Its Rival's Cannabis-Tied Drug

136,CVS,"Reports indicate that the drawn-out Rite Aid (RAD)-Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) merger may be edging toward fruition, sending Rite Aid shares soaring Monday.The pop in price has been linked to a CTFN article that reportedly cites antitrust lawyers and a former DOJ official, according to Seeking Alpha.X The CTFN story is behind a paywall, but StreetInsider quotes the article as saying that merger approval from the Federal Trade Commission is ""more likely than not.""The FTC's deadline to OK or block the merger is July 7.Rite Aid shares jumped 30% to 4.05 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day moving average for the first time since Jan. 20.

137,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) ended months of back and forth with regulators over its buyout of Rite Aid (RAD) by scrapping the deal Thursday and instead announcing a new one for just half of Rite Aid's stores.XWalgreens will pay $5.18 billion for 2,186 stores plus a $325 million termination fee to Rite Aid, which pulled out of a separate deal with Fred's (FRED), the pharmacy chain that would've received 865 Rite Aid's stores under the prior deal with Walgreens. Fred's will get a $25 million termination fee.Under the new deal, which is expected to close within six months, Walgreens sees the Rite Aid stores adding to adjusted earnings in the first year and creating $400 million in synergiesMeanwhile, Walgreens reported fiscal Q3 results that topped views. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.33 beat consensus forecasts by 2 cents, and sales of $30.1 billion topped estimates of $29.68 billion.The company raised the low end of its 2017 EPS outlook and now sees $4.98-$5.08, up from a prior view of $4.90-$5.08. Wall Street sees $5.00.Rite Aid also reported quarterly results, swinging to an adjusted Q1 loss of 5 cents a share, as revenue fell 4.9% to $7.8 billion. Same-store sales dropped 3.9%, with pharmacy sales down 5% and front-end sales down 1.5%.Walgreens shares closed up 1.7% at 78.37 in the stock market today after hitting 81.55 in the morning. Rite Aid sank 26.5% to 2.89, hitting their worst levels in nearly four years. Fred's collapsed 23% to 9.51. CVS Health (CVS) retreated 1.2%.The new deal follows nearly two years of will-they, won't-they drama surrounding the initial merger agreement, which was first announced in October 2015.More recently, Rite Aid shares vaulted 30% on Monday on a report that the Federal Trade Commission was ""more likely than not"" to approve the merger. But earlier this month, Rite Aid stock crashed on reports the FTC was preparing ""advice"" to block the merger with Walgreens.The FTC had until July 7 to approve or deny the merger. The combination would've fuse together the second and third largest drugstore chains to create a massive rival to CVS Health.Zacks, in a research note this month, said that Rite Aid has focused more on making over its wellness stores, which feature things like vision and diabetic diagnostic centers, and growing its clinical and pharmacy offerings.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens also face growing competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), which have broadened their pharmacy businesses, Zacks said.RELATED:Rite Aid Stock Just Had Its Best Gain In 20 Months As Walgreens Deadline NearsAre These Amazon's Next Five Targets?

138,CVS,"XShares of Rite-Aid (RAD) surged 12% on Monday, clocking their biggest jump since October 2015, when the drugstore chain's now-troubled merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was first announced.The reasons for the gains were unclear. They come amid questions over whether that merger will go through, and speculation over whether Amazon (AMZN) might jump into the pharmacy business and, potentially, try to acquire Rite Aid if the deal collapses.The speculation follows Amazon's announcement that it had agreed to buy Whole Foods (WFM), a deal that could redraw the retail landscape. Shares of Walgreens and CVS Health (CVS) retreated on the Amazon-Whole Foods announcement Friday. Both Walgreens and CVS sell a lot of groceries, and there's speculation that Amazon could eventually enter the pharmacy business in some fashion. Rite Aid edged higher on Friday.According to a StreetInsider post, among the factors that may have been driving Rite Aid shares higher Monday were Amazon's possible interest in the No. 3 U.S. drugstore operator, the fact that the FTC has yet to block the Walgreens takeover, and the possibility that Walgreens would fight the FTC if it did oppose the merger.The FTC has until July 7 to approve or block the merger.Rite Aid rose 12% to 3.36 in the stock market today, after hitting 3.49 intraday. Rite Aid is well below Walgreens' revised $6.50-$7-a-share deal price.Walgreens climbed 1.8% to 79.81 while CVS advanced 1.4%. Amazon climbed 0.8%, but well off intraday highs. Whole Foods rose 1.3% to 43.22, moving further above Amazon's $42-a-share deal price.Fred's (FRED), which has a deal to buy a large number of Rite Aid stores and other assets to try to win FTC approval for the merger, fell 2.1%.RELATED:Whole Foods Stock Signals Another Bidder Is Coming, But Who?Amazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, Eateries

139,CVS,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

140,CVS,"Shares of Rite Aid (RAD) crashed on reports that the Federal Trade Commission was preparing ""advice"" to block the drugstore chain's merger with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).The news was reported by Bloomberg, citing Capital Forum.Shares of Rite Aid sank 15% to 3 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest levels since August 2013. Walgreens dipped 0.6%. Rival CVS Health (CVS) edged up 1.6%, retaking its 50-day line.The report follows growing doubts from the government about the deal, which would combine the second and third largest drugstore chains, and its potential to harm competition.Walgreens had initially agreed to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to pharmacy chain Fred's (FRED), then upped its offer to 1,200 stores, after regulators didn't think the original number was enough. The company this year also cut its takeover price.Last month, Rite Aid and Walgreens said they had complied with the FTC's request for information about the potential merger, initiating a 60-day countdown for the agency to give the deal a thumbs up or thumbs down.Shares of Fred closed off 0.5% at 11.28 after falling intraday to a 2017 low of 10.60.RELATED:Rite Aid Finally Gets Some Good News As Walgreens Deal In Doubt

141,CVS,"Shares of Humana (HUM) have advanced 13% to a record high since its official Valentine's Day breakup with Aetna (AET), but new suitors could be lining up that could push the stock much higher, says JPMorgan.JPMorgan analyst Gerry Taylor isn't the first to speculate that Cigna (CI) could bid as much as $300 per share for Humana. Wells Fargo analysts said the same thing last week. What's interesting, though, is that Taylor sees a range of potential suitors that could extend beyond the usual managed-care industry suspects.IBD'S TAKE: Humana is ranked No. 8 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group based on earnings, sales, margin and stock performance. See which Medicaid-focused insurer is ranked No. 1 at IBD Stock Checkup.Taylor also sees pharmacy-benefit managers and drug stores as potential bidders because of the attractiveness of Humana's leading position in Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D markets.That might add CVS Health (CVS), the drugstore and pharmacy-benefit giant to the list of possible buyers. CVS Health's revenue has taken a hit from the loss of pharmacy contracts. After meeting with management, Taylor said he thinks Humana is open to integrating its business with a drugstore or pharmacy-benefit manager.Humana shares slipped 1.5% to 230.26. The stock is now back in buy range from a 220.59 buy point, though Thursday's heavy volume action isn't great.Cigna, which also saw its proposed takeover by Anthem (ANTM) collapse after courts blocked the deal on antitrust grounds and the two companies had a falling out, lost 1.2% to 166.51. Cigna hit a 52-week high Wednesday.CVS Health rose 0.4% to 78.45.RELATED:Amazon, P&G, Humana Get Price-Target Hikes; Under Armour Cut AgainCVS Earnings Top, But Pharmacy Sales, Guidance Less Impressive

142,CVS,"X Amazon (AMZN) is acquiring upscale grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) for $42 per share in an all-cash deal worth $13.7 billion, including the grocer's net debt, the companies announced Friday. The deal makes Amazon a huge player in the brick-and-mortar grocery business, sending shares of grocers and other big food sellers down sharply.Whole Foods Market will continue to operate stores under its brand, and CEO John Mackey will stay on in the top spot, according to the official statement from Amazon. The company's headquarters will remain in Austin, Texas.""This partnership presents an opportunity to maximize value for Whole Foods Market's shareholders, while at the same time extending our mission and bringing the highest quality, experience, convenience and innovation to our customers,"" said Mackey.Amazon shares rose 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods shares rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above the offer price. Several big Whole Foods investors said Amazon's bid was too low and looked for another buyer to swoop in.The deal is expected to close in the latter half of the year.Grocery-store operators Kroger (KR) and Albertsons were other names speculated to be mulling a bid.Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake in Whole Foods in April, calling shares ""undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity,"" and was said to be nudging the grocer toward the exploration of a sale.Amazon already controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart (WMT), including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March 2016 analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen.IBD's TAKE: As we said a year ago, Amazon's next big growth play would surprise you. Even before the Whole Foods acquisition, Cowen estimated that Amazon's grocery volume would rocket to $23.2 billion five years from now, up from an estimated $8.7 billion in 2016.Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer, is a distant second with a 9% market share. Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.Kroger, which crashed 19% Thursday after slashing its full-year profit guidance, tumbled 9.2% on Friday, hitting a three-year low. Grocery sellers have come under heavy pressure as Amazon and Wal-Mart (WMT) have helped suppress prices.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a natural foods rival to Whole Foods, fell 6.3% after losing more than 9% on Thursday. Sprouts said Thursday that it has been ""significantly impacted by deflation.""Wal-Mart shares fell 4.6%, gapping below its 50-day moving average. Wal-Mart has been stepping up its online efforts, as well as introducing curbside online grocery order pick up and an automated grocery store kiosk.Grocery rival SuperValu (SVU) and Target (TGT), another big grocery seller, were selling off, down 14% and 5%, respectively.

Core prices, stripping out volatile food and energy categories, rose 0.2%, but the annual gain backtracked to 1.7%, lowest since May 2015.May retail sales slid 0.3% — overall and excluding the stalling auto sector — defying expectations of mild gains. Sales at nonstore retailers led by Amazon (AMZN) continued to be the standout category, rising 10.2% from a year ago as department store sales slid 3.7%.Meanwhile, industrial production was weak in May, but the Philly Fed and New York Fed reported stronger-than-expected regional manufacturing activity in June.May housing starts unexpectedly fell, putting further pressure on housing stocks that had been moving to new highs.U.S. crude futures fell 2.4% to $44.74 a barrel, hitting seven-month lows, amid more evidence that a global supply glut continues despite the OPEC production cut. The International Energy Agency said crude stockpiles jumped by 18.6 million barrels in OECD countries in April, pushing the five year average higher than before OPEC's production deal in November.

Domestic production rose to 9.33 million barrels per day up from 9.318 million barrels.General Electric (GE) said health care chief John Flannery will take over from current CEO Jeff Immelt on Aug. 1. Immelt pivoted the industrial conglomerate from financial services back to its engineering roots while sharpening its technology focus, but GE stock has fallen roughly 30% since he took over in 2001. General Electric indicated its digital push will continue under Flannery. The Dow component also announced more executive changes later in the week, including the exit of power unit veteran Steve Bolze. That spurred talk of a potential brain drain – similar to exits by losing CEO candidates when Immelt was named CEO in 2000, replacing Jack Welch. GE shares jumped 3.6% Monday.Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick will take an indefinite leave of absence following an independent review of allegations against the ride-hailing company of harassment, discrimination and an aggressive culture. The investigation by Eric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general, led to 47 recommendations and creating a board oversight committee. During an all-staff meeting to discuss how Uber plans to transform itself, director David Bonderman made a comment seen as offensive to women, leading to his resignation.Shares of Dow components Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK) diverged Monday on news stemming from trials.

Sources told Bloomberg that the FTC has worried about Fred's ability to still compete if Walgreens actually buys Rite Aid.Walgreens originally planned to pay $9 a share for Rite, but cut that to $6.50-$7 earlier this year, with the specific price based on how many Rite Aid stores were sold to win FTC approval.Walgreens was up 0.2% to 85.98 on the stock market today. Rite Aid edged up 2 cents to 4.07.

146,CVS,"X President Trump's political woes sent the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite tumbling, but not for long. But Alibaba (BABA) and other China internet stocks rallied on generally upbeat reports. Dow retailers Wal-Mart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) had strong results, but many other retailers are struggling. Dow tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) sold off on its weak guidance.An ongoing stream of damaging media reports took their toll on President Trump, raising concerns that he'll be too distracted or too weak to push tax cuts through this year, if at all. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.6%. But stocks slashed losses on Thursday and Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 off 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.6%. Credit Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and the other FANG+ stocks, along with Alibaba (BABA) and other Chinese internets.Alibaba's Q1 EPS rose 37% to 63 cents, but missed the consensus by 3 cents as tax expenses and spending on its entertainment and cloud computing businesses ramped up. Revenue jumped 60% to $5.61 billion, beating views. The Chinese e-commerce giant also OK'd a $6 billion buyback. Shares rose 0.5% Thursday after falling 5% early, then rose to a record high on Friday.

Comps skidded 1.3% but better than the expected 3.7% tumble. Shares rose Wednesday but finished the week up just 0.4%, still close to five-year lows. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Q1 profit unexpectedly ticked up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street estimates for a 2% dip, though 1.4% sales growth to $117.54 billion just missed. Still, U.S. same-store sales rose, unlike Target and many other retailers. The megastore credited organic growth at Walmart.com for its 63% boost in U.S. online sales, although it also acquired two e-commerce properties, Moosejaw and ModCloth, during the quarter. Wal-Mart shares rose 4.1% to a two-year best.Cisco Systems (CSCO) adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 5% to 60 cents, beating views by 2 cents. Revenue fell 1% to $11.94 billion, above estimates but the sixth straight year-over-year decline as the networking giant transitions from sluggish switch and router hardware to software and security. Current-quarter revenue guidance was far short of forecasts, in part because of concerns that President Trump's economic and tax agenda has stalled.Cisco shares fell 6.7% for the week.Home Depot (HD) reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates, making it one of the few retailers that isn't cracking under the weight of e-commerce, discounts, discounters, too many stores and not enough traffic.

Comps grew 3%. But Q2 profit guidance missed, and full-year EPS outlook was a little light.

Ross rose Friday, paring its week loss to 2%.Computer-aided design software firm Autodesk (ADSK) saw its stock surge 14.7% to record levels Friday after it beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30.

147,CVS,"As we move through May, the old Wall Street adage ""Sell in May and go away"" comes to mind, a reminder that stocks historically tend to underperform during the May-to-October period.But does that mean ETF investors should liquidate their holdings, take the summer (and a few extra months) off, and resume buying stocks in November?That's one investment strategy. But, as with most old sayings, it doesn't have to be taken literally. Even if the market's return tends to be bigger in the November-April period, investors sitting out the other six months miss out on intermediate rallies and on the power of reinvesting dividends and compounding returns.That's why Oliver Pursche, chief executive of Bruderman Brothers and Bruderman Asset Management, doesn't think the adage proves advantageous for most investors.""It is at best unreliable and inconsistent and amounts to market timing,"" he told IBD. ""When taking into account possible tax consequences, missed dividends and trading commission, the math doesn't bear out.""But Pursche, who oversees the New York-based firm's investment banking and wealth management divisions, thinks May is a good time for investors to reassess their portfolios.Click Here To See A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Bruderman Asset Management is a registered investment advisor (RIA) with more than $1 billion in assets under management.Here are Pursche's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:""Sell in May and walk away"" is not a strategy we feel is particularly smart or beneficial to investors. However, as we enter the summer months and the second half of the year, there is a need for investors to revisit their investment thesis and potentially reallocate their portfolios. After a solid double-digit run by the S&P 500 since Mr. Trump was elected president, a portfolio risk assessment is certainly due. Investors should expect a continuation of the current positive sentiment, even though the Trump administration is unlikely to pass any major legislation, in particular tax reform. Nonetheless, there are several key factors that are benefiting our economy and consequently, corporate earnings.The United States economy, as well as the world as a whole, is benefiting from a cyclical rebound in growth and consumer demand that is helping drive corporate earnings higher, and could help boost U.S. GDP growth by 4% or more in the second quarter. One phenomenon that has been interesting to observe in the current earnings cycle is the strength of earnings coming from outside the United States. Of the companies within the S&P 500 that have reported earnings so far, those companies that earn more than 50% of their revenues offshore have seen EPS growth of nearly 20%, while companies that derive all of their earnings domestically are experiencing low- to middle-single-digit EPS growth.One last note: Expect a correction at some point, but don't let that change your long-term investment strategy. The ETFs named above should perform well if the current environment persists through the end of the year and into 2018, as we expect it to.RELATED:This ETF Is Knocking The 'Socks' Off The Tech Sector

148,CVS,"XDrugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD) reported fiscal fourth-quarter results on Tuesday that topped views, while its takeover by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) remains in doubt.Estimates: Wall Street expected a 2-cent per-share loss, down from a profit of 6 cents a share a year ago. Revenue was seen as roughly flat, at $8.265 billion.Results: Rite Aid reported break-even results on an adjusted basis, with revenue up 3.3% to $8.5 billion. Same-store sales slid 3%.Stock: Shares climbed 6.4% to 3.97 on the stock market today after hitting a 3-1/2-year low on Monday. Walgreens Boots Alliance rose nearly 2%, moving above its 50-day line.Fred's (FRED) climbed 4.6%, after naming new board members late Monday. CVS Health (CVS) rose 2.65%, due to CVS' pharmacy benefits manager side possibly benefiting from Express Scripts (ESRX) likely to lose Anthem (ANTM) as a key customer.IBD'S TAKE: Deutsche Bank believes that Rite Aid's stock could dive more than 50% if Rite Aid's merger with Walgreens doesn't go through.Walgreens originally agreed to pay $9 per share for Rite Aid in 2015 in a deal worth $9.4 billion at the time. It came amid a wave of health-industry moves to consolidate and keep expenses in check as the Affordable Care Act brought insurance to more people.When the agreement was struck, Bloomberg noted that Walgreens would modernize Rite Aid's stores and gear them more toward beauty and wellness, while Walgreens would gain access to the drug-benefit management market for employers and insurers where CVS Health competes.To pass antitrust muster, Walgreens planned to sell 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's but that still wasn't enough to ease regulators' concerns that that tie-up could hurt competition.So earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its takeover to $6.50-$7, with the new price dependent on how many stores Rite Aid had to divest, as the Federal Trade Commission reportedly considered blocking the deal.The potential number of Rite Aid stores that could be sold has since been bumped up to as many as 1,200. But regulators' doubts have grown about Fred's ability to absorb that many stores.Early this month, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said he was ""still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion. But there is no doubt that the process of getting clear for the transaction is taking longer than we expected.""Last week, Bloomberg, citing a report from the trade publication Capitol Forum, said that the Federal Trade Commission was considering suing to block Walgreens' attempt to buy the company.An merger expiration extension suggests Walgreens will keep fighting to win over the FTC, perhaps after President Trump gets new commissioners to fill empty seats.RELATED:Walgreens CEO On Rite Aid: 'I Am Still Positive On This Deal'New Walgreens Report Sends Rite Aid Stock Plunging Again

Revenue is expected to be essentially flat at $8.265 billion.Shares of Rite Aid fell 1.8% to 3.73 the stock market today, continuing to stray further from the original deal price. Earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its takeover price from $9 a share to $6.50-$7, with the new price dependent on how many stores Rite Aid had to divest. Rival CVS Health (CVS) edged up 1% to 80.05.Rite Aid stock has seen an avalanche of selling as the merger deal with Walgreens, first agreed to in 2015, hit hurdle after hurdle. The subject seems likely to come up when Rite Aid reports.Early this month, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said he was ""still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion. But there is no doubt that the process of getting clear for the transaction is taking longer than we expected.""IBD'S TAKE: Deutsche Bank believes that Rite Aid's stock could dive more than 50% if Rite Aid's merger with Walgreens doesn't go through. Last week, Bloomberg, citing a report from the trade publication Capitol Forum, said that the Federal Trade Commission was considering suing to block Walgreens' attempt to buy the company.Shares of Rite Aid sank on the news, as did those of discounter Fred's (FRED), which is set to buy up to 1,200 Rite Aid stores. That divestiture, intended to appease regulators worried that the size of the combined company would harm competition, could roughly triple Fred's store count.Walgreens' initial plans to sell 865 stores to Fred's weren't enough for the FTC. Walgreens and Rite Aid in January also cut the per-share price of the deal, whose deadline has been pushed back as the companies work with regulators.Meanwhile, Rite Aid also faces competition as its industry consolidates, Zacks noted.Shares of Walgreens rose 0.3%; Fred's climbed 4.1%.RELATED:Rite Aid Rises As Trump Names Acting FTC Chief

155,CVS,"Just as an ace baseball pitcher mixes his throws, top mutual fund managers vary their investments. Managers of Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund are mingling semiconductor stocks with biotech stocks, online travel agencies and a Chinese fast-food chain, all to good effect. That's been a benefit to investors with retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $3.3 billion fund is working its way back toward its multiyear top-notch outperformance. This year going into Wednesday, the fund's 8.97% gain topped 62% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the 5.75% advance by the S&P 500.That's an improvement over its showing during the past 12 months, when the fund outpaced just 54% of its direct rivals with a nonetheless decent 15.49% rise. So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

The stock has slid over 44% in 2017.Earlier this year, Walgreens slashed its takeover price from $9 a share to $6.50-$7, with the new price dependent on how many stores Rite Aid had to divest.Bloomberg reported on Friday that Walgreens was close to hammering out a new agreement, one that would likely include the sale of more than the previously agreed-upon 865 Rite Aid stores to smaller drugstore chain Fred's (FRED).Walgreens shares fell 1.7% to 83.21, undercutting the 50-day moving average.

161,CVS,"After missing Friday's merger deadline, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) are extending their agreement end date to July 31, slashing the takeover price and changing other terms in a bid to get regulatory approval.Walgreens will now pay a minimum of $6.50 per share and a maximum of $7 a share, according to a joint press release, depending on how many Rite Aid stores are to be divested in order to pass regulatory muster. The original deal was worth $9 per share.Under the new terms, Walgreens will sell up to 1,200 Rite Aid stores and certain other assets, if needed, marking a 200 store increase from the original agreement. The drugstore giant will acquire Rite Aid for $7 a share if 1,000 or fewer stores must be sold; it will pay $6.50 a share if it winds up having to divest 1,200 stores.

162,CVS,"Rite Aid (RAD) erased steep intraday losses to turn slightly positive Friday on a report that private-equity firm Cerberus could step in as a white knight to help save the $9.4 billion takeover deal by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Cerberus is open to buying the 865 stores that Rite Aid planned to sell to smaller rival Fred's (FRED) to allay antitrust concerns, the New York Post reported. Cerberus had bid for those stores last year via its Albertsons grocery store chain, the Post said, but Walgreens and Rite Aid feared that the Federal Trade Commission would not like a private equity buyer. But one reason why the FTC reportedly has been reluctant to approve the deal is over concerns that Fred's would not be viable competitor.The Post also cited sources that the FTC is not inclined to block the deal.The reports comes as the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal officially expires today. Most analysts have expected Walgreens and Rite Aid to extend the $9-a-share merger deal. The drugstore giants already extended their original expiration date from Oct. 27 to Jan. 27.Rite Aid rose 2.2% to 6.93 on the stock market today. The stock fell nearly 8% intraday to 6.26, the lowest since the Walgreens-Rite Aid deal was announced in October 2015.Walgreens shares climbed 0.3% to 81.50.Fred's, which could be left in the cold if it loses the Rite Aid store deal, sank 2.35% to 14.11, closing just above its 50-day line. Fred's has shed one third of its value since spiking 81% on Dec. 20, when the Rite Aid deal was announced.IBD'S TAKE: While drug store investors are hoping for the Trump administration to approve Walgreens-Rite Aid deal, Target, Wal-Mart and Macy's are hitting new lows on Trump hints about a border tax that could sock retailers.On Thursday, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said at the annual shareholders meeting that his company ""actively engaged in dialogue with the FTC."" He also reportedly said that Walgreens is still ""actively in discussions"" with Rite Aid to make the deal work.If the deal ultimately falls apart, Walgreens would have to pay a breakup fee of $325 million, or $650 million under certain circumstances.The FTC has two vacancies, soon to be three, on the five-person body.

169,CVS,"A lukewarm shopping environment hasn't put a blemish on the beauty industry, which has been the fastest-growing retail segment for the last three years, according to NPD Group.Specialty players Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH-owned Sephora are flourishing — and value cosmetics brand and recent issue e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) appears poised to take advantage of the on-fire trend.E.l.f., which sells its wares mostly via CVS (CVS), Target (TGT), Ulta Beauty and other national retailers, went public at 17 in late September, rising roughly 70% to about 29 a share as of Wednesday.In an email Q&A with Investor's Business Daily, e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin outlined his approach to engagement, the significance of its small but growing brick-and-mortar presence, and the company's greatest growth opportunities in 2017.IBD: Social media — Instagram in particular — has become a hot spot for beauty enthusiasts. Following e.l.f.'s Beauty Scape activation, how does social media play into your engagement strategy in 2017, and how do you see that impacting the new loyalty program?Amin: Our approach to engage consumers is deeply rooted in social media and digital platforms, and will continue to be a main pillar of our engagement strategy. We were extremely pleased with the outcome of our e.l.f. Beauty Scape activation, which delivered a 25% increase in Instagram followers and reached a combined community of 53 million across social media platforms. We believe we can further build awareness and deepen engagement with our consumers in different ways, including our new Beauty Squad loyalty program. We enrolled 80,000 consumers in just the first six weeks and look forward to continuing to expand the program as we strengthen our CRM capabilities and deliver more fun, relevant content for our consumers.IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""IBD: You've previously said that the majority of growth will be driven by your presence in retailers such as Target and CVS? How do you see the sales mix of e.l.f. direct-channel, third-party e-commerce (such as Amazon) and national retailers shifting over the next few years, if at all?Amin: We expect the U.S. to be the largest source of our growth over the next few years as we grow space allocation with existing retailers, increase new customers and grow our direct-to-consumer business through elfcosmetics.com and e.l.f. stores. The majority of our growth will be driven by national retailers, given the white space that we see here in existing doors as well as new doors. That being said, our direct channel plays an incredibly important role in terms of validating our innovation and engaging with our consumers, and we believe there is significant room to grow here as well.IBD: There are fewer than 20 stand-alone e.l.f. brick-and-mortar retail locations. What's the significance of building out a brick-and-mortar presence?Amin: In Q3 of 2016, we opened seven e.l.f. stores, to bring our total to 15, including our first California stores, with two locations in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Our stores showcase a broad assortment of e.l.f. products, create an environment dedicated to play beautifully, and allow us to test and validate new products. We believe our stores provide a great opportunity for us to connect with our consumers in an experiential format, and drive both awareness and engagement.IBD: Cosmetic and skin care products are still selling well, even as other areas of retail have struggled. Do you see interest in beauty peaking any time soon?Amin: We believe that the cosmetics category is highly attractive given its scale, growth dynamics and consumer demand trends. And, given the importance of cosmetics in a woman's daily regimen and the availability of products across price points, the category has demonstrated resiliency through economic cycles. We expect cosmetics to continue to be among the fastest growing and most consistent consumer categories.IBD: What's the biggest area of growth and opportunity for e.l.f. in 2017?Amin: We believe we are in the early innings of growth as we continue to make progress on our four key strategies: Build a great brand, lead innovation, expand brand penetration and drive world-class operations. We continue to see momentum in both our direct channels and leading national retailers, as well as strong operational results and remain excited about our business as we head into 2017.RELATED:How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of RetailRetailers Face 2017 'Reckoning,' More 'Sad Malls' As Amazon Keeps BoomingWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Domino's CEO Doyle On Netflix, Trump And Pizza's 'Jetsons' Future

170,CVS,"Amazon.com (AMZN) isn't attending the annual ICR Conference in Orlando, Fla., but its presence was arguably felt in one way or another Tuesday morning.With holiday retail figures out — some tremendously disappointing to investors, others less so — and Amazon crowned the clear winner of Christmas by Slice Intelligence, the conference presents an opportunity to reflect on a modern shopping landscape pockmarked by growing online sales and subdued mall traffic.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) management said it was ""relatively happy"" with its real estate portfolio, calling it ""pretty healthy"" and noting that it doesn't feel particularly hurt by Macy's (M) recent announcement to close dozens of locations, despite having stores in those same areas.But an outperforming digital channel could prompt store closures anyway.""We're looking at things like digital penetration to brick-and-mortar sales within that region,"" said one executive at the conference. ""You know, if a store's in a C-mall location, for instance, and although we're still making money (but) we're seeing digital having a much higher penetration — you know, we might decide to close that store. ""He then said that the company ""will definitely see a decrease in our U.S.-based real estate portfolio over the ongoing years, particularly as traffic gets more challenged in some of the C(-mall) locations.""American Eagle shares were up 1.7% at 15.22 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today. Amazon dipped 0.15%.Separately, Lululemon (LULU) CEO Laurent Potdevin told CNBC following his presentation that the upscale yogawear maker is being targeted in its approach.""When you think about traffic, we're not going after every bit of traffic; we're really focused on getting highly qualified traffic,"" said Potdevin on CNBC. ""If you'd been in our stores during the holiday season, they were really, really busy. And our conversion was outstanding, both in-store and online.""What about Amazon moving in on the apparel space with activewear of its own?""When you have more competitors, you have a bigger market, and it's an opportunity,"" said Potdevin in response. ""I'd rather have more competitors than no competitors. . . It really validates the strength of the market.""Lululemon shares rallied 3% to 70.26 as they work on a cup-with-handle base with a 72.80 buy point.And then there's beauty, which has thus far been a market that's shown relative immunity to Amazon's appetite for brick-and-mortar retailers' business.For e.l.f. beauty (ELF) — which began as an e-commerce business — part of that advantage comes in the form of speed-to-market. It takes the low-cost makeup company as little as 20 weeks to bring a product to market, while larger, slower-moving players can take up to two years to launch product, according to e.l.f. executives at the conference.""We've been able to grow regardless of economic cycle,"" said e.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin.E.l.f. is carried in retailers like Target (TGT), Wal-Mart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS). With only a handful of stand-alone stores, it is expanding its reach via in-store partnerships with existing retail heavyweights.""We see Ulta (ULTA) and Walgreens (WBA) as natural partners and expect a possible announcement in the next 60-90 days,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink following the presentation.""The company's trend identification, development speed, and commitment to newness are both averaging up the gross margin and driving working capital utility, but are also setting the brand apart at retail from a merchandising, messaging, and engagement perspective.""Shares of e.l.f. were down 1.6% at 28.60, near the low of a flat base with a 32.64 entry.

171,CVS,"Rite Aid (RAD) said Thursday that the prolonged merger process with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) created a ""difficult operating environment"" as third-quarter results missed forecasts.But the drugstore chain expects the $9.4 billion deal to close early next year, echoing what Walgreens said in October, when it pushed back expectations for completion this year as the companies try to ward off regulatory concerns.Rite Aid's earnings per share tumbled 83% to 1 cent, missing analyst views for a decrease to 4 cents. Revenue edged down 0.8% to $8.089 billion, below estimates for $8.227 billion.Same-store sales fell 3.4%, led by a 4.7% decrease in pharmacy sales, which were hit by new generic introductions. Front-end sales fell 0.4%. Same-store prescriptions filled fell 2.4%.""Reimbursement rates remain our largest challenge and we expect that to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year,"" CEO John Standley said in Rite Aid's earnings release.""Moving forward,"" he continued, ""we will remain focused on improving the health of our patients through clinical services like immunizations and medication adherence, converting additional stores to our highly successful Wellness format and working as a team to deliver a consistently outstanding experience to our customers.""Rite Aid's stock dipped 3 cents to 8.44 in the stock market today. Shares cleared a cup-with-handle case at the end of last month and have trended above their 50-day and 200-day lines since. Walgreens dropped 1.8%, still holding above both those key tests of investor support. Rival CVS Health (CVS) eased 1.3%.IBD'S TAKE: As Rite Aid and Walgreens work to get their planned merger approved, elsewhere in the health industry, health care stocks have surged since the election.Rite Aid's results come two days after the company and Walgreens announced that they had agreed to sell 865 Rite Aid stores and other assets to Fred's (FRED), a struggling pharmacy chain, for $950 million in cash. The plan to sell off the Rite Aid stores was intended to address antitrust concerns about the merger raised by the Federal Trade Commission.The deal with Fred's is contingent on the approval from the Federal Trade Commission and completion of the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger. Walgreens first said that it would buy Rite Aid in October last year and has faced regulatory concerns since.The sale would more than double the size of Fred's, which currently operates 647 locations, and make the company the third largest U.S. drugstore chain, Fred's said in a release. Fred's said it expects the deal to close during the first half of next year if it is approved.Fred's shares spiked 81% higher on the announcement, but retreated 4.8% on Thursday.However, Fred's popped more than 6% in late trading to 20.61 after activist fund Alden Global Capital disclosed that it bought a further 5.533 million shares from Dec. 20-22, for a total stake of 9.275 million shares, or a 24.8%. RELATED:Walgreens Signals FTC OK For Rite Aid Deal Near; Stock Breaks Out
"
172,CVS,"Mylan (MYL) made a fortune, and stirred controversy, while getting EpiPen allergy shots stocked in schools across America.Now the drugmaker wants to sell EpiPens to restaurants, sports venues and potentially even Boy Scout troops — by setting up its own pharmacy to cut out middlemen and by lobbying for new laws that could expand sales of its biggest product.The plan, obtained by Bloomberg News through public records requests, would bypass small-town pharmacists and chains like CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) and let Mylan sell the drug directly to public places. The company is looking to revitalize EpiPen sales that began slumping last summer, when Congress questioned Mylan over EpiPen's sixfold price increase since 2007.""It's extremely smart,"" said Mark Baum, founder and chief executive of San Diego-based Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (IMMY), which supplies drugs directly to patients. ""There's no rationale for other middlemen getting in the way. That's just driving up the cost to customers.""Sales of EpiPens fell in the third quarter as the $600 price tag sparked a furor that included questioning of Mylan CEO Heather Bresch by a congressional committee. Since mid-August, shares have fallen about 20%. Last month, Mylan said it would cut fewer than 10% of its employees.Mylan declined requests for interviews with executives, but Bresch has made no secret of its strategy to push for state laws to allow so-called entity prescriptions — drugs sold to places rather than people.""We are continuing to open up new markets, new access with public entity legislation that would allow restaurants and hotels and really anywhere you are congregating, there should be access to an EpiPen,"" Bresch said at a September 2015 conference.In October, Mylan said it reached a $465 million settlement with the U.S. government over accusations that it overcharged the Medicaid program by classifying the EpiPen as generic, instead of a brand-name drug, in order to pay lower discounts.Mylan's new business plan could revolutionize an industry whose layers of middlemen, critics say, cost customers money. The country's more than 600,000 eating and drinking establishments, plus thousands more sports venues, amusement parks and movie theaters, could be a gold mine for Mylan.More than 15 million Americans have food allergies, and a severe reaction sends a patient to the emergency room about every three minutes, according to Food Allergy Research & Education.In 2015, EpiPens brought in $912 million with an operating profit of $498 million, Mylan said in a regulatory filing. If half of America's restaurants bought an EpiPen two-pack each year at a full price of $608, Mylan would generate about $180 million more in annual sales. Last month, the company began selling an authorized generic two-pack for $300.EpiPens, which deliver shots of epinephrine that can stop severe reactions to bee stings and food such as peanuts and shellfish, have been provided free to 67,000 U.S. schools, Mylan said. Schools can also buy additional EpiPens at a discount.Laws in 48 states allow schools to stock and administer epinephrine injectors. Mylan spent about $4 million in 2012 and 2013 to help get federal legislation passed to encourage states to stock the devices in schools, according to lobbying disclosure forms filed with the U.S. House of Representatives.Now the company is trying to replicate that campaign. Since 2013, Mylan has funneled thousands in campaign contributions to state lawmakers, according to campaign finance disclosures and documents posted on Mylan's website.Already, at least 30 states permit entity prescriptions beyond schools. Before Mylan's involvement, no states had enacted such legislation, the company website says.Ohio State Representative Christina Hagan, who sponsored a bill there, received a $1,000 donation from Mylan last year. Hagan said working as a waitress taught her the gravity of food allergies.The Republican said she was unaware of Mylan's campaign contribution. The bill was unanimously approved.Frank Minear, owner of Frank's Family Restaurant in Alliance, Ohio, said he plans to buy an EpiPen because he has shellfish and items containing peanuts on the menu.While most severe allergic reactions happen at home, 6% occur at restaurants, according to a 2014 study.""I look forward to being one of the first restaurants in Stark County to supply the EpiPen in case it's needed,"" Minear said. ""It's a lifesaving thing.""Mylan said its pharmacy, Mylan Health Management, would be used to distribute EpiPens only to entities and not to individuals, according to the company's pharmacy license applications obtained by Bloomberg News. Mylan first disclosed the existence of the unit in a securities filing last year, without providing any details, and Umer Raffat, an analyst at Evercore ISI, reported on it in October. The pharmacy was created for ""future opportunities"" and isn't operating, Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in an email.Prescriptions to restaurants and other entities would likely be cash purchases, so Mylan wouldn't have to pay rebates to drug-benefit managers, like it does for prescriptions covered by insurance.And with its own pharmacy, Mylan could keep the entity prescriptions from migrating to cheaper generic competitors that might emerge in the future. Its website describes a new ""Mylan On Location"" program to help businesses ""offer immediate care in emergency situations.""Mylan might save $40 to $55 in pharmacy and distributor fees on each $600 EpiPen prescription, according to Michael Rea, CEO of Overland Park, Kansas-based Rx Savings Solutions.By cutting out middlemen, Mylan ""can offer an EpiPen for $200 or $250, give the market a $350 discount, and make the exact same profit,"" Rea said.Mylan's approach could backfire, said George Sillup, chairman of pharmaceutical and health care marketing at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. Someone without proper training ""could inflict some harm or injury,"" he said.Training requirements vary by state. The American Red Cross offers a 30-minute online course for $20.Pharmacist Brad Arthur, who owns two drugstores in Buffalo, N.Y., and is a past president of the National Community Pharmacists Association, said he would applaud the program despite its threat to his livelihood.""It's this kind of disruption in the pharmaceutical pricing model that we're ripe for,"" Arthur said.

"
174,CVS,"The rate of inflation remains below 2%, but you wouldn't know that looking at rising health care costs. Health insurance premiums, in particular, are seeing dramatic increases. What can the average person do to cut costs and get the best coverage for the least amount of money?The best and most obvious solution is to stay healthy. Take better care of yourself through preventive care. Evaluate your lifestyle, what you eat, drink and do. Most people overlook this, but the more you invest in your health by making smart choices through nutrition and exercise, the less you will need health care services now and in the future. Keeping your body in good shape will end up saving you dollars.But no matter how healthy you are, you still need health insurance — and affordability is a real issue. If you don't have health insurance, the first thing to do is enroll in ObamaCare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act. Even though ObamaCare faces an uncertain future under the new president, if you're enrolled before any legislative changes, at least you will be grandfathered into the program.On ObamaCare your premiums are capped as a percentage of your income. If your household income is one to four times the federal poverty level (FPL) of $11,800 for an individual and $23,400 for a family of four, you may be eligible for a premium tax credit. In 2017, 400% the FPL for an individual will be $47,520 and $97,200 for a family of four.The best way to save money on your health insurance coverage is to get it through an employer. But if you have to get coverage as an individual, you are constrained by the options available in your state. When you evaluate plans, premiums and copays are offsets. That is, the more you pay in premiums, the less you pay in copays. The less you pay in premiums, the more you pay in copays.""If you're young, take the lower premium and the higher copay,"" said Chris Orestis, the chief executive officer of Life Care Funding, a national company based in Portland, Maine, that works with families to help them pay for long-term care services, and the author of ""A Survival Guide to Aging."" ""If you're older or you have a family and you anticipate going to a doctor regularly, you should pay a higher premium because you want a lower copay if you're a regular consumer of health care services.""But even people who get their coverage through their jobs are seeing their deductibles and copays rising. Some even find insurance companies saying that instead of asking patients to pay $20 to go to the doctor, they now need to pay 20% of the bill.""There are limited things you can do,"" said Paul Fronstin, the director of health research for the Employees Benefit Research Institute. ""Sometimes you have to weigh whether to skip a service. Ask more questions. Is this service really needed? Is this drug really needed? Are there coupons for this drug? Coupons are a big thing.""Fronstin suggests if you have a large deductible, you can try to negotiate with a doctor. He may give a discount if you pay cash.""If you have a $3,000 deductible and you owe the doctor $1,000, she may write some of it off,"" said Fronstin. ""It depends on the doctor. Ask the doctor to waive a facility fee. Don't be shy. You might not get it, but it doesn't hurt to ask.""Fronstin also suggests asking if certain procedures, such as an endoscopy, might be cheaper in an outpatient facility than in a hospital.""None of this is necessarily easy, but there are options."" he said. ""The possibilities exist.""Laurie Kamhi, managing director and partner of LCK Wealth Management in New York, notes that people in high-deductible health plans can save for qualified medical expenses on a tax-free basis in health savings accounts. These are similar to the flexible spending accounts offered by companies in that money is saved on a pretax basis. The big difference is the money doesn't have to be spent each year. It can be accumulated to pay for health care costs years in the future.Kamhi also says people need to be aware that some health insurers are now restricting consumers' choice of pharmacies to cut costs and will not reimburse you if you buy from certain retailers or prescription mail-order services.

177,CVS,"If President-elect Trump wants to crack down on drug pricing, he might start with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), short-seller Citron Research suggested Thursday on Twitter (TWTR).Citron called Express Scripts the ""Philidor of the pharma industry,"" referring to the specialty pharmacy that Bloomberg reported last year was said to have changed doctors' orders to boost reimbursements from insurers and juice sales for Valeant Pharamacueticals (VRX), which last year said it was cutting ties with Philidor.Express Scripts, along with CVS Health (CVS) last year also cut Philidor from their networks.In an email to IBD, a spokesman for Express Scripts, pointed to that decision in response to Citron's comments, saying that ""we're nothing like Philidor. As you may recall, we removed Philidor from our network more than a year ago.""The company added that, while it hadn't seen any report from Citron, Express Scripts was ""a market force that uniquely puts medicine within reach by driving down cost of care and improving health outcomes.""The remarks from Citron, below, come after Time this week published a story on Trump in which he said that he was ""going to bring down drug prices,"" adding, ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""$ESRX is Philidor of the pharma industry. @therealdonaldtrump promises to fix drug pricing?

178,CVS,"Payers like Anthem (ANTM), Humana (HUM) and United Healthcare (UNH) are either broadly denying or in UNH's case restricting coverage of Sarepta Therapies' (SRPT) FDA-approved Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug, Jefferies analyst Gena Wang said Wednesday.Wang slashed her price target on Sarepta Therapies stock to 32 from 46. She has a hold rating on Sarepta stock, which crashed 5.8% to close at 29.98 on Wednesday. Shares are down 17% this year and have traded under their 50-day moving average since late October.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval to Sarepta's Exondys 51 in September. The drug targets 13% of the DMD population with confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene amenable to exon 51 skipping.But the drug is costly. Sarepta estimates average annual cost at about $300,000 per patient. The majority of patients would be covered by Medicaid and benefit from a 23.1% discount. Private plans would likely get the same discount, Wang said.""There appears to be no legal consequence, according to KOLs (key opinion leaders) for payers (Medicaid and private) to restrict/deny coverage, citing clinical benefit as No. 1 criteria for coverage decisions and FDA approval status as secondary,"" she wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Sarepta might be diving, but fellow biotech Regeneron has a bright future ahead on eczema drug dupilumab, an analyst said Tuesday. What takeaways are there for the broader biotech sector. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the bigger picture.Outside the Medicaid and private arenas, though, Wang says three of five national and eight of 15 regional managed care organizations (MCOs) have said they would largely deny coverage of Exondys 51.Anthem denies coverage of Exondys 51, saying the drug ""failed to show it improves health outcomes."" Humana has said it would cover Exondys 51 on ambulatory patients provided they remain able to walk. The drug will be approved every six months or as determined through clinical review.Wang notes that it's ""largely unprecendented"" for an FDA-approved drug to be denied or restricted.Aetna (AET) requires the drug be initiated before age 14 and patients be able to average a six-minute walking distance.United Healthcare is mostly unrestricted, but will only cover the drug for the initial four weeks and likely require monitoring after the first month, Wang said.Only certain Cigna (CI) plans cover Exondys 51, she wrote. CVS Health's (CVS) Caremark would cover the drug for 12 months, but then look for improvement in dystrophin levels or a six-minute walking distance before renewal. Express Scripts (ESRX) hasn't disclosed its plans for Exondys 51.Most pediatric hospitals and clinics administering Exondys 51 would be eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, Wang said. Home infusion could potentially cut down on costs, but Wang sees that as a long shot outside of private insurance plans.Editor's Note: Clarifies first paragraph to note the United Healthcare restricts, but does not deny, coverage of the Sarepta DMD drug.

179,CVS,"High expectations got the better of Ulta Beauty (ULTA) last quarter, despite solid results and bumped-up guidance. Could that happen to the specialty beauty retailer again, even if its third-quarter results shine late Thursday?As of Monday, Wall Street analysts are anticipating per-share profit to rise 23% to $1.37 a share on 22% revenue growth to $1.11 billion.Cosmetics and skin care are retail standouts. Specialty shops Ulta and LVMH-owned Sephora have been riding the beauty trends, with Ulta able to serve up double-digit same-store sales growth during a time when many other retailers are hoping for comps that are simply in the black. And analysts often call out Ulta Beauty as a top retail pick, immune to the charms of shopping on Amazon (AMZN).So why would investors expect anything but a rally from positive results? A quick recap:Despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 results in late August, shares tumbled over 6% and sank below their 50-day line. Slightly light Q3 profit guidance and concerns of high valuation were tossed around as possible causes.One equity strategist even mused on Twitter that male investors might not ""get"" the beauty business.Since then, however, Ulta has raised its Q3 and full-year guidance. For the 2016 fiscal year, it now expects mid-20% EPS growth and 12%-14% comps gains, up from low- to mid-20% growth and 11%-13% increases, respectively.Shares popped back up above their key 50-day level on the news.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta isn't the only retailer taking advantage of shopper lust for beauty products. Department stores and mall names are trying to build on a social media-driven interest in makeup to lure in foot traffic: ""How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of Retail.""Flash forward to the present: Ulta fell 0.8% to 261.60 in the stock market today, after hitting 265.38 earlier. Shares are closing in on a 268.88 buy point in a double-bottom base. Ulta had climbed in 13 of the prior 14 sessions as of Friday.The current holiday quarter is looking good so far.Beauty department traffic was solid on Thanksgiving eve and Black Friday, according to one analyst.""Traffic overall in beauty was solid; we expect ongoing strength in the category to persist through the December quarter,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink on Friday.And shoppers are currently in the thick of Cyber Monday sales, so the numbers have yet to roll in, but the National Retail Federation expects a slight uptick to 122 million Americans who intend to plunk down dollars online today.E.l.f.

Beauty (ELF) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) look to be in a good spot ahead of the shopping crush this Thanksgiving weekend.Value cosmetics brand E.l.f., which can be found at mass stores like CVS Health (CVS) and Target (TGT), dipped back into buy range Tuesday, falling 1% to 30.02 on the stock market today, rebounding from an intraday low of 28.73.Shares first broke out of a flat base with 29.02 entry point last Monday, which means that this buy range has a ceiling of 30.47, or 5% from the buy point.Beauty names are about as popular with the Wall Street analyst set as they are with consumers. Specialty retailers like Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora thus far appear well-shielded against Amazon's (AMZN) e-commerce appetite, and experts are optimistic about the growth prospects of e.l.f.'s low-cost products.IBD'S TAKE: Retailers are gearing up to do battle against Amazon and friends. See what Black Friday and the rest of the holiday season has in store: ""Retailers' Holiday Outlook: Not So Horrible This Year.""Ulta's stock was up 2.9% to 258.39. Shares have been intermittently popping back above their 50-day moving average over the last couple of months, but have held above that key support area for several sessions.Ulta Beauty is in a double-bottom base with a buy point of 268.88.The last big market move came on Oct. 13, with shares spiking 11.4% after management upped its full-year outlook, guiding per-share profit up to mid-20s percentage growth from prior outlook for low- to mid-20s percentage range growth.It also raised same-store sales growth outlook to 12%-14% vs. prior comp targets for 11%-13%.RELATED:How Instagram, Twitter Beauty Selfies Are Changing The Face Of Retail Teens Help This Top Retailer Resist 'Amazon Effect' Why An Upward Price Gap In Ulta Shares Is Thing Of Beauty

181,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) sank to a more than two-year low Tuesday after the drugstore giant and pharmacy-benefit manager cut full-year and 2017 EPS guidance, saying it expected to lose more than 40 million retail prescriptions next year amid tougher competition.CVS Health cut its full-year 2016 EPS target to $5.77-$5.83 from $5.81-$5.89. Analysts had expected $5.85.In cutting 2016 guidance, company said that ""very recent pharmacy network changes in the marketplace are expected to cause some retail prescriptions to begin migrating out of our pharmacies this quarter."" It added that ""slowing prescription growth"" and a ""soft seasonal business"" were also hurting.Those network changes, CVS said, had ""more significant implications"" for 2017, and the company said it expects retail operating profit growth to decrease. CVS sees 2017 EPS at $5.77-$5.93, far below analyst targets for $6.53.The forecast comes as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tries to lure pharmacy-benefit managers away from CVS with better prices. The landscape could become more difficult if Walgreens and Rite-Aid (RAD) merge.For this year's third quarter, earnings per share rose 28% to $1.64, topping views for $1.57. Revenue climbed 15.5% to $44.6 billion, missing estimates for $45.29 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.3%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 3.4%.CVS also announced a new $15 billion stock buyback program.Shares tumbled 11.8% to 73.53 on the stock market today. CVS hit 69.30 intraday, its lowest since early 2014. Walgreens Boots fell 1.7% to 80.09 while Rite Aid surged by 5.4% to 6.86.CVS has been investing in its specialty pharmacy business, to provide drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and other chronic conditions and spent $10.1 billion acquisition of Omnicare last year.But shares have suffered since May amid reimbursement rate pressures across the sector, weak earnings and guidance from drug distributor McKesson (MCK), and reports that the Justice Department will bring charges against makers of generic drugs for price collusion.Meanwhile, CVS hasn't been as invested in the front end of the business, unlike Walgreens, which has revamped its beauty offerings.IBD'S TAKE: The big drugstore chains sell beauty products, which have been a bright spot in an otherwise bleak retail landscape. Here's why e-commerce giant Amazon has had trouble breaking into that market.Last month, Walgreens reported fiscal Q4 earnings that topped but sales coming up a little light. The drugstore giant also extended its merger deadline with Rite Aid to allow more time to gain regulatory approval amid new doubts about whether the deal will pass muster.RELATED:Walgreens Boots Alliance Earnings Mixed; Rite Aid Deadline ExtendedCVS Earnings Beat On Specialty Pharma Bet; Guidance Raised

After the close Monday, the chip designer reported Q3 results that beat forecasts. The midpoint of its Q4 sales guidance is $87 million. Analysts expect $99.2 million.But Momo (MOMO) reversed sharply lower from a new high of 28.44 at the open. The stock fell 13% to 23.16 after the Chinese social network reported Q3 earnings of 24 cents a share, up from 2 cents a year ago and well above estimates.

185,CVS,"Stocks finished higher but the market went into reverse in late in Tuesday's trading session, as the major indexes gave back more than half its earlier gains.After being up as much as 0.9%, the Nasdaq composite ended with a 0.5% gain.

It can also be interpreted as a flat base with the same early buy point. Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded Microchip to buy from neutral with a price target of 75. Jefferies and Needham also raised price targets. Microchip beat profit and sales expectations late Monday.Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR) gapped past the 43.75 buy point of a base-on-base pattern. It also beat profit expectations late Monday.CommScope (COMM) charged to a new high, but the stock already had broken out of a 33.19 buy point.A couple of financial stocks also made noteworthy moves. Synovus Financial (SNV), which has banking branches in the South, fell 0.3% to 33.59.

187,CVS,"When Christie Tucker's son Preston was diagnosed with diabetes, his insulin prescription cost just $40. Now, two years later, Christie is paying $650 for a six-week supply of the medicine.Many people reflexively blame drug companies for Christie's dilemma. But the firms producing Preston's insulin aren't making more money. Insulin list prices are going up, but net prices — the money drug firms actually receive — are falling sharply. The extra cash is instead landing in the pockets of pharmacy benefit managers.Pharmacy benefit managers act as middlemen between drug companies and patients, pharmacists and insurers. They determine which medicines are covered, and at what co-pay or co-insurance level, for 210 million Americans' health plans. They're abusing this role to rake in enormous profits — at the expense of patients' health.The gatekeeper role gives PBMs enormous bargaining power to buy medicines in bulk. Just three PBMs dominate 70% of the market,  and pharmaceutical companies know they will not be able to access millions of patients unless they accommodate the demands of PBMs.With that disproportionate negotiating power, PBMs coerce pharmaceutical companies into offering substantial discounts and rebates.There's nothing inherently wrong with this hardball strategy. In theory, PBMs do patients a great service by securing lower drug prices.The problem is that, in practice, PBMs rarely pass the rebates they wrench away from drug companies along to pharmacies, insurers or patients. PBMs instead hoard the cash. Express Scripts, the nation's largest PBM — which boasted a market cap of $43 billion  in early November — has increased its profit per adjusted prescription 500% since 2003.Disturbingly, PBMs are maximizing their negotiating leverage, and thus their rebates, by refusing to cover dozens of lifesaving drugs. Combined, the top two PBMs in the country deny coverage to 239 medicines.When PBMs decrease coverage, patients suffer. Consider the plight of the 400,000 Americans with multiple sclerosis, a neurological disease that causes pain, fatigue and a loss of muscle control.CVS Health, the nation's second-largest PBM, excludes three top multiple sclerosis treatments in order to pressure the makers of other treatments into giving steeper discounts. That's dangerous for MS patients whose doctors purposely prescribed one of those three treatments to help them manage their disease.When drugs aren't covered by a PBM-determined insurance plan, many patients give up and stop taking the medications, rather than appeal for an exemption. One study, examining 60,000 Americans, found that when PBMs excluded drugs, almost half of patients simply stopped taking those medicines.Patients who fail to take the medications their doctors prescribe often develop complications, ending up in the emergency room or hospital. That drives up overall health care costs by billions of dollars annually. Grimly, nonadherence causes 125,000 deaths every year.Pharmacy benefit managers are supposed to negotiate big rebates on drug prices. And they do. But they're pocketing the cash instead of passing discounts along to patients. When patients across the nation either can't access lifesaving drugs, or must shell out a fortune to do so, it's time to ask: Who exactly benefits from pharmacy benefit managers?

192,CVS,"Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Mylan (MYL), Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP), Lannett (LCI) and other generic-drug makers tumbled Thursday afternoon after Bloomberg reported that the Justice Department is investigating possible price collusion, with charges likely by year-end.The DOJ is probing more than a dozen generic-drug makers over whether they colluded on pricing, according to Bloomberg.Mylan issued the following statement: ""Mylan is and has always been committed to cooperating with the Antitrust Division's investigation.  To date,  we know of no evidence that Mylan participated in price fixing.""Teva Pharmaceuticals has disclosed subpoenas and is cooperating, Bloomberg added. Lannett also has received a subpoena, the Wall Street Journal said.The antitrust probe is about two years old and covers some two dozen drugs, Bloomberg said, citing sources. A grand jury is examining if executives agreed to raise prices.Teva shares plunged 9.6% to 39.17 on the stock market today, falling to its lowest levels since November 2013. Mylan lost 6.7%. Lannett crashed 26.6%, Endo Pharmaceuticals 19.5% and Akorn (AKRX) 18.1%.

Sales rose 0.4% to $28.6 billion.Outlook: Walgreens sees fiscal 2017 EPS of $4.85-$5.20, roughly in line with analyst expectations for $5.02.Stock: Walgreens jumped 5% to 81.02 at the close on the stock market today, finding resistance at the 200-day line. Shares have been moving sideways for much of 2016, bobbing above and below both their 50- and 200-day moving averages. Rite Aid climbed 6.8% to 7.11. Rival CVS Health (CVS) was up 1.5% to 87.30.IBD'S TAKE: The big drugstore chains sell beauty products, which have been a bright spot in an otherwise bleak retail landscape. Here's why e-commerce giant Amazon has had trouble breaking into that market.Last year, Walgreens agreed to buy Rite Aid for $17.2 billion but skepticism that it would get antitrust approval has weighed on shares.In July, Walgreens held talks with the Federal Trade Commission over how many of the combined 13,000 stores it needs to sell to get approval for the deal, according to the New York Post, and appeared to be making progress winning over regulators.And last month, Walgreens said it is ""exploring potential divestiture remedies"" and signaled it expects to get the FTC's OK soon, saying it sees sales of 500-1,000 stores combined.But Kroger (KR) may balk at buying hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid need to divest to win regulatory approval.Kroger had wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores, but the FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post and Reuters Wednesday.RELATED:CVS Earnings Beat On Specialty Pharma Bet; Guidance Raised

But as Amazon (AMZN) continues to suck up more dollars from consumers, brick-and-mortar chains are increasingly latching on to the social media-driven fire for cosmetics and skin care products, which are proving to be a glimmer of hope for a surprising range of shops trying to lure Instagram-savvy shoppers.Last year, cosmetics, skin care and fragrance made up a $37.7 billion market in the U.S. vs. $266.8 billion in apparel and footwear sales, according to Euromonitor research. But beauty has been the fastest-growing retail segment for at least the last three years, outpacing apparel, footwear, food, in addition to being one of the fastest-growing segments online, said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.Echoing that trend, Ulta continues to crank out double-digit same-store sales gains — 14.4% in its most recent quarter — while the Gap (GPS) and Macy's (M) each posted comps of negative 2% in their latest reports, while Nordstrom (JWN) reported a 1.2% decline. Their respective stocks have followed the diverging sales trajectories as well.IBD'S TAKE: Robust and reliable growth appeals to institutional investors, so it's not surprising that Ulta has seen eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing mutual funds have reported a position in the stock.The major chains have taken notice, and are looking for a makeover with some social-media flair.Retail icon Macy's, which by Cowen & Co.'s estimates will be overtaken by Amazon next year as the biggest U.S. clothing seller, is planning to open more in-store locations of luxury beauty retailer Bluemercury, a 2015 acquisition, and is expanding its brand assortment beyond traditional prestige names to include smaller labels.And for any shoppers who bought $35 in Rampage accessories, the nation's largest department store also recently offered a free selfie stick.""Beauty is the new hoodie, in terms of being a product that works well with social media,"" said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, noting that retailers are looking for categories that are less vulnerable to promotions and unseasonable weather. ""You can't deny the power of social media. On average, someone will spend over 15 hours a week on social media.""Social media help shape and stimulate new trends, he added, as well as educate others about those trends. Makeup lovers now scour Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube for contouring tips and skim hashtags for brow-shaping tutorials from the seemingly endless parade of self-appointed beauty gurus with a domain name and an Instagram account.Department store beauty counters remain a fixture but are in particular danger of losing relevance in this digital age. NPD Group said that compared to two years ago, 11% more women are doing cosmetics product research online.By the time the customer enters the store, she's frequently past the product research stage, says Wissink. ""She walks in, she says 'I need palette 212,' and (the salesperson) goes 'Wait a second, don't you want to see our lip, our eye (products)?'""The social-media driven shift in habits means retail heavyweights have to enhance the store experience. In fact, chains that previously had no service aspect are adopting in-house experts to guide customers through the beauty aisle.For example, CVS Health (CVS) now has in-store beauty consultants and last year upgraded its makeup and skin care offerings in a few thousand locations. In its August earnings call, CEO Larry Merlo said the drugstore chain was focused on shifting its assortment toward health, beauty and store brands, all of which are higher-margin segments.And Target (TGT) features a ""beauty concierge,"" clad entirely in black and available to answer questions about the big-box retailer's brands.""It's meant to create retail theater,"" said Wissink, noting that customers ""crave that tactile in-store experience.""Shoppers enjoy sampling new products in store, and the quest for a Holy Grail blush can become a day out with the girls. In the process, it's not uncommon to snap a selfie and send it to a friend — or to Twitter (TWTR) followers — for immediate feedback.For their part, premium brands like Estee Lauder and Clinique are loosening their grip on exclusivity as they accept that shoppers like to sample different brands from a variety of retailers.They've broadened their distribution to specialty retailers like Ulta and lower-tier department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP), which nixed creating a whole new in-store beauty experience in lieu of bringing in an already-successful titan: Sephora.Its in-store Sephora locations were among the department store's top-performing divisions, the company said in its Q2 earnings release in August, and there are plans for more Sephora shop-in-shops to drive beauty-revenue growth.""Seems like everyone's trying to get a piece of that pie,"" said FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""It's working, at least for Sephora and Ulta, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon.""And as beauty products increasingly drive traffic to stores, chains that traditionally haven't sold them are now testing them out.A Barnes & Noble store seems like a peculiar place to open up a beauty counter, but it may be inclined to seize trends early, given that Amazon laid waste to book sellers.The Glossary, as it is cleverly called, is a college-focused shop-in-shop stocked full of makeup and skin care products from Smashbox, Burt's Bees and other millennial-friendly brands, not far from the Jane Austen paperbacks and math textbooks needed to survive freshman year. Barnes & Noble College — a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble Education (BNED) -- has rolled out the pilot program at a handful of locations, including Emory University, Southern Methodist University and the University of California at Riverside.""(It's) similar to what they did a few years ago with coffee shops,"" said NPD's Grant. Barnes & Noble wants shoppers ""to browse, to know that they can hang out."" After all, the longer retailers can get customers to stay in the store, she said, the better the chances of them buying something.Apparel stores like Urban Outfitters (URBN) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are also cultivating nascent beauty offerings. Teen retailers have broadly been trying to reconfigure their identities now that their millennial consumer base has grown up and out of midaughts trends.Urban's curated ""Back-to-School Beauty"" collection showcases a small mix of products, including trendy Korean brand Tonymoly and uberhip Milk Makeup. (Besides select Urban Outfitters, the only other place to buy Milk in a store is Sephora.) In its mid-August earnings call, Urban Outfitters management called out the strength of its beauty segment, as well as its home and intimates divisions.American Eagle's foray into the beauty space has been more hesitant, though it may have more up its sleeve. Its Aerie Global Brand President Jennifer Foyle noted in American Eagle's May earnings call that the company has assembled a team ""to venture into the beauty business, but we are going to walk before we run."" It, too, sells Tonymoly face masks, plus some assorted Aerie-branded lotions and body washes.Rolling out new display cases is one thing, but building up a healthy following on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram is another.Out of all of its department store brethren, Nordstrom has the strongest social presence, with 2.1 million Instagram followers to Bloomingdales' paltry 608,000 and J.C. Penney's 300,000 follower count. It was one of the first major companies to incorporate Like2Buy into its Instagram profile, allowing customers to click through and buy the pictured products.All of them pale in comparison to Sephora's 8.8 million followers and Ulta Beauty's 2.4 million Instagram devotees. Still, the department stores are seeing progress at the cash register.Nordstrom's summer ""Glam-Out Days"" offered free makeup tips and services during its yearly ""anniversary sale"" event. According to Piper Jaffray research, beauty products had the highest sellout rate during the promotional period, with 51% of Nordstrom's makeup and skin care products selling out, up from 30% last year and 8% in 2014.""One of the things that makes beauty important within department stores is (that) it's a gateway,"" said Grant. ""It helps the retailer attract other consumers, whether it's apparel or footwear. One of the things they've used the beauty space to do is carve out new consumers or drive traffic through the rest of the store.""RELATED:Beauty's A Hot Industry, But Does That Make E.L.F.

196,CVS,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.
"
197,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) signaled Thursday that it expects the Federal Trade Commission to soon approve its pending takeover of rival drugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD), sending shares of both drugstores higher in the stock market today.Walgreens said it is ""exploring potential divestiture remedies"" as talks continue. It expects the retailers will have to sell more than 500 stores combined but fewer than 1,000. The retailers had originally expected having to sell less than 500 stores, but their deal allowed for divestitures of up to 1,000 stores.Walgreens still expects the $17.2 billion, $9-a-share deal to close in the second half of the year.Back in February, Walgreen-Rite Aid approval skepticism was widespread, though Rite Aid shares rose nearly 8% last month on renewed optimism.Walgreens still expects the deal, first announced in October 2015, will be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first year after the transaction close. It also continues to see more than $1 billion in synergies, fully realized within three to four years.Deutsche Bank said the merger will be slightly less accretive due to the increased store divestitures, but maintained a buy rating with a 94 price target.Walgreens stock rose 2.2% to 84.67. Rite Aid jumped 5.9% to 8.21. Rival drugstore chain CVS Health (CVS) dipped 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Walgreens is in a downtrend going back more than a year. But shares cleared resistance at 83.88 on Thursday, breaking out of a short consolidation to a two-month high in a larger consolidation.

198,CVS,"E.l.f. Beauty (ELF), a maker of low-priced cosmetics, opened sharply higher Thursday morning its debut after pricing its initial public offering late Wednesday above the expected range, signaling the recent run of strong IPO performance will continue.E.l.f. Beauty opened at 24 on the stock market today, up 41% from its IPO price of 17. The stock finished 56% higher at 26.50.Late Wednesday, e.l.f. raised $141 million by selling 8.3 million shares above the expected 14-16 range.E.l.f. -- short for eyes, lips, face -- is fast growing and was profitable in 2015. Its cosmetics can be found in stores such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS (CVS).The company relies on social media and fast product turnarounds to keep up with trends.The beauty business is taking off, with drugstores like CVS also trying to step up their game. Two pure-play standouts are Sephora and Ulta Beauty (ULTA).E.l.f. is part of the busiest week for IPOs so far this year. The Trade Desk (TTD) got the party started with a 67% debut to 30.10 on Wednesday. Trade Desk, a fast-growing, profitable ad-tech firm, had priced above-target at 18 late Tuesday. Trade Desk rose initially but is trading down nearly 3% intraday.Also Wednesday, Novan (NOVN) rose 65% to 18.10, and was up more than 16% on Thursday. Novan, developing acne treatments had priced at 11, the low end of its expected range.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market is in an uptrend, but the current environment is tricky for making purchases.

199,CVS,"Shares of generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) rebounded in early trading Thursday, then lost steam, after the company said it would expand patient assistance for its controversially priced drug EpiPen.The move hit shares of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) Express Scripts (ESRX) and pharmacy chain CVS Health (CVS).Mylan stock had been falling all week as members of Congress called for an investigation into its pricing of the emergency anti-allergy drug, which has gone up 400% in the last few years. On Wednesday, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also criticized the company and promised to act against high drug prices as president, statements that demolished the drug stock rally of the last few days.On Thursday, Mylan issued a press release saying it was doubling the eligibility of its patient-assistance program for EpiPen to 400% of the poverty level, meaning that a family of four making $97,200 a year would pay nothing for it. It also offered a savings card of up to $300 to defray out-of-pocket costs for those on frugal insurance plans.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan's troubles were foreseen by some in the industry, and it's not alone — see our June article These 6 Drugmakers Could Be The Next Price War Casualties.Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat roughly estimated that the new programs would have, at most, an annual $100 million impact on Mylan, or 10% of EpiPen sales. Earlier in the week he noted that there was evidence of heavy rebating already going on with EpiPen, which provides about 12% of Mylan's revenue.""Notice that in 2015, net sales increase vs. 2014 was roughly zero despite volumes up 7% and price up 31% year-over-year,"" Raffat wrote in an email to clients. ""This speaks to the contractual arrangements around EpiPen.""Mylan CEO Heather Bresch made a similar point in an interview with CNBC late Wednesday, saying that the middlemen that Mylan has to go through strip off large chunks of the price for themselves. Leerink analyst David Larsen wrote in a research note that this is likely why Express Scripts and CVS Health were both selling off Thursday.""This obviously implies that CVS and Express Scripts, as the PBMs, are reaping significant profits from EpiPen,"" Larsen wrote. Therefore, any reduction in EpiPen's price would presumably be felt by them as well, he said.Express Scripts stock fell 6% to 71.74 Thursday, hitting a 4-month low intraday. CVS stock was down 3.5% to 93.78.Larsen also noted that fellow generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) has an EpiPen competitor that could hit the U.S. market in 2018.""Since a generic launch is pending, we believe Mylan may have been getting slightly more aggressive about pricing,"" he wrote.Mylan rose as much as 4.5% in early trading on the stock market today, after having lost more than 11% the previous three days. But the stock closed down 0.7% to 42.85.RELATED:AstraZeneca Sells Antibiotics Business; Mallinckrodt Sheds Imaging Unit

200,CVS,"Target (TGT) shares tumbled Wednesday, as the big-box retailer took an ax to its full-year earnings guidance and said it plans for a ""challenging environment"" during the rest of 2016.Target said it's lowering earnings expectations to $4.80-$5.20 a share, down from a prior outlook of $5.20-$5.40. Analysts as of Wednesday morning expected $5.13 per share.For the current quarter, Target sees 75-95 cents in per-share profit, on the light side of current expectations for 95 cents, and said it is projecting a 2% drop to flat revenue growth at outlets open more than a year, or same-store sales.Shares fell 5.4% to 70.63 in the stock market today after falling as low as 69.90. But the stock closed below its 50-day line for the first time since early July.During the second quarter, earnings edged up a penny to $1.23 per share, topping estimates by 11 cents. Meanwhile, revenue slid 7% to $16.17 billion, just a hair short of consensus for $16.18 billion. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, weighing on revenue. Not having pharmacies and clinics to count toward results also dragged on revenue, it said.CVS Health (CVS) last year acquired almost 1,700 pharmacies and 80 clinics from Target and re-branded them as CVS pharmacies.According to Reuters, management told analysts on the call Wednesday morning that Target had experienced meaningful pressure in electronics, marked by a double-digit comp decline. About a third of that pressure is fueled in part by declining sales of Apple (AAPL) products.Apple product sales fell 20% vs. a year earlier, highlighting the problem with the tech titan's aging product lineup.Management also reportedly said Target's grocery business disappointed during the quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Target isn't the only one who has turned in lackluster guidance this week. TJX, normally a standout in a struggling retail space, offered weak guidance Tuesday. But some maintain that it could be a sound investment: ""Why TJX Stock Could Still Be A Good Buy Despite Off-Price Outlook.""But the retail major is trying to keep up in an e-commerce-heavy shopping environment. As comparable digital-channel sales rose 16% in the second quarter, Target is looking to continue investing in its digital capabilities. On the call, the company indicated that it will increase its ship-from-store capacity, according to Reuters.CVS shares fell 1 cent to 97.55. Apple stock lost 0.15% to 109.22.Target rival Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) closed up 4 cents to 72.93. Wal-Mart will report earnings on Thursday.

201,CVS,"Pharmacy and health services giant CVS Health (CVS) is launching CVS Pay, joining Apple (AAPL), Starbucks (SBUX), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others in mobile payments.Initially, CVS Pay is only available in certain markets including New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware. A nationwide rollout is planned later this year. CVS Pay operates on Apple iOS and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Android devices and is now part of the CVS Pharmacy mobile app.The app integrates mobile payments, prescription pickup and the company's ExtraCare loyalty program. After downloading the app, a customer shows a bar code, which a sales clerk will scan to ring up the purchase, sending a confirmation to the customer.CVS shares dipped 0.1% to 97 on the stock market today. Archrival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) rose 0.5%, and Walgreens' buyout target Rite Aid (RAD) climbed 1.1%. Apple fell 0.1%, Starbucks slid 0.3% and Wal-Mart eased 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: CVS Health stock offers an entry point at 113.75 but hasn't yet formed a base. For more on signs that a stock is a good prospect, go to ""When to Buy Stocks"" in IBD University.Last week, CVS reported an 8.2% hike in diluted earnings per share, beating analyst views. Revenue climbed 18% to $43.73 billion, lighter than expected. But the company raised its full-year EPS forecast.
"
202,CVS,"Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said the case for a rate hike is stronger now, but investors weren't sure what to make of that. Pfizer (PFE) paid $14 billion for a one-drug biotech, but shares of drugs and pharma supply chain companies sold off as Mylan's (MYL) EpiPen price hikes drew outrage. Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range. OPEC members gave conflicting signals over whether they might support a production freeze, while Goldman Sachs said such a move would not ""be sufficient to support prices much further."" Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels vs. expectations for a small drop. Domestic production fell slightly.The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop ""the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution."" Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021.Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point. Shares rose 2.3% for the week.Tesla Motors (TSLA), which is ending its business relationship with Mobileye, introduced new versions of its Model S and X that boosts speeds and driving range, powered by an updated battery technology. Tesla said its upgraded Model S is now the fastest-accelerating car in commercial production. Tesla shares fell 2.2%, closing below the 50-day line and just above the 200-day line.Tesla partner Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled a new processor for autonomous driving, saying it's 50%-100% more powerful than other mobile processors.The beauty products retailer reported better-than-expected earnings and sales, with yet another quarter of double-digit same-stores growth. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday.July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents.

203,CVS,"Deutsche Bank (DB), UBS (UBS), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Banco Santander (SAN) are jointly developing a blockchain-based currency to clear securities trades more quickly, following efforts by JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) to develop their own digital methods to settle such transactions.Blockchain, the technology initially used to move Bitcoin transactions, allows stock and bond trades and other such exchanges to take place through a shared ledger database system, cutting down on the middlemen often needed to allow those transactions to take place. Banks have become increasingly interested in the technology, and the ""fintech"" startups that use it, as a way to modernize their own infrastructure and potentially save billions in transaction-settlement costs for trades.Deutsche Bank, UBS, Bank of New York Mellon, Banco Santander and ICAP, an electronic broker, will try to sell the plan to develop what they call the Utility Settlement Coin to central banks, the Financial Times reported.The Utility Settlement Coin, which would be convertible into a variety of currencies at central banks, was first introduced last year by UBS and tech firm Clearmatics, another participant in the joint effort. The firms hope to launch the digital coin on a small scale by 2018.Development efforts will focus on the ""financial structuring"" of the digital currency, building the platform out through several phases intended to draw more users, Deutsche Bank said in a statement Wednesday. The firms plan to test the digital currency in a real-market environment.Deutsche Bank's U.S. shares closed up 1.4% in the stock market today, while UBS rose 1.8%, and Bank of New York Mellon edged up 0.1%. Santander added 1.4%. JPMorgan ticked 0.3% higher, Goldman lost 0.5%, and Citigroup added 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: The financial technology, or ""fintech,"" industry has the potential to upend the landscape of traditional banking. But regulators have become increasingly concerned about mismanagement and insufficient oversight. Find out more about the broader fintech industry.The fintech industry has grown rapidly in recent years, with an array of startups trying to take the hassle out of sending and receiving money by moving much of the process to your phone, computer or other mobile device. But as those companies speed up the process of payments and loans, calls have grown for tighter regulation of the industry.""Active dialogue with central banks and regulators will continue to ensure a regulation-compliant, robust and efficient structure within which the USC can be deployed,"" Deutsche Bank said in the statement about the Utility Settlement Coin project.RELATED:

205,CVS,"Shares of Danish diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) dropped sharply Friday after the company reported a mixed quarter and trimmed its guidance.Novo's Q2 earnings of 59 cents a share were a hair over analysts' consensus, while sales of $4.1 billion were slightly below. But the company cut the top end of its full-year operating growth guidance range, now 5% to 7% on the top line and 5% to 8% on the bottom line.""This reflects expectations for continued robust performance for Victoza and Tresiba as well as a contribution from Saxenda and Xultophy,"" Novo said in its news release. ""These sales drivers are expected to be partly countered by an impact from a contract loss in the U.S. for NovoLog, the loss of exclusivity for products within hormone replacement therapy in the U.S., intensifying competition within diabetes and biopharmaceuticals especially in the U.S., as well as adverse macroeconomic conditions in several markets in International Operations.""It's a story that's been afflicting Novo as well as fellow European diabetes player Sanofi (SNY) for a while now, as both new entrants into the market and biosimilar versions of existing drugs have intensified competition. It didn't help that CVS Health's (CVS) 2017 formulary list excluded Sanofi's Lantus, Bloomberg reported this week.Novo stock ended Friday's trading session down 9.7% on the stock market today to 49.87 and touching a nearly six-month low.IBD'S TAKE: Novo Nordisk rates No. 9 in IBD's Ethical Drugs group, and is sinking.

206,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) announced second-quarter earnings above analyst estimates Tuesday as the drugstore giant's investment in specialty pharmacy last year paid off.Earnings per share jumped 8.2% to $1.32, above analysts' views for $1.30. Revenue climbed 17.6% to $43.73 billion, but fell short of forecasts for $44.28 billion. Pharmacy Services Segment revenue rose 20.7% to $29.5 billion on increased network claim volume and growth in specialty pharmacy. Revenues in the Retail Segment increased 16% to $20.0 billion.Looking ahead, CVS sees Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.55-$1.58 vs. consensus for $1.55 and the company narrowed its full year EPS outlook to $5.81-$5.89 from an earlier view of $5.73-$5.88. The new midpoint of $5.85 tops the analyst target of $5.82.CVS shares jumped 4.9% to 98.06 in the stock market today, rising above its 50-day moving average and just above its 200-day line.Pharmacy same store sales fell 355 basis points on new generic drugs while front store same store sales decreased 2.5% on the shift of Easter from April in 2015 to March in 2016, weaker customer traffic.

Narrowed full-year EPS view to $5.81-$5.89 from $5.73-$5.88 vs. consensus for $5.82.CVS shares jumped nearly 5% to end trading at 98.06 on the stock market today, retaking its downward sloping 50-day average. Walgreens Boots Alliance edged down to 78.94, while Rite Aid was unchanged at 7.01.IBD'S TAKE: CVS is more likely to face a larger rival as prospects for the Walgreens-Rite Aid merger deal improve. Walgreens held talks last month with the Federal Trade Commission over how many of the combined 13,000 stores it needs to sell to get approval for the deal.In June, Rite Aid reported a break-even quarter, below analyst estimates for earnings of 5 cents a share and prior-year EPS of 2 cents. Revenue rose 23% to $8.18 billion, short of views for $8.26 billion.""Our challenge was pharmacy reimbursement rate pressure, which we were unable to offset, largely due to drug-purchasing efficiencies that did not meet our expectations,"" said CEO John Standley in a statement.Rite Aid also attributed a decline in adjusted EBITDA to ""lower pharmacy margin due to lower reimbursement rates that were not offset by purchasing efficiencies and script count growth.""Meanwhile, CVS has been adding health-conscious food and drinks to its CVS Pharmacy stores as consumers continue to gravitate toward natural and organic foods.
"
208,CVS,"The spectacular rise and even more spectacular collapse of Valeant Pharmaceuticals had multiple causes, but at the heart of the story was how much the biotech company relied on big drug price increases for growth.Not only did those price hikes make Valeant (VRX) politically unpopular, but they also meant the business was ultimately unsustainable. Money managers prefer biotechs and pharmas that produce drugs with growing customer demand, as signaled by growth in sales volume.""As you would think, the preferable avenue for revenue growth is through volume, as significant price increases (like we have seen over the past two years) can only be repeated for a few years,"" Leonard Yaffe, health care portfolio manager at Kessef Capital, told IBD in an email. ""The more the revenue increase is due to volume, the more value is assigned to the drug.""If you're hunting for big growth stocks, and biotechs catch your eye, looking past the headline revenue numbers can help you see which companies might have more sustainable -- and even accelerating -- growth. If volume growth lags sales increases, the company is leaning on price, which might not last.Most price increases are far more moderate than Valeant's 525% and 212% price hikes for heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel, respectively. But many companies regularly lift their prices well past the inflation rate, which can prop up revenue but disguise actual demand.IBD'S TAKE: Big caps can deliver still deliver big gains, often with less volatility than smaller-cap stocks. That's also true in biotech, which has some strong big-cap companies. Amgen and Biogen are among current residents of the IBD Big Cap 20.Comparing volume and revenue is worthwhile for another reason: If volume growth was more than overall revenue growth, this signals that a company is having to rebate more of its list price than it did last year to move product, and/or is rolling out the drug in countries that extracted a lower price (as is often the case in Europe). Investors don't like this either, because it signals that insurers and other payors are putting the thumbscrews on the company.""Payor mix obviously is very critical as well, as large, consolidated payors which cover many many lives have negotiating power and can pick/choose/rationalize products based on price, efficacy, alternatives etc.,"" Thomas Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, told IBD in an email.Second-quarter earnings reports and conference call comments revealed that while some biotech giants and hot stocks relied almost solely on price increases for growth, others expanded mostly on volume increases, and still others credited a mix of both.Amgen (AMGN) was a classic example of leaning on price: Q2 revenue rose 6%, but volume growth was zero.Much of this stems from the age of Amgen's leading drugs. Its top-seller, rheumatoid-arthritis drug Enbrel, is over a decade old, and its volume shrank 2% in the quarter. But it still contributed 10% growth thanks to pricing.Two drugs that are even older, Epogen and Neupogen, shrank in both price and volume because they're facing new biosimilar competition. Newer drugs Prolia and Xgeva made up the difference by growing on both fronts. But this is one reason why, despite the fact that it beat Q2 estimates and raised guidance, Amgen stock initially dropped after the earnings report.In contrast to Amgen, Celgene's (CELG) revenue rose 22% in Q2, and 16 of those percentage points came from volume growth, according to the company. It didn't break the percentages down by individual drug like Amgen did, but the company said demand was good across the board.Celgene also beat forecasts and raised guidance for future sales and profit, and its stock jumped 3% after the report.Medivation (MDVN) demonstrates the sneaky power of rebating. The list price of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi -- for now, Medivation's only marketed drug -- rose 6% during the second quarter. But while revenue overall rose 17% -- a bit less than analysts expected -- volume grew 18%.""The growth in underlying demand for Xtandi was partially offset by a lower net price for Xtandi due to a year-over-year increase in the gross-to-net rate,"" said CFO Jennifer Jarrett on the Q2 earnings conference call, gross-to-net being industry-speak for the rebate level.Xtandi has been in a tight competition with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga in the prostate-cancer market, and J&J has been undercutting its price. CVS Health's (CVS) recently released 2017 drug formulary passed over Xtandi for Zytiga for this reason.Following their Q2 reports, here's a rundown of how the other big biotechs are faring on the price vs. volume question:""In the United States, the lion's share from a change (on a) year-over-year basis is price, and is pretty stable unit trends on Tecfidera, pretty stable unit trends on Tysabri and modest, gradual decline on the interferon franchise (which includes Avonex and Plegridy),"" Clancy said. ""Ex-United States, we are not seeing any pricing (increases) on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion.""Biogen's overall revenue rose 12% in the quarter, beating expectations.Lead drug Soliris provides the vast majority of revenue, and its volume rose 15% on a 10% hike in sales. The rest of the top line came from newly launched drugs that have no year-over-year comparison.Incyte's revenue jumped 51% year over year, beating expectations.RELATED:Are Biotechs Making A Comeback: 5 Stocks To WatchBiotechs Are Making A Case For Leadership, But Is It A Good One?

213,CVS,"Prospects for the $17 billion Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) acquisition of Rite Aid (RAD) may have improved as Walgreens holds talks with the Federal Trade Commission over how many of the combined 13,000 stores it needs to sell to get approval for the deal.Walgreens is already auctioning off stores in areas with high volumes of Walgreens and Rite Aid stores, according to a report from the New York Post.Walgreens shares fell 1.5% to 82.51 at the close on the stock market today. Rite Aid shares gained 2.4% to 7.19.

214,CVS,"Stocks showed mild action Friday, but the Dow snapped a four-week winning run. In general, the market maintained a positive bent amid a week jam-packed with earnings reports and a data showing weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy.But the Q2 advance GDP report didn't seem that horrible beyond the headline number. While the overall 1.2% gain far missed the Econoday consensus forecast for an increase of 2.6%, the government also revised the figure for Q1 of 2015 sharply higher from 0.6% growth to 2.0%.Plus, in the latest reading, consumer spending jumped 4.2%, strongly reflecting the positive impact of relatively high employment and lower gas prices in the world No. 1 economy.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%, lagging gains of nearly 0.3% for both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. The latter hit a new all-time high, rising as high as 2,177.09 during the stock market today.The Dow's 0.1% loss for the week pales in comparison with gains of 3.2%, 1.1%, 2% and 0.3% in the prior four weeks, respectively. The Nasdaq rallied 1.2% for the week -- a fifth straight weekly advance. The S&P 500 edged lower by fewer than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Which stocks are performing best in the Dow?One way to view this is by comparing the Relative Strength Rating, which measures a stock's performance over the past 12 months vs. the rest of the stock market. Action over the past three months carries a higher weighting. On that score, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) lead the Dow's 30 components with RS ratings of 83 and 81, respectively.J&J rose 0.6% to 125.23, padding its impressive gains since clearing a long saucer with handle near 105. Even with that large advance, J&J's annualized dividend yield of 2.6% still exceeds the S&P 500's 2% payout.J&J continues to rise after recently posting a third quarter in a row of modest earnings growth. Q3 earnings are seen rising 11% to $1.66 a share, which would be an acceleration from the 2% increase which the medical and personal care products titan saw in the second quarter.For the year, J&J's earnings per share are seen rising 8% on a 3% pick-up in revenue to $72.07 billion.UnitedHealth has had a masterful performance since it broke out of a shallow double-bottom base at 121.19 in late February. The managed care behemoth rose 0.3% to 143.20, up 18% from that proper pivot point.Ranking third in RS Rating among the Dow components is DuPont (DD). The chemicals giant is cozying up to the 70 price level, where it's had trouble piercing higher. Earlier this week, DuPont marked a 14% jump in Q2 earnings, the best result in 10 quarters.

219,CVS,"A major expansion by Amazon.com (AMZN) into private-label goods, which could come this month, elevates its ability to further challenge legacy retailers across the board.Cowen analyst John Blackledge estimates Amazon will be the No. 2 player in the $425 billion consumable market, excluding food and beverage, surpassing Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), CVS Health (CVS) and Target (TGT) but still lagging well behind market leader Wal-Mart (WMT).He defines consumables as four segments: personal care products, household products, baby products and pet products.Blackledge also estimates Amazon will be a top-10 player in the $785 billion food and beverage grocery market by 2019.“We are encouraged by Amazon’s growing footprint in this category, which we see as ripe for potential disruption, given younger demos increasingly purchasing grocery items via digital channels,” Blackledge wrote.The leader in the food and beverage category is Wal-Mart, followed by Kroger (KR), Albertsons/Safeway and Costco Wholesale (COST).Last week, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the matter as saying Amazon is set in the coming weeks to roll out new lines of private-label brands that will include its first broad push into perishable foods.According to the Private Label Manufacturers Association, sales of private-label store brands in the U.S. topped $118 billion in 2015, with supermarkets and drug chains accounting for over $70 billion of the total.In the grocery and consumables market, Blackledge says, Amazon’s growth has come at the expense of Wal-Mart, Target. Walgreens and CVS. Amazon’s key competitive advantage is its multiplatform approach with Amazon Prime, which includes same-day delivery for many goods, “all of which should lead to rising number of consumers skipping the trip to the local supercenter, drug store or grocery market,” he wrote.Amazon has sold private-label products since 2009, primarily under the AmazonBasics brand, though that effort has concentrated largely on consumer electronics.Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 702.80 in the stock market today. Amazon stock hit an all-time high of 722.45 on May 12. It carries a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94, putting it among the top 6% of all stocks on key metrics such as revenue growth.Walgreens climbed 1.3% but CVS fell 1.5%. Target climbed 2.4%. Wal-Mart advanced 1%, hitting a nine-month high intraday, after spiking nearly 10% Thursday on strong earnings and same-store sales.

226,CVS,"Amazon (AMZN) has solidified its position as an e-commerce leader, and its global takeover may happen sooner than you think.A Cowen & Co. report out Wednesday forecasts Amazon displacing Macy’s (M) as the No. 1 U.S. apparel retailer by 2017, driven by selection, fulfillment and brand relationships. Amazon’s momentum in apparel is also seen leading to retailer mergers and acquisitions, as well as store closures.Cowen also projects that Amazon will displace Target (TGT), Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) to become the No.2 company in consumables, behind Wal-Mart (WMT), by 2018. The report calculates a compound annual growth rate of 27% for the e-commerce giant’s consumables market.Meanwhile, Social Capital has set a very bullish $3 trillion, 10-year valuation on the stock, with the venture capital firm citing strength across retail and its Amazon Web Services segment.

227,CVS,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has toppled Sephora to become the favorite beauty destination of average-income teen girls, says Piper Jaffray, which highlighted Ulta's rewards program and hiked its price target to 220 from 188 following the results of its semi-annual Taking Stock With Teens poll.Ulta now has 27% share among average-income teen girls vs. 15% in the previous spring, and it has gained popularity even as it sits in the No. 2 spot behind Sephora among more affluent female teens.Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink, who also raised her fiscal 2017 and 2018 profit estimates on Ulta, wrote that the price-target increase reflects confidence in the company's position as a share-gainer, as customers ""shift from legacy to emerging purchase environments.""Mass merchandisers, department stores like Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN), and drugstores like Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) are no longer the de facto places to buy cosmetics and skin care products, as Ulta, LVMH's (LVMUY) Sephora and even Amazon's (AMZN) beauty offerings have grown in popularity.While teens are spending less than they used to in general, they are nevertheless willing to shell out money on beauty products, with beauty wallet share hitting a new high of 10.5% among upper-income female teens. Beauty spending rose 20% from last year among more affluent teens, the firm said, with growth in all areas: makeup, skin care and fragrance.Wissink specifically called out Ulta's rewards program as a successful lure for return customers.""From surveys of both women and teens, the single common thread is that beauty spending is rising, and the shift to specialty and (e-commerce) formats is accelerating,"" wrote Wissink in a separate note on Ulta. ""Ulta's loyalty program is a key asset, driving frequency and reinforcing a growing content library to inspire brand discovery, test & trial, and basket value.""The company's Ultamate Rewards program now has over 18 million members, with over 80% of sales coming from those customers.Shares of Ulta were up 1.7% in the stock market today. U.S.-listed shares of LVMH climbed 2.5%. Macy's and Nordstrom rose less than 1%, while Walgreens and CVS fell fractionally.And there's room for more share gains in the beauty space.""Ulta and Sephora represented over 50% of destination preferences but only 10% of industry share, implying significant runway for growth,"" she said.RELATED:Ulta Beauty’s Amazon-Resistant Model Impresses Wall StreetWhy Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.

230,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD), which are working toward becoming one, are both on tap to report earnings in the upcoming week.Walgreens has logged a string of double-digit earnings and revenue gains for the last four quarters, following the late-2014 completion of the merger of Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The drugstore giant then announced in October that it would acquire smaller rival Rite Aid at $9 per share in cash for a total valuation of $17.2 billion, including acquired net debt.The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal, which is still expected to close in the latter half of calendar 2016, was ""progressing as planned"" as of Walgreens' last quarterly report in January. Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin, however, recently expressed doubt that the merger would get the regulatory OK.When Walgreens reports on Tuesday morning, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate an 8.5% profit rise to $1.28 per share. Revenue is seen growing over 15% to $30.66 billion.In mid-March, Walgreens and OptumRx, a unit of insurance giant UnitedHealth (UNH), announced a pharmacy benefit partnership, allowing the drugstore's pharmacies to better compete with CVS Health (CVS) on services and cost savings.

231,CVS,"Charcoal cleanser. BB creams. The 10-step Korean skin-care regimen.The modern woman's bathroom counter likely looks very different from her grandmother's, and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) knows it. Stocked with both higher-end prestige products and value-focused mass brands, the specialty beauty retailer has carved out a unique space for itself amid offerings from department stores, drugstores and the ever-looming 800-pound gorilla, Amazon (AMZN).While the beauty shopper of yesteryear might have frequented a favorite department store cosmetics counter for all her Estee Lauder (EL) or Lancome supplies, today's consumer doesn't feel as tied to specific brands.""The beauty bag is more diverse -- so there's category loyalty and interest but there is less buying across a single brand range,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. The average shopper is ""mixing and matching brands more routinely.""As brand loyalty wanes, the rising concept of ""destination loyalty"" may begin to matter more, particularly as a plethora of competitors vie for attention, including not just department stores like Macy's (M) or privately held Saks but drugstores like CVS Health (CVS) and big-box retailers Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Ulta and rival Sephora, owned by Paris-based LVMH (LVMUY) have become the reigning specialty stores in the beauty space. Sephora lines its glossy black-and-white shelves only with prestige brands such as Dior, Nars and Yves Saint Laurent, while Ulta offers a mix.Conventional drugstore brands like Revlon and L'Oreal are featured alongside edgier titles at Ulta, such as Smashbox and Urban Decay. Ulta also offers both a full-service salon in every store and ""brow bars,"" or eyebrow treatment areas, at some of its almost 900 locations.Traditionally, customers who opted for a department store makeover would have to ""go home and try to figure out how she did it,"" said Wissink. But makeup trends once relegated to the service model are now accessible online and via other venues.Now, anyone can simply hop on YouTube and look up, say, a video tutorial from beauty guru Michelle Phan on contouring -- highlighting and shading facial features to the cosmetically challenged -- or head to their local Ulta for a makeup consultation.The sample-friendly ""test-and-trial"" nature of specialty beauty stores -- minus the salesperson pressure -- appeals to shoppers who want to experiment with a new look. Ulta has ""floating artists and salespeople who can talk intelligently about a beauty trend who aren’t (commissioned) to sell you a specific brand,"" said Wissink.""You might be buying a $3.99 compact of glittery eye shadow and a $49 base compact and putting on $7 mascara,"" said Wissink. ""That’s the Ulta way.""Ulta also has a rewards program, offering samples and perks in exchange for shopper loyalty. The Ultamate Rewards program membership has grown to over 18 million members, and those members offer the company precious insights into their shopping habits, including frequency of salon service use, spending patterns, favorite products, and other data.""That’s very valuable information,"" Ulta Beauty Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten told IBD. ""It helps us position new stores, where we’re going to build those stores -- we like to go where we already have an existing customer base, so it’s very valuable.""In a bid to capture and keep customers, the company has been shifting from discounts and delving into direct email marketing with personalized messaging. Its hold over shoppers is proving to be strong: More than 80% of the company's sales come from loyalty program members, said Chief Executive Mary Dillon in last August's earnings call.Ulta's online sales, while a single-digit fraction of its overall net sales in 2015, has been growing at a 40% to more-than-50% clip every quarter without weighing on same-store sales.""It’s been incredible,"" says RBC Capital markets analyst Brian Tunick of Ulta's e-commerce growth. ""It’s been one of the biggest parts of the story. But at the same time, their store comps have been high single digits as well. In retail today, there’s not a lot of companies that are showing positive store traffic.""In the fourth quarter, reported on March 10, Ulta's e-commerce sales leapt 44.2%, while retail-only comps rose 10.4%. And the company's per-share profit climbed 25% to $1.69 on 21% revenue growth to $1.27 billion, both beating consensus estimates. Ulta also announced an accelerated share buyback program.Ulta shares continue to float in buy range after breaking out of a period of consolidation on March 11, gapping up past the key 50-day and 200-day levels.Following the results, a bevy of analysts upped their price targets, including those from Piper Jaffray, Nomura, RBC and Jefferies, though concern over the stock's apparently full valuation lingered.""We continue to like the strength of the business model, ULTA's unique market positioning and future growth prospects,"" wrote Jefferies' Randal Konik in March. ""However, we believe valuation already prices in these positives.""Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel called out the company's accelerating comps amid share gains in low- to -mid-tier markets. ""We continue to expect that with minimal mall and (e-commerce) penetration, ULTA remains isolated from the main issues facing retail as the company’s self-help initiatives drive ongoing top- and bottom-line growth,"" Siegel wrote in a note to clients last month.Any talk of e-commerce typically leads to talk of mega-retailer Amazon. But even after the online one-stop shop and known brick-and-mortar killer set up its own storefront in 2013, Amazon Beauty, the beauty space has not been subject to as much disruption as some initially feared.A mild assortment of higher-end brands means the e-commerce giant is still at a disadvantage to specialty players when it comes to the top-shelf stuff. And while one might think that Amazon would be a perfect place to conveniently restock supplies, most cosmetics and skin care shoppers actually like being in stores to play with samples and try out new makeup techniques.That appeals to Ulta's core customer, the ""beauty enthusiast and beauty enthusiast on a budget,"" says the company's Settersten.""(They're) not so prone to this replenishment concept, so when you think about our e-commerce business it’s not people just necessarily price shopping or looking for convenience,"" he said.Plus, consumers can't exactly get a haircut over the internet.""(Ulta is a place to) have your hair done, your nails done, your eyebrows waxed,"" said RBC's Tunick. ""That’s what’s unique here.""

They thought I was a stupid person. A loser! Erin Gloria Ryan of Vocativ said I would start talking about the Japanese bombing of Pearl Jam and the Native Americans' Trail of Sears.

Turning 9/11 into 7-Eleven was the beginning of something huge. Phenomenal! The people at 7-Eleven -- great retailer, decent coffee, convenient! -- loved it. Loved it! They said to me: Mr. Trump, if you could mention us and other corporations more often at unexpected moments, we think it would really help to Make America Great Again. And I said: We will do even better. We will Make America Great Again by selling some of our greatest assets to you and to America's other great corporations.We are meeting here in the MapQuest Room of the Trump National White House because our new Crate & Barrel Cabinet Room is being refurnished. Next we'll have a drink in the Johnnie Walker Blue Room, and we'll eat in the Allstate Dining Room.

We are making only the best deals, throughout the Federal Express government and across the entire United States of American Eagle Outfitters.They said I couldn't unify the Republican Party. But then I renamed the Navy the Ted Cruz Line. They said I couldn't hold on to the evangelical Christians. But then I renamed the Liberty University Bell and Niagara Falwells.Most of all, they said I couldn't get rid of the entire federal debt -- $19 trillion! -- in one year. They said I was stupid -- a loser! But I traveled this land, from the Redwood Inn forest to the Gulfstream G650, and knew that everybody wanted to buy American! So I sold the Treasury Department to Citigroup, the Pentagon to Lockheed Martin, the Food and Drug Administration to Pfizer, HHS to CVS, the EPA to Waste Management, the FBI to Apple, the NSA to Google and the Grand Canyon to GMC. Great deals! China gave up all $1.3 trillion of our debt -- and all I had to give them was the Walt Disney Company. Phenomenal deal!Now we are placing corporations' names in amazing places -- the greatest -- and we are winning, winning, winning, and we are making a lot of money. A lot. We are bringing out the best in America, the fast and convenient spirit of 7-Eleven, and I say: Oh, thank heaven. We are Making America Great Again.(APPLAUSE)

233,CVS,"Drugmaker Allergan (AGN) got a price-target cut from Canaccord Genuity Thursday after the company hit a delay in its merger with Pfizer (PFE), among other issues.Analyst Corey Davis noted that on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had asked for additional information on the Pfizer-Allergan merger, which was first announced in November. The companies also have to wait until Allergan finishes divesting its generic-drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), which itself hit a delay this month that caused Teva to push the expected closing date from Q1 to June. Pfizer and Allergan still expect to close their $160 billion merger in the second half of this year.""In the meanwhile, we are lowering our Q1 estimates (EPS drops from $3.43 to $2.89) as it's always the weakest quarter for specialty pharma, and we feel the rest of the Street is also too high,"" Davis wrote in his research note lowering his price target on Allergan stock to 320 from 340. ""This has been a trend in the past several years and is partly because of the reset of Medicare Part D.""Davis added that the merger of Target (TGT) and CVS Health (CVS) should hit Allergan's distribution business to the tune of $500 million a year, and the launch of bowel-disease drug Viberzi has increased spending.Davis wrote that he is nonetheless maintaining his buy rating due to the high likelihood that the deal will close. There has been some skepticism among investors over whether the Pfizer-Allergan deal is going to close this year -- besides the signals from Allergan's falling stock price, a buy-side survey by Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum this month found that a fifth of respondents place the odds at less than 50%. Along with the FTC's backlog, there's concern that the incoming president and Congress might do something to limit tax-inversion deals like this one, as some candidates have threatened to do.Pfizer's leadership and Wall Street analysts have been more confident, however. On March 8, Deutsche Bank analyst Gregg Gilbert wrote that the gap between Pfizer's offer price and Allergan's stock price -- then $47 -- presents a buying opportunity as it will likely narrow as the deal closing nears.Allergan stock was down a fraction in morning trading on the stock market today, near 274.

234,CVS,"McKessson (MCK) announced up to $330 million in costs for restructuring, including layoffs, amid a consolidation wave led by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS).McKesson said in a regulatory filing Friday that its restructuring will result in a $300 million to $330 million charge this year, mostly for severance and employee-related costs. The company expects the cost alignment to save about $170 million-$190 million in the coming fiscal year starting April 1, and about $70 million-$80 million the following year.The Dallas Morning News said Wednesday that McKesson will lay off approximately 1,600 people, or 4% of its workforce, as it consolidates offices in Irving, Texas. Earlier this month, McKesson also agreed to buy Canadian drug store operator Rexall for $1.9 billion.In January, McKesson cut its fiscal 2016 earnings outlook and sees next year’s EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""Last year, Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance.Other upcoming headwinds include the end of a contract with UnitedHealth's (UNH) OptumRx health-services unit and the transitions of contracts with Ommicare and Target's (TGT) pharmacy business, which were bought by CVS.McKesson stock had been a steady performer for years, reaching an intraday high of 243.61 on May 19, 2015, before faltering. It's lost 35% of its value since then but rose 4.4% on the stock market today.Walgreens Boots Alliance closed up 0.8% on Friday. Rite Aid edged down 0.25%, and CVS Health climbed 0.5%.Meanwhile, Walgreens, which has a distribution partnership with AmerisourceBergen (ABC), exercised warrants to buy 22.7 million shares of the drug distributor for about $1.17 billion.Walgreens has the right to buy another 22.7 million shares beginning in March 2017.Amerisource shares rose 1.9%.

236,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) will use UnitedHealth (UNH) OptumRx for its pharmacy benefit needs, which could save companies and consumers billions.The pact likely negates the need for Walgreens making an expensive purchase of a large pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) like Express Scripts (ESRX), as some on Wall Street had speculated. Express Scripts shares fell 3.5% to 67.61 after falling as low as 65.97, near a 52-week low.Walgreens' agreement with UnitedHealth OptumRx will give it the ability to provide similar services and cost savings as arch-rival CVS Health (CVS), a combined drugstore and PBM.The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association separately launched an ad campaign Thursday touting savings from PBMs. The trade group said in a statement that PBMs, which negotiate prices and other terms between pharmacies and drugmakers/distributors, are projected to save employers, unions, government programs and consumers a combined $654 billion on drug benefit costs over the next decade.Currently the No. 2 drugstore chain by revenue, Walgreens is buying No. 3 Rite Aid (RAD), which has its own PBM, for an estimated $17.2 billion. If that deal goes through, Walgreens could choose to expand use of that PBM for the combined company.Walgreens said in a statement that the UnitedHealth OptumRx agreement includes a 90-day prescription option at Walgreens' nearly 8,200 pharmacies in the U.S., OptumRx home delivery, and 24/7 access to pharmacists.The drugstore company plans to integrate OptumRx's pharmacy care services with Walgreens' current drugstore services. The agreement will go into effect starting on Jan. 1, 2017.Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which operates nearly 13,000 locations in 11 countries, rose 1.5% to 83.30 in the stock market today. Walgreens stock has been in a first-stage consolidation for more than five months, with a 97.40 buy point. It's risen 16% from the 71.50 low point of the trough.Shares of CVS, which have also been in a more-than-five-month first-stage consolidation, were up 0.1% Thursday. Rite-Aid, a distant third in annual revenue behind CVS and Walgreens, rose 0.1% too. UnitedHealth slid 0.1% but closed well off intraday lows.

237,CVS,"FedEx (FDX) got a lower price target Thursday following the news that Amazon (AMZN) will lease planes for air cargo, while Coca-Cola (KO) and CVS Health (CVS) had their price targets raised.RBC Capital Markets cut its price target on FedEx to 153 from 157 and maintained its sector perform rating on the stock. The delivery company, along with peers such as UPS (UPS) and DHL, might feel a little pain from Amazon’s decision to operate its own fleet of jet freighters to deliver its packages.On Wednesday, Amazon confirmed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA) 767 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) as a way of grabbing more control over distribution and logistics amid rapid growth in its Prime service, which promises speedy delivery.FedEx shares closed down 0.1% on the stock market today. Amazon fell 0.1%, Boeing rose 0.1%, and Air Transport added 4.8%.Coca-Cola’s price target was raised to 55 from 47 by RBC Capital Markets, which maintained its outperform rating on the stock.In a Thursday morning note, RBC analyst Nik Modi said “we are at the precipice of Coca-Cola inflecting to a period of sustained outperformance, particularly among its consumer staples mega cap peers under our coverage.”Those peers include Proctor & Gamble (PG), Clorox (CL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), PepsiCo (PEP), Altria Group (MO) and Reynolds American (RAI).Coca-Cola’s stock price touched a new stock high of 44.83 on Wednesday and moved 0.9% higher Thursday.

238,CVS,"Investors sent shares of CVS Health (CVS) up 1% Tuesday after the second-largest drugstore chain reported fourth-quarter earnings that met analyst views on earnings and slightly beat expectations on the top line.CVS earned an adjusted $1.53 a share in the quarter, up 28% from a year earlier and in line with views. Revenue rose 11% from a year earlier to $41.15 billion, slightly above the $41.13 billion analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected.Same-store sales overall increased 3.5%, above analysts' views for a 2.1% gain. Pharmacy same-store sales were up 5%, but front-end same-store sales were down 0.5%, which management blamed on softer customer traffic, partially offset by an uptick in basket size. A mild flu season may have modestly impacted sales to the downside, analysts say.It was the first quarter that tobacco sales were not part of year-over-year comparisons. Tobacco products were eliminated in all stores in early September 2014.Pharmacy same-store sales would have been 470 basis points higher if not for recent generic introductions, the company said.Fourth-quarter revenue in the company's pharmacy services rose 11.1% to $26.5 billion, driven mostly by growth in its specialty pharmacy business, thanks to its acquisition of Omnicare in August. Pharmacy network claims in the quarter climbed 7.2% to 237.4 million claims.Chief Executive Larry Merlo noted that the company's pharmacy benefits management (PBM) side of the business has had a strong selling season for 2016, with gross client wins of $14.8 billion, which analysts figure add up to more than $1 billion of incremental wins late in the year vs. the company's previously disclosed wins.CVS's marketing pitch focused on its hybrid retail pharmacy and PBM businesses, which ""is resonating quite well in the marketplace,"" analyst Steven Valiquette of UBS told IBD. In the post-earnings conference call, management emphasized that the firm's PBM business is part of the solution, not the problem, since it aims to control drug spending, not increase it.""The pharmacy services segment continues to be a source of upside,"" analyst Ross Muken of Evercore ISI said in a note to investors.CVS didn't change its previous forecast for 2016 and the first quarter, which calls for adjusted earnings per share of $5.73 to $5.88 a share for the full year and $1.14 to $1.17 for the first quarter. The analyst forecast for Q1 is for $1.18 a share, and for the full year it's an estimated $5.83.That the company reaffirmed guidance ""should help quiet concerns of the macro malaise bleeding into what had been thought of as a highly defensive business,"" said Evercore's Muken.Shares of larger rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) rose 2.8%. No. 3 drugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD), which is being bought by Walgreens, added 0.1%.
"
239,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) on Tuesday said that a measure of growth in its pharmacy benefit clients' prescription-drug spending slowed to 5% last year from 11.8% in 2014.But ""(price) inflation in non-specialty brands outweighed all other trend drivers,"" the company said in a statement. Specialty drugs, as well as new launches and rising costs, ""had less impact than inflation of brands in high-volume categories such as drugs used to treat diabetes.""The announcement follows two years in which the price of specialty drugs has been under increased scrutiny.""The double-digit drug trend increases we were experiencing in 2014 resulted in a call to action from our clients to help them ensure their plan members could access the medications they need to stay healthy, at an affordable price,"" CVS Health Executive Vice President Jonathan Roberts said.CVS shares finished 0.7% lower in the stock market today. Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) fell 0.1% and Rite Aid (RAD), which Walgreens is buying, eased 0.1%.In 2014, the price of specialty drugs, exemplified by the near six-digit treatment price of hepatitis drugs from Gilead Sciences (GILD), became a lightning rod for criticism. Pharmacy benefit managers such as CVS and Express Scripts (ESRX) have since negotiated discounts from drugmakers in exchange for coverage.In 2015, the lightning rod became the practice of some companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals, which bought obscure drugs on the cheap and hiked their prices.CVS has tried to curb usage of Valeant's Jublia, a toenail fungus drug that reportedly has a retail price of around $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle. On Monday, according to Bloomberg, CVS said it would launch an optional program in April intended to steer patients toward cheaper treatments.CVS clients' spending on Jublia soared 950% last year, Bloomberg said, adding that Express Scripts said it would also try to bring down the price of toenail fungus treatments.Gilead Sciences shares dipped 0.8%, Express Scripts closed down 0.6%, and Valeant climbed 4.4%.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
240,CVS,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Perrigo (PRGO) shares continued to tumble Monday, generally pulling the drug sector down with them. Allergan (AGN) was an exception, rising on strong earnings.Valeant late Monday tumbled as low as 68 -- which would be the lowest since March 2013 -- on a Dow Jones report that Valeant Pharmaceuticals would likely restate earnings. Hours later Valeant said a restatement for 2014 and 2015 earnings is expected, related to sales of drugs to ex-distributor Philidor. Valeant said $58 million in sales in late 2014 should have been recognized later. Valeant expects 2014 earnings to be lowered by 10 cents a share, with 2015 EPS lifted by 9 cents.During the regular session, Valeant shares closed down 10.7% at 75.92  in the stock market today, extending losses on a bearish report from Wells Fargo Friday. Valeant shares dived nearly 10% that day after Wells Fargo initiated coverage on the maker of branded drugs to treat eye diseases, acne, depression and other ailments with an underperform, saying there were ""unanswered questions"" about its accounting methods and strategic direction.Earlier Monday, drugstore giant CVS Health (CVS) said it plans to restrict use of Valeant's Jublia toenail fungus drug as part of an initiative to cut costs for dermatology treatments. Jublia retails at about $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle, according to the website GoodRx.Valeant stock price has plunged 69% from a Sept. 21 intraday high at 245.82 despite double-digit quarterly earnings and revenue growth for nearly four years. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund is down significantly this year partly because of the fund's large stake in Valeant.Valeant had already been battered by a series of events including the absence of CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications. On Jan. 6, Valeant's board named board member and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller A interim CEO.Earlier this month, Valeant interim CEO Schiller was called before Congress to explain why the company decided to increase the prices of two cardiac drugs by 525% and 212%. Schiller promised to end an era of sharp price hikes.Perrigo, whose business model is divided between private-label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugs, fell 4.1% to 124.08 Monday to its lowest level since late 2013.The stock has lost 15% over three sessions, after Perrigo reported weak fourth quarter results on Thursday and subsequently had negative reports by Jefferies on Friday and by Goldman Sachs on Monday.Jefferies cut its price target to 163 from 209 although it maintained a buy rating. Goldman Sachs, however, downgraded the stock from neutral to sell, with a 124 price target, reports said.Perrigo reported $1.80 Q4 EPS minus one-time items, 13 cents below estimates. It was the company's first earnings miss in five quarters. Revenue grew 33% to $1.425 billion. Analysts expected $1.461 billion.Mylan (MYL) last year made an offer for Perrigo, which Perrigo shareholders in mid-November rejected. Mylan rose 3.2% Monday.Big pharma Allergan (AGN) reported what it expects to be its final full earnings report as an independent drug maker after it agreed in November to be bought by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion.Allergan's Q4 EPS ex items rose 33% to $3.41 on a 74% hike in revenue to $4.2 billion. Wall Street expected $3.34 EPS and $4.19 billion revenue.Allergan shares climbed 3.7% to 285.82. Pfizer rose 1.9%.But IBD's generic drugs and ethical (branded) drug groups were among the rare losers on an otherwise strong day for stocks.

241,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance's (WBA) proposed merger with smaller U.S. rival Rite Aid (RAD) isn't a done deal yet, since regulators need to greenlight the $17 billion deal first.But analyst Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research put out a report this week questioning whether the merger will be approved.After visiting with management last week, he wrote: ""We have even more doubt that the merger with (Rite Aid) will be approved.""""While clearly not trying to, (Walgreens) appeared to make a good case against the deal,"" Mushkin said.Mushkin says management indicated that independent pharmacies tend to be located in areas that are not of interest to chain pharmacies such as Walgreens, Rite Aid and No. 2 drug store retailer  CVS Health (CVS) -- rural locations, for example -- and that those non-chain providers also are focused on providing specialized services ""that do not make sense for chain drug stores."" Without independent pharmacies playing in the same market to offer competition to these bigger players, it may not sit well with regulators.Mushkin also said that Walgreens indicated it has some potential buyers lined up for unwanted Rite Aid stores, but the government ""may be concerned"" whether any buyers would actually turn in viable offers, given tough industry dynamics and subpar assets that would be offered. That could further limit competition.The Obama administration has become more skeptical of big takeovers over time. The FTC in December took legal action to block Staples' (SPLS) takeover of Office Depot (ODP), the No. 1 and No. 2 office supply chains. Staples plans to fight the deal in court.Walgreens' management noted that it also would seek to merge some Rite Aid locations into Walgreens stores and viewed Rite Aid stores as ""generally inferior"" to Walgreens stores, Mushkin wrote.""Perhaps even more important is that after listening to management, we expect that as Rite Aid's leases come up for renewal, (Walgreens) would look to actively prune Rite Aid's store base,"" he said.Mushkin concluded: ""This is a great profit enhancer for Walgreens Boots Alliance, but a potentially significant choice reducer for the consumer.""Walgreens has previously said the acquisition of Rite Aid and its 4,500 stores is going as planned. It's expected to close in the latter half of this year.Despite Mushkin's doubts, Rite Aid stock has been holding steady in 2016 while Walgreens falls. Rite Aid rose 0.25% to 7.89 on the stock market today. Walgreens slid 2.1% after announcing plans to offer 58 million shares on behalf of Alliance Boots shareholders.

243,CVS,"When gasoline is cheap, people figure out a way to put more miles on their cars, whether it’s taking a road trip they might otherwise skip or driving to work instead of riding the bus.That’s good news for businesses that sell gasoline, such as convenience stores, as well as the companies that rent out the spaces for those stores. That latter group includes National Retail Properties (NNN), a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that specializes in buying retail sites and leasing them back to the retailer.National Retail has seen its share price hit record highs in recent weeks amid a strong operating environment for two of its main focus areas: restaurants and convenience stores. Those two sectors accounted for 18.2% and 16.7% of its annualized base rent, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2015.The restaurant and convenience store sectors are both seeing an uptick in business, thanks to favorable macro trends, National Retail Chief Executive Craig Macnab said on a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts last month.“The decline in the price of oil is assisting the gas margins realized by our convenience store tenants, who are obtaining elevated margins at the pump,” Macnab said. “Our restaurant tenants are also performing well, with many of them experiencing same-store sales growth, which obviously assists them in their ability to pay out rents.”D.A. Davidson analyst Barry Oxford offered a similar view on a fourth-quarter earnings report, saying the convenience store sector “has been benefiting from increased margins at the pump due to the drop in oil.”He says National Retail’s high exposure to convenience stores has helped offset risks related to the company’s large exposure to oil-rich Texas, where about 20% of its portfolio is located.“While drops in oil have hurt the local Houston economy, the state as a whole is less threatened by the depressed commodity,” Oxford said. “Economic growth in cities such as Dallas and San Antonio still appears healthy. In addition, 40% of the Texas portfolio exposure for National Retail is convenience stores, which can benefit from lower oil prices.”The favorable operating environment is reflected in National Retail’s recent stock performance. Its shares touched an all-time high of 46.14 on Feb. 11 and are up about 10% since the beginning of the year.Although National Retail doesn’t set the world on fire in terms of financial growth, it is solidly profitable and can usually be counted on to produce quarterly revenue gains in the low double digits. It also has increased its annual dividend 26 years in a row.During the fourth quarter, National Retail reported funds from operations of 56 cents a share, flat with the previous year and a penny below consensus estimates. REITs use funds from operations to measure the cash flow from their operations. They pay no income tax if they pass the bulk of their income on to shareholders. National Retail paid a dividend yield of 4.3% at Dec. 31.Fourth-quarter revenue rose 10% from the previous year to $124.6 million, topping views. The portfolio occupancy rate was 99.1% at the close of the quarter, up from 98.6% a year earlier. The weighted average lease term was 11.4 years, Oxford reported.“About 75% of (National Retail’s) leases have rental increases tied to (consumer price) growth, allowing them to be protected from inflation,” Oxford said.The company ended 2015 with 2,038 properties in 47 states. Its portfolio included 22.1 million square feet of space, and more than 400 tenants in 38 retail categories, with assets totaling $5.2 billion. Lessees include high profile names such as CVS Health (CVS), privately held LA Fitness, AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) and 7-Eleven convenience stores. National Retail typically signs 15- to 20-year leases.The company usually operates under a “triple net” lease agreement. Under this agreement, the tenant is solely responsible for all of the costs related to the asset being leased, as well as the lease’s rent fees. Those costs include real estate taxes, as well as insurance and common area maintenance. The term “triple net” refers to these three different types of costs.RBC Capital Markets analyst Rich Moore notes that the triple net sector is the largest in commercial real estate, with as much as $2 trillion worth of product in the U.S. Most of the growth comes via acquisitions.“(National Retail) management is actively reviewing transactions, and we expect overall acquisition activity to exceed expectations over the next 18 months,” Moore said in a recent report. ""Importantly, the company is sitting in a very strong position with regard to capital access, which could ultimately make a heavier acquisition pace -- or the addition of a portfolio -- even more attractive.""Last year, National Retail acquired 221 net lease retail properties at a cost of about $726 million. The vast majority were small deals, purchased from existing tenants at an average of $3.3 million per property.“Only one of our deals in 2015 was larger than $50 million in size, and we did not have competition on this particular transaction,” CEO Macnab said on the conference call.National Retail also sold 19 properties during the year, with net proceeds of $39 million.“Management guided for full-year 2016 acquisition volumes to be $400 million to $500 million, and dispositions to be $75 million to $100 million,” Oxford said.Following its Q4 earnings report, National Retail raised its full-year 2016 FFO guidance to a range of $2.29 to $2.35 a share, up a penny from prior guidance of $2.28 to $2.34 a share.

246,CVS,"The off-price channel continues to show strength as TJX (TJX) posted fourth-quarter results that comfortably topped expectations and announced a dividend hike and share buyback. Separately, big-box retailer Target (TGT) missed views but its same-store sales and better-than-expected guidance were enough to reassure Wall Street.TJX's Q4 earnings rose 6.5% to 99 cents per share, a nickel above views. Revenue grew 8% to $8.96 billion, ahead of forecasts for $8.73 billion. Same-store sales rose 6%, with positive comp growth in all segments. TJX is the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods.Comps and EPS growth ""significantly"" exceeded the company's own expectations, said CEO Ernie Herrman.""Once again, customer traffic drove our entire consolidated comp increase,"" he said in prepared remarks. ""It was also the primary driver of our comp increases at every division in the fourth quarter and full year as we continued delivering consumers a differentiated offering at extreme value. We are convinced that we are gaining market share profitably around the world.""TJX also announced plans to hike its regular quarterly dividend by 24% to 26 cents a share and said it will repurchase $1.5 billion to $2 billion in shares during the year.For 2017, TJX sees $3.29 to $3.38 in diluted per-share earnings, which includes the impact of currency exchange and a previously announced wage initiative. Analysts currently expect $3.61.The company expects the same factors to weigh on Q1, and is expecting 68 cents to 70 cents in earnings per share for the quarter, below current Wall Street views for 74 cents.That doesn't worry Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen.""Though we acknowledge FY17 guide was below St, we believe stock should hold up given history of conservatism in guide and quality/sustainability of (off-price) business model,"" he wrote Wednesday.TJX shares closed up 2.1%. Rival Ross Stores (ROST) shares added 1.6% in the stock market today.Meanwhile, Target said it earned $1.52 per adjusted share in Q4, a 1% rise from last year and 2 cents below views. Sales dipped 0.6% to $21.63 billion, just shy of consensus estimates for $21.75 billion.Comps grew 1.9%, above estimates and driven by 1.3% traffic growth. That gain was offset by the impact of the sale of its pharmacies and clinics to CVS Health (CVS), said Target. Online sales climbed 34%.Despite the earnings and revenue misses, Target shares rose 4% as investors focused on the better-than-expected comp and digital growth, as well as guidance. Chen wrote in a separate note that he was ""impressed"" by Target's Q4 traffic-led comp beat, ""digital outperformance"" and continued strength in its signature categories of baby, wellness, kids and style.He reiterated an outperform rating on the stock, as Target is ""gaining share in a difficult backdrop.""For the year, the retailer expects to earn an adjusted $5.20 to $5.40 per share, well above current analyst forecasts for $5.16 a share. For Q1, Target sees $1.15 to $1.25 in adjusted earnings per share, the midpoint of which is a penny above views for $1.19 a share.Major competitor Wal-Mart (WMT), by contrast, cut its sales guidance for the year and missed Q4 revenue forecasts when it reported in mid-February.

Both metrics exclude discontinuing operations, notably Allergan's Global Generics business that it agreed to sell in July.The Global Generics unit carries the old Actavis name and generic drugs lines of business. Actavis had purchased specialty drug and Botox maker Allergan, a deal that closed in March, and renamed itself Allergan.Allergan stock rose 3.7% in the stock market today, to 285.82, 16% off its all-time high of 340.34, touched July 29. Pfizer (PFE) stock rose 1.9% Monday to 30.05, 18% below a nearly 12-year high set July 31 at 36.46.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q4 EPS of $3.34 minus items, down 14.6% from $3.91 in 2014, on revenue of $4.192 billion, up 3.4% from Q4 2014's $4.057 billion, although analyst numbers apparently were not uniformly adjusted for discontinuing operations. Allergan presented the pro forma year-earlier numbers as adjusted EPS of $2.57 and revenue of $2.4 billion.For the full year, Allergan said non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations increased 78% to $13.43 on revenue from continuing operations up 124% to $15.07 billion. With varying adjustments, for the full 2015 analysts expected $15.43 per share minus items, up 66% from $9.29 in 2014, on sales of $18.206 billion, up 117% from $8.380 billion in 2014.Allergan reported a Q4  GAAP loss from continuing operations of $2.13 per share, compared to a GAAP loss from continuing operations of $4.48 per share in the prior-year period. It said full GAAP results were impacted by amortization and acquisition expenses, license agreements, impairments, and severance related mainly to the acquisition of Allergan on March 17,  and Kythera on Oct. 1, as well as research and development expenses resulting from the purchase of R&D assets of Mimetogen.Allergan had declined to freshen its guidance upon issuing its Q3 performance Nov. 4, citing early merger discussions with Pfizer back then. But Monday it guided 2016 revenue to about $17 billion, with ""no material changes to gross margins"" from current levels and a non-GAAP tax rate ""normalized"" to about 14%. Management didn't specify EPS for the year nor offer Q1 guidance other than suggesting Q1 performance would be the weakest of the year and fall below Q4 2015 results.Allergan's 2015 results were an analyst's challenge, influenced by its extraordinary M&A dance card. In Q3, it began discontinuing operations of the renamed Actavis generic lines, which it agreed to sell to Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in July for $40 billion.By Nov. 23, Allergan's board agreed to Pfizer's offer of 11.3 Pfizer shares for each Allergan share, then valuing Allergan at $363.63 a share, or $160 billion for the entire deal, expected to take nine months to close. CEO Brent Saunders told analysts in a conference call following the Q4 earnings release that he still expects the Pfizer buyout to close in the second half of 2016. It would be the second-largest acquisition ever, after the sale of Vodafone AirTouch in 1999 to Mannesmann for $202 billion. Dell's October offer to buy EMC (EMC) is valued at $67 billion. The Pfizer acquisition of Allergan is another in a thinning number of tax inversion deals that allow American companies to domicile in Ireland, Allergan's home base, where the buyer may enjoy a lower tax base. The Obama administration has criticized the practice and thrown up speed bumps, if not road blocks.On Feb. 8,  Pfizer said it plans to reorganize its two broad lines of business into three after the merger with Allergan is complete.Allergan CFO Tessa Hilado told analysts that debt stood at $42.7 billion on Dec. 31 and that $8 billion would be paid down after the close of the Teva sale. She put revenue from top-seller Botox at $656 million in Q4, with eye drug Restasis at $365 million, and Namenda XR at $190 million.  She said the CVS (CVS) purchase of Target (TGT) pharmacies ""had an effect in Q4"" on revenue, but that it didn't and wouldn't impact earnings.

254,CVS,"They call it stormy December, but January was  -- worse.On the heels of December's 1.58% decline in the S&P 500 and 2.80% tumble for U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, in January the broad market lost 4.96% and U.S. diversified stock funds dove 6.25%, according to Lipper Inc.It was the sixth worst January for the big-cap bogey in the past 47 years. And in that span it was the third worst opening month to a year for U.S. diversified stock funds as a group.Click Here To See List Of Top Performing Mutual Funds Past 6 MonthsThere was no mystery about the main culprits. Investors worried about stock market news that harped on China's economic slowdown and speculated about how badly it would affect the global economy -- including that of the U.S.And investors fretted about oil's declining price. Light sweet crude, for example, fell from $37.04 a barrel to $33.62 by January's end. It closed below $30 on five trading days.""China and oil are two of the reasons for the weak market in January,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. ""I would also throw into the mix the strong dollar, high inventories, weak manufacturing sector and the political cycle.""Still, the market trended higher in its final eight sessions. Why? Credit the Federal Reserve, Orlando says. On Jan. 27, the Fed signaled that its decisions regarding future rate hikes ""would be dovish, data dependent and cautious,"" Orlando said.That was in stark contrast to the Fed's quarter-percentage-point rate hike in December.Also, Japan's central bank went to negative interest rates on certain bank reserves -- a move that bolsters stocks by making them more attractive than cash.The Federal Reserve action preceded by two days the Bureau of Economic Analysis' release of its advance estimate of GDP growth in the fourth quarter: annualized 0.7% growth, lower than Q3's 2% gain and slightly below market expectations of 0.8% for Q4.So investors, who were already spooked by the five indicators that Orlando cites, were relieved by the BEA's move, which virtually wiped out the prospect of three or four rates hikes in 2016. ""And when the Fed does make its next rate hike, investors know that that will be a sign of the Fed's faith that the economy is strong enough to handle it,"" Orlando said.Orlando believes that the Fed won't lift its rate again until the U.S. sees a quarter with 2% annualized GDP growth. ""July is the earliest we might see sufficiently strong data,"" he said. ""Then September is the next time that they'd be likely to raise the rate.""A 9.03% gain made dedicated short-bias funds the best-performing mutual funds among all U.S. diversified stock funds in January.Click Here To See The Top-Performing Stock And Bond Mutual Fund CategoriesAmong just market capitalization and style categories within U.S. diversifieds, large-cap core funds did best by losing the least, 5.35% in the month. Equity-income funds gave up even less: -3.92%.Top large-cap growth managers included Frank Caruso, whose AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) fell 6.08% last month.Reflecting the flight to safe havens, commodities precious metals funds paced all sectors, gaining 2.53%.Also reflecting the flight to safety, U.S. Treasury bond funds leapt 3.45% as taxable-bond funds overall lost 0.34% in the month.Latin American funds led foreign-region stock funds by losing the least, -4.30%.Orlando expects the market blahs to continue until about midyear.""I don't think China is going into recession,"" he said. ""Consumers are doing well there, but it will take a couple of quarters for investors to figure that out. Consumers in China will offset weakness in manufacturing by midyear.""By midyear, investors should also see that the U.S. dollar has stopped strengthening altogether, or at least as fast as it has, he adds. ""That dollar stabilization will make it easier for U.S. megacaps to export, which will boost corporate earnings,"" he said.Corporate inventories are already falling, he says. ""So we might see a restocking-cycle kick off in the second half of the year, which would boost manufacturing,"" he said.The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index jumped to 55.6 in January from 42.9 in December, the highest pace of growth in a year. When that barometer tops 50, it's a sign of growth in the manufacturing sector. ""It was in contraction mode the last six months,"" Orlando said.As for politics, only once in the past 75 years has the party in power extended control of the White House to a third straight term. Concern about weak growth in jobs and wages should help swing control of the presidency to Republicans, Orlando says. And that should be good for business interests.With his eyes glued to midyear, Orlando expects that the technology, consumer-discretionary and industrial sectors to lead the breakout. That should benefit tech-hardware makers, chipmakers, automakers, homebuilders and airlines, he says.""Once the Fed starts to tighten again, then financials ought to work better,"" he said.In the meantime, his focus is on lower-beta, higher-dividend stocks. Names that he likes include Exxon Mobile (XOM) and Royal Dutch (RDSA).""In the first half of the year, we have overweights in Europe and Japan vs. the U.S.,"" he said. ""We're overweight in developed foreign markets but underweight in emerging markets.""Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of $1.6 billion T. Rowe Price Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $203 million Large Cap (TRULX), also expects ""a pretty tough year."" To cope with slower earnings growth, he has beefed up what he calls quality and higher-yield stocks. He's also been looking for early cyclical stocks with sound fundamentals, whose prices have been beaten up.In railroads, he began to buy Kansas City Southern (KSU) late last year. ""In a recovery, it should do well,"" he said. The stock is 32% off its 52-week high. Earnings fell 6% last year and are expected to increase 1% this year and 13% next year.In financials, he likes Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). ""They take advantage of volatility,"" he said. Intercontinental provides a market for derivatives, which many investors use to hedge volatility.He also likes American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), two REITs that own wireless towers. Their long-term contracts with telecom carriers give them ""fantastic recurring revenue businesses that should do well in a more stressed economic environment,"" he said.And in consumer staples he owns CVS (CVS), PepsiCo (PEP) and Philip Morris International (PM).In fixed income, he expects bonds generally to look more appealing if the Fed is forced to pause its rate hikes. In that scenario, bond prices should stabilize rather than decline.Rottinghaus would like to find commodities stocks that have been dragged down by their sector or industry group -- more than their own fundamentals call for. ""Those companies could do well over the next couple of years,"" he said. ""But they're still not there yet.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

255,CVS,"New ad formats helped Alphabet (GOOGL) -owned video wing YouTube attract more ad revenue throughout last year, even as YouTube's share of the market is expected to recede as competitors led by Facebook (FB) muscle in to the segment, according to an eMarketer report released Wednesday.U.S. video ad revenue growth for YouTube in the U.S. will fall 6.2% in 2017, eMarketer estimates, and YouTube's share of the video ad market will slip. The decreases reflect growing competition as Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), Yahoo (YHOO), Vimeo and others push further into ad-supported video. YouTube, however, will remain No. 1, with a 17.7% share of the total U.S. video ad revenue pie in 2017, says the report.Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) were the biggest ad spenders on YouTube in 2015, the report said, citing Pixability, the YouTube ad-buying and video-marketing platform that examined how much the National Retail Federation's top-10 U.S. brands spent quarter by quarter on YouTube last year.Wal-Mart upped its spending from $600,000 in Q1 to $2.5 million in Q4, and spent $5.2 million for the year, according to the report. Target shelled out $57,000 in Q1, $1.8 million in Q4 and $2.8 million for the year, the report said.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) also increased its spending during the year, from $12,000 in Q1 to $88,000 in Q4, and a total of $151,000 for the year.In April, YouTube introduced Trueview, a video ad ""buy button"" that lets users buy items by clicking on a banner inside the ad. Trueview has boosted ad spending, says the report.But not every brand boosted their spending on YouTube last year, eMarketer found.Amazon.com (AMZN), Lowe's (LOW), The Home Depot (HD) and CVS (CVS) decreased their spending during the course of 2015. E-commerce king Amazon spent about $1.7 million on digital video advertising on YouTube in Q1, but just $162,000 in Q4, the report said.In U.S. digital advertising, Google's share is expected to dip nearly 5% to 36.6% in 2015, according to estimates from eMarketer. That follows a 3% drop to 38.4% in 2014.

256,CVS,"McKesson (MCK) on Monday cut its fiscal 2016 earnings-per-share outlook and sees next year's EPS getting hit by 85 cents, citing weak generic-drug prices and ""recent customer consolidation.""The drug distributor's grim forecasts come after Rite Aid (RAD), with which McKesson has a distribution deal, agreed last year to be acquired by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), which has a distribution partnership with AmerisourceBergen (ABC). The merger cast into doubt McKesson's long relationship with Rite Aid.For the fiscal year ending March 31, McKesson now expects EPS of $12.60-$12.90, down from an earlier forecast of $12.50-$13.00, saying that its profits will be lower than expected during the second half of the year. Analysts expected $12.83.McKesson also expects fiscal 2017 EPS growth of 7%-12%, from the 2016 forecast issued Monday. Analysts expect 13% growth. The company will update 2017 guidance when it reports Q4 results, likely in May.Shares gapped down and finished 10.3% lower in the stock market today. Rival AmerisourceBergen fell 4%. Cardinal Health (CAH), another distributor, fell around 5.5%.Walgreens ended essentially unchanged, while Rite Aid dipped 0.3%. CVS Health (CVS) rose 1.5%.McKesson's headwinds for 2017 also reflect the expiration of its contract with health services company Optum and ""the transition of its contracts with (elder-health company) Omnicare and Target (TGT)."" But McKesson expects its current partnership with Rite Aid to ""continue through the end of fiscal 2017.""The forecasts could signify a considerable misstep for the company, FBR analyst Steven Halper said in a note Monday.""Over the years, MCK has rarely had an operational hiccup such as this in its core pharma segment,"" he wrote. ""It remains to be seen if the issues are temporary or more structural in nature.""The company, which buys drugs, holds them and supplies them to drugstores, said that it was reviewing its administrative cost structure for the fourth quarter. Drug distributors' profits hinge on the difference between the prices that manufacturers charge them to buy the drugs and the prices that they can charge in selling the drugs to retailers.The EPS outlook for 2016 does not include any restructuring that the review may bring, the company said.McKesson reports third-quarter earnings on Jan. 27.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

257,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said that its acquisition of smaller rival Rite Aid (RAD) is going as planned, as the drugstore chain turned in mixed first-quarter results and lifted the lower end of its full-year guidance.Earnings easily came out ahead of expectations, rising 27% to $1.03 a share, vs. views for 96 cents. But hefty revenue growth of 48.5% to $29 billion, primarily due to the 2014 merger of Walgreen with Alliance Boots, was not enough to top forecasts for $29.24 billion.Walgreens narrowed its annual earnings outlook by a nickel to $4.30-$4.55 from $4.25-$4.55 a share. Analysts expect EPS of $4.40.Walgreens' guidance assumes no material boost from the Rite Aid acquisition, which was first announced in late October and is expected to close in the latter half of this year. Both companies have received anticipated second requests from the Federal Trade Commission regarding the acquisition.Walgreens shares closed up 1.9% on the stock market today. Rite Aid dipped 0.9%. Rival CVS Health (CVS) eased 1.4%.""Even though EPS was much better than expectations, it's unlikely the stock will be up significantly, given the difficulty in interpreted numbers that have no comparison, the fact that adjusted operating income was lower than expected, and the company only raised the lower end of its adjusted cash FY16 EPS guidance range higher by $0.05,"" wrote Barclays analyst Meredith Adler.The company's U.S. retail pharmacy segment, which includes Walgreens and Duane Reade, saw total sales rise 4.2% in Q1, with same-store sales up 5.8%.The international retail pharmacy segment, which includes Boots and Benavides, had $3.5 billion in Q1 total sales. Comps rose 2.2% on a pro forma constant currency basis, with Walgreens citing ""particularly strong growth"" in Mexico and Ireland.The wholesale pharmaceutical division racked up $5.8 billion in sales in the first quarter, with 3.1% comp growth on a pro forma constant currency basis, minus acquisitions and dispositions.Walgreen combined with Alliance Boots in 2014 after acquiring the rest of the European drugstore company that it did not already own. Walgreens Boots Alliance divides results into domestic retail pharmacy, international retail pharmacy and wholesale pharmaceutical segments. Year-over-year results comparisons are not directly comparable as a result of reporting changes from the merger.Last month, beleaguered drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) struck a 20-year deal with Walgreens to offer treatments previously sold through the now-shuttered Philidor and to cut prices on generics.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Rite Aid Sales Slip; WellCare Shifts PBM WorkValeant To Cut Drug Prices In Team-Up With Walgreens.

260,CVS,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) on Tuesday issued 2016 earnings-per-share guidance of $6.08 to $6.28, solidly above views for $6.04, but analysts expressed concerns about the company's contract with health insurer Anthem (ANTM).Express Scripts shares settled 0.6% lower in the stock market today, after rising as much as 2% earlier. Anthem closed up 0.5%.In a conference call discussing the outlook, Express Scripts said it was reviewing the pricing of its contract with Anthem, its largest client, and expected the companies to reach a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement, according to Reuters. But it was unclear when an agreement would be struck and what it would look like.Given the absence of an agreement, the guidance issued Tuesday did not reflect any potential changes to Express' contract with Anthem. The terms of 10-year agreement, which began in 2009, allow the companies to re-evaluate pricing occasionally, Reuters said.""Questions regarding its long-term relationship with Anthem will continue to be a concern for investors,"" FBR said in a note.Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said the review presented ""a number of variables that prevent clarity on timing or financial ramifications.""And contracts aside, BMO analyst Jennifer Lynch said in a note Tuesday that she did ""not view the newly issued guidance as a game-changer to the story.""Express held to its EPS guidance this year of $5.51 to $5.55. Analysts expect $5.53. The company sees 2016 adjusted claims of 1.255 billion to 1.295 billion, roughly in line with guidance this year.Still, management during the call said it was happy with initial results from the selling season, Muken said.""Our focused model of alignment has positioned us uniquely in the health care services landscape to improve health outcomes and lower costs for our clients and patients,"" CEO George Paz said in a statement.Most recently, Express Scripts this month said it would partner with Imprimis Pharmaceuticals (IMMY) to promote what it called a cheaper alternative to Daraprim, the toxoplasmosis drug that became some 5,000% more expensive this year after it was acquired by Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals.CVS Health (CVS), which bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark in 2007, finished up 2.4%.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

Rite Aid attributed the decline to lower income tax expenses the year before, an increase in interest and amortization expense related to its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager EnvisionRx, plus $9.8 million in transaction costs related to its pending merger with Walgreens.Walgreens said in late October that it would acquire Rite Aid for $9 per share in cash, reflecting a total enterprise value of $17.2 billion. The deal is seen closing in the second half of next year.Rite Aid revenue grew 22% to $8.15 billion, just missing consensus estimates for $8.18 billion. The company reported pharmacy service segment sales of $1.5 billion and retail pharmacy segment sales growth of 0.8% to $6.7 billion, driven by same-store sales.Retail pharmacy segment's same-store drugstore sales rose 0.9%.For 2016, Rite Aid said in September that it expects 12-19 cents in diluted per-share earnings on $30.8 billion-$31.1 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate 17 cents EPS on $30.9 billion in revenue for the year.Due to the merger, Rite Aid will not further update its 2016 guidance or issue a 2017 outlook.Shares closed down 0.3% in the stock market Thursday. Walgreens shares fell 1.6%.Rival CVS Health (CVS) on Wednesday lifted its full-year 2016 guidance to $5.73-$5.88 and hiked its quarterly dividend by 21%.

299,CVS,"Rite Aid, the No. 3 pharmacy that will soon merge with Walgreens Boots Alliance, said its December same-store sales edged down 0.1%.The drugstore chain, which operates more than 4,500 stores, said pharmacy comparable sales dipped 0.6%, and prescription count comps fell 0.4%, while front-end comps rose 0.8%. Total drugstore sales for the four weeks ended Dec. 26 were flat, year over year, at $2.2 billion.On Dec. 17, Rite Aid (RAD) reported mixed Q3 results as costs related to its acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) EnvisionRx weighed on profit. The company said it ""remains comfortable"" with its current full-year guidance as it awaits the upcoming merger, which is seen closing in the second half of 2016.Separately, government-sponsored managed-care services provider WellCare Health Plans (WCG) is shifting its PBM work over to the second-largest such manager, CVS Health (CVS). The transition — which includes 3.8 million members who participate in the company's Medicaid, Medicare and Prescription Drug Plan — takes place Jan. 1.Earlier in December, CVS bumped up its full-year 2016 guidance and lifted its quarterly dividend by 21%.Meanwhile, Canada's pension funds, money managers and corporations went on an overseas buying spree in 2015 to acquire a record-setting $205 billion in foreign assets, driving the country's deal total to an eight-year high.In all, there were $281 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions involving Canadian firms through Dec. 30, up 34% from a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the second-highest total on record behind 2007, when Canadians were involved in $315 billion worth of transactions, the data show. The figures and rankings are based on announced date and subject to change as more deals are recorded.The size of the deals involving Canadian firms were also uncharacteristically large last year with the four biggest deals worth in excess of $10 billion for the first time since 2006, according to the data.Canada OutboundThe volume of foreign acquisitions by Canadian firms almost tripled in 2015 from last year, to a record $205 billion. That's almost double the previous peak of $112 billion in 2007.""Our central thesis has been to bring Canada to the world and the world to Canada and that remains intact. The pension funds are clearly a dominant factor here,"" said Bruce Rothney, chief executive officer of Barclays in Canada.Canada Pension Plan Investment Board led the charge for outbound acquisitions — the country's largest pension fund was involved in roughly $60.4 billion worth of deals last year, the data shows.That included its largest solo acquisition to date, when it agreed to buy General Electric's U.S. leveraged loan business from GE Capital in June in a deal valued at $12 billion.

"
301,CVS,"The name Evercore Partners (EVR) may not sound familiar, but you've probably heard of its clients, some of the biggest names in corporate America and beyond: DuPont (DD), Nokia (NOK) and CVS Health (CVS), to name a few.
"
302,CVS,"There's nothing small about Evercore's clients.
"
303,CVS,"The most high profile work of late by the financial advisory firm has been as a consultant to DuPont in its pending $68 billion merger with Dow Chemical (DOW) and to tech company EMC (EMC) on its potential sale to Dell. The $67 billion EMC/Dell merger, which has yet to be consummated, would be the largest-ever marriage of two technology companies.
"
304,CVS,"Analyst Doug Sipkin of Susquehanna Financial Group said in a note to clients that Evercore is one of the top M&A destinations in the investment banking industry. And despite its relatively anonymous status, it's starting to make the hard climb into greater prosperity.
"
305,CVS,"Take the firm's fees. Sipkin notes that its fee share on deal work through the first nine months of this year was 5.5%, still robust, though down from 6% in 2014. Fee-share gains will be tougher to get, and that's a good thing, Sipkin says.
"
306,CVS,"""Share gains will be harder this year and tougher going forward, as Evercore moves to the upper ranks of the fee league table,"" Sipkin wrote in his note. ""We do believe this is a testament to the strong hiring efforts and execution of senior management.""
"
307,CVS,"Independent Bank
"
308,CVS,"Evercore is an independent investment bank, with most of its revenue derived from advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings and other transactions. Its acquisition of ISI Group last year brought in a well-regarded investment research arm.
"
309,CVS,"Evercore itself also has some illustrious names behind it. It was co-founded in 1995 by its executive chairman, Roger Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, and Austin Beutner, a former general partner at the Blackstone Group (BX).
"
310,CVS,"Their connections and those of Evercore's top bankers have helped attract work on some of the biggest deals stretching as far back as a decade ago, such as AT&T's (T) acquisition of BellSouth and General Motors' (GM) sale of its $7.9 billion stake in GMAC, both in 2006.
"
311,CVS,"Evercore has gotten a lot bigger over that decade, with revenue rising from $217 million to nearly $1.2 billion this year. But it's still much smaller than the big investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), for example, or even investment bank Jefferies Group, owned by Leucadia (LUK).
"
312,CVS,"Better-than-expected advisory fees caused revenue and earnings in the third quarter, ending Sept. 30, to beat analysts' views. Adjusted earnings in the quarter rose 14% from the earlier year to 81 cents a share on revenue of $305.6 million, which was up 36%. Investment banking made up $280 million of that total and was up 41% from last year. Of that, $218 million was in advisory fees, $58 billion in equities, commissions and fees and another $4.5 million in underwriting.
"
313,CVS,"Bigger Deals
"
314,CVS,"While the number of deals didn't increase, the average deal size was ""considerably higher,"" Altman said in the quarterly conference call.
"
315,CVS,"Other advisory work called out in the quarter was for Centene's (CNC) soon-to-be-complete $6.8 billion purchase of Health Net (HNT) ; Shire's (SHPG) potential combination with biotech firm Bazalta (BXLT), in a deal valued at over $30 billion; and the huge Thames Tideway Tunnel project in the U.K. Earlier, it advised a Broadcom (BRCM) committee on its potential sale to Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO).
"
316,CVS,"In the quarterly report, Altman said Evercore's advisory business delivered the best results for the third quarter and first nine months of the year in the firm's history. He added that Evercore is starting to see restructuring opportunities in energy and other industries impacted by falling commodity prices.
"
317,CVS,"Weak Link
"
318,CVS,"But if investment banking was Evercore's strong suit, its much smaller investment-management business was a weak link. Revenue was down 4% from last year to $24 million. Its Mexican unit was especially hurt; institutional assets under management in Mexico declined 9% from a year ago as the value of the peso fell.
"
319,CVS,"Still, Evercore got a boost when the company priced 5.45 million shares to be sold by Japanese investor Mizuho (MZF) in a secondary offering. They went for 55 apiece, with 3.1 million shares available to the public. Evercore agreed to buy back 2.35 million shares.
"
320,CVS,"Moreover, Mizuho and Evercore extended their nearly 10-year-old agreement to jointly pursue merger advisory work for three more years to all parts of the world, not just U.S.-Japan transactions. The new agreement lets Mizuho and Evercore capitalize on global M&A activity given that there are limited opportunities within Japan, Chief Executive Ralph Schlosstein said in a conference call.
"
321,CVS,"The global M&A market ""remains vibrant,"" Altman said in the same call, adding that announced global volume for the first nine months of the year was $3.2 trillion, up from $2.4 trillion in 2014. About half of the global total was in the U.S., which was up 50% through the first nine months vs. the same period in 2014, he said.
"
322,CVS,"""I don't see anything in the mix right now which would weaken the M&A market. It has considerable momentum,"" Altman added. Evercore executives were not available for an interview with IBD.
"
323,CVS,"'Clear Positive'
"
324,CVS,"The Mizuho transaction and expanded M&A agreement are a ""clear positive,"" noted analyst James Mitchell of the Buckingham Research Group. He expects the firm's strong advisory pipeline to fuel continued fee growth over the next few quarters.
"
325,CVS,"He estimates that Evercore's advisory fee pipeline at the end of Q3 was up 54% vs. a year ago and that significant new assignments continued in October, offsetting a sizable amount of completed work.
"
326,CVS,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings this year to climb 21% over last year to $3.13 a share and go up another 18% next year. Revenue is seen rising 28% this year to $1.17 billion.
"
327,CVS,"CEO Schlosstein, who co-founded the giant asset-management firm BlackRock (BLK) in 1988 and earlier served as an adviser to President Jimmy Carter, likes to say that Evercore competes on the basis of its intellectual capital, ideas and relationships.
"
328,CVS,"If Evercore's intellectual capital is its bankers, it has an increasingly bigger pool to bank on. The firm hired a record 10 senior managing directors this year through the third quarter, for a total of 79 senior managing directors across the firm.
"
329,CVS,"Said the headline in a recent report on Evercore from Credit Suisse, which came with an outperform rating: ""The core (of Evercore) continues to blossom.""The name Evercore Partners (EVR) may not sound familiar, but you've probably heard of its clients, some of the biggest names in corporate America and beyond: DuPont (DD), Nokia (NOK) and CVS Health (CVS), to name a few.There's nothing small about Evercore's clients.The most high profile work of late by the financial advisory firm has been as a consultant to DuPont in its pending $68 billion merger with Dow Chemical (DOW) and to tech company EMC (EMC) on its potential sale to Dell.

330,CVS,"CVS Health's  (CVS) announcement Monday to cover Amgen's  (AMGN) cholesterol drug Repatha exclusively — over Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's  (SNY) rival version, Praluent — puts pressure on the Praluent makers to ""deliver the same,"" says one analyst. Repatha will be the only PCSK9 inhibitor on the CVS/Caremark commercial formularies, said the nation's No. 1 drugstore chain, after…
"
331,CVS,"Biotech pioneer Amgen has long depended on its flagship drugs for its revenue stream, but the next few years could see a changing of the guard as new medications overshadow the old.
"
332,CVS,"Currently, more than half of Amgen's (AMGN) sales come from drugs that debuted in the 1990s: the sister drugs Neulasta and Neupogen, both of which stimulate production of white blood cells, and Enbrel, which treats immunology conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Amgen's legacy anemia treatment, Epogen, still provides 9% of sales after being approved way back in 1989.
"
333,CVS,"However, as some of the earliest and therefore simplest biologic drugs, they've also been the first targets for rivals waiting to sell what are known as biosimilars once patents lapse on Amgen's products. Biosimilars aren't quite like generic drugs, which are identical copies of the originals, but they are similar enough to be used interchangeably by at least some physicians.
"
334,CVS,"Biosimilars of Neupogen have been sold for a few years in Europe, and this year Novartis' (NVS) version, Zarxio, entered the American market. It has put more weight on the growth of Amgen's launches.
"
335,CVS,"Repatha's Launch
"
336,CVS,"Probably the most anticipated Amgen launch this year was for Repatha, a treatment for high cholesterol approved in Europe in July and in the U.S. in August.
"
337,CVS,"Repatha is one of a new class of cholesterol medications called PCSK9 inhibitors, also being developed by several other drugmakers. In fact, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and its partner Sanofi (SNY) launched their own PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, just a month earlier than Repatha in the U.S.
"
338,CVS,"Since the clinical trials indicate similar effectiveness for both drugs, the two have been duking it out for payer deals. Last month Amgen was put on the preferred formulary of CVS Health (CVS), while Regeneron and Sanofi did the same with UnitedHealth (UNH).
"
339,CVS,"Analysts agree, however, that the crucial test for Repatha will come next year. That's when Amgen reports on the first results from its trial measuring Repatha's effects on cardiovascular outcomes — that is, whether it actually reduces cardiovascular events like heart attack and stroke. Praluent's corresponding tests come shortly after.
"
340,CVS,"Though the FDA approved both Repatha and Praluent based on their ability to lower LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, that ability doesn't mean that they automatically improve heart health.
"
341,CVS,"Better Than Expected?
"
342,CVS,"In a Dec. 14 note upgrading Amgen to overweight, Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison estimated that outcomes data could add 20% in annual sales of Repatha, even if Praluent (as is likely) gets the same result. But his upgrade was driven by a survey of cardiologists that found it could do better than expected even before that.
"
343,CVS,"""While we will be the first to acknowledge that survey data tends to skew toward high uptake, the cardiologists and PCPs (primary care physicians) we surveyed believe PCSK9 inhibitors can obtain 30% to 40% share of patients ... prior to outcomes data,"" Harrison wrote. ""This is well above what both we and the consensus model (see), and even if the penetration was cut in half, it would still be above consensus.""
"
344,CVS,"Seeing The Upside
"
345,CVS,"Analysts call for peak annual Repatha sales of $4 billion to $5 billion, but Harrison isn't the only analyst who sees upside to that number. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee recently wrote he thinks sales could be twice that.
"
346,CVS,"However, the peak isn't expected until 2020, and the need to negotiate with payers is keeping the launch fairly slow in the near term.
"
347,CVS,"Amgen has a few other cards to play, though, starting with blood-cancer drug Kyprolis.
"
348,CVS,"Amgen came by Kyprolis when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013 for $10.4 billion. Many investors at the time balked at the price tag, but Amgen has been working to justify it by doing more research to expand the drug's label.
"
349,CVS,"When the FDA first approved Kyprolis for multiple myeloma in 2012, it cleared the drug only for advanced cases — those who'd had at least two prior treatments — and only in combination with another drug called Velcade. Also, Amgen couldn't put any survival benefit on Kyprolis' label, as the clinical trials hadn't proven the benefit.
"
350,CVS,"Amgen won approval for somewhat less advanced multiple myeloma this summer, and it produced studies demonstrating a survival benefit, as well as Kyprolis' effectiveness without Velcade. In the most recently reported third quarter, Kyprolis sales jumped 46% from a year ago to $137 million.
"
351,CVS,"Overall, Amgen's earnings rose 18% to $2.72 a share for the quarter, beating analyst estimates by 34 cents. Sales increased 14% to $5.72 billion, also ahead of Street views.
"
352,CVS,"Unusual Events
"
353,CVS,"It was the best sales growth in some years, but Amgen acknowledged that some of it was due to one-time events, such as one customer's abnormally large purchase of Enbrel. Amgen's guidance was more modest; analysts overall are expecting a slowdown, with earnings up 5% in the current quarter and up 6% next year.
"
354,CVS,"The Street expects earnings growth to jump to 16% the year after that, but the longer-term outlook depends on the success of drugs currently in the pipeline.
"
355,CVS,"Analyst Harrison pegs June 2016 as the likely report date for the results of a late-stage study of romosozumab, a medicine Amgen is developing for osteoporosis. If it succeeds, the drug could eventually reach blockbuster status, with more than $1 billion a year in sales.
"
356,CVS,"But in the nearer term, Amgen doesn't have many levers left to keep growth pumping, says Wells Fargo analyst Jim Birchenough.
"
357,CVS,"""With a highly leveraged balance sheet and commitment to its dividend policy, we view Amgen's business development opportunities as much more limited than peers',"" Birchenough wrote in a Dec. 3 report, initiating coverage at neutral.
"
358,CVS,"""While Amgen has been able to beat consensus estimates for the past five years, with share repurchases and aggressive cost cutting, we believe that further cost cuts would be difficult to achieve and that focus will increasingly be on top-line performance,"" Birchenough said.Biotech pioneer Amgen has long depended on its flagship drugs for its revenue stream, but the next few years could see a changing of the guard as new medications overshadow the old.Currently, more than half of Amgen's (AMGN) sales come from drugs that debuted in the 1990s: the sister drugs Neulasta and Neupogen, both of which stimulate production of white blood cells, and Enbrel, which treats immunology conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

""This is well above what both we and the consensus model (see), and even if the penetration was cut in half, it would still be above consensus.""Seeing The UpsideAnalysts call for peak annual Repatha sales of $4 billion to $5 billion, but Harrison isn't the only analyst who sees upside to that number. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee recently wrote he thinks sales could be twice that.However, the peak isn't expected until 2020, and the need to negotiate with payers is keeping the launch fairly slow in the near term.Amgen has a few other cards to play, though, starting with blood-cancer drug Kyprolis.Amgen came by Kyprolis when it acquired Onyx Pharmaceuticals in 2013 for $10.4 billion. Many investors at the time balked at the price tag, but Amgen has been working to justify it by doing more research to expand the drug's label.When the FDA first approved Kyprolis for multiple myeloma in 2012, it cleared the drug only for advanced cases — those who'd had at least two prior treatments — and only in combination with another drug called Velcade. Also, Amgen couldn't put any survival benefit on Kyprolis' label, as the clinical trials hadn't proven the benefit.Amgen won approval for somewhat less advanced multiple myeloma this summer, and it produced studies demonstrating a survival benefit, as well as Kyprolis' effectiveness without Velcade. In the most recently reported third quarter, Kyprolis sales jumped 46% from a year ago to $137 million.Overall, Amgen's earnings rose 18% to $2.72 a share for the quarter, beating analyst estimates by 34 cents. Sales increased 14% to $5.72 billion, also ahead of Street views.Unusual EventsIt was the best sales growth in some years, but Amgen acknowledged that some of it was due to one-time events, such as one customer's abnormally large purchase of Enbrel. Amgen's guidance was more modest; analysts overall are expecting a slowdown, with earnings up 5% in the current quarter and up 6% next year.The Street expects earnings growth to jump to 16% the year after that, but the longer-term outlook depends on the success of drugs currently in the pipeline.Analyst Harrison pegs June 2016 as the likely report date for the results of a late-stage study of romosozumab, a medicine Amgen is developing for osteoporosis. If it succeeds, the drug could eventually reach blockbuster status, with more than $1 billion a year in sales.But in the nearer term, Amgen doesn't have many levers left to keep growth pumping, says Wells Fargo analyst Jim Birchenough.""With a highly leveraged balance sheet and commitment to its dividend policy, we view Amgen's business development opportunities as much more limited than peers',"" Birchenough wrote in a Dec. 3 report, initiating coverage at neutral.""While Amgen has been able to beat consensus estimates for the past five years, with share repurchases and aggressive cost cutting, we believe that further cost cuts would be difficult to achieve and that focus will increasingly be on top-line performance,"" Birchenough said.

364,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) posted Q3 earnings that fell short of views for the first time in more than a year and gave light guidance for 2016, just days after the drugstore operator's key rivals Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) announced plans to merge.CVS reported adjusted earnings of $1.28 a share, up 11.5% from a year earlier and below forecasts for $1.29 a share. It was the first time the company missed on earnings since the first quarter of 2014. Net revenue rose 10.3% to $38.6 billion, ahead of forecasts for $37.9 billion.CVS also sees 2016 adjusted earnings of $5.68-$5.88 per share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a profit of $6.02 per share.The earnings report followed Walgreens' announcement on Tuesday that it will buy Rite Aid, creating a drugstore powerhouse and a mighty rival to CVS.CVS shares closed down 4.84 Friday in the stock market today. Walgreens shares closed up 0.95%, and Rite Aid ended flat.In Q3, CVS' same-store sales for its retail drugstores increased 1.7% vs. a year earlier. Pharmacy same store sales were up 4.6%, and pharmacy same-store prescription volumes were up 4.4% on a 30-day equivalent basis.CVS said sales at its drugstores were hurt by the introduction of low-margin generic drugs, lower reimbursement rates, and its move to stop selling tobacco products last year.Front-store same-store sales were negatively affected by softer customer traffic, partially offset by an increase in basket size, it added.""Reimbursement pressure has not changed but ... Medicare and Medicaid are big areas of growth in this (pharmacy benefit management) business and they carry a lower margin rate,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo said on a conference call.Rising generic drug prices are hurting drugstore operators, as insurers and PBMs have been slow in raising reimbursement rates for those drugs, he added.

416,CVS,"Sephora and Ulta (ULTA) are stealing market share from CVS (CVS) and other drugstores as teens gravitate toward ""authentic indie"" brands, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey, out late Tuesday.Mass beauty brands are ceding share to indie brands and labels that get social media backing, said analysts. A quick peek on Facebook's (FB) Instagram yields about 885,000 results for #Revlon and fewer than 499,000 for #CoverGirl — both drugstore brands — but more than 2.5 million results for #UrbanDecay, a popular cosmetics label that can be purchased at both Ulta and Sephora.CoverGirl has steadily slipped down the rankings with upper-income female teens, falling to fourth place from second place, year over year, while Urban Decay's share has risen with all teen girls.Tied to that is the increased preference for specialty beauty retailers. Sephora nabbed a significant 38% chunk in Piper Jaffray's latest survey, climbing from 19% in the spring and up from 22% in fall 2014's poll among upper-income teenage girls. Sephora is owned by LVMH, which trades on the Paris exchange.While Target (TGT) took top honors in the spring, Ulta knocked it down to third place this fall, taking the No. 2 spot behind Sephora with 19% share of the vote, up from 13% last year. Target has 14% share.Drugstores that mostly carry mass beauty brands have also slipped down the rankings. CVS ceded about half its share, sliding to 6% at the No. 4 spot from 14% in the spring and 13% last fall. Wal-Mart (WMT) and Walgreens (WBA) have also slipped down the Top 10 list over the last 12 months.Ulta has a solid history of double-digit earnings and revenue gains, and has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 96. Piper Jaffray carries an overweight rating on the stock.Ulta shares closed down 2.8% to 159.26 in the stock market today. CVS fell 1.6% and Target fell 3.5%.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Ulta Beauty Delivers Great-Looking Growth.

418,CVS,"Biotech Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) has had a mostly good year, but it's preparing for a challenging future. Sucampo has enjoyed strong sales and profit growth over the past four quarters thanks to its constipation drug Amitiza, marketed by partner Takeda. The drug has driven Sucampo stock to a strong IBD Composite Rating of 86 even after the recent drug-stock hammering. But Amitiza is facing competition from Linzess, a fast-growing rival from drug giant Allergan (AGN).
"
419,CVS,"Next year, in fact, CVS (CVS) will drop Amitiza from its preferred formulary in favor of Allergan's drug.

"
428,CVS,"Sucampo has one other product in the pipeline: cobiprostone, a potential treatment for oral mucositis and nonerosive reflux disease. But both CEO Peter Greenleaf and Wall Street have said that the company needs to acquire more assets.
"
429,CVS,"On Aug. 26, Sucampo launched a tender offer worth $278 million in cash and stock for Japanese biotech R-Tech Ueno. Sucampo says that the acquisition will boost its financial profile along with its pipeline. Recently, Greenleaf talked to IBD about the acquisition and what it means for Sucampo's future.
"
430,CVS,"IBD: What was the rationale behind the R-Tech Ueno acquisition? Your companies had a relationship, right?
"
431,CVS,"Greenleaf: We had a relationship insomuch as the founders of Sucampo were the founders of R-Tech Ueno and held a 50% ownership position in our company as well.
"
432,CVS,"The business relationship between the two companies was primarily manufacturing. They were the exclusive manufacturer of our lead product, Amitiza; a historical product called Rescula for ophthalmology indications, which is really only available today in Japan; and one pipeline product we have in development, a product called cobiprostone.
"
433,CVS,"We had some historical tie-up in research and development, where we worked on some pipeline development. But today, while we have rights to some of the assets, we weren't currently engaged in some specific research collaborations with the company.
"
434,CVS,"The acquisition we set up as an accelerant to grow and transform the company. The strategic benefits are really threefold.
"
435,CVS,"One, it provides us an immediately accretive transaction. About a third of the economics (is) outside of what accrues to our partners, but a third of the economics accruing outside of our partners we would be acquiring. It brings significant financial benefit to the company: increased revenue, enhances our profitability and free cash flow, and our early projections — still to be adjusted based on our final financing terms — (call for) a near-doubling of EPS and income for the year to follow.
"
436,CVS,"We did give some guidance on what the financial results should look like: net income about $55 million to $60 million, EPS of about $1.20 to $1.30, and adjusted EBITDA (of) $95 million to $100 million. Those numbers are obviously significantly higher than where we are today. (Sucampo had EPS of 40 cents in 2014.)
"
437,CVS,"(Two), we get full control of supply chain and manufacturing, basically taking Sucampo from a company doing research and development — and producing revenue through our partners — to also having the benefit of controlling manufacturing. That helps us in two ways: one, it gives control, helps ensure that we have contiguous and continuous supply chain, helps us (in) management of risk; and second, operationally, it should provide us the opportunity to renegotiate contracts, to gain operational leverage, hopefully to continue to reduce our cost structure.
"
438,CVS,"Lastly, R-Tech Ueno had a lot of pipeline programs in this transaction. We're gaining several new assets across multiple new indications, and there's at least one of those that we're initially very excited about and could bring significant diversification and value to the company.
"
439,CVS,"IBD: Can you elaborate on the pipeline?
"
440,CVS,"Greenleaf: The R-Tech Ueno pipeline provides six new assets across multiple therapeutic areas. Those (include) gastroenterology, ophthalmology, an element of dermatology, autoimmune disease and oncology. Our initial diligence has told us that most of those assets will not meet our criteria to develop further, but they do have data up to certain phases of development — mostly in phase one, some in phase two. If we did not decide to develop those, we would either close them down, and they would appear as synergy in the deal, or we would decide to monetize them in some way by out-licensing them to other partners, either regional or global.
"
441,CVS,"There is one program — it's called a vascular adhesion protein inhibitor — that's currently being studied as an oral and as an IV formulation in autoimmune disease and in cancers, stroke and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). This is in pre-proof-of-concept development, but there's been a lot of interest across the pharmaceutical sector in this pathway and this inhibitor as a real potential solution in many autoimmune/inflammatory disorders.
"
442,CVS,"There have been a couple deals, most recently where Boehringer Ingelheim actually licensed a vascular adhesion protein inhibitor from a smaller company called Pharmaxis that's in the same stage of development, for an upfront $40 million to $50 million, and then earn-outs. So it shows there's some real interest from large pharma in this space. We're excited about the prospects.
"
443,CVS,"IBD: Does this have an impact on future deals? Are you still on the hunt for other assets?
"
444,CVS,"Greenleaf: Yeah, for sure. We've said in the past and will continue (to say), as part of our strategy, that we'll build the company both organically and inorganically, and that we'll continue to work to strengthen our pipeline as well as our financial performance as a company. So yes, we're still actively out there looking for opportunities in both the pipeline and in the commercial space.
"
445,CVS,"We're in the process of getting this one locked down — hopefully getting a successful tender offer. We've said publicly that we're using debt financing and cash on our balance sheet to finance, so that's in process. It's going to be a matter of what our debt financing looks like on the back end and how quickly we can deleverage that.
"
446,CVS,"There's so many different ways you can structure deals these days. It's not slowing us down, but to some degree we're digesting and starting the process toward getting the deal done and integrating it. While we want to do more deals, we're going to try to make this one a success first. We don't think that will take a long time, but we want to first get the deal done and start the base stage of integration.
"
447,CVS,"Do we think it's going to affect our ability to do other deals? I think a lot of that comes down to (the fact that) every deal's different; and size and structure, as well as what the deal will bring to us, are all factors that are very deal-specific. Management has no desire to have this slow us down in future deal flow.Biotech Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) has had a mostly good year, but it's preparing for a challenging future.

448,CVS,"Stocks traded a bit lower yesterday - after Wednesday's FED induced rally.....as traders considered the language and odds of a December rate hike.  Selling was subdued, there was no ""get me outta here"" tone to the action at all.
"
449,CVS,"The mkt paused really - as investors now thought about the latest GDP report - which came in at +1.5%.....(great because it is positive) but when compared to the 2nd qtr it looks a bit pale.....yesterday's report was more a 60% drop from qtr to qtr all at a time when the FED suggests the economy is poised to 'explode' and that 'rates will rise in December'.
"
450,CVS,"In addition - yesterday's report was a disappointment when you consider year over year growth......last year's 3rd qtr growth rate was 2% - so all this says is that the economy continues to be held hostage to the dynamics of  weakness at home and abroad.   As the journal points out the ""US Economy Slogs Through Soft Patch"" -  consumer spending, business spending and home building all contributing to our positive report all in the face of 'headwinds' abroad.
"
451,CVS,"But do not be blindsided....Consumer spending  is misleading...because it includes what 'consumers spend' on healthcare - which is not something that many people consider they read the story about the health of the consumer......Spending by consumers on healthcare represents 30% of GDP...or some $18 bil ...but the gov't includes this under the heading of 'consumer spending' - making it appear as if the consumer spending is stronger than what reality might prove otherwise.   Remember - spending on healthcare is not really an option for the family budget - so that gets filed under the 'must pay' budget line.....which means that 'discretionary spending' gets cut back.....it's all semantics really....as far as Obama is concerned - Consumer spending - no matter on what - is still consumer spending....So - It's all good!
"
452,CVS,"Now in other news......our broken corporate tax structure has created another opportunity for a huge merger between Pfizer (PFE) and Allergan (AGN)  as they consider 'hooking up'  to avoid US taxes...you see - Allergan is based in Ireland and Ireland is a bit friendlier to big corporations......so if Pfizer gets into bed with Allergan in Ireland - they cut their US corporate tax liability in what is known as the 'inversion trade'...... Where one US company buys a smaller foreign rival and then moves the corporate headquarters abroad and BOOM!  - they just cut their US tax obligation by millions of dollars....   And to make the point - PFE CEO - Ian Read made no bones about it.....saying that ""US Corporate tax rates have put the company at a disadvantage to its foreign rivals.....We are fighting with one hand tied behind our back.....and that Pfizer was doing what we need to do to ensure that we can continue to innovate.""
"
453,CVS,"When will Washington wake up?  How many more 'inversion trades' must we see before those Bozo's in Congress recognize that they are nothing but a bunch of clowns as evidenced by the new 2 yr budget deal that lifts the debt ceiling even higher and rolls back fiscal austerity...but hey - it removes the risk of a debt limit/default risk for another  2 yrs....so the mkt will embrace that.
"
454,CVS,"And the 'other pharma' story continues to keep us glued to our seats....Valeant Pharma  (VRX) continues to make headlines......CVS Health Corp. (CVS), Express Scripts  (ESRX) and United Health  are all cutting ties with Philidor Rx - the pharmacy that has helped to propel VRX  to international fame.....The stock closed down $5 pts and is now down another 6 pts in early pre-mkt trading.  Remember that old quote - 'Where there's smoke, there's fire..'.....The question now is - is the fire just a log or the whole house?
"
455,CVS,"US futures are up 2 pts - Global mkts are under a bit of pressure.   The BoJ (Bank of Japan) did not increase their QE program which caught some by surprise but did not cause a negative mkt reaction.   In Europe  - EU eco data was mixed....CPI did rise by 1%, while German retail sales missed the expectation.  Inflation figures were better, but still low and will have no impact on the ECB's plan for more stimulus. 
"
456,CVS,"It is the last day of the month - so we will sure have some 'window dressing  or undressing' taking place  as asset managers close their books on October.   Earnings continue to weigh on some stocks, but overall the season is not as bad as originally expected....so the nervousness that permeated the mkts in early October seemed to have subsided.   Expect to see the mkt challenge 2100 today.....and then back off and churn in line....Eco data today  could derail us - but I doubt it.  Pers Income of +0.2%, Pers Spend of +0.2%, ISM Milwaukee of 44 and Chicago Purch Manager of 49.4.

476,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) said Thursday that its year-old tobacco products ban reduced overall cigarette buys. Meanwhile, rival drugstore chain Rite Aid's (RAD) stock rose slightly despite so-so August company sales figures.A CVS Health Research Institute study said that cigarette pack sales fell 1% at gas stations, convenience stores, big box stores, and other retailers in states where CVS had a 15% or greater share of the retail pharmacy market vs. states with no CVS pharmacies. Overall nicotine patch sales, meanwhile, showed a 4% increase in CVS-heavy states.CVS, the No. 2 U.S. pharmacy chain as well as a pharmacy benefits manager, has lost sales from its tobacco ban to rivals such as Rite Aid and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) as well as dollar stores such as Dollar General, but saw the move as an important branding effort to emphasize health.CVS Health rose 0.6% to 101.70 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, just creeping above the 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, Rite Aid, the No. 3 drugstore operator, said August same-store sales increased 1.6% vs. a year ago. That lagged some estimates.Pharmacy same-store sales rose 2.1%, including a negative impact of around 222 basis points from new generic launches. Front-end same-store sales grew 0.6%.Rite Aid's total drugstore sales for the five weeks ended Aug. 29 rose 1.6% over last year to $2.5 billion. Prescription sales made up 69.6% of the total.""We are encouraged by (Rite Aid's) front-end same-store sales results, the highest year-over-year growth since March,"" noted analyst Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.But Rite Aid's same-store pharmacy results have showed ""a notable slowdown"" this year due to tough comparisons from last year's ObamaCare boost, an industry-wide phenomenon, he noted.""However, we expect this slowdown to begin reversing itself in the back half of (Rite Aid's) fiscal year,"" especially accelerating in the fourth quarter, Muken said.Rite Aid will report August-ending Q2 results later this month.In Thursday's report, Rite Aid said Q2 same-store sales increased 2.1%, with front-end same-store sales up a fraction and pharmacy same-store sales up 2.8%. Analysts expect Q2 earnings of 4 cents per share, down from last year's 13 cents.Rite Aid is the smallest of the three major drugstore chains in the U.S., with 4,561 stores as of Aug. 29. Rite Aid stock rose 1.1% to 8.25 in afternoon trading. Shares recently found support at the 200-day line.No. 1 Walgreens Boots Alliance advanced 1% to 88.73.

493,CVS,"Specialty drugmaker Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) beat Q2 expectations and raised its guidance early Wednesday, sending the stock to a new high in early trading. It pulled back later, however, possibly because word got out that its sole marketed drug is being excluded from CVS' (CVS) preferred formulary next year.Sucampo reported earnings of 21 cents a share, up from just 4 cents in the year-earlier quarter and 6 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 45% to $34.9 million, about $3 million more than analysts expected.The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to 65-75 cents, topping the Street's estimate of 62 cents.Sucampo's revenue all comes from constipation drug Amitiza, which is still growing even though it's been on the market for nine years. In the U.S., prescriptions grew 10%, while Sucampo's royalty revenue through its marketing partner Takeda grew 15%. In Japan, royalty revenue from marketing partner Mylan (MYL) doubled.""In the second quarter, we delivered outstanding earnings growth, driven mainly by Amitiza's continued growth in the U.S. and Japan,"" Sucampo CEO Peter Greenleaf said in a statement. ""Our financial strength will fuel the continued transformation of our business.""That transformation includes the launch of a second drug, cobiprostone, which is in midstage testing for oral mucositis. Many on the Street have been waiting for Sucampo to acquire a company or drug to help fill out its thin pipeline. Greenleaf has told IBD that he's actively looking for opportunities, but for now the company still depends on the one product.That became a greater issue when pharmacy giant CVS' 2016 preferred formulary list leaked online, and Amitiza wasn't on it. It had been on this year's formulary, but CVS knocked it off in favor of Allergan's (AGN) Linzess.Nonetheless, Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen raised her price target on Sucampo to 27 from 23 and affirmed her buy rating.""Sucampo still expects mid-to-high single-digit growth for Amitiza despite Amitiza being put on CVS exclusion list; Amitiza has also had some formulary wins and the negotiations on reimbursement are still ongoing,"" Chen wrote in a research note Wednesday.Sucampo stock has been volatile since emerging from a cup base in mid-July, and the volatility continued on the stock market today. Shares shot up 19% to a new high of 25.70 early, then reversed to fall as low as 20.02. The stock is up 0.7% to 21.73 at midday. The stock boasts a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, meaning Sucampo tops 99% of all other stocks based on a range of key fundamental and technical factors.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

"
566,CVS,"McKesson (MCK), the biggest in a trio of major distributors that dominate the U.S. market, partners with pharmacy chain Rite Aid (RAD) to deliver drugs from manufacturers to consumers at retail outlets and medical centers.
"
567,CVS,"Last year the two companies announced a new five-year agreement designed to create drug purchasing and distribution efficiencies. Under that deal, which runs through March 2019, McKesson assumed responsibility for sourcing both branded and generic medications.
"
568,CVS,"Top-Line Lift
"
569,CVS,"The agreement helped McKesson post its biggest revenue gain in years during fiscal 2015, which ended in March. The company logged a little more than $179 billion in revenue for the year, up 30% from fiscal 2014.
"
570,CVS,"McKesson, along with AmerisourceBergen (ABC) and Cardinal Health (CAH) — which partner with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS), respectively — control roughly fourth-fifths of the U.S. drug distribution market.
"
571,CVS,"The Rite Aid partnership provides McKesson massive scale and purchasing power, analysts say. This in turn gives it both sales volume and pricing advantages, enabling it to grow revenue and maintain favorable profit margins.
"
572,CVS,"""McKesson is one of the best-positioned firms in the health care industry,"" Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj told IBD. ""They've been a very good performer.""

However, Bloomberg News has reported that Omnicare has attracted recent buyout interest from Express Scripts Holding (ESRX) and CVS Health, which could threaten the McKesson relationship.
"
574,CVS,"During its fiscal fourth quarter, McKesson's wholesale drug distribution business drove its sales to grow 19% from a year earlier to $44.9 billion. Excluding one-time items, its earnings from continuing operations climbed 15% to $2.94 a share.
"
575,CVS,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 13% this fiscal year and another 15% in fiscal 2017.
"
576,CVS,"McKesson's stock price touched a high of 243.61 on May 19 and currently trades near 231. The stock is up more than 10% in 2015.

"
578,CVS,"""We are calling for continued growth and strength right across the distribution solutions business,"" he said.
"
579,CVS,"Beer pointed to solid generic-drug price increases in fiscal 2015, saying that higher prices were an ""increasingly important factor"" and that this positive trend ""will be the case again in 2016.""
"
580,CVS,"It's too soon to gauge if the current fiscal year will be as strong on that front as last year, he said. But generic prices are still expected to rise amid heightening demand for drugs to treat a wide array of ailments.
"
581,CVS,"On the branded drug front, Beer said, McKesson anticipates steady pricing and volume growth in the year ahead as several drugs, including some that treat hepatitis C with high cure rates, are increasingly prescribed.
"
582,CVS,"Strong prices and volume are both important for drug distributors, which buy medications from manufacturers, store them and then sell them to retail pharmacies and other outlets.
"
583,CVS,"The distributors profit on the spread between the wholesale price charged by the manufacturer and the retail price that pharmacies set in conjunction with insurers.
"
584,CVS,"Even if drug prices taper off, distributors can still generate solid profit margins by selling drugs and other products in high volume.
"
585,CVS,"The majority of McKesson's pharmaceutical distribution business is in North America, but it is pushing for growth internationally. Its 2014 buyout of German drug distributor Celesio helped McKesson grow its sales outside North America by 3% in its latest completed quarter.
"
586,CVS,"""We continue to view McKesson as one of the best-positioned companies in the pharma supply chain and believe generic drug purchasing, Celesio synergies, and capital deployment could drive upside"" to the stock, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill noted in a June research report.

587,CVS,"CFO Beer said at the May conference that more buyouts could be in the offing ""if we can find attractive opportunities at sensible prices.""
"
588,CVS,"In a June report, Barclays Capital analyst Eric Percher said that, based on his talks with McKesson management, ""M&A is a clear priority."" Percher suggested that McKesson is most likely to build off of the Celesio deal and make Europe its international priority.

"
592,CVS,"This is particularly evident in the U.S. with the massive baby boomer generation, he said. That, coupled with more Americans now covered by health insurance in the wake of the ObamaCare rollout, means that more people will not only need medications, but more Americans will be able to afford them.
"
593,CVS,"""The need for health care, including medications, is only going to continue increasing,"" Pappas said.

635,CVS,"Merger mania has struck the health insurance sector's Big 5 at a time when their stocks are among the best performers in the market. Anthem, Cigna and Aetna shares hit record highs again Tuesday. UnitedHealth gained 22% so far this year, up 2% to a record 122.74 Tuesday.

"
636,CVS,"""That kind of consolidation for the big companies,"" said Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, ""that's really the only way that they can grow"" faster than organic growth.Big health insurers want to get bigger to cut costs and fatten profit, of course, but seem to be moving faster now to consolidate in response to mergers elsewhere in the health care system. Bigger pharmaceutical companies and merging hospitals may require larger, more powerful insurers to represent patients.So, eager perhaps to prove its determination to investors, Anthem (ANTM) last week took the unusual step of publicizing details of its takeover talks with Cigna (CI), leading the Bloomfield, Conn.-based Cigna to publicly admit that it's ""deeply disappointed"" with how Anthem disclosed its latest $54 billion offer .Meanwhile, Humana (HUM) has offered itself up for sale and is being pursued by Aetna (AET), which reportedly is being courted by UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the nation's largest health insurer.The possible post-merger scenarios include Anthem, Aetna and UnitedHealth lording over the U.S. health insurance sector. It could be just Anthem and UnitedHealth when the dust settles.Why now? The big insurers also may be feeling more pressure to merge as soon as possible knowing that subsequent M&A proposals will invite greater antitrust scrutiny.But the Big 5 health insurers may be too big and too late to avoid critics.""A lack of competition clearly exists today and speaks loudly against any further consolidation in the health insurance industry,"" the chairman of the American Academy of Family Physicians wrote to the Federal Trade Commission this month.Addressing Rising CostsStill, there's reason to cut costs and gain leverage via mergers.Last year, prescription drug spending rose 13.1% to a record $374 billion, according to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, with hepatitis C treatments among the most expensive new blockbusters.Consolidation will give insurers more leverage to negotiate prices with doctors, hospitals and drugmakers, other sectors of the health care industry that have consolidated rapidly lately.""They're trying to scale up in order to get more leverage over contracts with drug manufacturers and other health care providers,"" said Jeffrey Loo, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.Insurers may be feeling more pressure to grow now, having just absorbed new patients.ObamaCare's creation of federally subsidized insurance exchanges used by 34 states has provided new options for millions of newly insured consumers, but only in the last two years.Health care is one of the busiest industries for consolidation this year.

713,CVS,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: May Performance Report
"
714,CVS,"Corporate takeovers were the theme for May, boosting mutual funds holding these stocks and testifying to resilience in the U.S. economy, even as mixed economic data trickled in.
"
715,CVS,"The parade of pairings includedCharter (CHTR) and Time Warner (TWC), Avago (AVGO) and Broadcom (BRCM), Ascena (ASNA) and Ann (ANN), CVS (CVS) and Omnicare (OCR), Verizon (VZ) and AOL (AOL), and Danaher (DHR) and Pall (PLL).
"
716,CVS,"""M&A activity continues to support the U.S. stock market,"" Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote May 26. The deals allow companies to expand into new markets, as well as gain efficiencies and earnings leverage.
"
717,CVS,"And they came despite — or perhaps because of — sluggish manufacturing activity in May and an economy that shrank in the first quarter. In fact, weak data paradoxically boosted stocks because it ""alleviated concerns over an aggressive Federal Reserve rate-hiking regime,"" Koesterich added.
"
718,CVS,"U.S. diversified equity funds rose 1.3% on average in May, according to Lipper Inc. General domestic taxable bond funds fell 0.42%.
"
719,CVS,"Growth funds across the market-cap spectrum continued to notch the biggest gains. Small-cap growth funds beat last month, advancing 2.8% on average. That took their year-to-date gains to 6.2%. Midcap growth funds rallied 2% and 6.8% in the same periods.
"
720,CVS,"Value funds are catching up, posting tidy gains in May but lagging year to date.
"
721,CVS,"Sector-focused mutual funds holding health and biotech stocks proved stellar again. They trumped every other domestic fund category, soaring 7.5% in May and 16.2% in 2015 as of month-end.
"
722,CVS,"Strong Health Care Earnings
"
723,CVS,"Health care companies showed strong first-quarter earnings growth — 21.4% overall, topping all 10 S&P sectors. Stocks such as IBD Sector Leaders Actavis (ACT) and Illumina (ILMN) are profiting from robust demand for innovative drugs and testing equipment, as well as acquisitions of smaller companies to streamline or diversify operations.
"
724,CVS,"As interest rates stay lower for longer, mutual fund investors are seeking out income-producing equities. Utility and telecom funds eked out 0.2% and 0.5% gains last month. Year to date, they're laggards.
"
725,CVS,"Koesterich advises income investors to focus on dividend growth funds. ""Many sectors offering high yields, such as utilities, are expensive and the most vulnerable to a rise in rates,"" he said. ""Instead, yield-hungry investors should look for technology, financials, health care and select energy companies offering rising dividends.""
"
726,CVS,"The price of gold ended May roughly 1% higher at 1191.40. But a stronger dollar weighed upon bullion as the month wore on. Mutual funds investing in precious metal commodities managed to turn in a 1% gain on average over the course of last month. Virtually every other commodity fund — from ag-based to energy-focused — saw losses.
"
727,CVS,"Precious metal equities funds — such as those holding mining stocks — gave up 1.6% in May. They're more influenced by operational conditions, not just the underlying metal's price.
"
728,CVS,"Modest Gains Abroad
"
729,CVS,"In a reversal from the previous month, investors who turned to foreign markets for successful investing pegged slight declines.
"
730,CVS,"Still, several international regions managed to beat the ""sell in May"" naysayers, including rallying India, Japan and Europe. But China stock mutual funds fell 0.2% vs. their 14.2% outsize gains in April.
"
731,CVS,"Year to date, China region funds still lead their international peers with a 21.6% surge. But they were hurt in May by stock market news of shrinking factory activity and weak export growth.
"
732,CVS,"Overall, world equity funds dropped 0.5% in May vs. their 4.3% gain the previous month.
"
733,CVS,"""International markets have done pretty well year to date,"" said Matthew Dobbs, head of global small companies at Schroder Investment Management, ""so it's not entirely surprising to see a bit of a reversion back.""
"
734,CVS,"Dobbs manages part of the $2.8 billion Vanguard International Explorer Fund , which rose 0.9% in May and is up 12% in 2015. It invests 23.3% of assets in Japan, its biggest single-country allocation.
"
735,CVS,"Japanese mutual funds rose 1.7% in May. They're up 16.5% this year.
"
736,CVS,"Large caps in Japan powered that performance, said Dobbs. The falling yen gave these companies, which tend to have sizable exposure to foreign earnings, a boost.
"
737,CVS,"VINEX also assigns 58.4% of assets to continental Europe and the U.K. European funds rallied 0.5% last month. Year to date, they're up 9.5%. Massive stimulus measures have kick-started markets there.

"
759,CVS,"So it was only last week - when we were celebrating the breakout by the Nasdaq market - a breakout that took 15 years to accomplish....On April 24th - My Morning Thoughts started out like this and asked that age old question:
"
760,CVS,"Oh.....now it is getting interesting.....but is it getting a bit 'bubbly'?
"
761,CVS,"Nasdaq made history yesterday....breaking out of its 15 year purgatory....but the breakout did not come with any fanfare, or bells and whistles.......Yesterday at 11:55 am....traders took the Nasdaq up and thru its former high of 5048 - as it ticked at 5049......... and shift into overdrive....the algo's kicked in forcing it to a new all time intraday high of 5069. At the closing bell - Nasdaq ended the day at 5056....signaling a 'new dawn'....and this during what many would consider the worst earnings season in recent memory (negative 4% growth) ....
"
762,CVS,"And that was the 'kiss of death' - Just a few days ago we were celebrating - Nasdaq was the new darling child, the S&P 500 was at an all-time new high and the Dow and Russell were teasing with their all-time highs.........but today - the Dow 30 is now flat for the year and both the S&P and Nasdaq have closed below their 50 day moving average's and the small cap Russell 2000 - well that broke its 50 & is now sitting right on its 100 dma at 1217.
"
763,CVS,"In the past week - stocks have reversed course, giving back all of the April gains.....There was not one sector left standing as investors did a little 'window undressing' at the end of the month....or as the incomparable Arthur Cashin of UBS and worldwide fame said:
"
764,CVS,"""Today's action looks like end of month window BREAKING""
"
765,CVS,"And so it was.....you could hear the smashing glass as investors started throwing everything out the window - the only thing left was the kitchen sink....but hold on - that may be next....
"
766,CVS,"We can credit the 'usual suspects'.........ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates, the pending Greek Tragedy, key weak earnings, weakening macro data and the tensions building in the Persian Gulf as the Iranians try to bully the international community causing us to send warships to 'accompany US ships thru the Strait of Hormuz.....as one 'unidentified' US Official put it:
"
767,CVS,"""Out of abundance of caution, because of the unpredictability of our Iranian friends, we're now positioned so that, should the Iranians decide that they're going to be stupid, we're ready to respond...."" (Iranian officials have yet to comment...)
"
768,CVS,"So after you turn on the lights and look back- you will see that we haven't gone anywhere in the broad market so far this year. Yesterday, we got confirmation that the economy is not growing...... 4 months ago the GDP was 'supposedly' growing at 5.0% and now the GDP is growing at 0.02%. - Yes - that is NOT a typo.....a 4.98% reversal in activity......and this as all of the major indexes were making all time highs. (There's that whole disconnect thing again......)
"
769,CVS,"But you say - ""Why the negative - we knew this...The Atlanta Fed's forecasting model actually called for growth of 0.01% - so in fact - we beat it! Where are the party hats? What does the Atlanta Fed say about this quarter? Their initial forecast calls for growth of 0.9% - a far cry from the consensus estimates of 3% - so the reality of the robust recovery......well - ain't so robust. These are recession numbers....Hey...I'm just sayin.....
"
770,CVS,"Over the last 2 weeks - we have seen the dollar get clobbered (not such a bad thing for the multinationals)...it is down 5% - this though has been good for oil...(dollar down/oil up) and prices ended the month of April up another $1.05 closing at $59.63/barrel or up 17% in that same time. And with tensions building in the gulf - you can rest assured that there is now a floor under the price of oil....(could this whole Iranian thing be a set up to goose oil?)
"
771,CVS,"Yesterday we heard from some of the big oil companies.... Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CHV), ConocoPhillips (COP), - while the plunge in oil prices has caused some heartburn for the oil producers it has created a boom for the refiners.....and in fact American refiners are laughing all the way to the bank....because US crude - cheaper than Brent - has given them the competitive advantage over their European and Mid East rivals.......and the plot thickens.....
"
772,CVS,"After the bell - LinkedIn (LKND) slashed guidance - blaming the strong dollar and weaker demand for its problems.....the stock was down 5 points during the trading day and then got slammed in the afterhours session......dropping more than 20%....this morning in early pre-market trading it is hovering around $201....There we go again with these 'high growth stocks'......(Recall Twitter) - it is difficult to forecast and guide - so when they do they set themselves up for failure - but anyone trading these names understands that.....and if they don't - they do now.....
"
773,CVS,"US futures are up 6 points....not surprising after being down 21 points yesterday.....with the S&P 500 now broken its short term support at 2090 - look for that to become resistance again......support is now at 2070ish......
"
774,CVS,"It is May 1st...so expect to hear the 'sell in May and go away' mantra - as historians come out of the woodwork telling us about this phenomenon......This is a well known trading adage - essentially telling investors to take the summer off......
"
775,CVS,"Economic data today includes April ISM Manufacturing - expectations of 52. March Construction Spending of +0.5% and University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey...expectations of 96...on the earnings front - look for Weyerhauser (WY), CVS Health (CVS), Legg Mason (LM), VF (VFC) to name just a few.
"
776,CVS,"Also, watch for 2 Fed speakers today....Loretta Mester (Cleveland Fed) at 8:30 a.m. ETand John Williams (San Francisco) at 3:20 p.m. - of the two - Williams is the one that has the potential to create more noise.....

At the closing bell - Nasdaq ended the day at 5056....signaling a 'new dawn'....and this during what many would consider the worst earnings season in recent memory (negative 4% growth) ....And that was the 'kiss of death' - Just a few days ago we were celebrating - Nasdaq was the new darling child, the S&P 500 was at an all-time new high and the Dow and Russell were teasing with their all-time highs.........but today - the Dow 30 is now flat for the year and both the S&P and Nasdaq have closed below their 50 day moving average's and the small cap Russell 2000 - well that broke its 50 & is now sitting right on its 100 dma at 1217.In the past week - stocks have reversed course, giving back all of the April gains.....There was not one sector left standing as investors did a little 'window undressing' at the end of the month....or as the incomparable Arthur Cashin of UBS and worldwide fame said:""Today's action looks like end of month window BREAKING""And so it was.....you could hear the smashing glass as investors started throwing everything out the window - the only thing left was the kitchen sink....but hold on - that may be next....We can credit the 'usual suspects'.........ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates, the pending Greek Tragedy, key weak earnings, weakening macro data and the tensions building in the Persian Gulf as the Iranians try to bully the international community causing us to send warships to 'accompany US ships thru the Strait of Hormuz.....as one 'unidentified' US Official put it:""Out of abundance of caution, because of the unpredictability of our Iranian friends, we're now positioned so that, should the Iranians decide that they're going to be stupid, we're ready to respond...."" (Iranian officials have yet to comment...)So after you turn on the lights and look back- you will see that we haven't gone anywhere in the broad market so far this year. Yesterday, we got confirmation that the economy is not growing...... 4 months ago the GDP was 'supposedly' growing at 5.0% and now the GDP is growing at 0.02%. - Yes - that is NOT a typo.....a 4.98% reversal in activity......and this as all of the major indexes were making all time highs. (There's that whole disconnect thing again......)But you say - ""Why the negative - we knew this...The Atlanta Fed's forecasting model actually called for growth of 0.01% - so in fact - we beat it! Where are the party hats? What does the Atlanta Fed say about this quarter? Their initial forecast calls for growth of 0.9% - a far cry from the consensus estimates of 3% - so the reality of the robust recovery......well - ain't so robust. These are recession numbers....Hey...I'm just sayin.....Over the last 2 weeks - we have seen the dollar get clobbered (not such a bad thing for the multinationals)...it is down 5% - this though has been good for oil...(dollar down/oil up) and prices ended the month of April up another $1.05 closing at $59.63/barrel or up 17% in that same time. And with tensions building in the gulf - you can rest assured that there is now a floor under the price of oil....(could this whole Iranian thing be a set up to goose oil?)Yesterday we heard from some of the big oil companies.... Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CHV), ConocoPhillips (COP), - while the plunge in oil prices has caused some heartburn for the oil producers it has created a boom for the refiners.....and in fact American refiners are laughing all the way to the bank....because US crude - cheaper than Brent - has given them the competitive advantage over their European and Mid East rivals.......and the plot thickens.....After the bell - LinkedIn (LKND) slashed guidance - blaming the strong dollar and weaker demand for its problems.....the stock was down 5 points during the trading day and then got slammed in the afterhours session......dropping more than 20%....this morning in early pre-market trading it is hovering around $201....There we go again with these 'high growth stocks'......(Recall Twitter) - it is difficult to forecast and guide - so when they do they set themselves up for failure - but anyone trading these names understands that.....and if they don't - they do now.....US futures are up 6 points....not surprising after being down 21 points yesterday.....with the S&P 500 now broken its short term support at 2090 - look for that to become resistance again......support is now at 2070ish......It is May 1st...so expect to hear the 'sell in May and go away' mantra - as historians come out of the woodwork telling us about this phenomenon......This is a well known trading adage - essentially telling investors to take the summer off......Economic data today includes April ISM Manufacturing - expectations of 52. March Construction Spending of +0.5% and University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey...expectations of 96...on the earnings front - look for Weyerhauser (WY), CVS Health (CVS), Legg Mason (LM), VF (VFC) to name just a few.Also, watch for 2 Fed speakers today....Loretta Mester (Cleveland Fed) at 8:30 a.m. ETand John Williams (San Francisco) at 3:20 p.m. - of the two - Williams is the one that has the potential to create more noise.....Take good careKpKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O'Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

812,CVS,"Remember back almost six long years ago -- July 22d, to be exact -- when President Obama was concluding another marathon news conference? A reporter looking for something, anything to write about, went fishing and asked the first black president for his reaction to the recent arrest of a black Harvard professor by local police.The arresting officer, who was white, was answering a late-night burglary-in-progress call. He saw a black man entering a house and when he questioned his identity, the man became irate and outraged. Trained to be wary, the officers restrained the man while sorting out the situation.Now, even off the cuff an unprepared president could have said something like, ""I think I'll leave that to local authorities.""But

If that holds up, it would be the biggest gain since the third quarter of 2012.Revenue is seen rising 9% to $34.6 billion, which would be the biggest top-line increase since the September 2013 quarter.In Q4 2014, UnitedHealth topped sales and earnings views, as its Optum Health Services platform delivered a 23% revenue gain. Optum includes a managed care business, a software and consulting unit, and pharmacy benefit management (PBM) provider.The PBM unit, OptumRx, will get a lot bigger when UnitedHealth closes its $12 billion acquisition of Catamaran (CTRX), which was announced on March 30. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter.The merged entity will serve 65 million customers — nearly twice the 35 million that Catamaran currently serves. That should give UnitedHealth's PBM business the kind of scale and bargaining power to land better deals on drugs, analysts say.""The combination of the two entities will take the total annual prescriptions filled to nearly 1 billion and make it the third largest player in the industry with a market share of around 20%,"" Trefis analysts noted in a recent report.In comparison, the report said, ""CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESRX), which together control more than 50% of the PBM market, filled around 1 billion prescriptions each in 2014.""Trefis says OptumRx was the fastest-growing business in the entire Optum division in 2014: ""OptumRx revenues have almost doubled since 2010, and there was improvement in the bottom line as well. This is exhibited by the fact that EBITDA margins improved from under 3% in 2011 to 4.4% in 2014.""UnitedHealth has an IBD Composite Rating of 92.

"
881,CVS,"Monday brought a surprising turn to the twisting story of hepatitis C treatments, as pharmacy giant CVS Health said it will offer exclusive coverage for Gilead Sciences' hep C drugs.
"
882,CVS,"But the key issue of price remained unanswered.The deal seemed to counterattack one cut two weeks ago between pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), days after the FDA OK'd AbbVie's four-drug Viekira Pak for genotype 1 of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Express Scripts said that at the start of 2015 it would cover only the Viekira Pak for genotype 1 patients, unless they'd already started a course with another drug.Although both firms were tight-lipped on the details, CVS' (CVS) deal appeared to mirror Express Scripts'. Starting Wednesday, CVS, which also operates as a pharmacy benefit manager, will cover Gilead's (GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni exclusively on its CVS/Caremark Standard Commercial, Exchange (Marketplace), Medicare Part D and Medicaid formularies. Viekira Pak would be covered only for patients who got an exception or prior approval.What they didn't say was how much CVS will pay for the drugs.Price was the big motive behind Express Scripts' deal, as it had objected to the cost of the new hepatitis C drugs ever since Sovaldi launched in December 2013 at $84,000 for a 12-week round of therapy.Harvoni, which for most patients eliminated the need for companion drugs, launched in October at $94,500 for 12 weeks.However, there wasn't much anyone could do about it as long as there were no competitors of equal quality on the market.When the Viekira Pak was approved on Dec. 19, a price war seemed to have been averted as the treatment priced at a modest discount to Harvoni — $83,319 for 12 weeks — which most analysts thought accounted for the fact that it's more complicated to take than one-pill-a-day Harvoni, though it's equally effective.Price Subject To HagglingAs Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum has observed, the official list price of a drug is a lot like the sticker price on a car, just a starting point for haggling.AbbVie acknowledged that Express got Viekira Pak at a discount, though it declined to reveal how much. Analysts think it could have been 25% to 30%.Gilead's stock fell more than 17% the day Express disclosed the deal, and some analysts cut their ratings or lowered their targets.Monday's news helped Gilead's stock rally 2%. AbbVie fell 2%.""Gilead is not a biotech start-up,"" Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert said Monday. ""This is a savvy, marketing-driven company that understands how to launch and manage a product life cycle. .. . Don't underestimate Gilead's ability to manage the competitive environment.""In his own research note Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee pointed out that he and most of the Street had already assumed a Gilead price cut once Viekira Pak came out.""We already have a steep 15% gross to net and moving to 18% over the following few quarters,"" Yee wrote. ""So it's not like we think the average price to CVS is going to be drastically different than a 15%-20% discount.""
"
883,CVS,"As the price war over the new hepatitis C drugs heats up, the 2015 consensus estimates for both may be too high, according to Deutsche Bank.In two separate notes Tuesday and Wednesday, analyst Robyn Karnauskas calculated the prospects for AbbVie's (ABBV) Viekira Pak and Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Harvoni and Sovaldi after the two companies announced a series of exclusive agreements with payers and pharmacy benefit managers.""ABBV has so far nailed down 7% of US lives (Express Scripts (ESRX) national formulary) while GILD has been chosen as preferred for 30% of US lives (CVS (CVS) and Anthem (ANTM),"" she wrote. ""If we were to assume 10% market share for ABBV among non-exclusive/preferred lives, we see overall share for ABBV at 14% and US sales at $1.25 billion in 2015.""With added revenues from Europe, where the drugs in Viekira Pak are expected to launch this year both as a set and as separate products, Karnauskas arrived at total HCV sales of $2 billion vs. $2.7 billion consensus. However, she also expects Gilead is going to low-ball consensus due to the price discounts it's had to negotiate to compete with AbbVie.""At worst case, we expect discounts in commercial channels to be 15% for Harvoni (5% Sovaldi) which coupled with government discounts (40% Harvoni, 30% Sovaldi) calculates to 22% overall discount for HCV franchise,"" she wrote, explaining that this could result in revenue guidance $1 billion lower than the present consensus of $28.6 billion. ""If guidance comes $2.5 billion lower that would validate what PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) are telegraphing regarding discounts.""AbbVie is due to report Q4 and 2015 guidance on Jan. 30. Gilead hasn't yet set a date for its report.Despite these lowered estimates, Karnauskas maintained a buy rating on both stocks due to their pipelines full of other promising drug candidates. The stocks didn't react much on the stock market today: In afternoon trading, Gilead was down 0.5% while AbbVie was down 1.4%. Gilead moved back above its 50-day moving average on Tuesday while AbbVie continues to slide below that key level.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.RELATED: Aetna Side With Gilead In Hepatitis C Drug Battle.

884,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) on Monday said it would select Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi and Harvoni as the exclusive treatments for hepatitis C patients who use some of its benefit plans, the latest development in what could become a price war among hepatitis C drugmakers.The decision, which takes hold Wednesday, comes after Express Scripts' (ESRX) move last month to dump Gilead's drugs from its preferred formulary list for genotype 1 hepatitis C patients, in favor of AbbVie's (ABBV) rival drug Viekira Pak. AbbVie agreed to discount the drug to get on the list, amid concerns that the hep C drugs from both AbbVie and Gilead are too expensive for many low-income patients.Harvoni costs $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment, compared to Viekira Pak's $83,319. Sovaldi costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment.""Our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients with all genotypes of hepatitis C,"" CVS said, according to Bloomberg. It was unclear if Gilead and CVS agreed to any kind of discount.Express Scripts, in announcing its decision to add AbbVie's drug to its preferred list, cited concerns about a lack of sufficient price competition in the hepatitis C drug space. The company's clients have also warned about costs.""If the specialty drug trend continues to increase by double-digit percentages, payers will be forced to implement even more narrow management tools, thus limiting the number of patients who can afford to receive the drug therapy,"" Paula Jakub, CEO American Foreign Service Protective Association, said last month. ""It only makes sense for manufacturers to work with payers on pricing decisions.""Gilead's shares tumbled 15.5% on Dec. 22, the day of Express Scripts' announcement. They were up 2.8% on the stock market today . AbbVie shares fell 2%, below their 50-day line for the first time since October.CVS said Sovaldi and Harvoni will be the exclusive treatment for its list of standard commercial drugs, as well as its Medicaid, Medicare Part D and health-exchange formularies.The Wall Street Journal reported that patients could get AbbVie's Viekira Pak only if they obtained approval or a medical exception in advance.RBC Capital Markets reacted favorably to CVS' decision in an analyst note.""We view this as positive because it removes near-term uncertainty for many investors who feared CVS would also strike a deal with ABBV and further put more pressure on GILD,"" RBC said.

954,CVS,"Text of President Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are fifteen years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.  But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service.America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another — or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.They were young and in love in America, and it doesn’t get much better than that.“If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.”As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction — and home for dinner every night.“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled.  You are the reason I ran for this office.  You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.<[>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  And more Americans finish college than ever before.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way.  We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.  But here’s the thing — those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet — tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.That’s what middle-class economics is — the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.  We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success — we want everyone to contribute to our success.So what does middle-class economics require in our time?First — middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement — and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.Here’s one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority — so this country provided universal childcare.  In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.It’s not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.  It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America — by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.Here’s another example.  Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave.  Forty-three million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  It’s the right thing to do.Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  Really.  It’s 2015.  It’s time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship.  That’s not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage — these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  That is a fact.  And that’s what all of us — Republicans and Democrats alike — were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world.  But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education.  Two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero.  Forty percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt.  Understand, you’ve got to earn it — you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran.Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.  Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago — jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  That’s why the third part of middle-class economics is about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure — modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen?  We should write those rules.  We should level the playing field.  That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair.Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.  But ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China.  Let’s give them one more reason to get it done.21st century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development.  I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine — one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.  In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.  Tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes — and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs — converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay.  Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.  In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.  Good luck, Captain — and make sure to Instagram it.Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there’s bipartisan support in this chamber.  Members of both parties have told me so.  Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.  As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.  They’ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don’t need, denying a break to middle class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that.  Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.  Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.  We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.  We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.  Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness.  This is where America needs to go.  I believe it’s where the American people want to go.  It will make our economy stronger a year from now, fifteen years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if there’s one thing this new century has taught us, it’s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.  In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.  When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military — then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.  That’s what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.  That’s exactly what we’re doing right now — and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists — from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.  We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we’ve learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years.Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we’ve trained their security forces, who’ve now taken the lead, and we’ve honored our troops’ sacrifice by supporting that country’s first democratic transition.  Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance.  Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.  We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.  This effort will take time.  It will require focus.  But we will succeed.  And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.  We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.  Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.That’s how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new.  Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.  And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.  As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of “small steps.”  These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.  And after years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.  Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we’ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.  Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies — including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.  But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails — alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.  It doesn’t make sense.  That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.  The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, we’re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.  We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism.  And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children’s information.  If we don’t act, we’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.  If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola — saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.  I couldn’t be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done — and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules — in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.  And no challenge — no challenge — poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does — 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.I’ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they’re not scientists; that we don’t have enough information to act.  Well, I’m not a scientist, either.  But you know what — I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities.  The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.That’s why, over the past six years, we’ve done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it.  That’s why we’ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.  And that’s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.  I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action.  In Beijing, we made an historic announcement — the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.  And because the world’s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we’ve got.There’s one last pillar to our leadership — and that’s the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I’ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.  It’s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.  It’s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims — the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.  That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.  We do these things not only because they’re right, but because they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice — so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.  Since I’ve been President, we’ve worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half.  Now it’s time to finish the job.  And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It’s not who we are.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties — and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.  So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven’t.  As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.  And next month, we’ll issue a report on how we’re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past.  Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.  Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.  Leading — always — with the example of our values.  That’s what makes us exceptional.  That’s what keeps us strong.  And that’s why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards — our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn’t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America — but a United States of America.  I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home — a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world’s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision.  How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.  It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws — of which there are many — but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naïve, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.I know how tempting such cynicism may be.  But I still think the cynics are wrong.I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.  I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.  I’ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London.  I’ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia.  I’ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.  I’ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home.  So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother’s keeper, and our sister’s keeper.  And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.  So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes.  I’ve served in Congress with many of you.  I know many of you well.  There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.  And many of you have told me that this isn’t what you signed up for — arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.  Imagine if we did something different.Understand — a better politics isn’t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.  A better politics is one where we appeal to each other’s basic decency instead of our basest fears.  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives.  A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America.If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments — but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.  We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs.Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it’s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.  But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed.  Surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.  Surely we can agree it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all.That’s a better politics.  That’s how we start rebuilding trust.  That’s how we move this country forward.  That’s what the American people want.  That’s what they deserve.I have no more campaigns to run.  My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I’ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol — to do what I believe is best for America.  If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you’ll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth — that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood:  your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids.I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen — man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:  that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past six years:  “It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family.  We, too, have made it through some hard times.  Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.  We’ve laid a new foundation.  A brighter future is ours to write.  Let’s begin this new chapter — together — and let’s start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. ####

1031,CVS,"Walgreen will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings early Tuesday amid continuing pressure from federal government reimbursements and archrival CVS Health, which is rebranding its stores.The government is asking pharmacies to accept lower reimbursements in exchange for higher patient counts. For example, Medicare Part D monthly premiums are slated to drop an average 2.3% next year, according to an analysis by consulting firm Avalere Health.The reimbursements are roiling the industry. Walgreen (WAG) in August ousted its chief financial officer after a forecasting error in the Medicare-related business forced the company to cut $1.1 billion from its prescription drug earnings outlook for fiscal 2016.No. 3 U.S. drugstore chain Rite Aid (RAD) earlier this month also lowered its earnings forecast for the current fiscal year and cited reimbursements as well.Meanwhile, CVS recently rebranded itself CVS Health (CVS) and said that it would no longer sell cigarettes, a move that's expected to cost the company $2 billion a year in sales but put it at the forefront of the U.S. health movement.Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for Walgreen to report a slight uptick in Q4 earnings per share to 74 cents from 73 cents a year ago. Revenue is projected to rise 6% to $19.02 billion.Walgreen sales rose 3.6% in August to $6.39 billion, and comparable-store front-end sales edged up 1.4%. But customer traffic in comparable stores fell 1.7% for the month. In July, sales rose 6.1% to $6.39 billion, and comparable-store sales rose 1.4%, but customer traffic slid 2.6%.Walgreen — the nation's largest drugstore chain, with more than 8,600 stores — is trying to make deals to boost earnings.In August, the company agreed to pay $5.9 billion for the 55% of Swiss-based pharmacy chain and drug distributor Alliance Boots that it didn't own.Walgreen had also considered reincorporating overseas after the Alliance Boots deal is completed to cut its tax rate. But it changed its mind under pressure from the Obama administration and members of Congress who have criticized companies that opt for offshore domiciles in countries where tax rates are lower than in the United States, a process known as tax inversion.The decision to forego a tax inversion disappointed investors who were hopefully eyeing a lower European tax rate.Walgreen shares were down less than 1% in Monday morning trading on the stock market today.Walgreen's stock carries a weak 34 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99, meaning that it performed better than only 34% of all stocks in recent quarters on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar .

""Ninety percent of mobile pay in the U.S. takes place at Starbucks locations.

1106,CVS,"Monthly premiums for stand-alone Medicare Part D prescription drug plans will likely fall next year as a number of sponsors consolidate offerings into lower-cost plans, according to a study released Monday by Avalere Health.After analyzing data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the health care advisory firm estimated that average premiums would fall by 2% to $38.95, from $39.88 in 2014.As premiums decline, Avalere warns, Medicare Part D sponsors ""may be shifting more cost-sharing responsibilities to beneficiaries."" For example, the proportion of prescription drug plans with zero deductibles in 2015 will drop to 42% from 47% in 2014.In addition, Part D sponsors ""continue to move away"" from offering coverage in the drug-coverage gap, or donut hole, as the Affordable Care Act gradually closes the gap. Some 74% of such plans will not offer coverage of drugs in the gap next year, Avalere said.""While beneficiaries will welcome lower premiums, they will need to look at other facets of benefit design, including how their medications are covered, cost-sharing responsibilities and total out-of-pocket spending,"" stated Christine Harhaj, senior manager at Avalere.Avalere noted a wide variance among the top plans. For example, a consolidated plan from Aetna (AET), called Aetna Medicare Rx Saver, will reduce premiums by 31% to $24.46, while WellCare Health's (WCG) Classic plan will go up by 52% to $31.46.The two most expensive plans are Humana (HUM) Enhanced at $52.81, up 11% from 2014, and the AARP MedicareRx Preferred from UnitedHealth (UNH) at $50.15, up 16% over 2014, Avalere said. The latter plan is also the largest by number of enrollments, at nearly 3.8 million.Humana also has among two of the lowest-priced 2015 plans: the Humana Preferred Rx Plan at $26.40 and Humana's Wal-Mart (WMT) Rx Plan at $15.67.The second largest plan by enrollment (at nearly 2.5 million), SilverScript Choice, will see average premiums fall by 21% in 2015 to $23.16, Avalere said. SilverScript Choice is offered by SilverScript Insurance, a CVS Caremark company, part of CVS Health (CVS).Another plan from UnitedHealth, the AARP MedicareRx Saver Plus, will have an average premium of $28, Avalere said.As for Medicare Advantage plans, Avalere found that the number of those plans will drop 3% amid continued government reimbursement cutbacks.

1230,CVS,"Amazon.com seems to be eyeing a lot of possibilities with Prime Pantry, a service that lets Amazon Prime members order up to 45 pounds of canned or packaged items — cereal, paper towels, soft drinks, etc. — and get it shipped to their homes for a flat rate of $5.99.The service, which launched in late April, targets the mass market for nonperishable groceries. Analysts say it's a stab at rivals such as Costco (COST) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Observers say it also lays the groundwork for a national grocery delivery service along with AmazonFresh, a test program that offers same-day or next-day delivery of perishables and other groceries. That service is being tested in Seattle, Los Angles and San Francisco.Prime Pantry offers an additional perk for Amazon Prime members, at a time when Amazon (AMZN) is pushing to keep people in the program after this year's hike in the annual membership fee, to $99 from $79.Basically, Pantry is ""part of Amazon's larger strategy to become a much bigger player in grocery"" deliveries, says Bill Bishop, chief architect of retail technology consulting firm Brick Meets Click.Tried By 3% Of RespondentsBut there's evidence Pantry is falling a bit flat with consumers, who either don't know about the program or don't plan to try it.A mid-May survey by research firm Bizrate Insights, a unit of online retail site Shopzilla, found that 66.7% of 1,762 consumers polled nationwide didn't know about Amazon Pantry, while fewer than 3% had tried out the service. Only 7.5% said they planned to try the service, though only 23% totally ruled it out, the poll found.About 25% of the respondents were Amazon Prime members.""The majority of Amazon Prime members in our survey didn't know what Amazon Pantry is,"" Hayley Silver, vice president of Bizrate, told IBD. ""There was confusion over other Amazon offers like AmazonFresh or grocery subscriptions.""There's not a lot of knowledge and awareness. (Amazon Pantry) can't move the needle if it lacks awareness.""Silver says Prime members could be confused by the many recent announcements from Amazon touting new services and perks for Prime. ""Some Prime members recalled getting an email from Amazon about Pantry, but it just didn't resonate,"" Silver said.Among those who said they had no plans to try Pantry, Silver says some may have been turned off by the $5.99 delivery fee.4-Cubic-Foot BoxAlso, she says, it might be difficult for some users to calculate how many grocery items equal 45 pounds of goods and can fit into the 4-cubic-foot box in which Pantry items are delivered.Silver also says Pantry's market could be limited.""It seems the audience for Amazon Pantry would be somebody without a car or who lives very far from stores like CVS or Target, or with another inhibitor that would stop them from getting these items on their own,"" she said.On the upside, analysts say Prime Pantry offers a way for Amazon to popularize online sales of items like pet food, diapers and canned soup, which before had to be ordered in bulk to qualify for free, two-day shipping under Prime.Prime Pantry items are being offered with special discount coupons, helping cut costs for users.Brick Meets Click's Bishop says a survey of 22,000 customers conducted by his firm at the end of 2013 showed that the AmazonFresh grocery service was used by 39% of households who had bought groceries online from various providers in the 30 days before the poll.""This was mainly to buy one or two items that couldn't easily be found in another place,"" Bishop said.But that 39% was by far the highest tally among all the vendors, he says. ""Amazon dominates in this space,"" Bishop said.Bishop judges Amazon Pantry a success. He says it provides a nice benefit for those open to online grocery shopping and boosts Amazon's market share in this sector.Coupon ClickingBut Silver sees other weaknesses in Pantry. She says Prime members need to click each coupon separately to qualify and do the math to compare the prices with other online delivery services.""It's an extra step consumers have to take,"" said Silver, who notes that typical loyalty programs at regular grocery stores automatically apply such discounts at the register without the need for such online coupon clipping.Based on website checks, Silver says some online grocery items sold by Target (TGT) are cheaper than identical items discounted on Amazon Pantry. Target offers free deliveries for eligible online orders that total $50 or more.Amazon is doing more in the grocery field. In April, it unveiled Amazon Dash, a wand-shaped device that lets users add grocery items and household goods to their AmazonFresh online grocery shopping lists by speaking into the device, which is equipped with voice-recognition technology.Users can reorder by scanning the bar codes on the wrappers of products already delivered.The device is being distributed free to consumers participating in AmazonFresh's pilot program. Such a device could also be used to place orders for Amazon Pantry, though that's not yet the case.AmazonFresh, Amazon Pantry and Amazon Dash could merge into a national online delivery service, with analysts expecting more announcements from the company.

1318,CVS,"After three years of single-digit earnings growth, CVS Caremark (CVS) rebounded in 2012.Final results haven't been reported yet, but the Street estimates 2012 EPS climbed 21%. Analysts expect earnings this year to rise 16%.The five-year EPS Stability Factor is 4 on a gauge that runs from 0 (calm) to 99 (erratic).For the income investor this is good news because stable earnings growth provides a platform for dividend growth. CVS has increased its dividend for 10 consecutive years and aggressively since 2007. In the past six years, the annualized payout rose from 15.5 cents a share to 65 cents a share last year.In December, the company announced that the quarterly payout would be jacked up from 16.25 cents to 22.5 cents a share, or annually from 65 cents to 90 cents. The new quarterly rate will be paid on Feb. 4 to shareholders of record Jan. 24.The current annualized yield is 1.7%, which is below the S&P 500's 2.56% yield.However, CVS Caremark's stock-price appreciation has been better than the major indexes. Over the past five years, CVS rose 40% vs. 33% for the Nasdaq and 11% for the S&P 500. Last year, CVS advanced 23%, topping the Nasdaq's 19% gain.The company has more than 7,400 drugstores, a pharmacy benefits unit serving 63 million plan members and 640 MinuteClinics in 25 states.CVS intends to grow the MinuteClinics to 1,500 in 35 states by 2017.In Q3, pharmacy services accounted for about 60% of net revenue.Drawbacks include the government's role in the health sector; slim margins in the PBM business; and a return on equity of about 10% in 2011 — well below the 17% minimum associated with elite stocks.The Composite Rating of 82 also is somewhat low, though about two months ago, it was 68.

The consumer spending estimate was unchanged at 1% growth, in line with expectations.The upshot: growth was slower than expected during the quarter, while inflation rose faster than forecast.  That complicates the pressure on the Federal Reserve, which has signaled that two more interest rate hikes are likely before the end of the year, but is already wrestling with its impact on the finance and stock markets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1322,CVS,"Just when health care investors thought it was safe to dive back into retail pharmacy stocks, Amazon.com (AMZN) delivered a jolt on Thursday by buying PillPack, an online pharmacy that delivers prescriptions presorted by the dose. The move sent shares of CVS Health (CVS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbling. Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen (ABC), Cardinal Health (CAH) and McKesson (MCK) also retreated, along with pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX).In April, Walmart (WMT) had reportedly been close to a deal to buy PillPack, nudging aside Amazon. Meanwhile, Amazon's feared shake-up of health care no longer looked quite so scary as the company shelved plans to deliver medical supplies.Now there will again be a focus on just how big of a threat Amazon represents to the prescription retail industry. Already, CVS has moved to same-day delivery in major markets and next-day delivery.

1323,CVS,"The U.S. economy added 213,000 jobs in June as the jobless rate ticked up to 4.0%, the lowest in nearly a half century, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Wage growth, the key number for stock market investors worried about more Fed rate hikes, came in softer than expected at a 2.7% annual rate.Wall Street economists expected 190,000 new jobs, 3.8% unemployment and 2.8% wage growth.Including an upward revision to April and May payroll gains of 37,000, the economy has added 211,000 jobs a month over the past quarter.Dow futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures, under pressure as President Trump opened fire in his China trade war, turned mixed on the jobs data.

1324,CVS,"Biopharma investors breathed a collective sigh of relief Friday after a drug-pricing speech from President Trump was consistent with earlier views that he would offer ""more rhetoric than reform,"" according to one analyst.On the stock market today, biotech and pharmaceutical stocks stayed in the black at the close, up 2%-3%. Pharmacy retailers like CVS (CVS) and Amerisource Bergen (ABC) briefly retreated before jumping a respective 3.2% and 1.6%.Trump's plan to cut foreign drug prices would actually help pharmaceutical companies, says Topher Spiro, vice president of health policy for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy think tank. Spiro was critical earlier in the week of a potential blueprint for pricing reform.""Why are Big Pharma stocks way up?"" Spiro said in a tweet. ""Trump is promising their number one priority: trade deals that boost prices abroad. And virtually nothing touching U.S. prices.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpecifically, Trump said he had instructed Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, to work on trade agreements with foreign countries for drug prices. The president called for Lighthizer to ""end global freeloading once and for all.""Outside that, Trump's plan was light on details. He pledged to ""eliminate the middlemen"" but stopped just short of identifying those as pharmacy benefit managers. He swore to take on the ""tangled web of special interests,"" but didn't say how.Pharmacists should be allowed to tell patients how to save money, Trump said. He also called out firms for using patents to ""choke out competition."" And Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar argued drugmakers should be required to list the prices of their drugs in commercials.Altogether, ""Trump's drug-pricing plan has gaping holes,"" Spiro said on Twitter. It doesn't address how to cut prices on existing and launching drugs for private insurance, Medicare Part D nor Medicaid. It only looks at cuts for Medicaid Part B, he said.Height Capital Markets analyst Andrea Harris didn't expect the proposals to have any teeth without Congressional support. Trump says he's working on it, but didn't outline which specific proposals he expects to send to Congress in the coming weeks.But one piece of Harris' report did come to fruition: Trump had a lot of blame to spread for the ""broken system."" Among those, he identified drugmakers, insurance companies, distributors, pharmacy benefit managers and the government for keeping prices ""artificially high.""Trump also called out ""twisted incentives"" under ObamaCare. He promised to give Medicare Part D plans, which cover pharmaceuticals, new tools to negotiate and incentives to keep prices low. He pledged to end ""dishonest double dealing"" that enriches middlemen.""We are not going to reward companies that constantly raise prices,"" he said.Harris had predicted ""fiery rhetoric"" from Trump.""The president never shies away from fiery rhetoric, and we expect that in his speech he will finger manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, insurers, hospitals and foreign countries as responsible for high drug prices,"" she said in a report before the speech.Health Secretary Azar said Trump's blueprint has more than 50 actions planned. The goal is to ""reorder an entire, complex system of our economy,"" he said.Earlier in the week, Azar outlined a laundry list of hurdles the HHS is working to solve. He noted issues with high list prices, seniors and government overpaying due to a lack of negotiation tools, rising out-of-pocket costs, and foreign governments ""free-riding off American innovation.""""HHS' blueprint for addressing these issues will build on the proposals put forth in President Trump's 2019 budget, but he wants to go much, much further,"" Azar said at the time. On Friday, though, he was more subdued on the specifics.Trump is working on ""real change while continuing to lead the world in innovation and patient access.""Harris had expected Trump to blame rebates, a pricing practice in the pharmaceutical supply chain that makes it so patients don't have to pay the full list prices for drugs. These are often negotiated by middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.In a speech earlier this week, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called out PBMs for allegedly failing to pass savings onto patients. The FDA has the power to approve drugs, but it can't dictate their prices.""The top three PBMs control more than two-thirds of the market, the top three wholesalers more than 80%, and the top five pharmacies more than 50%,"" he said, according to Business Insider. ""Market concentration may prevent optimal competition.""Harris doesn't expect Trump to ban rebates altogether. But she did expect for him to call on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to require PBMs to pass rebates onto patients. The HHS could also be asked to deem rebates as kickbacks, she said.But some highly priced drugs will likely be spared, American Progress' Spiro said ahead of the speech.""There is nothing, absolutely nothing in this plan to lower the sky-high launch prices of new specialty drugs,"" he said. ""These drugs are for diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis, costing tends of thousands or even $100,000.""Heights' Harris expected Trump to call on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to use HHS authority to write new payment models in Medicaid and Medicaid Part B. Part B is health insurance coverage, whereas Part A covers hospital expenses.It's possible Trump could require physician-administered drugs to be negotiated under a PBM-like payment model. Currently, these receive reimbursement at 106% the market price, she said.This ""would force these drugs to compete for placement on a formulary like prescription drugs currently do,"" she said. ""This could be a material headwind for manufacturers, but it is politically challenging.""In the blueprint posted by Spiro, the proposal allows for greater flexibility in negotiating for prices under Medicare Part D. Part D is the prescription-drug side of Medicare. It would also offer free generics to low-income patients and require plans to share rebates with patients.But, American Progress' Spiro added, ""There is nothing, absolutely nothing in here to lower drug prices for the 150 million Americans with employer coverage or the millions more with other private insurance.""Trump also praised efforts by the FDA to approve more generic drugs and said that will continue. In 2017, the FDA approved a record number of generic drugs in an effort to increase competition. The FDA is soon to unveil a plan to boost the number of biologic copies, called biosimilars.It's possible Trump could also call on Congress to crack down on patent and market exclusivity ""gaming practices"" between branded- and generic-drug manufacturers, Harris said. He could further require the Federal Trade Commission to enforce ""pay for delay"" violations.Hospitals are also at risk, she said. The Trump administration is rewriting regulations that require manufacturers to sell drugs to hospitals and clinics at deep discounts. This allows providers to be reimbursed at market price and pocket the extra cash, she said.""We expect the president to call for further pro-patient (and pro-manufacturer) changes to this program, some of which can be achieved unilaterally through regulation and others that will require congressional action,"" she said.As expected, Trump blamed foreign governments for ""exploiting U.S. drugmakers."" The same pill with the same ingredients, in the same package, made in the same plant, costs more in the U.S. than it does in other countries, he said.""When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S. drugmakers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost of research and development,"" he said. ""It's unfair and it's ridiculous and it's not going to happen any longer.""But, this will all have ""much more bark than bite,"" Heights Capital Markets' Harris said. The outcome will be dependent on trade agreements, she said. American Progress' Spiro agrees.""This is the biggest item on Big Pharma's wish list!"" he said.

1325,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS) said it's making progress in the regulatory review of its $68 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna (AET) after first-quarter earnings came in higher than analysts anticipated.Both CVS and rival Express Scripts (ESRX) are trying to get their mega mergers approved by regulators, as drug middlemen combine with large insurers in the U.S. to offer a larger suite of medical services under one roof.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe shares gained 2% to 69.33 in stock market trading.CVS's proposed takeover of Aetna would bring together around 10,000 CVS stores and the health insurer's 22 million customers. A central plank of the deal is transforming the stores into health hubs where consumers can get care, pick up their drugs, buy some cosmetics, and stay out of the hospital. In a sign of its ambition, last month, CVS hired a senior executive from a startup that specializes in primary-care clinics to oversee expanded health-care services across the company.Aetna reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed estimates Tuesday.""Aetna is firing on all cylinders, validating that CVS would gain pristine health insurance assets should the deal go through,"" wrote Jason McGorman, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.Concerns that Amazon.com (AMZN) may start directly competing with CVS by selling prescription drugs have receded recently, following a CNBC report in April that the internet retailer had shelved plans too sell drugs to hospitals and other businesses.

1330,CVS,"Wall Street expects the April jobs report to show the economy added 191,000 new jobs last month as the unemployment rate fell to 4% for the first time since 2000. Yet for stock market investors on edge over Fed rate-hike plans, wage growth is the key number. There's a good chance it will surprise on the upside.Economists expect average hourly wage growth of 2.7% from a year earlier, same as in March. Yet a host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhat's different from 2016 is that now the jobless rate is nearly a percentage point lower, meaning more competition for workers. On top of that, numerous companies announced wage hikes in the wake of tax reform.The likely combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March.

1331,CVS,"Goldilocks has left the building. For proof, just look at interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield eclipsed 3% in late April for the first time in four years, hitting the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq. Clearly, the not-too-hot/not- too-cold economy that supported the nine-year bull market for stocks has fundamentally changed. On Wednesday, the 10-year yield again hit 3%.To some extent, that's good: Higher interest rates largely reflect faster economic growth, unemployment headed to a multidecade low and wage gains that are slowly picking up.Yet financial markets are sending the message that this good news comes with a growing risk of a squeeze on the economy from several directions. First, higher goods and wage costs will squeeze corporate profits. Caterpillar (CAT) warned recently that the first quarter was the ""high-water mark"" for operating margins, and profit pressures already are hitting other companies ranging from airlines to packaged food. Second, higher interest rates will squeeze corporate and household borrowers. Rising rates also could squeeze stock prices as investors opt for higher returns from risk-free short-term government bonds.Yet by far the biggest risk is that policymakers will go overboard. Fed rate hikes to counteract a temporary growth spurt from new tax cuts and government spending could push the economy into a recession if they go too far.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor the stock market, the most obvious sign of peril is the hit to the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average since late January. But worrisome signs lurk in the details. Both homebuilders, which thrive on low interest rates, and banks, which can benefit from rising rates, are among the market's biggest laggards.IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group has sunk to 176 out of 197 industries based on stock performance. Shares of Lennar (LEN), the largest U.S. homebuilder, have tumbled from their January high. Meanwhile, the Banks-Money Center group, which includes JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and more, has slid to No. 158.While the latest data point to a robust housing market, there's no mystery about why housing stocks have tumbled as the 10-year Treasury yield pushes up mortgage rates. But what about the recent underperformance vs. the S&P 500 from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America? While higher interest rates have grabbed the headlines, the more ominous signal is the flattening Treasury yield curve. Over the past year, the gap between the 2-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield has been cut by more than half. The yield curve is at its flattest levels since the lead-up to the 2007 recession.Higher interest rates boost profits for Bank of America, Citigroup and others when the longer-term rates at which they lend increase more than the short-term rates at which they borrow. But the opposite has been happening, so even bank profits are getting squeezed. Two-year yields have climbed with the Fed's overnight rate and expectations of future hikes. But the 10-year yield's rise has lagged. Investors aren't demanding a big long-term premium, which suggests mild growth expectations beyond two years. The 2-year yield has hit its highest rates since August 2008, squeezing the spread between the 2- and 10-year yields.By the second half of 2019, an economy that the Fed worries is at risk of overheating could hit a soft patch as stimulus levels off. Overly tight Fed policy that raises borrowing costs could turn that soft patch into a ditch.Fed policymakers today are focused on overheating risks, while overlooking the likely slowdown. The Fed's latest projections, issued when the Fed hiked rates in March for the first time this year, penciled in two more rate hikes in 2018, three in 2019 and still two more in 2020. That would lift the Fed's benchmark rate from 1.62% now all the way to 3.375%. If that happens, the 10-year yield could head for 4% and the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage might near 6%.The bond market's reaction to the more hawkish Fed outlook was swift. Within a week, the spread between the 2- and 10-year Treasury yield narrowed to less than 50 basis points, then fell to as little as 40 basis points in mid-April. The spread is around 47 basis points in the stock market today, with the 2-year yield at 2.53% and the 10-year at 3%.Neel Kashkari, the dovish president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, called the flatter yield curve a ""yellow light flashing"" a heightened risk of a recession. His take-away: The Fed ""may not be that far away from neutral,"" a rate that neither boosts nor restrains economic growth.""We are clearly more concerned than the Fed"" about the economic outlook for 2019, wrote Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Bank. ""As the impact of the (tax cut and spending) stimuli fades, growth rates should begin to slow perceptibly around the middle of the year, before slowing further into 2020.""Dec Mullarkey, managing director of investment research at Sun Life Investment Management, told IBD that he expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to 3.5% within a year as the Fed follows a path of accelerated tightening. He predicts one rate hike per quarter through 2019, ""which ultimately will lead to recession"" in 2020.To be fair, new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose deep into the expansion, when growth is firm and labor markets tight. To top it off, the deficit financing used to pay for stimulus, which will exacerbate what most economists see as an unsustainable fiscal path, has added to upward pressure on interest rates.Now the Fed's challenge just got even harder. Core consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.1% in March. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption price index, rose to 1.9% in March. That's just below the central bank's 2% target.Average hourly wage growth ticked up to 2.7% in March and will likely head higher in the next few months. CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) all announced pay hikes effective this spring. CVS raised its minimum wage to $11 an hour and Target to $12. They are among dozens of major companies that announced wage increases in the wake of corporate tax cuts passed in December.As core inflation edges past the Fed's target and the jobless rate falls below 4%, standing pat would go against policymakers' deepest instincts.Bandholz expects cooler heads to prevail, with the Fed hiking rates just once in 2019 as data point to a slowdown. But Mullarkey notes that the data ""feedback loop is not instantaneous."" By the time the Fed recognizes that a soft patch has arrived, a recession may be a fait accompli.Even if the Fed does shift gears a year from now, false expectations come at a cost today. If policymakers are determined to stick to a path of steady Fed rate hikes, they could dampen the dynamic impact of lower taxes by adding to the growing and unsustainable federal debt burden.The more future Fed rate hikes that markets price in, the more federal borrowing costs will rise. As the government borrows more to service debt with higher interest rates, borrowing costs for businesses and individuals will face more upward pressure.Deutsche Bank estimates that U.S. Treasury issuance will soar from $1 trillion in 2017 to $1.5 trillion this year and $2.3 trillion next. The surging federal deficit is the main culprit. The Fed will add to the debt pileup as it offloads about $180 billion in government bonds this fiscal year.The Fed set its plan last fall for quantitative tightening, reversing bond buys made to aid the tepid recovery from the financial crisis. Newly passed tax cuts and spending hikes make those balance sheet reductions look like ""bad timing,"" Mullarkey says.Corporations carry a record $8.8 trillion in debt that will be more costly to refinance, working at cross-purposes with the tax-cut stimulus.Meanwhile, higher U.S. interest rates have begun to push up the dollar. That acts to tighten financial conditions not only at home but in developing economies where companies often borrow in dollars.""The risk in all this is a scenario where economic growth doesn't pick up as the supply-siders expect it to but interest rates move higher as a result of the larger federal deficits and the perception that Trump's fiscal stimulus might boost inflation,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, the veteran Wall Street economist who now runs Yardeni Research.That may not happen, but Yardeni sees little evidence that corporations are putting their tax windfalls to work in the real economy: ""We are waiting to see some signs that the supply-siders are on the right track. We aren't seeing any yet, though it has been only four months into the Trump tax cuts.""Stock market history suggests investors shouldn't worry right away about a flatter yield curve, LPL Financial strategists John Lynch and Ryan Detrick write. ""When looking back at the previous five recessions, once the yield curve hit 0.50%, it took a median of nearly a year before the curve inverted,"" they note.An inverted yield curve, meaning long-term bond yields fall below short-term yields, is a reliable predictor of recession. Yet recessions typically haven't begun until 20 months after the yield curve inverts.Also, Lynch and Detrick note, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a median 21.5% gain after the Treasury yield spread narrows to 50 basis points.The problem with counting on that history is that the Fed faces unusual late-cycle stimulus at a time that federal debt has begun an unprecedented spiral upward.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is Inflation, And Why Does It Matter To The Fed — And You?Amazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Both were off session highs.Among drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) rose 3.5%, AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 2.25% and Cardinal Health (CAH) 3.1%.Amazon shares didn't react negatively to the news, rising 0.75% on Monday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe report seemed to have the most direct connection to the trio of major drug distributors that handle logistics for major drug manufacturers, a big revenue but low-margin business. Complexity, such as handling temperature-sensitive products, and the lack of interest among hospitals in switching purchasing relationships, will keep Amazon out of the business.Investors seemed to interpret the move as decreasing the likelihood that Amazon will enter the retail prescription business, giving a boost to CVS and Walgreens. If so, then Amazon investors apparently don't think the internet retail giant needs prescription drugs to win over and keep customer loyalty.Amazon could still enter the prescription business, such as via an acquisition of Walgreens. Or it could start small with just online pharmacy.Meanwhile, Walmart (WMT) appears to be increasingly focused on health care and pharmacy as a key to boost sales and loyalty. Walmart is reportedly in talks to merge or deepen its partnership with Humana (HUM), whose managed care businesses is focused on the Medicare population.Shares of Walmart climbed about 1%, but didn't see much of an uptick after the Amazon news broke.Cigna (CI), the managed care provider that is buying pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX), rose 2%.Shares of UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care provider, rose 2.7%.

1333,CVS,"The economy added 164,000 jobs in April as the jobless rate fell to 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Yet wage growth, the key number for stock market investors on edge about more Fed rate hikes, surprised on the downside, coming in at 2.6%.The jobs and wage data slightly lowered odds of four Fed interest-rate hikes in 2018, which should be positive for the stock market. The data didn't initially provide much of a boost. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened moderately lower after the jobs data, but the major market indexes staged a midmorning rally, fueled by Apple (AAPL). The Nasdaq led the way into positive territory, soon followed by the Dow Jones and S&P 500.Wall Street expected 191,000 new jobs, 4.0% unemployment and a 2.7% annual rise in average hourly wages. Yet the undershooting on two of three key jobs metrics may make the job market look less robust than it is.First, job gains in the prior two months were revised up by a combined 30,000, leaving the 3-month average at a rock-solid 208,000.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFurther, Jefferies economist Thomas Simons noted that wage growth is sometimes depressed in months that the Labor Department's survey of businesses doesn't include the 15th of the month, which occurred in April. If that's the case, wage growth could take a leap in May. However, March's wage gain was also revised down, from 2.7% to 2.6%.Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that other gauges of wage growth have pointed to stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index released last week showed that private-sector wages and salaries grew 2.9% from a year ago in March.After the jobs data, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 2.935% while the 2-year yield, which more closely tracks Fed rate expectations, held around 2.49%. The narrow spread between long-term and short-term interest rates may reflect concerns that the Fed will hike rates too much in the near term as the economy gets a boost from tax-cut and spending stimulus, leading to an economic letdown.The stakes have increased for each jobs report as inflation has picked up close to the Fed's target 2% and interest rates have hit multiyear highs. The combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March. Meanwhile, Wall Street has bumped up odds for a fourth rate hike this year to about 40%. Still, the Fed signaled on Wednesday that it won't be overly concerned if inflation rises a bit above 2% for a few months.There's good reason to expect a further pickup in wage growth in coming months. A host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour. Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. In March, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.What's different from 2016 is that now the jobless rate is nearly a percentage point lower, meaning more competition for workers.

1338,CVS,"Don't be fooled by the weak job growth or higher-than-expected unemployment in March. Better wage growth and less labor-market slack mean the stock market won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike fears.The good news: The surprisingly weak 103,000 job gain throws a bit of cold water on the notion that the economy is overheating.

Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Second, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes.

1339,CVS,"Wage growth will likely accelerate in the March jobs report and beyond, with hawkish implications for the Fed interest-rate outlook. Goldilocks is on her way out.Wall Street economists expect the monthly employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET to show a gain of 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate should dip to 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Average hourly wage growth should tick up to 2.7% on an annual basis from a so-so 2.6% in February.Expect the improvement in wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSecond, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes.

Envision said the deal represents a 32% premium to its stock price in November, when it announced it was reviewing strategic alternatives.Investors such as KKR and strategic buyers including  insurers have been snapping up health-care assets in the U.S. Last year, KKR finished raising money for a $1.45 billion health-care fund dedicated to growth stage companies.

1342,CVS,"Every Amazon (AMZN) flirtation toward the health care industry has sent hearts racing on Wall Street. Yet Amazon appears to be having commitment issues, and others have leapt while Jeff Bezos hesitated. Now comes a possible Walmart (WMT)-Humana (HUM) merger. A Walmart acquisition of the insurer could fundamentally reshape health care delivery in ways that Amazon may have trouble matching.A Walmart-Humana deal could potentially transform the health care market for seniors, a demographic that is critical for both companies.Walmart already operates about 4,500 in-store pharmacies and 2,900 vision centers, but a Humana deal would likely accelerate its efforts in developing in-store clinics. The clinics haven't been a knockout success, but Walmart has been learning, wrote Tracy Watts, U.S. health reform leader at Mercer, in a blog post. ""This partnership could foster new ways to bring people what they want and need,"" she wrote, highlighting health care access in rural areas.CVS Health (CVS), which is in the process of acquiring Aetna (AET), is planning to revamp its drugstores to provide more health services. Walmart has greater financial wherewithal to execute the strategy and its supercenters may be a more natural fit for health services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA Walmart-Humana tie-up has strategic merits for the retail giant, wrote Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan. He expects it would drive greater store traffic and produce health care cost savings, helping the discounter to keep investing to fend off Amazon.Savings would come from closer ties to Humana, the largest remaining independent pharmacy benefits manager. That would help to reduce drug prices for Walmart's 1.5 million U.S. employees, Astrachan wrote.Humana recently purchased a major stake in the home health care business of Kindred Healthcare, a natural fit for Walmart's home delivery business.Still, there would be challenges. Piper Jaffray analyst Sarah James sees hurdles to staffing up clinics amid a nursing shortage that's pushing up wages. She also questioned how attractive a merger would be for Humana. Humana has an enviable Medicare position while Walmart has a smaller store base compared to CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).Still, Humana shares rose 4.4% on the stock market today, even as the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all lost about 2% or more. Meanwhile, shares of Walmart lost 3.8% and Amazon skidded 5.2%.So far Amazon's disruptive impact on health care has been all about what others are doing. Since reports last summer that Amazon might enter the retail prescription industry, the shockwaves have set in motion one deal after another. First it was CVS buying Aetna and beginning to offer same-day delivery in major markets, and next-day nationwide. Albertsons grabbed the Rite Aid (RAD) stores not bought by Walgreens. Last month, Cigna (CI) announced the purchase of Express Scripts (ESRX), the largest of the pharmacy benefit managers.Options to enter the prescription drug business have narrowed for Amazon but haven't been closed off entirely. One potential avenue would be acquiring Walgreens.In January, Amazon announced a health care venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Health care stocks tumbled amid fear that Amazon would use the same formula that slayed book sellers and department stores. The scariest part: The companies say they have no intent to earn a profit from the effort. Yet they also confessed to a lack of any coherent plan for putting still-to-be-formed cost-saving ideas to work.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Trump Tariffs: China Trade War Just Took This Surprise TurnIs FANG Stock Trade Dead As Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google Lead Tech Weakness?The Big Picture: Stocks Do Some Damage Repair, As Patience Now Becomes KeyThe Best Growth Stocks To Watch And BuyHere's What You Need To Know About Spotify's IPO, Due Tuesday

1343,CVS,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has announced that it will acquire Aspire Health, a non-hospice, community-based palliative care provider. The agreement is aimed at providing unique and innovative medical care in the community outside hospitals. Financial terms of the transaction have not yet been disclosed. The acquisition, pending standard closing conditions and customary approvals, is expected to wrap up in the third quarter of 2018.The company anticipates the buyout to be neutral to 2018’s earnings but accretive to 2019’s bottom line.Buyout BenefitsFounded in 2013, Aspire provides services under contracts with above 20 health plans to patients across 25 states. The company identifies patients suffering serious illnesses and helps them fight fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, appetite loss and depression through supreme medical care.Anthem already owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and purchasing Aspire would help it enhance its medical care business and provide better services along with its other clinical care assets such as CareMore Health and AIM.

1344,CVS,"Strong operating performance of health insurers for the past many years continued in the first quarter of 2018. Higher medical enrollment, surging revenues, medical cost management and an increasing share of revenues from complementary services helped results. Most of the major players raised their earnings guidance for 2018, reflecting solid operating environment down the road. Moreover, a strong U.S. economy has held the health insurance industry in good stead. A record-low unemployment rate and gradual wage increase bode well for the space. High employment and wage growth fuel demand for health insurance and various other health-related services provided by these insurers. The overall bullishness reinforces our sentiment that the growth cadence for the sector should continue. Despite being tied by a strict regulatory regime and a fast-changing industry backdrop, insurers have time and again emerged as winners. To put it into perspective, revenues and earnings of almost all dominant health insurers have shown a secular rise since 2010, when a sweeping and historical health care reform was put into effect by ex-president Obama.Ever since the enactment of the healthcare reform act, numerous changes have gone into effect, which have altered the traditional operating model of the health insurers. The ensuing changes were taken sportingly by health insurers, which then adapted themselves to the changed industry dynamics. A shift in business mix from commercial to government, the way care is delivered from fee for service to value for care, greater emphasis on medical cost management, growing consumerism and technical innovations have been the game changers. Rapid evolution is, however, continuing in the industry. Given the need of the hour, players in the industry are taking concerted efforts to transform themselves into comprehensive health care providers from their earlier role of being traditional payers. The same is being effectuated by a cross-sector collaboration wherein health insurers are foraying into another realm of the health care sector such as pharmacy benefit management, ambulatory care and physician services. Some of the deals that are underway in this vein are the merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) take over od Express Script Holding Co. (ESRX  -  Free Report) as well as the UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) acquisition of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). All said, the industry has remained an outperformer having generated returns higher than the S&P 500 index in each year since 2012. In the past five years, the health insurance industry has returned a whopping 257% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 91%. Is Further Upside Potential Left? While the industry has outperformed the broader market, valuations remain at the same level as that of the industry.The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 16.95 which is near 17 for the S&P 500 index as a whole. Over the last five years, the industry has traded in a range of 10.6 to 20.1, with a median of 15.3. We therefore go a bit further and look at the PEG ratio which bakes in the growth rate of the industry. The industry’s PEG ratio is 1.3, which compares favorably with the industry’s PEG ratio of 1.8. This shows that the industry is undervalued and has room for upside. Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, health insurers are broadly grouped in the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). We rank 256 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We club our industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.) Stocks Worth Adding Though past performance does not guarantee future returns, strong industry fundamentals keep our confidence undeterred.

1345,CVS,"Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) are down 16.5% over the last year based mostly on Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears. There is no doubt that online selling and delivery have altered the retail world, but does that mean Walgreens can no longer compete? Let’s dive into some of WBA’s fundamentals to see what to do with the stock.Amazon ThreatAmazon is set to acquire online and delivery pharmacy startup PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack’s co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The late June announcement sent shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens tumbling. But the question is, how quickly can Amazon infiltrate the industry with a pharmacy firm that boasted just tens of thousands of customers? Walgreens alone claims 13,200 stores in 11 countries, with whole distribution centers delivering to more than 230,000 pharmacies—as of August 2017.Amazon does already sell its own private-brand, over-the-counter drugs, called Basic Care, selling 65 drugs at costs that were roughly 20% less than Walgreens and CVS. Yet, Amazon is far from overtaking the approximately $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry.Investors should also note that fears the e-commerce giant would destroy the grocery industry have been largely overblown to this point as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have adapted to the times and pushed out their own online portals, delivery options, and meal-kits. The pharmaceutical and drug industry is much different than the grocery business, for an array of reasons, but Walgreens and others are just as capable of fighting back against Amazon’s pharmaceutical invasion.In fact, Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said on a conference call that his company is “not particularly worried” about Amazon’s PillPack acquisition. “The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages,” he continued. “I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Recent NewsWalgreens reported strong fiscal third-quarter results on June 28, topping Wall Street estimates and posting solid year-over-year gains. The company is also upbeat about its purchase of 1,932 Rite Aid stores.Furthermore, Walgreens is ramping up its delivery, and currently offers an array of shipping and delivery options. Meanwhile, just last week, it announced that its 40% acquisition of a leading retail Chinese pharmacy chain, Sinopharm Holding GuoDa Drugstores Co, was approved—which could prove to be a great investment. And the company recently introduced a new $10 billion share repurchase program that helps indicate its focus on driving long-term stockholder value, and that its stock price looks pretty cheap at the moment.Price Movement & ValuationShares of WBA are up 88% over the last 10 years, which falls below the S&P 500’s 128% climb. And over the last three years, Walgreens has seen its stock price tumble 31%, with a 14% decline in the last three months alone. With that said, shares of WBA sit roughly $20 below their 52-week high of $83.89. This means Walgreens stock is relatively inexpensive at face value.Diving a little deeper, investors will note that Walgreens presents rather strong value at the moment. WBA is currently trading at 9.9X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which marks a substantial discount compared to its industry’s 16.2X average. Furthermore, Walgreens stock has traded as high as 23.3X over the last year, with a one-year median of 15.8X. Walgreens stock is also trading almost directly in line with its year-long low, which is its lowest earnings multiple over the last five years. Therefore investors should be able to say with some confidence that WBA appears rather cheap at its current level. Outlook Walgreens is also expected to continue to experience strong top and bottom line growth. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for its quarterly revenues to climb by over 11% to hit $33.51 billion. The company’s top line is expected to expand by 10.8% to touch $131.02 billion for its current fiscal year.Moving onto the other end of the income statement, Walgreens is projected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings pop by 10.7% to reach $1.45 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by 17% to reach $5.97.Bottom LineWalgreens is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system. With all that said, WBA looks like it might be worth considering at the moment based on its outstanding valuation picture and growth outlook.Lastly, investors should expect Walgreens to adapt in order to better compete going forward. And let’s not forget the company is a dividend payer, with a yield of 2.8%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1346,CVS,"Search for safe havens has intensified ever since the trade hostility between the United States and China commenced. However, its high time that you bury the trade related fears and rejig your portfolio, as second-quarter earnings season comes knocking. The reporting period is undoubtedly considered the ideal time to rebalance one’s bucket list, and with analysts looking quite optimistic about the season one must not miss the opportunity.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the S&P 500 index is expected to rise 19% in second-quarter 2018, with 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors likely to register double-digit earnings growth. Total revenues are projected to improve 8.2%.Retail-Wholesale, which typically performs well in a maturing economic cycle, is among the sectors that are likely to steal the show this season. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness bottom-line growth of 18.3%, while top-line is anticipated to increase 7.9%. The underlying economic strength backed by robust job market, latest tax reform and pro-business policies are likely to act as catalysts for the sector.Needless to say, aforementioned factors play a vital role in lifting consumer confidence that spells boon for retailers. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy. Per industry experts, the second-quarter GDP rate likely to come ahead of 4%. We note that consumer spending increased $27.8 billion or 0.2%, while personal income surged $60 billion or 0.4% in May.Without an iota of doubt, retailers are the end gainers. Notably, the sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past three months outpacing the S&P 500’s growth of approximately 5%. So, picking stocks that are likely to trump estimates can fetch handsome returns. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on an earnings beat.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonAll said, we used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this reporting cycle.

1348,CVS,"Putting an end to speculations, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has finally stepped into the high-potential pharmaceutical industry. In line with this, the online retail behemoth recently announced a definitive acquisition agreement with PillPack. Although the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps, a few market experts estimate the value of the transaction at $1 billion.This news was heavily cheered by investors, sending Amazon’s share price 2.5% higher on the day of the announcement.Does Amazon’s Entry Spell Doom for Pharmacies?Although Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy business was well speculated, it still came as a shocker for industry bigwigs. Let’s take a closer look at the reactions of some of the behemoths.Amazon.com, Inc. Price  Amazon.com, Inc. Price | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBeginning with, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), which has been basking in the glory of being added as the youngest member to the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index, saw a 9.9% decline in stock price on the day of the buyout announcement. The company also saw a rating downgrade by a number of analysts.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteThe stocks of other big retailers like Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) also slipped around 11.1% and 6.1% on the same day.CVS Health Corporation Price  CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer reports, three of these bigwigs collectively lost about $12.8 billion in market value on the day.Rite Aid Corporation Price  Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteMajor drug distributors like Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) also panicked, with stocks falling a respective 4.8%, 4.1% and 6.1%.How Rational is the Deal for Amazon?In an era where brick and mortar set ups are being challenged by online sellers, though Amazon’s entry into the prescription drug industry is welcome news for consumers, it is also fraught with challenges.Coming back to the buyout, PillPack is an online pharmacy that pre-sorts medications into different doses and handles both refills and renewals. It also holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states and has URAC and VIPPS accreditation. It is an in-network pharmacy with most pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) along with major Medicare Part D plans.Per an article on STAT, the integration of PillPack will help Amazon become a major player in the $370-billion drug business.Some analysts believe that with PillPack, which is working with Medicare plans, Amazon will be able to see an increase in its Amazon Prime membership of the rapidly-growing age group of 65 and above. There are high chances that 100 million Prime subscribers with Amazon will choose the company for their prescription drug needs.However, the deal has come with its own set of challenges. Per an article published on PYMNTS.com, PillPack sources products from AmerisourceBergen and Walgreens Boots. Further, per the same article,  there were rumors in the recent past about Walgreens Boots’ plans to buy AmerisourceBergen, which might pit Walgreens Boots against Amazon in the space.PillPack’s in-network membership with Express Scripts is also subject to renewal at the end of July. It is being speculated that if Amazon appears to be a formidable threat to the PBMs they might start refraining from renewing the in-network memberships in future (per an article published on PYMNTS.com). With regard to this, Amazon had to let go of its 40% stake in Drugstore.com as PBMs denied to include Drugstore.com in their networks. This  eventually resulted in Drugstore.com exiting the prescription business (per an article published on AXIOS).How Bad is the News for Pharmaceutical Giants? ""You've got to keep reinventing. You'll have new competitors. You'll have new customers all around you.""Nothing could more aptly sum up this situation than this remark by Ginni Rometty, IBM CEO. The incumbent players in the drugstore industry don’t seem to be in a mood to give up and lose their turf. To counter competition, CVS Health, Walgreens Boots and others have started to add more digital and customer-friendly programs. These companies have incorporated mail order pharmacy models to their stores with same day/one day to two days delivery programs.Further, CVS Health’s deal with United States’ third-largest health insurance company, Aetna, will fortify its position in the industry.In a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens Boots has tied up with Express Scripts and has announced plans to expand existing group purchasing efforts. Per reports, Walgreens Boots is also collaborating with a number of healthcare businesses, including health insurers like Humana and UnitedHealth Group.The company is also partnering with lab testing provider Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings to expand the range of health services at its stores.Further, some analysts believe those preferring cash payments are expected to opt more for Amazon’s pharmacy services. The percentage of this population is quite nominal. Moreover, patients with the need for immediate drugs will approach stores over waiting for online delivery.Considering these factors, major analysts believe there is enough scope left for these behemoths to maintain a competitive edge in the space.Summing UpAmazon’s entry has definitely created an upheaval in the prescription drug industry with major players struggling to keep afloat. However, in business, bankable human resource and strong financial position matter the most. And Amazon has an adequate amount of of both. So, the following quote from Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, Reuters suitably sums up the current scenario — “Amazon’s acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1349,CVS,"The much followed and widely speculated entry by Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) into pharmacy business has now been put to rest with the company’s announcing that it will purchase PillPack, an online pharmacy delivery company.Eying an Attractive MarketThe purchase of PillPack for $1 billion would provide Amazon instant access to the U.S. drug business worth nearly $370 billion. Close on the heels of the news, shares of pharmacy companies CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) nosedived on concerns that the entry of the giant company Amazon might take away market share from them. Other companies UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Humana Inc. having Pharmacy Rx business and would be affected by Amazon’s presence and lose value.Amazon already sells medical supplies and equipment like blood pressure monitors, braces, hearing aids, and even walkers and wheelchairs in the United States. Entering the pharmacy industry therefore was like the next best step to expand in the healthcare space.Amazon’s entry into drug distribution would definitely be a game changer but the immediate implications will be more limited, given that the healthcare space is highly complex and regulated.The U.S. drug industry is opaque and divided into specific tranches such as drugmakers that make drugs, PBMs that negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, processpharmacy benefit claims, and operate home-delivery pharmacies. Down the line are wholesalers, who physically distribute drugs to pharmacies and hospitals and at the bottom are the retail pharmacies.Complex arrangements between these different players and consolidation in the space have led them to rake in profits with the end consumers facing the fall out of the rising drug prices. Amazon, with its digital capabilities and huge logistics force, is aiming distribute drugs at a low cost.In a year's time, the Retail Drug Store industry has lost 11.8% compared with the S&P 500 market’s growth of 1.9% and a decline of 1.92% for the Medical sector.One Year Price Performance  What Next?Now, Amazon must have a pharmacy benefit manager in order to have an end-to-end solution. Thus the company might opt for a PBM alliance or acquisition. Any news to this tune from the company should not be surprising. It is but sure that the company will not rest here and will make further moves in other spaces of healthcare since its CEO’s has vented his frustration over an inefficient and costly U.S. healthcare system. To this end, recently, Amazon along with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan formed a healthcare venture to provide health insurance for their employees which together is more than a  a million. Late last month, the venture got its CEO Dr. Atul Gawande, implying that it is well on track to start operations.The ThreatAmazon is known for becoming a formidable figure by garnering huge market share of any industry it lays its hands with innovative market practices and skilled leadership. So far, it has carved a niche in businesses like books, retail, supermarkets, consumer electronics and cloud computing among others.So, Amazon’s pharmacy plans surfaced last year, the existing players in the space buckled up. In a retaliatory measure, CVS went on to acquire Aetna Inc. and Express Scripts sought partnership with Cigna. Also recently Walgreens entered into agreement with Humana to set up primary care clinics which would expand its pharmacy services and expertise.While Amazon is unlikely to give traditional healthcare companies a run for their money in the short term, they definitely will have to revamp business strategies to make use of technology, data and analytics to offer better products and customer-friendly services. The whole drill should modernize the healthcare system and give investors more reasons to keep a close tab on it.Close on the heels of Amazon’s news, the FDA chief said that disruptive competition is good thing any change that makes much-needed products more accessible to consumers and lowers cost is welcome.Ana Gupte, senior health care services analyst at Leerink Partners, advised clients to keep in mind that Amazon's push into the pharmaceutical space won't happen over night and that this is going to take a long time. But the threat that Amazon's share will grow over time looms large.We believe that it will be like walking a tight rope for the incumbent players.Zacks RankAmong the companies mentioned above, Aetna Inc. (AET) Express Scripts, CVS Health and Amazon each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Additionally, the sportswear giant’s North American sales popped 3% to hit $3.88 billion.Next, the hosts talked about music streaming giant Spotify, and what it’s doing to try and find new revenue streams.

1351,CVS,"Now a literal household name, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has experienced meteoric growth since its May 1997 IPO, since which its stock price has soared an astounding 111,260%. This represents about hundred times more growth than any of its industry competitors over that same time frame. This year alone, Amazon is up nearly 43% compared to an industry average of 9.2%.With this much growth already baked into its stock price, many investors may feel that Amazon stock is too expensive and that they have missed their chance to cash in. Is this truly the case? Let’s take a look.An Ever-Expanding Sphere of InfluenceOur team reported on Thursday that shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) plummeted on news that Amazon would purchase online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move is part of the firm’s push into the $400 billion industry. While specific details have not yet been released, the idea is that the firm would sell prescription medicines online.This isn’t Amazon’s first foray into healthcare. The company announced in January that it, alongside Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), would begin “partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs.” The partnership will see the formation of an independent company, at which a top-level executive from each respective firm will take lead.Amazon also announced Delivery Service Partners on Thursday, a new program that is designed to let local entrepreneurs manage and operate delivery networks with up to 40 vans within their respective regions. The move puts firms like UPS (UPS  -  Free Report) and FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) directly in their crosshairs. It said that the move would involve “hundreds” of small businesses and ultimately result in the hiring of “tens of thousands” of delivery drivers across the country.This week, Amazon began rolling out special deals for its Prime members to Whole Foods, which it acquired in August of last year. According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney, this could double Whole Foods’ customer base. Amazon is also expanding Go, its cashier-free convenience store initiative which made its public debut in January of last year.Amazon’s sphere of influence is only continuing to expand. It is difficult to fathom that the same firm which at one point only sold books, now has a presence in retail, logistics, media production, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, just to name a few of its numerous ventures. What makes the company interesting is the fact that it continues to invest and expand into new territory, just as its recent news announcements have shown us.By the NumbersAmazon had a stellar earnings report in April, delivering first-quarter 2018 earnings of $3.27 per share, crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.05 (168%) and representing 121% year-over-year growth. The company also reported $51.04 billion in revenue, beating our Consensus Estimate by almost a billion dollars and representing 43% in year-over-year growth.Product sales, which account for 61.9% of Amazon’s overall sales, increased 33.2% year-over-year to $31.61 billion, while service sales (which account for the other 38.1%) rose 62.2% year-over-year to $19.44 billion. This was driven largely by Amazon’s physical store presence through Whole Foods and Amazon Go. Physical store sales accounted for $7.46 billion in revenue compared to our $4.35 billion Consensus Estimate.The strong earnings report was also guided in part by strong performance in Amazon’s Web Services division (AWS), which saw revenues climb 48.6% year-over-year to $5.44 billion. The change was primarily driven by an expanding customer base, which included the addition of enterprise customers such as LG Electronics and Shutterfly (SFLY  -  Free Report). AWS now accounts for ~11% of Amazon’s total revenue and ~73% of its operating income, and holds a third of the global cloud computing services market.Investors should take note of Amazon’s 12-Month Forward P/E ratio of 101x, which is notably lower than its F1 2018 ratio of 130.4x. The ratio shifted dramatically in April, as analysts significantly raised their estimates on the back of the firm’s extremely strong earnings report.Investors may also notice that the aforementioned 12-Month Forward P/E of 101x still appears to hold a significant premium to the industry average of 23.7x. The reason why this is the case however, is because Amazon sacrifices profits in the short-term to fund its many different initiatives. This reduces earnings and thus inflates the ratio. This aggressive investment strategy is what has allowed Amazon to grow in such an explosive fashion. One good example is AWS, which was not immediately profitable as the firm created its infrastructure, but now represents one of its most lucrative divisions.The effects of Amazon’s investment strategy become clear when we look at the last five years of Amazon’s earnings estimate history, represented by the green line:Note that although earnings estimates for F1 2018 sat at $8.69 per share before April’s report, they currently sit at $12.74 per share. That Amazon’s estimates have continuously increased is a testament to analyst confidence that its various initiatives have not only already brought in results but will continue to do so.Here is another point that investors may find interesting:Although Amazon is burning through cash to fuel their operations, it has been increasing its margins consistently for the last six years. This is important because it tells us that Amazon is becoming more efficient at converting sales into actual profit. Once Amazon’s newer investments turn profitable, it will mean that Amazon can potentially continue to pull off earnings surprises as significant as last quarter’s 168% beat.OutlookAlthough investors may feel hesitant about Amazon’s current stock price, various signs point to it being warranted rather than overhyped. With a perpetually growing product portfolio, aggressive operations investment, and increasing margins, Amazon is positioning itself to dominate multiple industries at once for years to come.While nothing is certain, investors should remain aware of the possibility that should they attempt to wait for a better entry point to invest, it may never come. Regardless of if investors choose to purchase Amazon stock, they should continue to monitor its performance. As its various divisions continue to grow, an increasing number of firms will see their business models threatened.Amazon currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1352,CVS,"Shares of pharmacy giants CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) all plummeted on Thursday morning after Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced its purchase of online pharmacy delivery startup PillPack. The move clearly has some investors worried that Amazon’s push into the pharmaceutical industry will hurt the current powers. So let’s take a look at more of the details to find out what’s really going on.PillPackAmazon is reportedly set to acquire PillPack for $1 billion in cash, in a deal that is expected to close in the second half of 2018. PillPack launched in 2013 and ships pre-sorted medications by the dose to patients on a monthly basis. The company, which is a full-service pharmacy, works mostly with customers who take multiple daily prescriptions and coordinates refills and renewals with doctors and customers.The Manchester, New Hampshire-based pharmacy delivery startup said that it ships everywhere in the U.S. except Hawaii. PillPack has raised $118 million in venture capital funding, and its co-founder and CEO TJ Parker said last fall that the company had tens of thousands of customers and was set for more than $100 million in annual revenue.The deal should be hugely beneficial for Jeff Bezos’ behemoth, which now enters the quickly growing, $400 billion U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The news saw shares of CVS sink 9.36% through early morning trading, with Rite Aid down 11.17% and Walgreens down 8.59%.Meanwhile, shares of Amazon climbed over 1.1%. But pharmaceutical industry investors shouldn’t be too worried that Amazon will simply waltz in and take over.It’s Not Over, YetAmazon’s PillPack acquisition comes roughly a year after the company shook up the grocery industry with its Whole Foods purchase. Investors worried at the time that grocery heavyweights such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) would all take a big hit, and possibly crumble underneath Amazon’s quick delivery e-commerce model. This turned out not to be the case—at least not yet (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).All four of these grocery industry powers simply revamped their business models and dove right into everything from same-day delivery and easy to use e-commerce portals, through partnerships with startups as well as in-house initiatives. Today, the grocery industry and customers are likely better off than they were before Amazon bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion because it forced them all to offer more.Sometimes lost in the narrative that Amazon will one day dominate the world, is that the e-commerce giant’s multibillion-dollar competitors, many of which have been around much longer than Amazon, can adapt—and have every reason to fight back. In fact, Walgreens executives were in the middle of a call with analysts when Amazon announced its PillPack deal. CEO Stefano Pessina said his company is “not particularly worried” about the e-commerce giant’s newest acquisition.Pessina went on to say that his drugstore chain is “not complacent.” He also said that “the pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or packages. I strongly believe that the role of the physical pharmacy will continue to be very, very important in the future.”Investors should note that Walgreens is ramping up its delivery options and adding to its in-store health-related services. Meanwhile, CVS announced just last week that it will offer its customers prescription delivery options through a new deal with the U.S. Postal Service.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1353,CVS,"When it comes to merger, the Healthcare sector steals the show. The U.S. healthcare supply chain is consolidating fast, with deals across the industry ranging from insurers, pharmacies to drug distributors. The last four years were pretty solid for global healthcare mergers.According to an analysis by Kaufman Hall, 87 hospitals were merged through the third quarter of 2017, against 102 overall in 2016. Among these, eight transactions comprised hospitals with $1 billion or more in revenues, double the big-ticket mergers in 2016.Hospitals and health systems announced 561 transactions consisting about 1,260 hospitals from 2010 to 2015, according to the American Hospital Association. Health insurers are also striving to cut deals in this field.Some noted deals planned in the recent past include UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) (the biggest U.S. health insurer) $4.9 billion deal to acquire DaVita Medical Group and CVS Health Corp.’s (CVS  -  Free Report) acquisition plans for Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) (one of the top U.S. health insurers), for about $67.5 billion in cash and stock. CVS’s acquisition of Aetna is expected to close in 2H 2018. Cigna also proposed a $67 billion acquisition of Express-Scripts.What Promotes HealthCare Industry Merger? A surge in interest has been noticed for vertical mergers. This would help companies to generate more efficiencies by consolidating supply chains and enjoy scale advantage, per State Street (read: Play the Best Sector of Summer With These ETFs & Stocks).Investors should note that the healthcare sector’s debt-to-equity levels are 30% lower than the broader S&P 500. The sector is estimated to see return-on-equity more than double to 27.2% by the end of 2019 against the 19.72% expected growth in the broad market. The factors made the sector more attractive to companies that are eyeing inorganic expansion.Other Tailwinds So, investors can definitely play the merger mania in this field. Apart from this, there are some specific factors that can favor the sector in the near term.President Trump’s announcement of the drug plans in May, which were in the best interest of pharma companies, may benefit the space. The drug plans will likely put pressure on U.S. trading partners, forcing them to pay more for medicines.Also, on May 30, the President signed the 'Right To Try' bill into law. This law will help patients suffering from terminal diseases to undergo experimental treatments and use drugs that are not yet approved by the FDA.

1354,CVS,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) is progressing well toward the completion of its pending merger with the grocer, Albertsons Companies, Inc. The progress of the deal became evident, after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) made the previously filed registration statement on Form S-4 effective.Following this, Rite Aid is now urging its shareholders to vote in favor of the merger deal. Voting, regarding the proposed transaction, will be carried out in the Special Meeting of Rite Aid shareholders, which is scheduled for Aug 9, 2018. Rite Aid’s shareholders, with record as of Jun 22, 2018, are entitled to cast votes in connection with the proposed deal.Though Rite Aid’s shares haven’t witnessed much positive momentum lately, we believe that the deal, after the completion, can begin a new chapter to its story. Shares of Rite Aid have declined nearly 6.9% on Jun 26. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 17.4% in the last three months, driven by optimism stemming from the completion of store sales to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) and the aforementioned merger developments. The company has outperformed the industry’s increase of 6.9%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The BackgroundRite Aid had agreed to merge with the largest grocer in the country, Albertsons, on Feb 18, 2018. The merger will not only help revive the distressed business of Rite Aid but also help in dispelling the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, Rite Aid’s shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash, or only its shares.For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash, or only 1.079 Albertsons shares. This will leave shareholders of Rite Aid with about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own a 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.The new company will operate about 4,900 locations, including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington D.C. It will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies’ plan to re-banner most of Albertsons’ pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores, following the completion of the transaction while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-alone pharmacies.The merger is approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar 2018, conditioned upon the receipt of approval from Rite Aid’s shareholders, and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.The drugstore industry, in general, has been witnessing increased consolidation lately. After the failed merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid, the industry has seen CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) enter a $69-billion deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018. While the CVS-Aetna deal is on track, Walgreens’ bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report) seems to have cooled off in the early stages.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1355,CVS,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) surged over 10% on Thursday to inch near their 52-week high after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results. Investors were also likely pleased to see that the grocery chain’s e-commerce initiatives started to pay off. The question is should investors think about buying grocery stocks as Amazon-based (AMZN  -  Free Report) fears seem to have been overblown.Kroger Kroger posted adjusted quarterly earnings of $0.73 per share, which came in well above our Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.63 per share and marked a nearly 26% climb from the year-ago quarter. The company’s Q1 revenues climbed over 3% to $37.53 billion, topping our estimate.The company also raised its earnings guidance, but what really stood out were Kroger’s online sales. Kroger saw its digital sales skyrocket 66%. Meanwhile, Kroger announced that it upped its investment in online British supermarket delivery company Ocado to help improve its online ordering, automated fulfillment, and home delivery capabilities. Furthermore, Kroger announced a merger with private meal kit powerhouse Home Chef in a move to compete against the likes of Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report), HelloFresh, and Plated—which supermarket chain Albertsons bought last year. Kroger also expanded its partnership with grocery delivery startup powerhouse Instacart, which works with companies from CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) to Aldi.Kroger stock is currently a Zacks Ranks #3 (Hold), and might not experience Thursday’s gains for a while now. With that said, the rest of the grocery industry has also made some significant changes in order to compete in the age of online shopping and delivery.Industry OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online. FMI and Nielsen also estimated that people will spend $100 billion a year in this budding industry. Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart in March announced its plan to expand its online grocery delivery option to more than 100 metro areas by the end of the year, up from just six. The big-box giant also offers an order online and curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,200 stores, with the company expected to add the service at 1,000 more locations by end of the year.Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S. Looking ahead, the company is projected to see it quarterly earnings climb by 12%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s revenues are expected to pop 1.8% to $125.53 billion. WMT is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that rests well below its 52-week high.Costco (COST  -  Free Report)Shares of Costco hit a new all-time high of $211.11 per share yesterday on the back of Kroger’s strong quarter. The big-box giant, like its competitors, has also made a new-age push that includes its launch of CostcoGrocery last fall, which offers two-day delivery for non-perishable food and household supplies nationwide. The company also expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with Instacart.The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%. Looking ahead, Costco’s full-year earnings are projected to surge nearly 18%, while its full-year revenues are expected to reach $139.98 billion, representing an 8.5% jump. COST is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but sports an overall “A” VGM score based on its strong Value, Growth, and Moment grades.Target (TGT  -  Free Report)Target introduced its online ordering and curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” in more than 250 stores last quarter and expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, which allows customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery.  The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period. Target also introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations, which was made possible by its $550 million December 2017 purchase of grocery delivery startup Shipt.Target is expected to see its quarterly earnings climb by 13%, while its revenues are projected to reach $17.3 billion, which would mark 5.3% growth. TGT stock currently sits near its 52-week high and is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports a “B” grade for Growth and Value in our Style Scores system.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1356,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) has achieved a historic feat yesterday on emerging as the youngest participant on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) or DJIA. This is a momentous exploit not just because this goliath stock has entered the world’s most coveted index but more so for dramatically replacing Dow’s oldest member, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report). With this success, Walgreens stalled GE’s uninterrupted run on the exchange for 110 long years.The change will be effective Jun 26 market opening.Let’s delve deeper into the significance of the decision for Dow investors.GE Booted Off: How Far is This Logical?The S&P Dow Jones indices report says that “General Electric was an original member of the DJIA in 1896 and a member continuously since 1907”. However, per the index, this decision was prompted by the GE stock’s persistent trading at a low price of late, which affected the entire index’s price performance in turn. Going by the report, “the DJIA is a price-weighted index and the range of prices among its 30 constitutes matter. The low price of GE shares means the company has a weight in the index of less than one-half of one percentage point.”Overall, GE’s market capitalization rose to $594 billion in 2000 and has shrunk unbelievably over the years to $111.87 billion at present.Over the past year, shares of GE have nose-dived by more than 50%, a significant plunge justifying the above logic. If we compare the stock with its broader industry, the stock has plummeted 52.1% compared with the industry’s 16.7% decline.For the same time frame, DJIA has rallied 16.9% and another sought-after index, S&P 500, remained slightly below at 13.7% growth. Both indices however, remained far above the General Electric’s tally. Walgreens’ DJIA Foray: Does it Make Sense?While talking about the decision to incorporate Walgreens on the DJIA index, the S&P Dow Jones indices report informed that Walgreens will contribute more meaningfully to the index as its share price is higher than GE’s. The stock will also help the index represent the U.S. market and economy in a better way.The investment world has already been dissected into two with respect to this impactful decision. Per David Blitzer, chairman of the S&P’s index committee, industrial companies like GE no longer hold prominence in the American economy, whereas healthcare, banks, tech and consumer companies race as front runners now.From Walgreens’ point of view, this world’s first pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise has never has been shoved away from the limelight, courtesy of its consistent flow of strategic developments. The company has been formed through the combination of legacy Walgreens and Alliance Boots. The merger brought together a couple of companies with compelling portfolios and iconic brands, complementary geographies, shared values and trusted health care services via pharmaceutical wholesaling and community pharmacy care.Recently, in a bid to ensure availability of specialty brand drugs, Walgreens has tied up with Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) and announced plans to expand their existing group purchasing efforts. Also, Walgreens’ Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational as well as financial benefits.Following the news, shares of Walgreens gained 5.24% to $68 at yesterday’s close.The Opposite ViewOn the flip side, some are questioning the practicality of substitution as CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a bigger contender of Walgreens in the similar field in terms of market cap, volume and prescription revenues.According to the analysts, Walgreens incurred immense debt to maintain its expansion through acquisition strategy.The company’s long-term debt shot up to $12.5 billion as of February 2018 from $3.7 billion in August 2013 (per a Wall Street Journal report).Moreover, while CVS Health is currently in the process to complete its $69-billion Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal, its decision to buy the health insurerhas been taken quite positively by the investment world. Economists are looking forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put brakes on America’s mounting health-care costs. In spite of this huge prospect, CVS Health not present in the list of 30 Dow members is putting the investors in sort of dilemma. Walgreens’ stock performance too is currently not looking much convincing. Over the past year, shares of Walgreens have lost 17.9%, outperforming the DJIA and S&P 500 index. The broader industry has witnessed a 10.7% decline. Per a Bloomberg report, “On paper, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. is an underwhelming choice for inclusion in the world’s most famous stock index.”How Significant the ‘Delete’ & ‘Replacement’ Will Be?According to many investment experts, the General Electric-Walgreens case is more of a publicity stance for Dow, gradually losing its sheen since the economic recession of the 1990s. Going by a Reuters’ article, “GE is currently the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value, and it sports the index’s lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.”A Lipper data also concluded that while just $20 billion is invested in exchange traded funds attached to the Dow, ETFs tracking the S&P 500 index, have assets of around $380 billion. Undoubtedly, next week, GE’s exit and Walgreens’ entry may not have any relevant effect on the performance of the index.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1357,CVS,"Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has decided to collaborate with Walgreens for providing better primary and other services to senior citizens via primary care clinics. Notably, Walgreens is a provider of trusted care, included in the Retail Pharmacy USA Division of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report). This alliance is part of the ongoing and shared commitment of both companies to the health and well-being of the Kansas City community.The partnership forged between Humana, a leading health and well-being company and Walgreens, the provider of trusted pharmacy services and care would essentially create a senior-focused neighborhood approach to health, which would include primary care, pharmacy, in-person health plan support and additional services for Medicare beneficiaries. The companies are also interested in expanding this collaboration into other markets in the near future.Partners in Primary Care, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Humana, would operate senior-focused primary care clinics (on a pilot basis) in two Walgreens stores in the Kansas City, Missouri area. Located most conveniently, the clinics are expected to open doors this fall with a spacious area of around 2,500 square feet and would complement Walgreens pharmacy services along with the four Partners in Primary Care centers, inaugurated last year in Kansas City.The clinics cater to aged people participating in a few Medicare plans. Partners in Primary Care focus on offering care services beyond addressing just the acute and immediate health issues. Additionally, the unit caters to developing long-term relationships with patients suffering chronic conditions.Humana currently provides health-related programming and resources to its more than 65,000 Medicare Advantage and Medicare stand-alone Part D Prescription Drug plan members in the region. While Walgreens supports more than 75,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Kansas City community through above 50 neighborhood pharmacies and other points of care.Humana expects its initiative with Walgreens to deliver a way simpler and better experience for people, which would in turn encourage them to take care of their health more seriously while being closely in touch with the doctors. This senior-focused care by the company is a continuation of its strategy to revolve around integrating care via clinical programs intersecting health with lifestyle. The humanitarian service also supports Humana’s multi-faceted approach to healthcare in general.The win-win program has aided Walgreens to expand its pharmacy services and expertise plus drive the digital tools and other programs, aimed at helping the grey populace in the community. It is one of Walgreens’ efforts to make cost-effective healthcare accessible to patients, providing them with a value-for-money experience.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 20.86% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.87%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This deal charts out the obvious course of action for Walgreens as it braces itself well for handling the pressing competition from the likely entry of Amazon in the pharmacy business. Also, CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) is on track to acquire Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report), which should expand the combined entity’s scale and size in the industry.These health-oriented pacts point to the blurring of the boundaries between two subsectors of the healthcare industry such as, the pharmacies and drug stores and health insurers. These alliances are a way forward for the companies, striving to emerge as comprehensive healthcare players and cost controllers. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1358,CVS,"Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of Aspire Health, a non-hospice, community-based palliative care provider. The deal is aimed at providing unique and innovative medical care to the community outside hospitals.The company anticipates the buyout to be neutral to current-year earnings but accretive to the bottom line in 2019.Aspire Health provides services under contracts with above 20 health plans to patients across 25 U.S. states. The company identifies patients suffering serious illnesses and helps them fight fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, appetite loss and depression through supreme medical care.Anthem already owns Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states and purchasing Aspire Health would enable it to enhance its medical care business, providing better services along with other clinical care assets, namely CareMore Health and AIM Specialty Health. Through this transaction, Anthem plans to introduce advanced illness programs to deliver optimum patient satisfaction via home-based care, reducing medical costs in the process.Palliative care is fast gaining ground as the U.S. healthcare system shifts to value based care from a volume based one. The consolidation should aid Anthem to dispense treatment affordable costs to patients with complex medical conditions. Thus this move might effectively lower overall medical costs, boosting margin expansion in the process.The Aspire Health deal is projected to be a kind of vertical integration for Anthem and will craft it into a more wholesome and integrated healthcare service provider.Vertical tie-ups are anyways in vogue in the healthcare industry with two mega deals comprising Express Scripts Holding Company by Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) being already underway. Both these transactions are the combination of a health insurer with a pharmacy benefit manager.Year to date, the stock has gained 8.5% compared with the industry’s rally of 13.8%. Anthem carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1359,CVS,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) might have forever changed the grocery industry exactly one year ago when the e-commerce giant bought Whole Foods for roughly $14 billion on June 16, 2017. Today, grocery delivery is commonplace across the entire industry.OverviewNielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) and the Food Marketing Institute released their second-ever ""Digitally Engaged Food Shopper"" study earlier this year, which stated that within the next five to seven years 70% of consumers will do at least some grocery shopping online. Furthermore, FMI and Nielsen estimated that people will spend $100 billion year in this budding industry.Amazon’s e-commerce dominance sparked this growth and forced Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), and many other grocery players to dive headfirst into e-commerce, delivery, and curbside pick-up.Before we jump into what the individual companies are doing on these vital fronts, let’s take a quick look at their price performances since Amazon bought Whole Foods last year.  Investors will note that Target stock has outperformed some of its peers over the last year, by a pretty wide margin. With that said, Amazon stock has soared nearly 78%, but it operates a much bigger and more diversified business than these grocery and big-box retailers. WalmartIn March, Walmart announced its plan to expand its online grocery delivery option to more than100 metro areas by the end of the year. At the time, the service was only available in six markets.The big-box giant also offers an order online, curbside pickup up service called “Grocery Hero” at 1,000 stores, with the company expected to add that service at 1,000 more locations by end of 2017. Investors should note that Walmart’s first-quarter e-commerce sales surged by 33% in the U.S.TargetTarget also introduced its online ordering, curbside pickup service called “Drive-Up” at more than 250 stores last quarter. The company also expanded its “Restock” program nationwide, allowing customers throughout the U.S. to shop from thousands of popular items for next day delivery.  The Minneapolis-based retailer saw its digital sales surge 28% in Q1, on top of a 21% climb in the year-ago period. Target also introduced same-day delivery at over 700 locations, which was made possible by its $550 million December 2017 purchase of grocery delivery startup Shipt.CostcoBig-box powerhouse Costco (COST  -  Free Report) launched CostcoGrocery last fall. The service offers two-day delivery for non-perishable food and household supplies to Costco customers nationwide. Meanwhile, the company expanded its same-day delivery service to “most metropolitan” areas through an updated partnership with grocery delivery startup giant Instacart.The company’s most recent quarterly financial results helped demonstrate how well Costco’s online ordering and delivery business has performed. The wholesale retailer’s quarterly revenues popped by 12% to $32.36 billion, with e-commerce comp sales up 36.8%.KrogerGrocery chain Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) recently started its “Restock Kroger” initiative, aimed to accelerate its digital and e-commerce offerings. The company currently offers online ordering and curbside pickup through its ClickList service.Like Costco and many others, including CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), Aldi, and Jewel-Osco, Kroger works with Instacart for same-day delivery. It’s unclear exactly how effective Kroger’s new e-commerce and delivery initiatives have been, but its upcoming first quarter might give investors a better idea. The company is expected to report its Q1 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, June 21 (also read: Upcoming Earnings to Watch: FDX, KR, DRI).Bottom LineAmazon changed the retail grocery business forever before it even bought Whole Foods. Today, consumers have online delivery and curbside pickup options at nearly every major U.S. chain, with most of the company’s rapidly expanding their same-day delivery offerings on their own or through partnerships.Going forward, don’t be surprised if a company like Costco, which is projected to pull in nearly $140 billion this year, buys grocery delivery superstar Instacart before the company decides to go public. There is no clear winner at the moment, aside from customers around the U.S. who have exponentially more online and grocery delivery options than they did one year ago.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1360,CVS,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, CVS Health has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of nearly 11.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.5. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, CVS Health’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. In fact, the current level stands close to the lows for the stock, indicating that it could be a solid entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 31.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers. We should also point out that CVS Health has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 9.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for CVS Health stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, CVS Health has a P/S ratio of about 0.4. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years. If anything, CVS is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, CVS Health currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes CVS Health a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though CVS Health might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C. This gives CVS a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Notably, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging. The current quarter has seen 13 estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one downward revision, while the full year estimate has seen 15 upward and one downward revision in the same time period.This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 9.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has jumped 9.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus  CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus | CVS Health Corporation QuoteHowever, this somewhat bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock, as we have just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which indicates expectations of in-line performance in the near term. Nonetheless, the positive analyst sentiment hints at favorable ongoing prospects.Bottom LineCVS Health is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Despite having a Zacks Rank #3, the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the Top 29% out of more than 250 Zacks industries, which indicates that broader factors are favorable for the company.So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1361,CVS,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

1362,CVS,"A federal judge has approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85 billion merger with Time Warner , handing the telecom giant a massive victory in what has been the most intense antitrust case in decades.Shares of AT&T sunk in after-hours trading shortly after the news, while Time Warner stock added as much as 4.5%. The judge’s decision will apparently allow AT&T to buy Time Warner without any significant conditions.Analysts have said that such a decision might limit the government’s power to restrict mergers in the future, with many pointing to potential tie-ups between CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) and Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), or Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), as deals that could be affected by this precedent.Judge Richard Leon filed the decision, which will ignite AT&T’s content ambitions and put the company in a better position to battle tech-media hybrids like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Government prosecutors attempted to argue that a combination of AT&T’s distribution network—its cellular and wired broadband infrastructure—and Time Warner’s original content—HBO, Warner Bros., and Turner Broadcasting—would create an anticompetitive environment in today’s evolving communications and media sector.Now, AT&T will leverage those new properties to create a new telecom-media behemoth.Initial investor reaction likely reflects hesitation toward the costs associated with the deal, but it is hard to think that the merger does not present exciting potential for AT&T.Want more market analysis from this author?

1363,CVS,"On Jun 8, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). While increasing demand for PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and specialty pharmacy was a major growth driver for the stock, its dull retail performance over the last few quarters seems to have disappointed investors. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past three months. The stock has lost 4.3% compared with the 6.3% decrease of the broader industry.CVS Health ended the first quarter of 2018 on a mixed note. While earnings were ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues lagged the same. However, the  top line’s year-over-year growth was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the specialty services. A strong 2019 PBM selling season was another favorable factor.  Notably, the company is already more than halfway through its 2019 renewals. The retention rate is currently in line with the rates it has witnessed over the last few years.Despite a tough pricing competition, CVS Health currently gains momentum through high levels of service and execution, competitive pricing and a unique integrated model, which allows the company to provide differentiated products and services generating savings, better health outcomes as well as convenience.Moreover, solid year-over-year Retail/LTC comparisons were encouraging. The company is presently moving toward achieving the completion of the Aetna deal. Per CVS Health, this landmark acquisition of the U.S. health insurance giant might introduce a vast change on the Healthcare landscape in the United States. Investors are hopeful about CVS Health’s earning of $750 million drawn from the near-term synergies via the Aetna transaction post its closure.Meanwhile, the company’s commencement of this momentous $69-billion healthcare consolidation is keeping all analysts upbeat. On its successful culmination, CVS Health expects to reap $750 million with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the close of the buyout.On the flip side, the company’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern as it faces some stiff rivalry in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments in the portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining a major market share. This apart, CVS Health delivered some sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. Per the company, this decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and Amedisys, Inc. (AMED  -  Free Report). While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Amedisys carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intuitive Surgical has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 12.1%.Illumina expects long-term earnings growth of 20%.Amedisys has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 17.5%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1364,CVS,"Express Scripts’ (ESRX  -  Free Report) partially-owned subsidiary Inside Rx recently announced an agreement with the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. (VFW). The aim is to help VFW’s 1.3 million members and their families benefit from the free Inside Rx card, part of the Inside Rx prescription savings program.This will provide Express Scripts’ veteran customers a wider range of choices at affordable prices.Inside Rx Platform at a GlanceInside Rx is a prescription savings program powered by Express Scripts — the nation's leading independent pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). Notably, the platform recently garnered $100 million in medication savings for Americans who are uninsured or pay out-of-pocket for prescriptions.Inside RX recently made an additional 22 branded medications within the means for people who currently pay the full list price for prescriptions.Veteran Customers in FocusThe Inside Rx card offers more than 125 branded medications allowing average savings of 40% for veterans who are uninsured or underinsured. The card can be used at more than 40,000 pharmacies in the United States.Inside Rx card can be easily downloaded, providing customers with details like the list of participating pharmacies, catalog of medicines and terms of usage. The patients only need to present the discount card at participating pharmacies, including national chains such as CVS Healthcare (CVS  -  Free Report), the Kroger Family of Pharmacies and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report).Per a study by economist Mariacristina De Nardi of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, healthcare spending for Americans aged 65 and aboveis approximately $18,424 per person, per year.Hence, Express Scripts’ move has been a timely and strategic one.Other Solid DevelopmentsRecently, Express Scripts announced a new Rare Conditions Care Value (RCCV) program in partnership with PinnacleCare — a private health advisory firm that offers personalized guidance and expert case review. This will provide members with free access to a support service known as Second Opinion. As the name suggests, this is a life-altering service that offers a second opinion from a top specialist in the field.Additionally, Express Scripts’ value-based SafeGuardRx program has proven to be effective in improving clinical outcomes and in lowering drug spend for patients, according to data released by the company.These endeavors clearly show that Express Scripts has fortified its position as one of the biggest PBM in the country.Price PerformanceBuoyed by a slew of developments, Express Scripts’ shares have rallied 25.4%, compared with the industry’s 11.8% gain in a year’s time.Zacks Rank & Key PickExpress Scripts carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Abiomed, Inc. (ABMD  -  Free Report).Abiomed has a long-term growth rate of 27%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1365,CVS,"On Jan 12, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industry over the past six months. The stock has inched up 0.7% against the industry’s 2.9% decline. We are upbeat about the company’s strong Pharmacy Services business, which has been growing on a solid Specialty Pharmacy subsegment. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is its top priority in gaining new customers and retaining the old, loyal ones. Accordingly, CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings including Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.We are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season, showing a solid progress from the last quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract loss but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. The company has already completed about 90% of client renewals for 2018.Additionally, it is encouraging to make a note of the company’s latest announcement to buy all outstanding shares of a diversified health care benefits company — Aetna (AET) — in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion).The company expects this takeover to be completed in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. On the deal’s successful closure, CVS Health estimates $750 million of near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s completion.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance allowing it to carry out share repurchases.On the flip side, the company’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern. Precisely, the company faces some stiff competition in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments in the portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining a major market share. Moreover, CVS Health has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. Per the company, this decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report) and Molina Healthcare Inc. (MOH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bio-Rad has a whopping expected growth rate of 141.5% for the first quarter of 2018. The stock has jumped 35%, surpassing the broader industry over a year.Centene has an expected long-term growth rate of 14%. The stock’s performance on the bourses has been solid in a year’s time with a high return of 70.4%.For 2018, Molina Healthcare has a robust projected growth rate of 178.6%. In the last three months, the stock has surged 37.8%, higher than the broader industry’s rally of 17.9%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1367,CVS,"There is no doubt that 2017 will go down as one of the most remarkable years in the history of U.S. stock trading. The market touched more than 60 daily all-time highs, and the S&P 500 closed higher in every single month for the first time in history. That hot streaked has continued into the first days of the New Year, with our major indexes once again surging to new peaks in 2018.Another trend we have also seen move into 2018 is speculation over major mergers and acquisitions. Total M&A activity was actually relatively quiet in 2017—deals were down about 35% through mid-November—but several Wall Street titans either announced major deals or found themselves at the center of deal-related rumors throughout the year.From industry-shifting moves like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout of Whole Foods and CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) tie-up with Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), to future-focused acquisitions like Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) purchase of CAR-T researcher Kite Pharma and Intel’s INTC deal to buy computer vision firm Mobileye, 2017 had plenty of huge M&A headlines to soak in (also read: 15 of the Best Mergers & Acquisitions of 2017).And so far in 2018, the headlines have continued. The entertainment industry is still reacting to Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) acquisition of several major 21st Century Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) assets, and giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) have already caused the rumor mill to swirl.With this in mind, let’s take a look a three huge M&A deals that might happen this year:1.       Apple (Finally) Buying NetflixPeople have been arguing that Apple should use its massive cash pile to make a major media acquisition for years now, and video streaming giant Netflix is typically the first choice among speculators.But Apple has defied these speculators time and time again, opting instead to invest in itself. Indeed, the company recently promised $1 billion to its Apple Music division for the purposes of building out original video content, and its first in-house produced shows are starting to debut now.However, the GOP’s tax reform bill, which includes a one-time allowance for companies to repatriate overseas cash, could be the catalyst needed to inspire a major Apple deal.Earlier this week, shares of Netflix surged after a note on this very topic from Citigroup analysts emerged. The firm’s Jim Suva and Asiya Merchant wrote that Apple is gearing up to make a major acquisition of a car company, video game company, or entertainment company. The analysts suggested that there is as high as a 40% likelihood of Apple acquiring Netflix soon.But is Apple even interested in the company, or will its attention turn elsewhere? 2.       Amazon Targets… Target?As if Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods was not enough to satisfy the retail deal rumors, the latest batch of industry whispers point to the e-commerce king going after big-box retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report).The rumors were sparked by Loup Venture co-founder Gene Munster, who recently published a report highlighting eight predictions for the technology industry this year.“Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,” Munster argued. “Getting the timing on this is difficult, but seeing the value of the combination is easy.”Amazon burned a lot of its cash with its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017, but if the financials work out, Target certainly makes sense within the context of the online retailer’s ongoing war with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report).Nevertheless, another brick-and-mortar acquisition could be a lofty move for the e-commerce company, especially considering how fresh the Whole Foods deal is. Can the internet giant really adapt to traditional retail that quickly? 3.       Time Warner and Comcast Snatch HuluAs mentioned, the entertainment industry is still figuring out what to do next after Disney decided to shell out more than $50 billion in stock for many of Fox’s most important assets. Disney has certainly beefed up the library for its upcoming streaming services, and ESPN’s grasp on the sports world is even tighter with the acquisition of Fox Sports Regional Networks.But one thing that remains unclear is the fate of Hulu, a budding video streaming platform co-owned by Fox, Disney, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), and Time Warner . Disney bought Fox’s 30% stake in the brand, giving it a controlling 60% stake, but it is unlikely that Comcast and Time Warner will give up on the promising streaming platform just yet.Comcast still owns 30% of Hulu, and through its NBCUniversal subsidiary, it could certainly whip up a Hulu-NBC-Universal streaming service that could compete with Disney and Netflix. Teaming up with Time Warner and its HBO division could add even more firing power.Of course, we have yet to see any indication that Disney is looking to shed its new controlling stake in Hulu, but one would imagine that it could become a bargaining tool in what is sure to be a complicated regulatory approval process.With Netflix, Disney, and Amazon poised to be video streaming leaders in five years’ time, might Comcast and Time Warner look to toss a fourth hat into the ring? Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1368,CVS,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market. Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts as well as an increase in volume owing to previously announced pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this momentum to get reflected in fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, which are scheduled for release on Jan 4.Moreover, rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have been strengthening the retail pharmacy market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board expects this trend to continue. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Challenges in the Retail Pharmacy USAPer management, the pharmacy business is affected by reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix toward 90-day at retail (one prescription that is equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Moreover, the company expects these factors to affect first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Moreover, collaborations among generic producers and a rise in generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) raise caution.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the retail pharmacy market has aggravated matters. To counter competition, Walgreens Boots will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.Intensifying competition owing to mergers and acquisitions is also a matter of concern. In this regard, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report). Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced plans to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report). Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to fend off competition.Steps to Counter ObstacleWalgreens Boots has been leaving no stone unturned to counter challenges.In this regard, the company has been developing and expanding relationships with commercial third-party payers to permit new and enhanced market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks. Notably, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots, as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently-owned pharmacies in the United States.Per management, the prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. The company’s 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is a lower margin one in comparison to 30-day prescriptions. However, it helps the company tap into opportunities pertaining to patients with chronic prescription needs. It also offers increased convenience and cost efficiency. The company’s U.S. loyalty program, Balance Rewards, also bodes well. Notably, as of Aug 31, 2017, the number of active Balance Rewards members totaled 88.2 million.Rite Aid Deal a PositiveWe currently look forward to the company's agreement to purchase a limited number of Rite Aid Corporation (RAD) stores. While the transition process of these stores is underway, the company expects this phased acquisition to be completed by spring 2018. Notably, Walgreens Boots has purchased 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.Although the deal is not going to impact the yet-to-be-reported quarter’s results, a number of aspects of it should prove beneficial in 2018. In this regard, the final Rite Aid deal agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreens Boots’ affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens Boots’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens Boots with certain transition services for up to three years post deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial value is quite attractive. Post the transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be realized within four years. This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens Boots, this modified merger contract will extend its growth strategy and offer operational plus financial benefits. It will also help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets, including the Northeast. Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C. However, to achieve the desired results, the company will have to incur huge expenditures to fully integrate and rebrand the retained stores.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings in first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Walgreens Boots has an Earnings ESP of +3.97%.

1369,CVS,"The year 2017 has failed to turn things around for CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has underperformed the S&P 500 market year to date. The stock has lost 5.4% as against the S&P 500 market’s 20.4% gain.During the first-quarter 2017 earnings call, CVS Health’s President and Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said, “We continue to expect 2017 to be a rebuilding year, but our goals remain clear, and we fully intend to return to healthy levels of growth.” Unfortunately, little of this could materialize. The company is still grappling with issues from the past along with other challenges.2016 Deals Major BlowsCVS Health is still trying to recover from the setback caused by Prime Therapeutics’ collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) in August 2016. Owing to this, CVS Health lost access to Prime’s 22 million members. Notably, Prime Therapeutics is the fourth largest Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in the United States owned by 14 leading Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans.Another major blow was dealt at the end of 2016 when the TRICARE retail pharmacy network managed by Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) restricted CVS pharmacies, including those in Target stores, from participating. This network, with more than 57,000 locations, included Walgreens Boots as a member instead.Thanks to these developments, CVS Health’s shares lost 15.2% in the last five months of 2016.   2017 Hasn’t Been Kind as WellCVS Health’s Retail/Long Term Care (LTC) business has been sluggish since first-quarter 2017 largely due to declining same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and a rise in the generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed).The company’s Retail/LTC business was also majorly impacted by weak operations in hurricane-ravaged areas like Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico. The company has valued the hurricane impact at about $55 million — primarily costs to cover insurance deductibles.The speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market has aggravated matters for CVS Health. To counter competition, CVS Health will have to add more digital and customer-friendly programs.CVS Health ~ A Force to Reckon With“If there is no struggle, there is no progress”Nothing could be more apt than this remark by Frederick Douglass. CVS Health, with a massive market cap of $74.52 billion, has been leaving no stones unturned to bounce back.Mergers & Acquisitions to Strengthen PBM BusinessIn a historic decision, CVS Health decided to acquire the United States’ third-largest health insurance company Aetna (AET) in a cash-and-stock deal worth around $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies from the deal, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction.Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business.Apart from the Aetna deal, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS Health’s PBM customers.Initiatives to Boost Retail/LTC BusinessThe company has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card. Subsequently, the company is planning to collaborate with PBMs and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health. The company’s latest initiatives like next-day and same-day delivery and automatic refills of prescriptions with a text message also seem promising.Recognizing the growing opportunities in the digital market, CVS Health has also been focused on enhancing its online and mobile capabilities in 2017. Building on the strength of its digital tools within pharmacy, with 60% of patients using them, the company is focused on offering advanced services to customers. These services range from Curbside program to same-day delivery options as well as enhanced mobile functionality and ExtraCare. Moreover, CVS Health has been enthusiastically working with Instacart and is now delivering from 2,800 stores.Is There a Rebound in the Cards?CVS Health has been firing on all cylinders of late. The company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) to provide services including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.While such measures will help smoothen the bumpy ride for the company, 2018 might come with a fresh set of surprises and challenges.

1370,CVS,"Fred’s Inc  has been reeling under sluggish comparable store sales (comps) in an intensely competitive retail scenario. The company’s murky performance is reflected in its price trend. Evidently, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has plunged as much as 80.4% over the past year against the industry’s rally of 10.4%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Let’s delve into some of the aspects that have led to the dismal performance of this discount retailer of pharmaceutical and general merchandise.What’s Weighing on Investors’ Sentiments?Rapid technological developments and lifestyle changes have radically altered consumers’ shopping habits. Companies which adapt with such market trends have been successfully afloat, while others suffer receding store traffic and resort to closures.Incidentally, Fred’s has been carrying out store closures for a while, which has been negatively impacting the company’s comps rate. In fact, declining store traffic led to the closure of 39 stores during first-quarter 2017. Additionally, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and continued rise in generic dispensing rate have led to reduced comps. Moreover, persisting challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have affected overall sales figures.  Further, Fred’s store expansion plans and aspirations to emerge as one of the largest pharmacy chain in the retail drugstore space were crushed by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. Also, the revised deal between Walgreens and Rite Aid offered no gains, thus keeping Fred’s behind industry leaders CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens and Rite Aid.Thanks to the downsides, we note that comps dipped 1.2%, 0.3% and 0.8% during the first, second and third quarters, respectively. Also, both top- and bottom-line results declined year on year and lagged estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Incidentally, Fred’s has been reporting bottom-line losses for six straight quarters. In addition to dismal comps, increased promotional activity to drive store traffic has been denting Fred’s business.To make matters worse, management cancelled quarterly cash dividend, alongside third-quarter results. Management stated that the cancelled dividend plan will help the company indulge in share repurchases and invest in strategic developments to induce efficiency in operations. However, with strategies failing to yield results and tumbling business, hopes of revival seem low for this drug-store retailer.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1371,CVS,"Health insurer Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) has signed an agreement to acquire Kindred-at-Home, a unit of Kindred Healthcare Inc.Details of the DealTPG Capital and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe and Humana have formed a joint venture to buy Kindred for nearly $4.1 billion including the acquired company’s debt. Humana will occupy a 40% stake for $800 million in Kindred-at-Home, which will be separated from the rest of the company after the deal. The transaction will see light by the summer of 2018 and will be slightly accretive to the company’s earnings per share in 2019 and beyond.Essence of the Deal for HumanaThe deal will provide a vertical integration for Humana and aligns with the company’s strategy to grow in the home healthcare arena. The deal will allow the company to provide an improved care to patients at low cost.This transaction will provide Humana with an extensive geographic coverage with approximately 65% overlap with Humana’s individual Medicare Advantage membership. The company will also have full access to extensive clinical capabilities to better serve its members.A deal of this kind comes as no surprise to us given that the company had kept its eyes wide open for such attractive acquisitions after its failed merger with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) earlier in the year. The company’s balance sheet with strong financial flexibility also provides enough support for capital deployment activities.Last week, the company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program to buy back its common stock worth up to $3 billion.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, the stock has rallied 21%, significantly underperforming the industry’s growth of 43%. Nonetheless, the recent announcement, a well-poised Medicare business as its solid balance sheet should drive the shares higher.Industry TrendA spate of similar deals is witnessed in the industry of late, driven by the increasing trend of health insurers foraying into patient-care business. The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna aims to dispense affordable cure to patients at their convenience closer home or at an outpatient location.Further competition is lent by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Recently, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group along with its clinics and urgent care centers.The central tenet for all these deals is to cut costs and improve care. These developments mark the coming forward of health insurers to play a more direct role in providing actual medical services and move beyond offering insurance.These deals seeking to reduce hospitalizations, lower emergency room visits and allowing physicians and clinicians to extend their care all the way to a patient’s home are, however, detrimental to hospital companies’ business and survival.Going ForwardThe ripple of shakeup in the health care industry started by CVS-Aetna deal continues to trend higher. One after another player continues to join the bandwagon of consolidation. Given the urgent need (in the rapidly-transforming health care industry) for increase in heft and size, restraint of sky-high medical costs plus diversification of business, we won’t be surprised if we hear more of deals along similar lines going forward.Humana carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1372,CVS,"“America has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, the best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in the world.” – Rep. Bill FristIn terms of market size, the U.S. health care market is the largest in the world. A report by Health Access suggests that America’s unparalleled purchasing power, massive demand for medical services and equipment, and opportunity for innovation has lent it a competitive edge.Further, the markets got a boost after President Donald Trump — an ardent proponent of “living big, living large” — came into power. His constant efforts to boost American lifestyle, focus on middle class and incorporate the best health care in America have been creating a stir.Trump’s efforts to eliminate the country’s jobless stature are remarkable. Per reports, the U.S. unemployment rate was pegged at 4.1% in November, the lowest since February 2001. Undoubtedly, Trump’s “America first!” pitch has been driving employment growth like never before.Four Factors to Drive MedTech in 2018Increasing Consolidation in HealthcareThe latest trend of increasing consolidation in the healthcare space has led to a reduction in the number of players, greater market concentration and reduced competition as well as increasing barriers of entry in the industry. The companies will benefit from higher market cap, which will put them in a position to negotiate with suppliers and consumers.The recent $69-billion deal between Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) and CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is a significant example. It qualifies as vertical integration, which will enable the newly formed entity to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.President Trump’s Focus on Emerging MarketsPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging market revenues, which is less than a quarter of MedTech’s global revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third by 2022.Thus, the United States' trade plans with emerging countries are likely to favor the domestic companies.In this regard, investors may find President Trump’s 12-day Asia trip last month interesting. The visit was aimed at boosting inter-country trade relations, particularly with the emerging nations. Trump’s promise to augment bilateral trade agreements with Indo-Pacific nations instills our confidence in his APAC policies. He also emphasized “free and open Indo-Pacific trade” with a focus on the nations of Japan, Australia and India.IVD & PBM Markets to Thrive A research report by EvaluateMedTech World Preview indicates that global MedTech sales are expected to witness a CAGR of 5.1% to $522 billion by 2022, with IVD (in Vitro diagnosis) raking in annual sales of $69.6 billion at a CAGR of 5.9%. Increasing investments from government and private players in the form of reimbursement coverage and speedy patent approvals are driving demand.The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. PBMs manage pharmaceutical spending and enhance health benefits for end users. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the global PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019. Investing in PBM stocks can be a prudent move for registering solid gains in 2018. Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

The growing prevalence of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, use of IT for quick and improved patient care and shift of the payment system to a value-based model.For example, MedTech major Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures and markets the da Vinci surgical system — an advanced robot-assisted surgical platform. This AI platform enables minimally-invasive surgery that helps avoid the trauma associated with open surgery. The company plans to expand the usage of da Vinci in general and thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and hernia repair in the days to come.Picking the Right StocksBased on certain parameters, we have selected six MedTech growth stocks which are poised for impressive returns in 2017.

1373,CVS,"Welcome to Episode #112 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.Every week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life.In this episode, Tracey is joined by John Blank, Zacks Chief Equity Strategist, to discuss the state of the economy, what could happen now that the US has gotten the largest corporate tax cut in history, the odds of a recession, the possibility of the treasury yields inverting and whether inflation will rear its head in the new year.Tracey and John have talked about the recession odds before on prior podcasts. Early in 2017, they said there were no signs of a recession.Is that true today, heading into 2018?Yield Inversion in 2018?And what about the worries over the 2 and 10-year treasury yields inverting?Many, including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, are fretting as those yields flatten.  Over the last 50 years, inverting treasury yields have signaled a recession 100% of the time.Yet John believes it could be different this time.Find out why on the podcast.How Investors Can Play the Corporate Tax CutsWill these massive corporate tax cuts really juice the US economy?John, who has a PhD in economics, explains what happens when businesses get an infusion of cash.If you’re trying to invest in the “winners” of the corporate tax cuts, you should check out a few of these names.Stocks for the Corporate Tax Cuts1.       CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) has already said it was one of the largest payers of corporate taxes in America. Last year, it paid $3.3 billion with an effective tax rate of 38.4%. What will CVS do with all the cash it sees from the cuts?2.       Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) is also one of the big cap corporate winners. Last year, it paid an effective tax rate of 37.4%, or $4.7 billion. Will it invest the cash in new technology, new rails, or new equipment? Or will it show up in a higher dividend or a share buyback?3.       Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) paid an effective tax rate of just 18.3% last year, or $2.3 billion. Therefore, it’s unlikely to see any real impact directly from the cuts themselves.4.       Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), on the other hand, had an effective tax rate of 34.1% but it only paid $1.9 billion. It already has $138 billion in cash on hand so a tax cut is, basically, meaningless.5.       Thor Industries (THO  -  Free Report) is a mid-cap maker of RVs and trailers. Last year, it paid an effective tax rate of 32%, or $182 million. What will Thor do with the extra cash? Smaller companies might be more likely to add employees or build new factories.There’s a lot of unknowns with the corporate tax cuts simply because they’ve never happened before. Even economists have no idea what will happen in boardrooms with management.Additionally, the cuts may help those who didn’t have as easy access to capital, as some of the large caps have.Where should you be placing your investing bets in 2018?Find out more on this week’s podcast.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of FB in her personal portfolio mentioned in this podcast.]Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1374,CVS,"On Dec 11, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industryover the past six months. The stock has lost 10.6% compared with the industry’s 12.5% decline.We are upbeat about the company’s strong Pharmacy Services business which has been gaining on strength in Specialty Pharmacy. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is top priority for customers. Accordingly, CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, which include Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.  We are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season, with solid progress in the last reported quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the loss of the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. The company has already completed about 90% of client renewals for 2018.We are encouraged by the company’s latest announcement to buy all outstanding shares of a diversified health care benefits company — Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) — in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is projected at $77 billion). The company expects the takeover to close in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. On the deal’s successful completion, CVS Health expects $750 million of near-term synergies, with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s closure.Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that allows it to carry out share repurchases.On the flip side, the highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a concern. Precisely, the company faces stiff competition in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments. Discount retailers, in particular, have made substantial inroads in gaining market share. Moreover, CVS Health has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in recent past. Per the company, the decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). Notably, PetMed and Align Technology sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PetMed has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. The stock has rallied roughly 94.1% over a year.Align Technology has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 28.9%. The stock has gained 136.1% in a year.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

"
1375,CVS,"The role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S. healthcare sector has been evolving. From being just third-party administrators of prescription drug programs, PBMs have come a long way. PBMs currently play a major role in managing pharmaceutical spending and enhancing health benefits for end-users.Notably, PBMs are mainly accountable for the development of formularies, discussing discounts with major drug manufacturers and pharmacy contracts. These firms also play an important role in the settlement of prescription drug claims.As per Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates, PBMs have the potential to save as much as 30% in total drug spending relative to unmanaged purchasing (data published in ‘The Economic Benefits of Pharmacy Benefit Managers’ by Orszag and Green).Undoubtedly, the PBM market is expected to continue the solid trend. Per a report by Market Research Reports.biz, the PBM market will see a CAGR of 7.16% between 2014 and 2019.Factors Driving PBMHistorically, there have been a number of factors supporting growth in the PBM market. Rising healthcare expenditures along with higher cost of drugs and other healthcare services have driven demand for PBMs who act as middlemen between the payer and other entities in the system.We are also encouraged by a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board on rising U.S. healthcare spending. Per the report, the U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of Gross Domestic Product (based on assumptions that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).The PBM market largely benefits from an aging population which tends to depend on drugs and pharmacy benefit plans. Per a report by Technavio, nearly 14.4% of the U.S. population is aged 65 years and above which buoys optimism.Many analysts believe that rising expenditure on prescription drugs and growing demand for specialty drugs have also been strengthening the PBM market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report published by Advisory Board predicts a continuation of this trend. Per the report, prescription drug spending is projected to grow roughly 7% between 2018 and 2019.Per a 2017 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies ad Pharmacy Benefit Managers, specialty drugs accounted for about one-third of the pharmacy industry’s revenues in 2016.Mergers & Acquisitions Change PBM LandscapeThe PBM market has always been dominated by a handful of large players. In 2007, CVS’ merger with Caremark Rx to form CVS Caremark, now CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), had a huge impact on the functions and scope of PBMs. Again, CVS Health announced a historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report).People in support of the merger view it as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gain and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s PBM business. Notably, a horizontal integration increases the chances of monopolistic practices in the market.Following the announcement of the CVS-Aetna deal, another leading health service company — Optum, part of the UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) — announced its decision to acquire DaVita Medical Group, a leading independent medical group and a subsidiary of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report).Moreover, it is being speculated that Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) might soon announce the acquisition of health and well-being company, Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report) to counter competition.3 Stocks to Scoop UpAs the PBM industry is constantly expanding, this industry is worth keeping an eye on. Here are three PBM companies with promising prospects.CVS Health: Headquartered in Woonsocket, RI, CVS Health, with its subsidiaries, provides integrated pharmacy health care services. This leading PBM company has a market cap of about $73.8 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.1% in the next three to five years.Apart from the Aetna deal earlier, CVS health has announced plans to set up a new 30,000-store performance-based pharmacy network fixed by CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report), as well as up to 10,000 community-based independently owned pharmacies across the United States. Through this initiative, the company intends to promote cost saving and enhance clinical outcomes which will eventually reduce costs for CVS’ PBM customers.CVS Health Corporation Price CVS Health Corporation Price | CVS Health Corporation QuoteExpress Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Saint Louis, MO, Express Scripts operates as a PBM company in the United States, Canada and Europe. The company has a market cap of about $38.83 billion. Its earnings are estimated to grow 9.7% in the next three to five years.Notably, the company’s PBM segment offers clinical solutions, specialized pharmacy care, home delivery and specialty pharmacy, retail network pharmacy administration, benefit design consultation, drug utilization review, drug formulary management, administration of a group purchasing organization, and consumer health and drug information services. Moreover, this segment provides Medicare, Medicaid, and health insurance marketplace products.The company recently announced plans to acquire privately-held and evidence-based medical benefit management services provider — eviCore healthcare. Notably, by integrating eviCore's medical benefits management (MBM) platform with its PBM offering, Express Scripts intends to combat rising healthcare costs.Express Scripts Holding Company Price Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteRite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report): Operating through Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Services segments, Rite Aid owns a chain of retail drugstores in the United States. The company has a market cap of about $1.91 billion.Notably, the company’s Pharmacy Services segment provides PBM services and a range of pharmacy-related services. This segment also provides prescription adjudication services for other PBMs, offers integrated mail-order and specialty and compounding pharmacy services, and provides infertility treatment as well as drug benefits under the Medicare Part D program.Rite Aid Corporation Price Rite Aid Corporation Price | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteBottom LineAlthough these companies have solid prospects, they are exposed to challenges like legal regulations, reimbursement pressure and the speculated entry of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the PBM market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1376,CVS,"The mega merger of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) with Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) announced recently has sent jitters across the hospital sector, which is already suffering from low patient volumes, soaring costs, increasing bad debts, and an uncertain regulatory climate among other issues.Increasing EncroachmentThe deal between a health insurer, Aetna and a pharmacy benefit manager and a pharmacy store company, CVS Health, is expected to eat into the business of hospital companies. The companies aim to bring affordable cure to patients at increased convenience. This implies greater emphasis on value-based care rather than fee for service care.The players are structuring their offerings in a way that should keep patients away from hospitals. In this regard, they are being provided necessary services at home or an outpatient location. This should shift patient traffic for emergency rooms away from hospitals.“The overuse of emergency department adds an estimated $38 billion in wasteful spending every year, so tremendous savings can be realized by utilizing local care solutions in a more integrated fashion,” according to Aetna’s CEO Mark Bertolini.Further competition is being posed by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), which is voraciously spreading its business in this space via its OptumCare unit by acquiring doctor clinics, urgent care facilities and surgery centers. Last week, UnitedHealth Group’s Optum unit announced that it would pay nearly $5 billion to buy DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) Medical Group and its clinics and urgent care centers.The expansion of UnitedHealth and CVS Health in outpatient facilities is likely to create challenges for big names in the hospital industry such as Tenet Healthcare, HCA Holdings and Community Health Systems. The country’s nonprofit hospital industry may also not be spared.The industry underperformed the S&P 500 index last year, as evident by growth of just 2.8% compared with a rally of 20% by the former.Recourse Being TakenPlayers in the hospital industry are coming together to gain in scale and size to face growing invasion. According to a Wall Street Journal report, hospital operators Ascension Health and Providence St. Joseph Health are mulling to merge which should create the nation’s largest hospital chain.Two major Midwestern hospital operators, Advocate Health Care and Aurora Health Care, are combining to lead cost-effective operations. Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health are merging, bringing together 139 hospitals and projecting combined revenues of $28.4 billion.Consolidation is the Name of the GameConsolidation in the hospital industry is already rampant, driven by the increased need by players to build scale and new capabilities, increase service offerings, and expand geographically to find a solid footing in an uncertain healthcare environment.According to the latest analysis by Kaufman Hall, a leading provider of strategic and financial consulting services, hospital and health system partnership transactions for 2017 were total 87 as of the end of the third quarter, implying that transactions may exceed 102 deals completed in 2016. Last quarter, 29 transactions were announced, slightly less than 31 deals announced in the second quarter.With the trend not likely to see any reversal anytime soon, we expect further deals down the line.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1377,CVS,"Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) received FDA approval for Admelog, its biosimilar version of Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) blockbuster rapid-acting insulin, Humalog (insulin lispro).

1379,CVS,"UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s (UNH  -  Free Report) Optum unit has announced the buyout of DaVita Medical Group, a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report), for $4.9 billion in cash.This acquisition will be made by OptumCare — a sub-segment of Optum — the company’s health services segment. OptumCare provides primary and urgent care delivery services business.This is the company’s third deal this year to expand its medical services business. It is expected to close in 2018. In March, the unit bought Surgical Care Affiliates for about $2.3 billion. Last month, Optum also bought the health unit of Advisory Board Co., which advises hospital systems.The company is on an acquisition spree to build its Optum segment gradually. In this regard, the Catamaran and the MedExpress buyout in 2015 are worth mentioning.The expansion of this segment, which complements its core health benefits business under UnitedHealthcare, should poise the company strongly for growth in an increasingly regulated market.In the last year, shares of UnitedHealth have gained 38%, in line with the industry's growth it belongs to.UnitedHealth has been continuously adding related businesses to transform itself from just an insurance company to a comprehensive healthcare provider. The company will now offer a bouquet of services that include selling of health insurance coverage to pharmacy benefit management to improve physician practices.This transformation is also necessitated by the company’s need to control soaring medical costs to protect margins. Getting vertically integrated, better equips the company to provide superior healthcare services at reasonable costs by ruling out duplication of services and playing a more direct role in medical services.Meanwhile, an increasing trend of vertical consolidation is being witnessed across the industry, which is itself undergoing rapid transformation owing to heightened regulation, soaring medical costs, increased consumerism, shift to value based care.Another deal in the same vein is that of the buyout of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), which would enable the surviving company to sell a range of services and products from drug to insurance cover.We strongly believe consolidation in the sector to continue, which would lead to more deals of this kind going forward.UnitedHealth carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1380,CVS,"On Wednesday, only a few days after the CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) and Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal helped shine a light on the quickly changing healthcare industry, UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report) announced that it will buy a unit of DaVita Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) for nearly $5 billion.UnitedHealth, the country’s biggest health insurer, announced that its Optum division reached an agreement to acquire DaVita Medical Group for roughly $4.9 billion in cash. This deal, which is expected to close in 2018, is aimed to help expand UnitedHealth’s primary and urgent care services.UnitedHealth hopes to pair DaVita Medical Group’s 300 medical clinics, 35 urgent-care centers, and six outpatient surgery centers—which reach around 1.7 million patients a year—with Optum’s massive insurance division.“Combining DaVita Medical Group and Optum advances our shared goal of supporting physicians in delivering exceptional patient care in innovative and efficient ways while working with more than 300 health care payers across Optum in ways that better meet the needs of their members,” Optum CEO Larry C. Renfro said in a statement.Optum also runs its own primary and urgent care centers, surgery centers, and senior and advanced care centers. Officials at both companies noted that the deal aims to help improve and streamline the ability to treat patients.This move is part of a growing shift for health insurers to play a more direct role in actual medical services. Many health insurers now want to be able to provide their own patient care as often as possible. The deal will hopefully cut costs and improve care, given the proximity and number of care centers—especially for people with non-life threatening, chronic conditions.The move comes after CVS announced its acquisition of healthcare benefits giant Aetna on Sunday. The $69 billion deal will allow the companies to offer more healthcare services at CVS stores.UnitedHealth's latest deal is its second acquisition in 2017 aimed at bolstering its offerings beyond insurance. In March, UnitedHealth purchased Surgical Care Affiliates for $2.3 billion.Shares of DaVita soared 12% premarket on the back of the announcement. Since then, the stock has cooled a bit and now hovers up around 10% at $67.20 per share, which is still $3 below its 52-week high.UnitedHealth saw its stock price dip in early morning trading, but shares have since gained around 0.80%. CVS stock dipped slightly on Wednesday following the UnitedHealth and DaVita deal.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1381,CVS,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) has created quite a buzz in the entire healthcare space. Most economists consider this coming together of two stalwarts — consolidation of CVS Health’s pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) business with Aetna’s large and unshakable insurance base — as a new dimension added to healthcare landscape. However, critics are of the view that the gains from this combined entity will be short-lived for the healthcare society at large to benefit from.Vision in Favor of the DealPeople supporting this proposed integration between CVS Health and Aetna opine that this merger has fair chances to pass the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health’s PBM platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) acquisition deal proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists lapping up the deal are looking much forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put the brakes on America’s soaring health-care costs. Notably, total medical cost has inflated in the 6-7% range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs (data published in The Economist article).Blankenhorn in his article stated that to counter this problem, the CVC-Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions. Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren’t available is a method to keep drug prices in check.The OppositionThose opposing the buyout comment that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care, both may finally end up paying severely for the merger. Akin to the supporters of the deal, the contrary view underscores the cost-control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the United States’ third-largest insurer Aetna’s huge client base into CVS drugstores to get their prescriptions filled through CVS’ drug plans. This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen’s role and other intermediaries in queue, finally resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost.However, the critics believe this to be a short-lived scenario and in the longer term, patients could end up incurring more medical expenses. Per a recent Vox report, this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won’t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms. This will in fact diminish competition in the sector leading to inflating prices.To know more in detail, please read: CVS Health's Aetna Buyout to Change Healthcare LandscapeShare Price ComparisonShares of CVS Health have outperformed the broader industry over the past three months.

1384,CVS,"The healthcare industry is headed for a shakeup after CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) officially announced its purchase of healthcare benefits giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) on Monday.CVS acquired the health insurer in a cash and stock deal worth roughly $69 billion. Including debt, the deal is valued at $77 billion. The merger will allow the companies to offer more healthcare services at CVS stores.“This combination brings together the expertise of two great companies to remake the consumer health care experience,” CVS CEO Larry J. Merlo said in a statement.“We look forward to working with the talented people at Aetna to position the combined company as America's front door to quality health care, integrating more closely the work of doctors, pharmacists, other health care professionals and health benefits companies to create a platform that is easier to use and less expensive for consumers.”CVS hopes the Aetna buyout will give the drug store giant the ability to become even more of a one-stop-shop. This mega-merger could also help to slowly reshape some of the U.S. healthcare industry. However, shares of both CVS and Aetna dipped on Monday following the announcement.With all of this said, let’s take a look at three healthcare industry stocks that might prove enticing to investors as the industry continues to shift.1.       Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report)Shares of this HMO provider, which serves the under-insured and uninsured with health plans through Medicaid, Medicare, and other programs, have skyrocketed 78.91% this year. At the moment, Centene is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and scored an “A” for Value and a “B” for Growth in our Style Scores system.For the current year, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Centene’s revenues are projected to climb nearly 18% to $47.84 billion. Centene’s earnings are expected to surge 12.42%. And within the last 60 days, Centene has received 11 positive full-year earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades.Centene also sports a 0.37 price to sales ratio, which marks a discount compared to the “Medical – HMO’s” industry’s average. On top of that, the healthcare power is currently trading at 20.30x earnings, helping further demonstrate Centene’s solid value.2.       Triple-S Management Corporation (GTS  -  Free Report)This San Juan, Puerto Rico-based independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock that rocks an overall “A” VGM grade. Before Monday’s 1% climb, which helped Triple-S’ stock price hit a new 52-week high, shares of the healthcare company had gained 38% this year—more than double the S&P 500’s pace.Triple-S’ 0.23 P/S ratio, which marks a nearly 60% discount compared to the “Medical – HMO’s” industry’s average, helped the company score an “A” for Value in our Style Scores system. What’s more, the company’s current quarter EPS are expected to surge 92.86%, according to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, Triple-S’ full-year earnings are projected to jump from $0.13 per share a year ago to $1.23 per share—or 846%.3.       athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report)Athenahealth is a top provider of internet-based healthcare IT services. This company specializes in online and web services—from record keeping software to back-office operations—for an array of healthcare providers.

Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Athenahealth’s full-year earnings to gain 6.44%.On top of that, Athenahealth full-year revenues are expected surge 12.46% and hit $1.22 billion. What’s more, shares of Athenahealth have already climbed 26.14% this year.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1385,CVS,"A momentous healthcare consolidation has commenced with CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) deciding to acquire the U.S. health insurance giant Aetna Inc. AET for a colossal sum of $69 billion. Per a Yahoo Finance article by Julia La Roche, this one valuable deal could reshape the landscape of American health care.Following this news, shares of the company have been slightly down (about 0.23%) in pre-market trading on Dec 4.Deal DetailsOn Dec 3, CVS Health announced that under a definitive merger agreement, the company will acquire all outstanding shares of Aetna in cash and stock for approximately $207 per share or almost $69 billion (considering a rough estimate of Aetna's debt, the total transaction value is calculated at $77 billion).  More specifically, Aetna’s shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share.CVS Health noted that the terms of this merger agreement have been unanimously approved by the respective board of directors of the two companies involved.Post the close of the transaction, Aetna’s shareholders will own nearly 22% of the combined entity while CVS Health shareholders will acquire the rest. The company expects the takeover to complete in the second half of 2018, subject to approval by both the company’s shareholders, regulatory approvals as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions.Synergy Benefit ForecastOn the deal’s successful completion, CVS Health expects to earn $750 million from near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s closure.Per the company, shareholders can look forward to several outcomes with respect to near-term synergy including enhanced competitive positioning and a new combined platform that might redefine access to high-quality care at low cost, substantially accelerating the consolidated business’ growth. The acquirer is highly optimistic about this merger, slated to combine the analytics of Aetna with its ‘touch of humanity’ on the health care turf and help create a robust platform to serve individuals better.Per CVS Health, this merger in the long term has great potential to deliver a significant incremental value as it is likely to spur development of new products and generate new-growth opportunities as a uniquely integrated retailer, pharmacy benefits manager and a far-sighted health planner.Share Price ComparisonShares of CVS Health have outperformed the broader industry over the past three months. The stock has dropped 3.5%, comparing favorably with the industry’s 9.1% decline during the same time frame. Its current value is however, lower than the S&P 500's 6.8% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCVS Health carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc.

1386,CVS,"The healthcare space is consolidating with the latest development being the potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report). A drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS has agreed to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna for $207 per share or $69 billion.This would be the biggest deal of the year and the first tie-up of a retailer, an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager in history. As such, the proposed deal would change the landscape of healthcare business as well as streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain (read: Top-Ranked ETFs in Focus on Rumored CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Aetna shareholders will receive $145.00 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share. Upon closure, Aetna shareholders will own approximately 22% of the combined company and CVS Health shareholders will own approximately 78%.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' healthcare needs, ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. By owning Aetna, CVS will become the first triple healthcare player: a drugstore, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer. It would be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. This is because CVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management business in the United States and often negotiates drug benefits for insurance plans and employers (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Additionally, the combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmaceutical drugs and has already received pharmacy-wholesaler licenses in a dozen states.The transaction would result in cost synergies of $750 million and low-to-mid single-digit accretion to earnings in the second full year after the transaction closes. It is expected to close in the second half of 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals. Including the assumption of Aetna's debt, the total value of the transaction is $77 billion.However, the transaction is expected to attract high antitrust scrutiny because of its sheer size and overlaps in Medicare Part D — a government program to subsidize prescription drug costs. Notably, CVS has a market capitalization of $76.1 billion while AET has a market cap of $59.1 billion. As such, the approval of the transaction might call for certain divestitures of Medicare prescription drug contracts.ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare and consumer ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CVS-AET deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with Aetna occupying the third position, accounting for 7.4% share. The fund has amassed $486.3 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 26,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF (CNSF  -  Free Report)The fund targets companies that have the potential to outperform the broad U.S. consumer staples sector and tracks the MSCI USA Consumer Staples Diversified Multiple-Factor Capped Index. Holding 28 stocks in its basket, CVS Health takes the sixth spot, accounting for 6.1% of the portfolio. In terms of industrial exposure, more than half of the portfolio is dominated by food beverage tobacco while household and personal product and food & staples retailing take the remainder with a double-digit exposure each. This ETF has attracted $2.6 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of about 500 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year and currently has a Zacks ETF Rank of 5 (Strong Sell).PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio (PMR  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the general merchandise stores by tracking the Dynamic Retail Intellidex Index. In total, the product holds 30 securities with CVS taking the fourth spot at 5% of assets. In terms of industrial exposure, specialty retail takes the top spot at 35%, while drug stores (13%), hypermarkets (13%) and food retail (11%) round off the top three positions. The fund has accumulated just $14.5 million in its asset base and charges 63 bps in fees per year. Average daily volume is paltry at 2,000 shares. The ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), with a Medium risk outlook (read: Best ETFs & Stocks From November's Top Sector).VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index. Of these, CVS takes the ninth position with 4.2% share. The ETF has a certain tilt toward specialty retail, which accounts for 32% of the portfolio, while Internet direct marketing (22%), hypermarkets (12%), departmental stores (10%), and healthcare services (8%) round off the next four spots.

The company would be paying a total of $2.5 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this year.With this deal, WellCare will be able to add around 1.07 million of Medicaid members in Michigan and Illinois.

In 2017, the company had acquired Arizona Medicaid Assets of Phoenix Health Plan and Universal American Corp.The acquisition of one of the largest privately held, for-profit managed care organizations in the United States is reminiscent of the increased merger and acquisition taking place in the healthcare industry, as the players are busy transforming their businesses to become a comprehensive healthcare provider.  In the same vein, two mega acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corp.

(CVS  -  Free Report) are already underway.Rising medical costs, shift to value-based care, threat of competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc., demographic changes and increased regulations are some of the catalysts driving mergers and acquisitions in the healthcare industry.The WellCare and Meridian transaction is expected to add about 40 to 50 cents per share to the company’s adjusted earnings in 2019, 70-80 cents per share in 2020 and more than $1.00 per share in 2021. This is inclusive of $30-$40 million in synergies that will ramp up over the upcoming years and exclusive of one-time transaction-related expenses of $75 million to $85 million and cumulative integration-related expenses of $50 million to $60 million.WellCare expects to fund this transaction through a combination of cash in hand, an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility, issue of new equity of about $800 million to $1.2 billion, and new debt of around $600 million to $1.0 billion.The company also announced that it has secured $2.5 billion in committed bridge financing.Shares of WellCare have rallied 9.96% year to date, outperforming the industry’s average of 7.28%. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

"
1388,CVS,"President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled his plans of lowering drug prices, in keeping with promises he made in the run-up to the Presidential elections. Pharmaceutical companies and the broader industry had been anticipating that Trump would come down heavily on them, as he had long criticized drugmakers of “getting away with murder” by charging way too much for their products. However, these fears were dispelled as Trump’s proposal will actually not directly hamper the profitability of drug companies. Instead, the reforms are aimed at increasing competition for medicines, cutting list prices and reducing patients’ out-of-pocket costs. This pleasant surprise gave stocks of pharmaceutical companies a boost.Long-Standing CommittmentLowering drug prices was one of Trump’s presidential campaign promises. He had committed to take on the big drug companies, which was also supported by Trump’s Democrat opponent Hillary Clinton. Since then, Trump has time and again criticized drug manufactures and pharmaceutical companies for charging too much for their products. This had kept the pharmaceutical companies reeling under pressure for quite some time, as they had feared that Trump’s pharma plan could hurt their profits. The broader pharma sector SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals (XPH) has declined 6.3% year to date. And the industry had feared further losses, apprehending harsh measures from Trump on Friday.Raising Competition on the AnvilThe twist in the tale came when Trump stressed on increasing competition for medicines. This was one of the highpoints of his speech on Friday. Framing his plan as the “most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people” and describing it as “American Patients First,” he laid out a policy that intends to increase pharmaceutical competition and the power of negotiations while lowering patients’ out-of-pocket costs. Trump’s policy also aims at creating incentives to lower list prices of prescription drugs. The reforms certainly are a ray of hope for American patients for whom the rising cost of healthcare is a nagging concern. The American Patients First plan will have both immediate actions as well as future opportunities for both lowering out-of-pocket costs faced by patients and reducing drug prices. Interestingly, Trump refrained from raising direct Medicare price negotiations on Friday, although this was one of his agendas during his presidential campaign.Pharma Stocks Rally on Trump’s ReformsClearly, Trump’s American Patients First plan doesn’t seem to be a threat to pharmaceutical companies and their profits. In fact, it is very much in line with the financial interest of drugmakers and health insurers and will no way hamper their profits. These fears, which had often resulted in shares of pharma companies taking a hit in the last few months, finally saw them bouncing back on Friday. Although the sector declined initially on Friday, stocks started rallying by the time Trump had finished his speech. Shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) increased 6.2%. Also, shares of CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) were up3.2%, 2.8%,1.3% and 0.3%, respectively. Merck & Co has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump Spares DrugmakersThe biggest reason behind this rally is that Trump’s plan actually doesn’t hurt U.S. pharmaceutical companies at all. In fact, the administration keeps in place, and in a few cases, extends the role of drug middlemen, who have been often been blamed for spiking drug costs. Trump’s plan calls for drug companies to display prices in ads and restrict “gag clauses” for pharmacists. This proposal comes because some pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) have contracts that donot allow pharmacists from letting patients know if a drug on the cash counter would be cheaper than if it was purchased usingtheir insurance.However, Trump’splan gives the companies new powers in Medicare Part D, the U.S. program under which seniors get drug coverage. This would allow Medicare to change the list of covered drugs midyear in order to push back against price hikes of some generic drugsthat donot actually have so much competition. This led to shares of healthcare service companies like McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report), Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report), AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) and Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) rising 2%, 1.8%, 1.4% and 1%, respectively.Summing UpTrump’s American Patients First, which comes with a set of reforms, had sparked fears among pharmaceutical companies for quite some time. However, the fears seem to have subsided somewhat, as the new plan doesn’t hurt drugmakers and their profits. This saw investors’ confidence finally getting reinstated and pharma and biotech stocks rallying.   5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.

1389,CVS,"Fred’s Inc.  confirmed sale of certain assets of its specialty pharmacy business, EntrustRx, to CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). The company has been considering the divesture of its specialty pharmacy unit for a while, in a bid to monetize non-core assets, reduce debt load and induce a turnaround in its operations. Per the terms, Fred’s is entitled to receive $40 million along with a sum equivalent to EntrustRx’s inventory value. The transaction is expected to close by May-end, upon approval of customary closing conditions.Further, this latest move by Fred’s seems to have perked up investors’ optimism in the stock. Evidently, the stock moved up 2.1% in yesterday’s trading session. Let’s now delve into this development and see how Fred’s is expected to benefit from it.The Significance of the DivestitureFred’s has been grappling with dismal comparable-store sales performance since many quarters, due to lower traffic, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and persistent increase in generic dispensing rate. Although the company made investments in sales teams, therapy diversification and technology upgradations to revive its pharmacy business, it failed to uplift performance. To make matters worse, the company’s attempt to improve its pharmacy business performance was crushed by the cancelled Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. The deal could not make its way through regulatory hurdles, which marred Fred’s store expansion plans.   Amid such headwinds, Fred’s has long been exploring strategic alternatives for its pharmacy business and revive itself. Indeed, the company seems to have struck the right chords with its latest deal with CVS Health. The divestiture is expected to provide a relief to Fred’s ailing business by vending off some of its dismally performing business units and concentrate more on other prospective areas.  In fact, management of Fred’s also stated that the cash proceeds from this divestiture will enable the company to strengthen its financial position by reducing debt load.Apart from this, Fred’s has also been exploring opportunities to augment its retail pharmacy operations. The company is committed toward undertaking strategic transactions, improving cost structure and capital allocation, optimizing assortments, undertaking talent acquisition and efforts to drive revenues and margins. Notably, management foresees cost-savings opportunities of $30-$40 million for fiscal 2018, backed by the aforementioned efforts and initiatives to lower SKU count. We expect that such well-chalked strategies will aid the company to uplift its stock performance in the long run that has declined almost 64% over the past six months, compared with the industry’s rally of 16.4%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1390,CVS,"Fred’s Inc.  released fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom line deteriorated year on year. Shares of the company lost 6.3% on May 4, following the dismal performance.In fact, the company has lost almost 89% in a year, as against the industry’s 17.3% growth. This is largely attributable to Fred’s dismal comps and earnings record, as well as the impact of the canceled merger between Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report)   and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report). The canceled deal thwarted Fred’s store expansion plans and kept it behind industry leaders like Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).  Q4 HighlightsThe discount retailer posted adjusted loss of 62 cents per share from continuing operations, which was wider than the prior-year quarter’s loss of 58 cents.Quarterly net sales climbed 2.1% year over year to $477.3 million.

This in turn was hurt by unfavorable mix and markdowns on clearance inventory.Fred’s posted an adjusted operating loss (or EBITDA) of $18.9 million in the reported quarter, comparing unfavorably with the year-ago quarter, when the company posted adjusted operating earnings of $13 million. During the quarter, management successfully reduced adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (as a percentage of sales) by 230 bps to 28.4%.Financial UpdateFred’s ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $6,573 million, long-term portion of indebtedness of $167.1 million and shareholders' equity of roughly $181 million.Store UpdateFred’s currently operates 600 pharmacy and general merchandise stores. These include 12 franchised locations along with three additional specialty pharmacy-only locations.Looking AheadManagement is on track with turnaround strategies focusing mainly toward delivering considerable enhancing free cash flow and removing debt load. The company remains committed toward undertaking strategic transactions, improving cost structure and capital allocation, optimizing assortments, undertaking talent acquisition and efforts to drive revenues and margins. Notably, management foresees cost savings opportunities of $30-$40 million for fiscal 2018, backed by the aforementioned efforts and initiatives to lower SKU count.With regard to strategic transactions, the company revealed that it is already on track to sell its specialty pharmacy business and some parts of its huge portfolio.

According to the company, a 8.5% increase in same store prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis, partnerships with PBM’s and health plans, inclusion in a number of additional Medicare Part D networks this year and brand inflation were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales increased 1.6% year over year driven by a 90 basis pointsfavorable impactof the shift of sales associated with the Easter holiday to the first quarter of 2018 from the second quarter of 2017.

1393,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.6%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 2.5%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health has so far progressed well with its 2018 PBM selling season. Per the last-reported numbers, gross new business wins totaled $6.2 billion while net new business wins grossed $2.4 billion along with an impressive client retention rate. This momentum is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Despite tough pricing competition, CVS health is currently gaining on high level of service and execution, competitive pricing along with unique integrated model.The company is also upbeat about sustaining the solid year-over-year earnings trend in the first quarter of 2018 on gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The performance is being driven by higher specialty pharmacy and pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation.Management stated that CVS Health’s specialty business is its top priority to help the company expand its customer base. CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, including Specialty Connect.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteFurther, the company expects drug price inflation, product launches and higher utilization to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.CVS Health also projects better-than-expected performance in the to-be-reported quarter primarily on the back ofscript utilization at retail. The company has projected a 1.5-3.25% rise in consolidated net revenues for the first quarter.Further, a strong flu season has led to the improved outlook. Overall, for the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $45.82 billion reflects a 2.9% increase year over year.Although CVS Health’s Retail/LTC business registered revenue growth after several quarters of a slump in the last reported quarter, there are multiple factors raising concerns. Firstly, the year-over-year growth was just a marginal 0.3%.Further, continued reimbursement pressure, increasing generic dispensing rate andrecent generic drug introductions have been affecting the business. This apart, marketplace changes that kept CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-basis point negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the previously reported quarter.However, CVS Health has been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card.The company also expects to witness revenue growth of 4% to 5.5% and operating profit growth in the low to mid-single digits range, within the Retail/LTC business.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health will beat estimates this earnings season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of +1.94%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CVS Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Please note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) should never be considered going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.40 reflects a 19.7% increase year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.53% and a Zacks Rank #3.Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.96% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1394,CVS,"Investors are keeping a close watch on Fred’s Inc.  as the discount retailer is gearing up to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. However, there are two things investors must note before they take a stock of the results. Firstly, Fred’s has rescheduled its earnings announcement date, and the second thing to note is why the company took this step.Well, Fred’s revealed that its fourth-quarter earnings are now slated to be reported on May 4, which will be followed by management’s conference call. Management clarified that this postponement is solely connected to Fred’s plans to divest its specialty pharmacy business, which will soon form part of the company’s discontinued operations.Notably, these revelations spurred investors’ sentiment, as shares of the company gained a solid 13.3% during yesterday’s trading session. This gave a major respite to the stock that was otherwise in the red zone for a while. Incidentally, Fred’s has lost close to 79% in a year, as against the industry’s rise of nearly 20%. This is largely attributable to Fred’s dismal comps and earnings record, as well as the impact of the canceled merger between Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) and Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report). The canceled deal thwarted Fred’s store expansion plans and kept it far behind industry leaders like Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).  Getting back to the latest announcements — we note that during the quarter under review, Fred’s directors sanctioned a plan to undertake rigorous marketing of the company’s specialty pharmacy business. This in turn requires Fred’s to put up the specialty pharmacy operations under discontinued operations for all time periods in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. As management anticipates filing the 10-K on May 4 itself, it is likely to take time to complete the accounting procedures associated with presenting its specialty pharmacy business operations in the discontinued operations section. This in turn caused the company to delay its reporting date from Apr 18 to May 4.We note that in third-quarter fiscal 2017, Fred’s generated more than half of its total sales from its pharmacy business, which comprises the retail pharmacy as well as the specialty pharmacy. However, total pharmacy sales dipped 2.1% year over year, most of which was accountable to softness in retail pharmacy stemming from store closures.In fact, management has long been focused on improving the performance of its specialty pharmacy business through investing in sales team, therapy diversification and technology. The company has also been leveraging its business relations with payer partners in order to augment network access. These efforts were expected to help Fred’s specialty business gain access to 5 million new patients across different markets. Nevertheless, company’s decision to sell the specialty pharmacy unit looks like a well-perceived move that was also welcomed by Fred’s investors.On that note, let’s wait and see what’s in store for Fred’s this earnings season. The company, along with its subsidiaries operated 597 discount general merchandise stores and three specialties pharmacy-only across 15 states in the southeastern areas of United States.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1395,CVS,"Merger and acquisition activities across the globe picked up rapidly in the first quarter thanks to U.S. tax reform and faster economic growth in Europe.Per the preliminary Thomson Reuters data, global mergers and acquisitions had their strongest start ever totaling $1.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2018. This is up 67% over the past year and marks the fourth quarter that has surpassed $1 trillion over the past three years. United States M&A volumes climbed 67% while Europe volumes doubled. Meanwhile, Asia saw an 11% increase. However, the number of deals dropped 10% year over year to 10,338.According to a report by research firm Mergermarket, M&A activity across the world has hit a 17-year-high record in the first quarter with 3,774 deals globally, totaling $890.7 billion. This was the strongest start to the year since 2001 and represents an 18% year-over-year increase in value.The healthcare space has so far been at the forefront as Amazon’s move into the pharmaceutical sphere has spurred the major pharmacy retailers to consolidate. With regard to this, U.S. health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report) will acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. In another deal, the drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) is also in a process of acquiring the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for $69 billion. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year (read: Cigna to Buy Express Scripts: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Another large agreement is German utility EON SE’s $38.5 billion deal to acquire RWE AG’s renewable energy business Innogy SE.The boom in M&A is likely to continue given an accelerating economy, still-low interest rates, and tax reform, which allows companies to bring offshore cash back home. Potential cost savings through mergers are further fueling the urge to merge in the current ultra-competitive environment.How to Tap?Investors could easily take advantage of this surge in deals by employing the merger arbitrage strategy in their portfolio. This strategy looks to tap the price differential (or spread) between the stock price of the target company after the public announcement of its proposed acquisition and the price offered by the acquirer to pay for the stock of the target company. This is especially true given that investors should go long on the target or the acquired company and short on the acquiring company. When the deal is completed, shares of the target company will increase to the full deal price (in some cases slightly below the deal price), giving investors a nice profit.Below, we have highlighted three merger ETFs to ride out the surge from the increasing M&A deals. Any of these could make compelling options for investors seeking to implement this low correlation strategy to their portfolio: IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA  -  Free Report) This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer while at the same time provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. This is done by tracking the IQ Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund has 44 holdings in its basket with the largest allocation to Blue Buffalo Pet Products  and Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) on the long side. These two firms combined to make up for 17.5% share. The product has amassed $503.7 million in its asset base and trades in average volume of around 119,000 shares a day. It charges 77 bps in annual fees. The ETF has lost about 2.3% year to date (see: all the Hedge Funds ETFs here). ProShares Merger ETF (MRGR  -  Free Report) This product provides exposure to a global merger arbitrage strategy, which seeks to capture the spread between the price at which the stock of a company (a target) trades after a proposed acquisition of such target is announced and the value (cash plus stock) that the acquiring company has proposed to pay for the stock of the target (a spread). This can be easily done by the S&P Merger Arbitrage Index. The fund holds a well-diversified portfolio of 33 stocks. Technology, industrials, healthcare and financials are the top three sectors. The ETF has been able to manage assets worth $4.4 million while it sees light volume of just 1,000 shares a day. Bottom Line While investors could capitalize on merger arbitrage by trading in a particular target company stock, the ETFs provide diversified exposure in the basket form with lower risk. Further, these could be excellent choices for investors in the rocky market due to their low correlation with the overall market (read: Trade Tensions or Not, Stay Safe with These ETFs). This is because companies in merger and acquisition deals generally move independently, ignoring all other issues that influence the movement of other stocks. As a result, investors could definitely focus on these products for relatively higher returns in any type of market.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

1396,CVS,"The health insurers continue to gain traction from increasing enrollment, product development, business diversification, cost-control efforts, increased operating efficiencies and a strong capital position. All these led to both top and bottom-line growth for most players in the field. Many in the industry have also kept raising their full-year guidance at the end of each quarter, thus indicating their rising operational excellence.Banking on the above positives, the industry has gained nearly 35.9% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500 average of 11.3%. The Zacks HMO industry is placed among the top 21% of the Zacks Ranked industries. Nevertheless, higher medical costs, public exchange woes, stiff competition, stringent regulations and compliance costs were a drag.Government Plans Look LucrativeDespite the prevalent uncertainty surrounding the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the industry continues to put up a good show in 2018.  We see sustainable growth potential in expanding government programs. The recent announcement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services regarding raising 2019 Medicare Advantage reimbursement rate by 3.4% also proves that. This action will definitely attract the private health insurance players with the aim of increasing their managed care participation. Since the government plans have already been highly profitable for health insurers, their increased participation is likely to result in significant top and bottom line growth.Apart from this upside, an increasing focus on preventive and value-based care, growing accountable care organizations, international business expansion, mergers and acquisitions also keep the industry’s growth trend alive.Thriving Economy, Rising Interest Rates, Changing Demography Fuel GrowthGrowing demand for health insurance products and services on the back of changing demographics, increasing income, low unemployment and jobless claims continue to aid the insurance stocks. A strong economy enables people to spend more on their healthcare needs that again opens up scope for the health insurers. An ageing U.S. population also boosts demand for Medicare Advantage plans, especially designed for the retirees to control the rising Medicare costs. This in turn encourages more participation from health insurers ensuring profitability on this ground.Additionally, the recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve also bodes well for health insurers. The managed care companies benefit from the rising rates owing to a generally sizeable investment securities portfolio coupled with manageable debt levels.Consolidation in the IndustryOf late, increasing consolidation has been a major phenomenon in the health insurance industry. This in turn leads to market concentration, which should help players enhance their operational scale as well as gain a substantial market share.Health insurers are trying to integrate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. The recently announced acquisitions of Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) and Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) underline the growing trend of two healthcare sector industries coming together to amicably provide a comprehensive care.Retailers have also expressed their interest in the health insurance industry. Humana has been in talks to get acquired by Walmart Inc. Eyeing the rewarding Medicare business provided to the surging baby boomers population, the retail major intends to invest big time in the health insurance industry. Recently, Amazon has also entered into a joint venture with JP Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway to manage insurance for their employees and is further looking for a CEO to helm its healthcare joint venture.Stocks to Bet on Before Q2We zeroed in on three stocks, poised for an earnings beat in the second quarter of 2018.

1397,CVS,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), following the completion of transferring stores to Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report),  revealed that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has expired on Mar 28, 2018, satisfying one of the conditions for its merger with Albertsons Companies, Inc.Though Rite Aid shares did not react much to this announcement, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock declined 20.4% in the last three months. This marks an underperformance from the industry’s fall of 12%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rite Aid had agreed to merge with the country’s largest grocer, Albertsons Companies, in February 2018. The merger will not only help revive the distressed Rite Aid’s business but also aid in dispelling the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). Per the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares.For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. This will leave Rite Aid shareholders with about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Meanwhile, Albertsons’ shareholders will own a 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in the next three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities.The new company will operate about 4,900 locations including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics, across 38 states and Washington D.C. The company will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies plan to re-banner most of the Albertsons pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores following the completion of the transaction, while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-along pharmacies.The merger is also approved by the board of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar year 2018, conditioned upon receipt of approval from Rite Aid shareholders, and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.The drugstore industry in general has been witnessing increased consolidation lately. After the failed merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid, the industry has seen CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) enter a deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018.  Additionally, Walgreens has bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report), a leading drug wholesale company.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1398,CVS,"On Mar 19, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report). While increasing demand for PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and specialty pharmacy was a major growth driver for the stock, its dull retail performance over the last few quarters seems to have disappointed investors. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Shares of the company have outperformed the industry in the past year. The stock has lost 19% compared with the 20.1% decrease of the broader industry. Notably, CVS Health exited the fourth quarter 2017 on a solid note with both earnings and revenues remaining ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A year-over-year rise in the top line was owing to a strong Pharmacy Services segment, having benefited from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy.The company’s sturdy 2018 PBM selling season is another growth-booster. On another positive note, the company is already making  a decent progress with its 2019 selling season. Good news is that it has been banking on gross wins of approximately $6.2 billion and net new business of $2.4 billion with a client retention rate of about 96.5%.Meanwhile, we are looking forward to the company’s commencement of the momentous $69-billion healthcare consolidation with the U.S. health insurance giant, Aetna. On successful completion of the deal, CVS Health expects to earn $750 million from near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the transaction’s closure.Moreover, Omnicare and Target Pharmacy buyouts are gradually driving enterprise value at CVS Health. Further, management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. Additionally, we expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.On the flip side, the company’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern as it faces some stiff competition in the pharmacy segment. This is because availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses continue to add pharmacy departments in the portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads in gaining a major market share. This apart, CVS Health has delivered some sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. Per the company, this decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) and PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1399,CVS,"Keeping in line with the projected time of completion of the Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) deal, CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) recently announced that its shareholders have voted in favor of the $69-billion acquisition of the health insurance giant. While the market is abuzz with this historically biggest healthcare deal nearing a step closer toward completion, investors are hesitant about its effectiveness.The deal surfaced when three corporate behemoths — Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase & co. (JPM  -  Free Report) — disclosed their plans to transform America’s healthcare landscape through their newly formed joint venture in the space. This is forcing investors to think that the deal is an attempt by the healthcare giants to hold on to their position.Supporting this, the former Aetna CEO John Rowe, in a CNBC report stated that both CVS Health and Aetna are trying to expand their footprint in healthcare with the entry of e-commerce and financial giants. According to him, “It's not quite explicit yet what they're planning on doing but whatever it is, it's scaring CVS.”Vision in Favor of the Deal — A Vertical Integration?According to CVS Health, with the closing of this consolidation, the combined company is expected to bring together two complementary businesses. This will lead to the creation of a new community-based open health care model that is user friendly and less expensive.Rowe and many other economists also opined that this merger has fair chances of passing the regulatory hurdles. They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one, thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost-cutting strategy of CVS Health’s PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) platform. Notably, a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market.An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this $69 billion deal, insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs. Per the article, the Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) acquisition proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition.The economists are looking forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put brakes on America’s soaring health-care costs. Notably, total medical cost has inflated in the 6-7% range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors, hospitals, medical devices and drugs (data published in The Economist article). Also, going by 2018 Deloitte data, global health care spending is projected to increase at an annual rate of 4.1% in 2017-2021, a significant escalation from just 1.3% in 2012-2016.Blankenhorn, in his article stated that to counter this problem, the CVS Health-Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions. Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren’t available is a method to keep drug prices in check.The OppositionThose opposing the buyout are of the opinion that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care, both may finally end up paying severely for the merger. Akin to the supporters of the deal, the contrary view also underscores the cost-control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the third-largest U.S. insurer Aetna’s huge client base into CVS Health drugstores to get the prescriptions filled through CVS Health’ drug plans. This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen’s role and other intermediaries, resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost.However, the critics believe this to be a short-lived scenario and in the long term patients could end up incurring more medical expenses. Per a recent Vox report, this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won’t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms. This will, in fact, diminish competition in the sector leading to inflated prices.CVS Health and Aetna both carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1400,CVS,"With underperforming stores, cancellation of dividends and continued bottom-line loses, Fred's, Inc.’s  troubles have been aggravating and denting its business for a while. However, to cater to consumers’ rapidly changing preferences and sustain market competition, the company has been focusing on pharmacy organization for driving scripts into its stores.  Additionally, it has been putting much effort to reduce operating expenses.Let’s take a look into the factors that have been bruising this discount retailer and discuss the growth plans it has put into place for achieving recovery.Factors Denting the StockFred’s comps have long been ailing from store closures, thanks to receding store traffic.  To top it, comps have also been bearing the brunt of continued increase in generic dispensing rate and sale of low productive discontinued inventory. Persistent challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have also affected overall sales figures. Due to these downsides, comps dipped 1.2%, 0.3% and 0.8% during the first, second and third quarters, respectively. In addition to dismal comps, increased promotional activity to drive store traffic has been denting business. Incidentally, the company has been reporting bottom-line losses for six straight quarters.Moreover, the company’s business expansion plans were eclipsed by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. If the deal were to materialize, it would have positioned Fred’s as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). However, obstacles such as antitrust concerns cancelled the deal and kept Fred’s far behind industry leaders.To make matters worse, management announced the cancellation of dividend alongside a dismal third quarter results. In combination, all such factors have gravely affected the company’s price performance. The stock has lost 80% in the past year, against the industry’s rally of 15%.Can Efforts Revive Performance?Fred’s strives to improve store traffic and has accordingly shifted focus to pharmacy organization. This is likely to drive scripts into its stores and improve services for patients. Fred’s Retail Pharmacy business seems to be stable, benefiting from the company’s shift to profitable generic prescriptions. In order to improve retail pharmacy business, the company has been expanding flu shots capacity along with aggressive inventory management and marketing initiatives.Further, management continues to build momentum in the Specialty Pharmacy business through investing in sales team, therapy diversification and technology. Owing to such efforts, the company expects its specialty business to gain access to 5 million new patients across different markets in the forthcoming periods. Additionally, such efforts position the company for new drug introductions, improve data flow and thereby increase efficiency in patient care.Fred’s also initiated several measures for reducing excess inventory and improving technology to better manage product-life cycle. During the third quarter, the company witnessed a turnaround in its tobacco business as well as improved sales of its beer and cosmetics businesses. Further, the company expects improved trends in these categories in the forthcoming periods.Along with strengthening pharmacy operations, expense reduction is also listed amongst Fred’s efforts to achieve profitability. During the third quarter, management successfully reduced selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses by 7% to $133.4 million. Further, management expects lower SG&A costs to help augment free cash flows. The company expects to pass the gains from the reduced cost structure to its customers and drive store traffic. Moreover, management plans to allocate funds derived from the cancelled dividend toward curtailing debt load, buyback shares and undertake other corporate initiatives.With such prospective endeavors in place, all is not gloomy for this Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) stock and we can still hope for its revival from the shambles. We hope that such dedicated efforts will help the company to uplift investors’ confidence in the stock in the long run.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1401,CVS,"Integrating medical care and pharmacy benefits under one roof, Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report), a global health insurance company. The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. Post the acquisition, the combined company will invest $200 million in its charitable foundation to support the communities in which it operates.Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts. Express Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefits manager.Express Scripts sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Express Scripts’ stock has outperformed the industry in the past year. Specifically, the company’s shares have gained 19.7% compared with the industry's rally of 13.8%.Under the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Express Scripts’ shareholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company.The transaction will result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after closure. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021. The latest acquisition has been undertaken solely to enhance customer base and improve ‘Patient-Provider Alignment’.Express Scripts Holding Company Price  Express Scripts Holding Company Price | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteU.S. Healthcare Leads the M&A GameMergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been the key driver of the U.S. healthcare space, lately. Glancing through the major acquisitions of the recent past, Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard, and JOHNSON & JOHNSON’s buyout of Actelion deserve a mention.In fact, health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain. Notably, the latest buyout of Express Scripts comes just three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to take over the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna.Coming to the post-acquisition impacts, we believe that the latest development will pose a big threat to UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), the largest U.S. health insurer, with its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS Health after it completes the merger with Aetna.The move is also expected to nullify threats from Amazon.com Inc., which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. Recently, the e-commerce giant announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to curb medical costs for their employees.What are the Moody’s Ratings for Express Scripts?Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody’s Corporation, placed the Baa2 senior unsecured long-term ratings to Express Scripts. Notably, obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate-credit risk. However, the latest rating has been kept under review with a tag of ‘direction uncertain’ by Moody’s.Moody’s has not rated Express Scripts with high-credit risk because of its solid position as a leading pharmacy benefit manager, moderate leverage and strong cash flow.However, Moody’s is worried about Express Scripts’ high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Further, the company’s ongoing dispute with Anthem, Inc — its largest customer — is a concern.Per Moody’s, Express Scripts experienced declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1402,CVS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 9.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CVS due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsCVS Health’s fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.92 were up 12.3% year over year. The adjusted EPS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. This one-time adjustment excludes the impact of a $1.5 billion income tax benefit resulting from the latest tax reform.Reported EPS from continuing operations came in at $3.22 per share, a 102.5% surge from the year-ago period.Full-year 2017 adjusted EPS came in at $5.90, a 1% improvement from the year-ago adjusted number.Net revenues in the fourth quarter increased 5.3% year over year to $48.39 billion, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%.Revenues for the year 2017 were $184.77 billion, a 4.1% improvement from 2016. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $183.88 billion.Quarter in DetailsPharmacy Services revenues increased 9.3% to $34.2 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes, higher pharmacy network volumes as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and continued price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8.2% to 389.7 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 69 million, up 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC were up by a marginal 0.3% year over year to $20.9 billion. According to the company, a 2.5% increase in same store prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 0.7% year over year but were positively impacted 80 basis points by seasonal cough and cold. Front-store sales were adversely affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales increased 0.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were adversely affected by approximately 340 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-bps negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the reported quarter.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) increased approximately 80 bps to 86.9% at the Pharmacy Services segment and around 160 bps to 86.8% at the Retail/LTC segment.Gross profit improved 3.9% to $7.9 billion. However, gross margin contracted 21 bps to 16.3%. Total operating margin in the quarter declined 10 bps to 6.4%.CVS Health exited the year 2017 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.81 billion compared with $3.45 billion at the end of 2016. Full-year, net cash provided by operating activities was $8 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.During the fourth quarter, CVS Health opened 65 new retail stores and closed 13 and relocated five retail locations. As of Dec 31, 2017, CVS Health operated 9,803 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.OutlookThe company has revised its outlook for 2018. The revision reflects the effects of the tax reform achieved through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).Management noted that, with $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the TCJA, the company will be able to make strategic investments in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term.Accordingly, the company has increased its 2018 adjusted operating profit growth guidance to a range of 1% to 4% from the earlier-stated range of (1.5%) to 1.5%.Earlier, while providing its 2018 initial outlook, CVS Health noted that, it expects to deliver net revenue growth of 0.75% to 2.5% in the year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full-year revenues is pegged at $188.04 billion.For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been 15 revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. In the past month, consensus estimates have shifted by 6.2% due to these changes.CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus  CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus | CVS Health Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, CVS has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C.

1403,CVS,"Waves of mergers and acquisitions have been heating up the healthcare space this year that could change the landscape of healthcare business. This is especially true given that health insurers are trying to consolidate with pharmacy benefits managers to streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The latest catalyst is the health insurer Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which has planned to acquire the largest pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding (ESRX  -  Free Report) for $67 billion, including $15 billion in debt. The moves comes three months after a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report) agreed to buy the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), for $207 per share or $69 billion (read: 4 ETFs to Gain From CVS-Aetna Deal).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Cigna will pay $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the newly combined company. Upon closure, Cigna shareholders will own approximately 64% of the combined company.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' healthcare needs, ranging from sale of drugs to insurance cover. It would benefit consumers by bringing together the medical care and pharmacy benefits at one roof to improve treatments and lower costs.The combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit, and CVS after it completes its merger with Aetna. The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion in the world of pharmacy business. The e-commerce giant recently announced a joint venture with JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) in order to curb medical costs for their employees.The transaction would result in total cost synergies of $650 million and double-digit accretion to earnings in the first year after it closes. As a result, Cigna expects the deal to increase earnings per share from $18 to $20-$21 in 2021. The deal is expected to close by Dec 31, 2018 and is subject to approval from shareholders of both companies and anti-trust regulatory approvals (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).ETF ImpactThe announced merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CI-ESRX deal.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment.

The fund has amassed $493.7 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 24,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook (read: Trump's 2019 Budget Blueprint: ETF Winners & Losers).SPDR S&P Health Care Services ETF (XHS  -  Free Report)The fund uses an equal-weight methodology to each security by tracking the S&P Health Care Services Select Industry Index.

1404,CVS,"The grocery and drug store industries are about to witness further consolidation with the country’s largest grocer Albertsons Companies proposing to buy the distressed drugstore retailer, Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report). This deal can be Albertsons’ and Rite Aid’s latest effort to dispel the fear of competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).Though Rite Aid’s shares reacted positively to the news in the pre-market trading session on Feb 20, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has declined 11.8% in the last two days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Overall, Rite Aid has gained 19.5% in the last three months, against the industry’s decline of 0.8%.The DealPer the deal, Rite Aid shareholders have the choice to opt for Albertsons’ shares and cash or only the company’s shares. For every 10 Rite Aid shares, shareholders can get one Albertsons share and $1.83 in cash or 1.079 Albertsons shares. Consequently, Rite Aid shareholders will own about 28-29.6% stake in the combined company, subject to the outcome of the cash elections. Further, Albertsons’ shareholders will own nearly 70.4-72% stake in the combined company.Depending on the results of the cash election, Rite Aid is likely to be valued at $1.30-2.65 per share under the sale agreement. The combined company is expected to generate annual revenues of about $83 billion. Further, the new entity anticipates delivering annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million in three years. Of these, the companies expect to realize nearly 60% of the cost synergies in the first two years after closing the transaction. Additionally, the companies anticipate identifying about $3.6 billion of potential revenue opportunities. Albertsons’ proposal is backed by investments from Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., along with Kimco Realty Corporation; Klaff Realty, L.P.; Lubert-Adler Partners, L.P. and Schottenstein Stores Corporation.Following the completion of the merger, the combined company will be steered by John Standley as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He is currently the Chairman and CEO of Rite Aid. Further, Albertsons’ current Chairman and CEO, Bob Miller will serve as the Chairman of the new company. With leadership from executives of both companies, the combined entity will have dual headquarters at Boise, Idaho and Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. The name for the new company will be decided as the transaction nears closure. Further, the new company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year.Albertsons currently operates about 2,300 supermarket stores and nearly 1,800 pharmacies. Meanwhile, Rite Aid has 2,569 drug stores in operation, following the sale of 1,932 pharmacies to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) for $4.38 billion.Together, the new company will operate about 4,900 locations including 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington D.C. The company will serve more than 40 million customers per week. The companies plan to re-banner most of the Albertsons pharmacies to Rite Aid Stores following the completion of the transaction, while Rite Aid will continue to operate its stand-along pharmacies.The merger has been approved by the board of directors of both companies. Further, it is expected to be closed by the second half of calendar year 2018, conditioned upon receipt of approval from Rite Aid shareholders and other regulatory and customary closing conditions.Industry Background & Threat of AmazonMajority of the recent consolidation in the grocery and drugstore industries has been trying to fend off rising competition due to the entry of Amazon in these segments. While Amazon’s entry in the grocery industry was marked by the recent acquisition of Whole Foods, the company recently teamed up with Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.  and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) forming a non-profit company providing healthcare solutions to its employees. This has perked up the drugstore industry’s concerns regarding the e-commerce giant’s entry in the healthcare business.Further, this threat comes at a time when the drug industry is dealing with challenges like weak reimbursement rates and lower generic drug prices. As the industry players look to cut down costs, the industry continues to witness soft traffic and sales at front-end stores for the last several years. The consequences of these challenges are clearly visible in Rite Aid’s tepid profits in the last two years.A few more instances of recent consolidation in the drugstore industry are CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) deal to acquire Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) in January 2018, as well as Walgreens’ bid to buy AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC  -  Free Report), a leading drug wholesale company.More Stock News: This is Bigger Than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1405,CVS,"On Feb 13, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industry over the past year. The stock has lost 12.2% compared with the broader industry’s 18% decline.Notably, CVS Health exited the fourth quarter of 2017 on a solid note with both earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Year-over-year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, which in turn benefited from an upside in the Specialty Pharmacy. Investors are hopeful about the company expected to earn $750 million drawn from near-term synergies as a result of the Aetna acquisition deal post the transaction’s closure.Per the company, shareholders can look forward to several outcomes with respect to near-term synergy including enhanced competitive positioning and a new combined platform, which might redefine access to high-quality care at low cost, substantially accelerating growth of the consolidated business.We are also upbeat about the company’s strong Pharmacy Services business, which has been flourishing on a solid Specialty Pharmacy subsegment. In fact management stated that the company’s specialty business is its top priority in winning new customers and retaining the old, loyal ones. Accordingly, CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity with wide and differentiated offerings including Specialty Connect.Additionally, management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. Also, the Pharmacy Services segment appears as a stable growth platform.With regard to its 2018 PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season, CVS Health is noted to have progressed well in the fourth quarter. The company boasts gross client wins of approximately $6.2 billion and net new business of $2.4 billion with a client retention rate of about 96.5%. Good news is that the company also advances with its 2019 selling season.Moreover, the company’s strong cash balance allows it to carry out share repurchases.On the flip side, CVS Health’s highly competitive retail pharmacy business is a big concern. Precisely, the company faces some stiff competition in the pharmacy segment due to availability of low-cost pharmacy options and other retail businesses consistently adding pharmacy departments in its portfolio. Particularly, discount retailers have made substantial inroads into gaining a major market share. Moreover, CVS Health has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in the recent past. The company’s decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was dictated by the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps.Stocks Worth a LookSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Centene Corporation (CNC  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc. (ATHN  -  Free Report) and BIOVERATIV Inc. , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Centene has an impressive projected long-term growth rate of 14.6%. The stock has returned 23.2% over the last six months.athenahealth has an expected long-term growth rate of 23.1%. The stock has gained 7.3% over the last three months.BIOVERATIV has an expected long-term growth rate of 14%. The stock has soared 87.2% over the last three months.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1406,CVS,"Per a report in The Wall Street Journal, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is in early-stage talks to buy the remaining stake in the leading pharmaceutical services company, AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report). Soon after the takeover rumor surfaced on Feb 12, shares of AmerisourceBergen gained 15.7% in after-hours trading and subsequently, closed with a 0.3% rise. However, the stock price of Walgreens remained unchanged.In this regard, we remind investors that the drugstore retailer and pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing enterprise already holds a 26% stake in AmerisourceBergen, which is part of their long-term strategic relationship, formed in 2013. That relationship comprises a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract with AmerisourceBergen.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Quote We believe, Walgreen’s latest decision to acquire AmerisourceBergen’s remaining stake, comes close on the heels of its rival CVS Health’s (CVS  -  Free Report) gigantic $69-billion acquisition deal of health insurer, Aetna Inc (AET  -  Free Report). According to a Reuters report, the Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen integration, similar to the CVS-Aetna deal, is likely to move toward a vertical consolidation, combining all members of a supply chain.This apart, some analysts believe that this move may be in response to Amazon’s latest decision to step into the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry. Notably, in December 2017, Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report) had acquired pharmacy licenses in a dozen states.As far as the news revolving around Walgreens-AmerisourceBergen agreement is concerned, many market researchers view this takeover rumor to be strategic, although the companies themselves have remained silent on this speculative issue.Significantly, Walgreens has a market capitalization of $67.82 billion while the same for AmerisourceBergen remains at $19.65 billion.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1407,CVS,"CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) recently announced three major programs that will allow the company to share the tax benefit earned from the implementation of the latest U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with employees. This news comes on the heels of the company’s promising fourth-quarter 2017 results. Along with the results, the company exhibited unwavering commitment toward employees’ welfare.According to management, the improvement in employee wages and benefits totaled $425 million annually. These are long-term and compensation investments, expected to create growth opportunities for the company and its employees.The programs include the following three employee-focused investments:First, CVS Health will lift the starting wage rate to $11 an hour for hourly employees, effective April 2018. With a view to grow its retail stores into a healthcare destination, the company plans to adjust pay ranges and rates for many of its retail pharmacy technicians, front store associates and other hourly retail employees later this year. CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus  CVS Health Corporation Price and Consensus | CVS Health Corporation Quote Second, the company wishes to consistently offer affordable healthcare services to workers by not increasing employee premiums for 2018-19, despite a 5% year-over-year rise in medical and prescription costs. CVS Health will absorb the entire increase for the 100,000 employees who are part of the company-sponsored health plan.Finally, a new paid parental leave plan will be put into effect starting April 1, 2018, for full-time employees. Per management, an employee who welcomes a new child can take up to four weeks away from work at 100% of their pay, so as to ensure proper care of the newborn.Additionally, management indicated that it will put the remaining benefits earned from tax savings back into the business. The company expects to channelize this money toward data analytics, care management solutions and store service, in order to improve health outcomes, reduce cost for patients and also debt reduction related to the planned acquisition of Aetna.Recent AccoladesRecently, CVS Health has been recognized as one of the World’s Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine. The company was honored as No. 39 on corporate rankings, up six spots from the previous year in terms of corporate performance and reputation and ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of services, management, innovation and social responsibility.Price PerformanceOver the last six months, CVS Health has outperformed the industry.

1408,CVS,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.92 were up 12.3% year over year. The adjusted EPS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. This one-time adjustment excludes the impact of a $1.5 billion income tax benefit resulting from the latest tax reform.Reported EPS from continuing operations came in at $3.22 per share, a 102.5% surge from the year-ago period.Full-year 2017 adjusted EPS came in at $5.90, a 1% improvement from the year-ago adjusted number.Net revenues in the fourth quarter increased 5.3% year over year to $48.39 billion, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%.CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteRevenues for the year 2017 were $184.77 billion, a 4.1% improvement from 2016. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $183.88 billion.Quarter in DetailsPharmacy Services revenues increased 9.3% to $34.2 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes, higher pharmacy network volumes as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and continued price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8.2% to 389.7 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 69 million, up 5.9% on a 30-day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC were up by a marginal 0.3% year over year to $20.9 billion. According to the company, a 2.5% increase in same store prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 0.7% year over year but were positively impacted 80 basis points by seasonal cough and cold. Front-store sales were adversely affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales increased 0.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were adversely affected by approximately 340 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320-bps negative impact on same-store prescription volumes in the reported quarter.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) increased approximately 80 bps to 86.9% at the Pharmacy Services segment and around 160 bps to 86.8% at the Retail/LTC segment.Gross profit improved 3.9% to $7.9 billion. However, gross margin contracted 21 bps to 16.3%. Total operating margin in the quarter declined 10 bps to 6.4%.CVS Health exited the year 2017 with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.81 billion compared with $3.45 billion at the end of 2016. Full-year, net cash provided by operating activities was $8 billion, down 21% from the year-ago period.During the fourth quarter, CVS Health opened 65 new retail stores and closed 13 and relocated five retail locations. As of Dec 31, 2017, CVS Health operated 9,803 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.OutlookThe company has revised its outlook for 2018. The revision reflects the effects of the tax reform achieved through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).Management noted that, with $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the TCJA, the company will be able to make strategic investments in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term.Accordingly, the company has increased its 2018 adjusted operating profit growth guidance to a range of 1% to 4% from the earlier-stated range of (1.5%) to 1.5%.Earlier, while providing its 2018 initial outlook, CVS Health noted that, it expects to deliver net revenue growth of 0.75% to 2.5% in the year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full-year revenues is pegged at $188.04 billion.For the first quarter of 2018, the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0.5% to 4.5%.Our TakeCVS Health ended the year 2017 on a solid note with a better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance. The year-over-year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the specialty services. However, year-over-year Retail/LTC comparisons were dull.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCVS Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks that reported solid results this earnings season are PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), PerkinElmer (PKI  -  Free Report) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX  -  Free Report).

1410,CVS,"In some market shaking news, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced that they are partnering with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway  and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) to build a healthcare company in order to cut costs for their U.S. employees and improve worker satisfaction.As a result, shares of health sector companies are sliding in intraday trading. Insurance players like Anthem (ANTM  -  Free Report), Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), and Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) are all down between 2.5%-5.5%, while pharmacy giants CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), and Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) each dipped around 5%. Pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX  -  Free Report) is down nearly 6% as well.The goal of the partnership is to create a company with the sole intention of providing healthcare for its workforce, and the future entity will not aim to make a profit, but instead focus on the technology that will provide “simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare.”Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan said that the kind of healthcare to be provided to employees will be long-term, and that they hope to bypass the frustration associated with securing healthcare from a third-party provider who is ultimately concerned with their own bottom line.“The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” said Berkshire Chairman and CEO Buffett. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.”Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said that “Hard as [forming a new healthcare company] might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,” while JPMorgan’s chief executive Jamie Dimon said the ultimate goal is to “create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.”There have been rumors of an Amazon entry into the pharmacy business for a while now—that so-called Amazon Effect—so this announcement is not entirely a surprise. The healthcare company is still in the “early planning” stages, though there is a temporary management team in place with leaders from each organization.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

1411,CVS,"Dow futures have rocketed up more than 200 points in this morning’s pre-market on news that the Senate has passed its version of a tax reform bill in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The corporate tax rate shedding 15 percentage points — 35% to 20% — is one of the main items the Senate version shares with the House bill, which now faces reconciliation to make its way to President Trump’s desk, which he would surely sign.Same with the pass-through rate and the elimination of the estate tax. In fact, many of the main tenets of each bill fit together, which should help reconciliation (made necessary because the tax cuts were decided on purely party grounds: no Democrats voted for either bill, with only a few defectors from the GOP voting against). There are still some wrinkles that both sides will need to iron out, but because this is far from a bipartisan effort, common ground should be fairly easy to reach.More difficult will be those who were against the tax bills before they even saw the contents of them. Now that we can all see what’s inside, be prepared to see economists, former Treasury Secretaries, etc. to voice their opposition. Republican representatives of “blue” states — those which tend to follow Democratic policies which generally include higher taxes at state and local levels — should be preparing themselves to hear from their voting constituencies, once these citizens recognize that their taxes are likely to go up, not down.In order to help pay for the big tax cuts, elimination of tax write-offs such as state and local, medical costs and waived college tuition look to add tax burdens on millions of households. At the same time, wiping out the estate tax (dubbed the “death tax” by supporters of the current bills) and the Alternative Minimum Tax appear to be clear handouts to singularly high-wealth individuals. And the drastic corporate tax rate cut will already be a boon to shareholders of publicly traded corporations, another main piece of evidence that these tax reform packages are not aimed at working- and middle-class families, as regularly claimed by supporters, but those much farther up the economic food chain.All this is to say that the hard work may be yet to come. House Representatives and some Senators also face re-election in the coming year; if their voting constituencies see the current tax proposals as being sell-outs to the Wall Street upper class — which Candidate Trump explicitly campaigned against, it is worth noting — they may feel the expressed need to make their displeasure known.Return of the Vertical MergerPharmacy retailer CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) has come to terms to buy managed health care giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) for a cool $69 billion. This move looks to transform the way health care is managed, with agents of the deal calling the timing “perfect.” The idea is that costs for employer-supported healthcare will be more effectively managed by joining the retailer with the coverage. Recall a year ago, when a similarly sized merger between Aetna and competitor Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) — a horizontal merger, not a vertical one — did not pass antitrust regulation. This morning’s vertical arrangement may be seen more palatable by these same regulators.That’s not to say all vertical merger agreements get a free pass: AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) proposal to buy Time Warner  faces litigation from none other that the U.S. Department of Justice. Government antitrust regulators for this $85+ billion deal claim the merger woulds harm competition and raise consumer prices. Yet thus far, we do not hear similar rhetoric from the Justice Department on the CVS-Aetna merger. We will keep our ears and eyes open, going forward.

1412,CVS,"Monday, December 4, 2017Dow futures have rocketed up more than 200 points in this morning’s pre-market on news that the Senate has passed its version of a tax reform bill in the wee hours of Saturday morning. The corporate tax rate shedding 15 percentage points — 35% to 20% — is one of the main items the Senate version shares with the House bill, which now faces reconciliation to make its way to President Trump’s desk, which he would surely sign.Same with the pass-through rate and the elimination of the estate tax. In fact, many of the main tenets of each bill fit together, which should help reconciliation (made necessary because the tax cuts were decided on purely party grounds: no Democrats voted for either bill, with only a few defectors from the GOP voting against). There are still some wrinkles that both sides will need to iron out, but because this is far from a bipartisan effort, common ground should be fairly easy to reach.More difficult will be those who were against the tax bills before they even saw the contents of them.

1413,CVS,"Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) will soon be acquired by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), per a definitive merger agreement.This mega-merger between a pharmacy health care provider, CVS and an insurance company, Aetna, is expected to close in the second half of 2018. Valued at nearly $69 billion, the deal is subject to approval by shareholders of both the companies, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.Notably, the merger-agreement has a greater probability of getting an approval from the regulators since it will be a vertical integration as compared to the horizontal combination (which was feared to create a monopoly in the market and stifle healthy competition among rivals, if passed) of Aetna-Humana Inc. (HUM) deal, which was inked earlier this year.Additionally, the deal seems to be encouraging as it would result in a deadly combination of Aetna’s strong position and its expertise in the health benefits space coupled with CVS’ deep knowledge of the consumers and its leading position in the pharmacy benefits market.This combined entity is anticipated to create a mammoth healthcare set-up with wide-ranging operations from sale of drug to insurance cover.What’s in Store for Aetna?The deal will add to Aetna’s scale and size, and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies in a better way. Consequently, this would lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs, thereby enabling the company to share the savings with its consumers through more customer-friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium. This, in turn, might ultimately lead to market-share gain.So far this year, the stock has surged 45%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 42%.Gain for ShareholdersAetna shareholders will receive attractive value from the transaction, including $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 shares of CVS Health common stock. Also, approximately 22% of the combined company will be owned by them. Consequently, these shareholders will be able to be a part of the success and high growth potential of the combined company in the near term.Shareholders will benefit from deal which should result in enhanced competitive positioning, low- to mid-single digit accretion in 2019 including the ability to deliver $750 million in near-term synergies.Consolidation in the Health Care SpaceMergers and acquisition (both horizontal and vertical) in the space is rife, given the necessity of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry.  Such deals (pharmacy benefit managers with insurance companies) are the need of the hour at the backdrop of a changing industry, which is rapidly seeing a rise in consumerism.Also, the increased incidence of specialty drugs that are paid through medical and not pharmacy benefit organizations, necessitates the coming together of medical and pharmacy benefit companies.The takeover of Catamaran by UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report) back in 2015 was in line with this trend.Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider  Aetna carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Triple-S Management Corp. (GTS  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1414,CVS,"After weeks of speculation, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) announced its decision to acquire Aetna (AET  -  Free Report), one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits companies. The cash and stock deal will see Aetna shareholders receive $145 per share in cash and 0.8378 CVS Health shares for each Aetna share with Aetna being valued at approximately $207 per share or about $69 billion ($77 billion including the assumption of Aetna's debt).News about a possible merger between the pharmacy giant and the health insurer had surfaced in late October when the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks with CVS proposing to pay more than $200 per share for the acquisition.With this deal, slated to go through in the second half of 2018, the companies are looking to change the healthcare landscape. The announcement comes at a time when insurers are under pressure to cut medical costs while companies like CVS are facing the prospect of fierce competition especially given the rumors about tech giant, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), planning an entry in this space. While there’s low visibility on how Amazon expects to enter this market, its potential entry poses a major threat for retail pharmacy chains like CVS. By merging with Aetna, CVS would be able to strengthen its position in the pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") business with a wider coverage.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) provide a wide range of services including formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management.A key responsibility is the negotiation of prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Formulary coverage and exclusion lists are issued by PBMs to keep consumers aware of drugs that are covered without extra out-of-pocket costs being incurred.  Clients include insurance companies with the focus being on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. By merging with Aetna, CVS will be able to expand coverage to the full ambit of healthcare including the medical benefits space. The combined company is also expected to be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. Moreover, Aetna’s insurance plans could help boost coverage and diversify CVS’s business.The combined company should be well-positioned to meet the health needs of many more people, especially the 50% of Americans with chronic conditions that account for more than 80% of all health care costs. Moreover, CVS Pharmacy locations will add additional products and services including space for wellness, clinical and pharmacy services, vision, hearing, nutrition, beauty, and medical equipment. Post-merger, CVS will find itself in the positon of an integrated retailer, pharmacy benefits manager and health plan provider.What Next?Of late, insurers and PBMs have been coming together especially if one keeps in mind the UnitedHealth-OptumRx combination. Given the changing healthcare scenario and the demand for more transparency where drug pricing is concerned, there could be more such mergers round the corner.Meanwhile, all eyes are focused on Amazon and its plans to enter the healthcare sector. Just last week, a CNBC report said that Amazon is in preliminary discussions with generic drugmakers including Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Novartis’s generic arm, Sandoz, about entering the pharmacy market. There has also been news about Amazon having obtained wholesale distribution licenses from the pharmaceutical boards of certain states. With not much information being available, there is a lot of speculation and discussion among industry watchers about the way the tech giant is planning to enter the market – as a drug wholesaler or a retailer.CVS and Aetna are both Zacks Rank#3 (Hold) stocks.

1415,CVS,"Health insurer Aetna Inc.’s (AET  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter earnings of $1.25 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Earnings, however, declined 23% from the prior-year quarter.The decline in earnings was primarily due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in Aetna's Health Care segment and targeted investment spending on growth initiatives. These were to some extent offset by lower losses in the company’s individual commercial products.Weak RevenuesAetna recorded revenues of $14.74 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.89 billion. Also, revenues compared unfavorably with the year-ago number of $15.72 billion. The downside was primarily due to lower premiums in Aetna's Health Care segment, including lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, and the temporary suspension of the Health Insurer Fee  (HIF) in 2017.Total expense ratio of 20.5% declined 240 basis points year over year. Pre-tax margin of 4.8% decreased 160 basis points year over year.The company’s total enrollment decreased to 49.4 million from 52.79 million in the year-ago quarter.Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Aetna Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Aetna Inc. QuoteSegmental Performance UpdateHealth CareAdjusted revenues were $14.5 billion, down 4% year over year. The downside was due to lower membership in Aetna's ACA compliant individual and small group products, lower membership in Medicaid products and the temporary suspension of the HIF. This was somewhat offset by higher premium yields in Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in Medicare products.Pre-tax adjusted earnings were $662 million, down 31.3% year over year due to lower favorable development of prior-period health care costs estimates, higher targeted investment spending on Aetna's growth initiatives and the negative impact of the temporary suspension of the HIF in 2017, partially offset by reduced losses in Aetna's individual commercial products.Total healthcare medical benefit ratio (MBR) rose 220 basis points year over year to 84.3% due to deterioration in Commercial and Government benefit ratios.Group InsuranceDuring the fourth quarter, the company completed the sale of a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses.This sale adversely impacted the quarter’s revenues and pre-tax adjusted earnings of $237 million and $16 million, respectively, which were down 61.8% and 57%, respectively.Large Case PensionsAdjusted revenues came at $71 million, up 11% year over year led by higher premiums in fourth-quarter 2017.Financial PositionTotal assets were $55.1 billion as of Dec 31, 2017, down 20% year over year.Long-term debt declined 57% year over year to $8.2 billion.Debt-to-capitalization ratio was 37% of Dec 31, 2017 compared with 53.6% as of Dec 31, 2016.Business UpdateDuring the quarter, the company sold a substantial portion of its Group Insurance segment consisting of its domestic group life insurance, group disability insurance and absence management businesses through an indemnity reinsurance arrangement. The sale is expected to result in an after-tax gain of approximately $710 million ($1.1 billion pretax).Also, Aetna entered into an agreement, in the quarter, to be acquired by CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report) for nearly $69 billion.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018.Zacks Rank, Peer Performance, Upcoming ReleaseAetna currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1416,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.7%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 2.7%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsCVS Health is optimistic about sustaining the solid year-over-year earnings trend in 2017 on gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The performance is being driven by higher specialty pharmacy and pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation. Management stated that the company’s specialty business is its top priority in gaining new and retaining existing customers. CVS Health is poised to capitalize on this opportunity on the back of wide and differentiated offerings, including Specialty Connect.Management expects drug price inflation, product launches, higher utilization and new PBM clients to fuel growth. We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform.In this regard, we are also impressed with CVS Health’s robust PBM selling season, reflecting solid progress from last quarter. While gross new business totaled $6 billion, net new business reached $2.3 billion. These figures take into account the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract loss but exclude the impact from individual Medicare Part D program. CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteHowever, increased generic dispensing and price compression have been partially offsetting growth in this space. Moreover, there are several timing factors that have affected the cadence of profit delivery last quarter. One such aspect was the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business. Per the company, the same is expected to continue through the fourth-quarter as well.Largely due to weaker margin performance in the PBM client and retail network claims administration process, CVS Health now expects adjusted operating profit growth in mid-teens at the Pharmacy Services segment for fourth-quarter 2017 and around 4% for full-year 2017.Apart from the timing of Medicare Part D profitability, the company expects higher benefits from the streamlining initiatives in the back half of the year. Taking that into consideration, the company projected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share and consolidated operating profit growth at the low end of the $1.88-$1.92 and 5.75-8% range, respectively.Here are some other factors that might also influence CVS Health’s fourth-quarter results:The company maintains fourth-quarter operating loss projection for its Retail/LTC segment at the low end of the 1.0% to 3.5% range, largely due to restricted network changes. Notably, the decision to restrict CVS Health from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks have continued to affect Pharmacy sales and script comps. Moreover, total same-store sales are expected to decline 1-2.8% in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.However, the company has been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that CVS Health is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share. The company’s tie-up with OptumRx, part of UnitedHealth Group (UNH  -  Free Report), to provide a 90-day Pharmacy solution to OptumRx commercial clients was made available at the beginning of last July. CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card.The company is planning to collaborate with PBMs (Pharmacy Benefit Management) and health plans to offer a menu of services such as MinuteClinic services, Infusion and Long Term Care. Also, Store Brands is an area of both strength and opportunity for CVS Health. The company’s latest initiatives like next-day and same-day delivery and automatic refills of prescriptions with a text message also seem promising.Notably, for the fourth quarter, the company’s adjusted script comps are expected to rise 1-2%.CVS Health has projected a 2.5-4.25% rise in consolidated net revenues during the fourth quarter. Specialty business is expected to record strong growth and the SilverScript business is likely to maintain momentum. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues of $47.58 billion reflects a 3.5% increase year over year.Aetna Deal: The company’s latest announcement to buy all outstanding shares of a diversified health care benefits company — Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) — in a total transaction value of $77 billion is also encouraging. On the deal’s closure (expected in the second half of 2018), CVS Health estimates $750 million of near-term synergies with low to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post the completion of the transaction.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  CVS Health has an Earnings ESP of -0.13%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CVS Health carries a Zacks Rank #3.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of $1.89 billion reflects a 10.5% increase year over year.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to beat earnings this time around:Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +194.12% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1417,CVS,"Consumer analytics firm Nielsen (NLSN  -  Free Report) just released its second-ever online food shopping study, which found that the industry Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and meal-kit delivery companies such as Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) helped popularize is set to grow into a $100 billion market soon.On Monday, Nielsen, in partnership with the Food Marketing Institute, released its “Digitally Engaged Food Shopper” study. The joint venture found that within as few as five to seven years, 70% of all U.S. consumers are expected to buy at least a portion of their groceries online.Previously, Nielsen and FMI projected it would take the U.S. online grocery business until 2025 to reach the $100 billion milestone. “The grocery industry is currently in the age of digital experimentation, where the roadmap on how to navigate and achieve real and profitable growth continues to evolve,” Nielsen executive Chris Morley said in a statement.The Digitally Engaged Food Shopper study found that the online grocery industry is set to expand rapidly, but investors should know that it is already widely popular in the U.S. CNBC noted that 49% of all U.S. shoppers bought a packaged good online within the last three months.Looking at the generational breakdown, 61% of Millennials purchased at least some type of grocery item online, while 44% of Baby Boomers also joined the new online shopping trend.This growth hardly comes as a shock to many investors and certainly won’t surprise many retailers. In fact, over the last year, big-box giants Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) have attempted to bolster their online grocery businesses in order to better compete with Amazon.Looking ahead, grocery companies such as Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) will likely invest more money in online ordering technologies and infrastructure.On top of investments from industry giants, grocery delivery startups such as Instacart have become popular in cities around the country. Now, as Instacart partners with everyone from Petco to CVS (CVS  -  Free Report), investors might see more shake-ups and mergers akin to Amazon’s Whole Foods purchase sooner than later.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1418,CVS,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced on Thursday that it had officially narrowed the list of candidates for its second headquarters down to 20, eliminating the vast majority of the reported 238 applicants and brining the remaining cities one step closer to the 50,000 jobs promised by the e-commerce behemoth.Not surprisingly, Amazon’s shortlist includes several locations in the Midwest and South and on the East Coast. The list shies away from tech-heavy West Coast hubs, but it does include one major Californian metropolitan area. Here’s a snapshot of the finalists’ locations:(Credit: Amazon.com)“Thank you to all 238 communities that submitted proposals. Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough – all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,” said Holly Sullivan, Amazon’s head of economic development, in a press release. “Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation.”Amazon provided no further details on why each city was selected, other than to say it based its choices on the criteria announced at the beginning of the search, which included a metropolitan area of more than one million and an ability to attract top technical talent.  Company officials will now work more directly with finalist cites. Amazon is expected to select a winner later this year. It is unclear exactly how the next phase of this process will look for these local governments, but judging by the very public displays many put on during the application process, it should be entertaining at the least.It will also be interesting to see whether local businesses step up their marketing efforts. The announcement of Amazon’s shortlist brings our attention to the “secret” winners of HQ2—potential partner corporations that will benefit from having Amazon as a neighbor without having to foot the bill for the company’s sure-to-be lavish demands.One example would be Red Hat (RHT  -  Free Report), an open-source software and enterprise IT company based in Raleigh, North Carolina. The company has a strategic partnership with Amazon’s Web Services unit and is rapidly growing its cloud offerings. Raleigh hits on several other key requirements, including its close proximity to top schools like Duke and UNC, but the presence of Red Hat is almost certainly a factorSeveral other locations look attractive for strategic reasons. Whole Foods Market, the organic grocery chain Amazon shelled out $14 billion for last year, is headquartered in downtown Austin, Texas. Bringing HQ2 to Austin could mean that Amazon wants the new location to be the center of its budding grocery business.We also know that Amazon has reportedly considered expanding into pharmacy operations. Well, Walgreens (WBA  -  Free Report) is based in Deerfield, Illinois—less than an hour outside of shortlist city Chicago. Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) is headquartered about two hours away from Philadelphia, while CVS (CVS  -  Free Report) finds itself slightly over an hour’s drive from Boston.There is no indication that Amazon is interested in working directly with any of these companies, let alone willing to move HQ2 to a nearby city in order to make that partnership work. And in today’s world, one would hardly need to be located near another business to join forces on a specific project.But proximity still matters to some, and it will be interesting to see whether any of these brands open their arms to Amazon—or reject the company’s advances altogether.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware, which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1419,CVS,"Fred’s Inc  has been going off the rails as the company continues to witness sluggish comparable store sales (comps). Shares of this discount retailer, specializing in general and pharmacy products, has plunged close to 76% in a year against the industry’s gain of 18.6%.What’s Troubling the Stock?Fred’s has been carrying out store closures for a while, which has been negatively impacting comps. In fact, declining store traffic led to the closure of 39 stores during first-quarter 2017. Additionally, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and continued increase in generic dispensing rate have been bruising Fred’s comps for a while. Persistent challenges in the front store business and competitive consumable categories have also affected overall sales figures.Thanks to such downsides, comps dipped 1.2%, 0.3% and 0.8% during the first, second and third quarters, respectively. Also, the top- and bottom-line results declined year on year and lagged estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Incidentally, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has been reporting bottom-line losses for six straight quarters. In addition to dismal comps, increased promotional activity to drive store traffic has been denting business. Moreover, the company’s business expansion plans were eclipsed by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. If the deal were to materialize, it would have positioned Fred’s as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). However, obstacles such as antitrust concerns cancelled the deal and kept Fred’s far behind industry leaders.To the disappointment of investors, management cancelled quarterly cash dividend, alongside third-quarter results. The company expects that the cancelled dividend plan will aid share repurchases. Also, the company will be able to invest in strategic developments to induce efficiency in operations. However, with strategies falling apart and a tumbling pharmacy business, hopes of revival seem low for this drug-store retailer.  Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1420,CVS,"Observing the growing awareness on Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) worldwide and with the industry introducing advanced treatment options, CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) has recently launched a program on RA. Known as Transform Rheumatoid Arthritis Care, this newfangled initiative claims to be helpful for the company’s pharmacy benefit management (PBM) clients for better care and cost management of RA.Per management, this latest RA offering will be accretive to the company’s condition-specific, highly personalized Transform Care programs. This will further add value-based management strategies including outcomes based contracts and indication-based formulary for autoimmune conditions to CVS Health's integrated pharmacy care model. Notably, RA is an autoimmune disease causing chronic inflammation of the joints and other areas of the body (as per medicinenet). CVS Health has stated that this complex physical condition is now a top driver of specialty drug trend for PBM clients. On a positive note, the cost and utilization of drugs to treat RA are a top drug trend and spend driver, accounting for nearly half of overall specialty drug trends. Per CVS Health, this new multi-pronged approach propels a trend guarantee based on the program's ability to improve both clinical care and cost management for RA. Besides, this integrated pharmacy care model will help the company provide personalized, whole-patient support through specialty pharmacy and embedded AccordantCare nurses. The Transform RA Care program is aiding an appropriate use of lower-cost therapies through pharmacy network and utilization management tools along with value-based management strategies. Per the company’s prediction, clients enrolled in the Transform RA Care program could expect to see up to 5% savings on their annual RA drugs spend.  Significantly, the burden of RA is considerable. Per the Global Data report, the RA space across eight major markets of the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Japan and Australia is set to expand to around $28.5 billion by 2025 from $19.5 billion in 2015, representing a CAGR of 3.9%. According to CVS Health, RA is the second most common form of arthritis, impacting more than 1.5 million people in the United States. Further, the treatment process is complex. Statistics show that approximately a quarter of patients on an autoimmune drug discontinues the therapy within 180 days, which may lead to poor health outcomes as well as higher costs for payors and members. We believe this latest program from the CVS Health stable will acquire a huge customer acceptance. In fact it effectively targets all the complications of RA treatment procedure.Share Price Performance  This leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care has been outperforming the broader industry over the past six months.

1422,CVS,"Fred’s Inc  is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 6, before the opening bell.We note that Fred’s delivered losses in the past five quarters. Further, the company has been struggling with murky comparable-store sales (comps).While the company has a mixed record of bottom-line surprises in the trailing four quarters, let’s look into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 is pegged at a loss of 15 cents, which has widened by a penny over the past 30 days. However, estimated loss for the quarter under review is lower than the prior year adjusted loss of 27 cents.Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $500.5 million, down 3.1% from the year-ago period.Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fred's, Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Fred’s has been delivering dismal comps since past many quarters, owing to declining traffic trends, sale of low productive discontinued inventory and rise in generic dispensing rate. Additionally, the company’s store expansion plans were gravely impacted by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger in June 2017. Had the deal materialized, Fred’s would have emerged as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).We note that comparable store sales dipped 1.2% and 0.3% during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017. The company’s weak comps trend is likely to continue in the third quarter as well.Nevertheless, Fred’s has been advancing with initiatives to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses and boost free cash flow. Further, the company has been trying to organize pharmacy business to drive scripts into the stores and improve service to its patients. Although such efforts seem promising, they are yet to bear significant impacts upon the company’s performance.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fred’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Fred’s carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

1424,CVS,"McKesson Corp. (MCK  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has entered into an agreement to buy RxCrossroads from CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report). RxCrossroads is a provider of tailored services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers. The transaction is valued at $735 million. The deal will be entirely funded by cash on hand. The acquisition is expected to close in fourth-quarter 2017.We believe that the buyout will enhance McKesson's existing commercialization solutions for manufacturers of branded, specialty, generic and biosimilar drugs, including comprehensive patient support services, custom pharmacy solutions and third-party logistics. This would also allow the company to expand end-to-end offerings for manufacturers. RxCrossroads will become part of the company's Specialty Health business. McKesson expects this transaction to prove accretive to adjusted earnings per share by approximately 20 cents within the third year following the close of the transaction.In recent times, McKesson has been witnessing increased price competition in the independent retail pharmacy channel, which eventually resulted in reduced volumes. The company continues to face market competition for selling generic pharmaceuticals in the United States. However, the company expects to overcome the independent pharmacy sell-side pricing impact by the end of 2018. Furthermore, cutthroat competition in the niche markets, currency headwinds and reimbursement issues remain challenges.In the last three months, McKesson has been trading below the industry. The company has lost 14.0% as against the industry’s gain of 1.8%. The current level is also lower than the S&P 500’s rally of only 4.7%.  Zacks Rank and Key PicksCurrently, McKesson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Inogen Inc. (INGN  -  Free Report) and Luminex Corporation (LMNX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1425,CVS,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.50 declined from the year-ago figure of $1.64. However, adjusted EPS beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.The year-over-year decline in earnings was due to disappointing Retail/LTC numbers as well as lower margins.Without one-time adjustments, EPS from continuing operations in the third quarter came in at $1.26, down from $1.43 in the prior-year quarter.CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteNet revenues in the quarter increased 3.5% year over year to $46.18 billion, almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong revenue growth in the Pharmacy Services segment was partially offset by a decline in Retail/LTC revenues in the quarter.Quarter in DetailsPharmacy Services revenues increased 8.1% to $32.89 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in specialty pharmacy volumes, higher pharmacy network claim volumes as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 8.3% to 374.2 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 66.9 million, up 6.1% on a 30-day equivalent basis on continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC dropped 2.7% year over year to $19.59 billion, primarily due to a 3.2% decrease in same-store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 2.8% year over year. Front-store sales were affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales also declined 3.4% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 435 basis points (bps) due to recent generic drug introductions. Also, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes inched up 0.3% on a 30-day equivalent basis. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 420-bps negative impact on same-store prescription volumes.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) increased approximately 100 bps to 87% at the Pharmacy Services segment and around bps to 87.2% at the Retail/LTC segment.Gross profit dropped 4.9% to $7.12 billion and gross margin contracted 140 bps to 15.4%. Total operating margin in the quarter declined 93 bps to 5.4%.CVS Health exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.56 billion compared with $2.16 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.14 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago period.During the third quarter, CVS Health opened 56 new retail stores and shut five retail locations. Further, the company relocated five retail stores. As of Sep 30, 2017, CVS Health operated 9,751 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.2017 OutlookCVS Health has narrowed its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $5.87-$5.91 from the earlier band of $5.83-$5.93.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.88 is within the guided range. However, full-year operating cash flow guidance has been reiterated at the range of $7.7-$8.6 billion and free cash flow at the band of $6.0-$6.4 billion.For the fourth quarter, the company expects adjusted EPS of $1.88-$1.92. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is pegged at $1.91, within the company’s projection.Our TakeCVS Health exited the third quarter on a solid note. However, weak year-over-year Retail/LTC comparisons along with margin decline resulted in a dull earnings performance.Nonetheless, the year-over-year growth in the top line was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the specialty services.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCVS Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Luminex Corp. (LMNX  -  Free Report) and Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG  -  Free Report). Notably, PetMed and Luminex sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Intuitive Surgical carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1426,CVS,"We’ve got another busy week in store: more Q3 earnings and economic data, Republicans in U.S. Congress get busy working through the details of its massive tax reform program and the arrest in Saudi Arabia of a man known as “the Warren Buffett of the Middle East” are all grabbing headlines this morning. And we also see what appears to be a hostile bid by Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) to take over Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share, or $130 billion, including $60 billion in cash and Qualcomm debt.Should this merger deal be accepted, it would be the largest pure-tech deal in history, which would be accretive to Broadcom after the first year of the merge. But odds are very good Qualcomm will reject this proposal; though the company has acknowledged it has received the offer but given no indications that its board will find the terms favorable. Considering Qualcomm’s recent difficulties as a supplier of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) products, some may see this as Broadcom moving at a very advantageous time.Reports this morning are that Qualcomm officials are openly questioning the initial asking price, as well as antitrust issues, in what is understood to be an initially negative reaction. And would Apple’s involvement — behind the scenes, perhaps — somehow manage to facilitate this deal down the road in a way that puts Qualcomm’s issues with Apple behind them? One thing is for sure: this is a discussion just warming up; we expect to hear much more about this proposed deal throughout the rest of this week and beyond.Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, reportedly facing money laundering charges following a corruption purge by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, may cause some ripples through the U.S. markets this morning — especially in two of al-Waleed’s major holdings, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). Questions regarding Middle Eastern countries surrounding and necessarily affected by the crown prince’s moves, such as rival major power in the region, Iran, and Lebanon, which has had its own issues with stability at the top recesses of government.Futures in U.S. markets are so far shaking all of this off. We are in the green again this morning, following 8 straight weeks of an up-market. As we’ve discussed before here and elsewhere, at least some of this positive sentiment is a result of hopefulness that corporate tax cuts will create new windfalls for companies and their shareholders, perhaps even before the year is out.Q3 Earnings UpdateCVS Pharmacy (CVS  -  Free Report) beat estimates by a penny to $1.50 per share this morning, on in-line quarterly sales of $46.18 billion. Earnings are down year over year, but revenues were up 3.5%. CVS also upped its earnings guidance for full-year 2017.Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) well outperformed expectations before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.33 per share easily surpassing the 83 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 37% year over year. Fiscal Q2 2018 sales of $1.147 billion topped the $1.046 billion we had been expecting. Guidance for both fiscal Q3 and full-year 2018, on both top and bottom lines, were also raised.Mylan Pharma (MYL  -  Free Report), however, missed expectations on both earnings and revenues, with $1.10 per share short of the $1.22 we were looking for, and $3.0 billion in sales beneath the $3.08 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Weaker-than-expected performance in North America, underscored by a fall in EpiPen sales in the quarter, were cited in the company’s report.

1429,CVS,"CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 3.7%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsCVS Health is optimistic about sustaining a solid year-over-year earnings trend in 2017 on the back of gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Pharmacy Services segment revenues of $33.1 billion reflects an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.However, there are several timing factors that have already affected the cadence of profit delivery last quarter. One such aspect was the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business. Per the company, the same is expected to continue through the rest of 2017.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer CVS Health, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the period when the risk-sharing corridor is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Hence, any change in any current estimates like utilization, significantly impacts the timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters.The timing of Medicare Part D profitability factor apart, the company expects benefits from enterprise streamlining initiatives to be much more in the back half of the year than the year to date figure. Keeping that in mind, at the last earnings call, the company had projected third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.47-$1.50, reflecting a decline of 2.5% to an increase of 1% year over year.Here are some other factors that might also influence CVS Health’s third-quarter results:The company is worried about its Retail/Long Term Care business, wherein revenues are expected to be down 3.25-5% in the third quarter from the year-ago period due to the restricted network changes. Notably, the decision to restrict CVS Health from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks have continued to negatively impact Pharmacy sales and script comps. Additionally, the company’s adjusted script comps are expected to be in the range of down 0.75% to up 0.25% and the total same-store sales to be down in the 4-5.75% band in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.However, it expects PBM revenues to grow 8.5%-9.75%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes and specialty pharmacy. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Retail Pharmacy segment net revenues of $19.3 billion reflects a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Consolidated net revenues have projected a 2.75-4.25% rise during the third quarter. Overall, the company estimates to deliver healthy PBM growth on a successful PBM selling season.

1430,CVS,"After a deluge of strong earnings reports from tech titans, the biggest story on Wall Street is the potential buyout of Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) by CVS Health Corp (CVS  -  Free Report). This is especially true, as a drug chain and a pharmacy giant CVS has proposed to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna for more than $200 per share, or around $66 billion according to various sources.This would represent the biggest deal of the year and the first tie-up of a retailer, an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager in history. As such, the proposed deal would change the landscape of healthcare business as well as streamline and cut costs in the drug supply chain.The merged company would create a one-stop shop for customers' health care needs, ranging from employer healthcare and government plans to managing benefits and running drug stores. By owning Aetna, CVS will become the first triple healthcare player: a drugstore, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer. It would be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. This is because CVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management business in the United States and often negotiates drug benefits for insurance plans and employers.Additionally, the combined company could pose a bigger threat to UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the largest U.S. health insurer having its own pharmacy benefits unit (read: Ride On UnitedHealth Q3 Strength with These ETFs).The move is also to stave off threats from Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is making huge expansion into the world of pharmaceutical drugs and has already received pharmacy-wholesaler licenses in a dozen states.However, the transaction is expected to attract high antitrust scrutiny because of its sheer size and overlaps in Medicare Part D, a government program to subsidize prescription drug costs. Notably, CVS has a market capitalization of $77.76 billion while AET has a market cap of $53.35 billion. As such, the approval of the transaction might call for certain divestitures of Medicare prescription drug contracts.ETF ImpactThe proposed merger has put the spotlight on a few healthcare and consumer ETFs that could be the best ways for investors to tap the opportunity arising from the CVS-AET deal. These funds have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy), suggesting their outperformance in the coming months.iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (IHF  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the Dow Jones U.S. Select Healthcare Providers Index with exposure to companies that provide health insurance, diagnostics and specialized treatment. In total, the fund holds 45 securities in its basket with Aetna occupying the second position, accounting for 7.3% share. The fund has amassed $482.5 million in its asset base while volume is light at about 26,000 shares per day on average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF (CNSF  -  Free Report)The fund targets companies that have the potential to outperform the broad U.S. consumer staples sector and tracks the MSCI USA Consumer Staples Diversified Multiple-Factor Capped Index. Holding 28 stocks in its basket, CVS Health takes the fifth spot, accounting for 5.8% of the portfolio. In terms of industrial exposure, more than half of the portfolio is dominated by food beverage tobacco while food & staples retailing, and household and personal product take the remainder with a double-digit exposure each. This ETF has attracted $2.5 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of about 200 shares. It charges 35 bps in fees per year.VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the 26 largest retail firms by tracking the MVIS US Listed Retail 25 Index. Of these, CVS takes the sixth position with 5.04% share. The ETF has a certain tilt toward specialty retail, which accounts for 31% of the portfolio with 31%, while Internet direct marketing (22%), hypermarkets (12%), departmental stores (10%), and healthcare services (9%) round off the next four spots. The product has amassed $50.5 million in its asset base and charges 35 bps in annual fees. Volume is light as it exchanges more than 11,000 shares per day (read: Profit from Retailers' Defaults With These ETFs).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1431,CVS,"Pharmacy giant, CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report), has reportedly made an offer to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer Aetna, Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) for more than $66 billion. According to the Wall Street Journal, the companies are in talks and CVS has proposed to pay more than $200 per share for the acquisition.Why Aetna – the Rationale behind the DealCVS is one of the key players in the pharmacy benefit management (""PBM"") business in the United States. Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) provide formulary management, Medicare Part D services, mail order, specialty pharmacy and infusion services, retail pharmacy network management services, prescription management systems, clinical services, disease management services and medical spend management.They negotiate prices with drugmakers looking for additional rebates and discounts so as to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers. Formulary coverage and exclusion lists are issued by PBMs to keep consumers aware of drugs that are covered without extra out-of-pocket costs being incurred.  Clients include insurance companies with the focus being on providing drugs that are beneficial as well as cost-effective. By merging with Aetna, CVS would be able to expand coverage to the full ambit of healthcare including the medical benefits space. The merged company would also be in a better position to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. Moreover, Aetna’s insurance plans could help boost coverage and diversify CVS’s business.The potential Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) threat could be another reason for CVS’s interest in acquiring Aetna. Amazon, which is rumored to be preparing to enter the pharmacy supply channel, would be a formidable competitor for PBMs. While there is not much visibility on how Amazon plans to enter the prescription drugs business, its potential entry poses a major threat for retail pharmacy chains like CVS. By merging with Aetna, CVS would be able to strengthen its position in the PBM business with a wider coverage.Changing the Healthcare IndustryThe merger, if it goes through, would change the healthcare industry the way we know it today. Of late, insurers and PBMs have been coming together especially if one keeps in mind the UnitedHealth-OptumRx combination. Given the changing healthcare scenario, the efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, the uncertainty faced by insurers as the “repeal and replace Obamacare” scenario plays out and the demand for more transparency where drug pricing is concerned, there could be more such mergers round the corner.Of course, it eventually remains to be seen whether the deal actually goes through. The insurance industry has seen quite a few failed deals recently including Aetna’s attempts to acquire Humana and Anthem’s plans to acquire Cigna with both deals running into regulatory roadblocks.  While CVS is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, Aetna is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1432,CVS,"Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), which had quite an eventful journey of late, reported dismal second-quarter fiscal 2018 results last week. Shares of the company have plunged 14% since the company posted a loss, and its top line declined year over year alongside lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The second-quarter outcome came roughly a week after Rite Aid and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) received the Federal Trade Commission’s (‘’FTC’’) nod for their latest pact. The companies have been in talks since October 2015 to engage in a transaction — first a merger, which was terminated on antitrust concerns (this June) and replaced by Walgreens’ bid to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets. Well, the second proposal, which was revised recently — to acquire 250 lesser stores, finally appeased the FTC on Sep 19.All aforementioned actions have taken a toll on investors’ sentiment, as evident from Rite Aid’s year-to-date slump of 76.2%, which is significantly wider than the industry’s 3.7% drop. Let’s delve deeper into Rite Aid’s second-quarter results and see where the company is headed.Q2 in DetailRite Aid posted adjusted loss of 1 cent per share for the second quarter that came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, this compared unfavorably with the year-ago period earnings of 3 cents. Management blamed the miserable performance on a tough reimbursement rate environment, along with the impacts from the amended asset sale deal.Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Rite Aid Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rite Aid Corporation QuoteWhile Rite Aid benefited from a merger termination fee of $325 million that it received from Walgreens, decline in adjusted EBITDA weighed upon its performance.  Furthermore, revenues dropped 4.4% to $7,678.9 million, also falling short of the Zacks Consensus mark of $7,871 million. During the quarter, Retail Pharmacy segment revenues slipped 3.4% on account of soft same store sales and unfavorable reimbursement rates. Moreover, revenues from the Pharmacy Services segment dropped tumbled 8.7% owing to an election to take part in lesser Medicare Part D regions.Same-store sales declined 3.4%, owing to a 4.6% fall in pharmacy sales and 0.9% dip in front-end sales. Pharmacy sales included a negative impact of nearly 189 basis points (bps) from the introduction of new generic drugs. Also, prescription count at comparable stores slipped 1.8%. Prescription sales constituted 67.8% of total drugstore sales and third-party prescription sales accounted for 98.3% of pharmacy sales.Rite Aid’s adjusted EBITDA crashed about 31.8% year over year to $213.3 million, with the respective margin contracting 110 bps. This was due to a fall in adjusted EBITDA contributions from Retail Pharmacy segment mainly owing to reduced reimbursement rate. This was somewhat compensated by efficient cost curtailment and improved scrip counts and generic purchasing efficiencies.Store UpdatesRite Aid continues to renovate stores, with 54 outlets remodeled, 1 opened and 1 relocated in the quarter under review. This brings the company’s total wellness stores count to 2,532. Further, the company shut 17 stores during the quarter, thus taking the total store count to 4,507 as of Sep 2, 2017.Financial StatusRite Aid ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $239 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $7,082.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $733.6 million. The company also had borrowings worth $2.2 billion remaining under its $3.7 billion revolving credit facility, alongside having outstanding letters of credit worth $59 million.Further, Rite Aid’s cash from operating activities came in at $297.8 for the first half of fiscal 2018.Where’s Rite Aid Headed?Per the latest deal with Walgreens, the latter will buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal of around $4.375 billion. Notably, the companies plan to carry out the transition of ownership of stores in a phased manner, beginning in October 2017. The transition is likely to be completed by spring 2018.While the amended contract wasn’t well received by investors as it will curtail Rite Aid’s main business, the transaction is likely to lower Rite Aid’s debt position and improve its financial leverage and balance sheet. Management stated that it intends to use the funds from this deal to pay down a part of its huge debt. In this regard, the company plans to repay roughly $270 million worth of net liabilities associated with the divested assets; restructuring expenses and transaction fees of nearly $100 million and $85 million as income tax.All said, the deal will make the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company a smaller, but stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates, which has been a hindrance for the company for quite some time now. As for Walgreens, with the approval of this long-awaited deal, the company is now poised to dominate the drugstore chain in the United States in terms of size, leaving behind CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). Rite Aid, on the other hand, will occupy the third spot.Still Want Exposure in the Drugstore Segment?Investors can count on Herbalife LTD. (HLF  -  Free Report), which has a splendid earnings surprise history and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1433,CVS,"The retail segment has been witnessing increased competition owing to technological upgradations and continuous expansion efforts by large retailers. Consumers are increasingly shifting toward online shopping, thereby hurting store traffic. As a result, smaller firms in the segment, who are incapable of adapting with such changing trends, have resorted to store closures as consumer footfall continues to decline.Fred's, Inc  is one such company that has resorted to store closures amid such challenging retail scenario. Let’s now delve into some of the aspects that have led to the dismal performance of the company.Declining Comps and Store Closure Fred's has been witnessing sluggish comps, lately, owing to declining store traffic and sale of discontinued inventory. A glance at the comps’ performance over the past four months reveals that, while comps were up 0.8% for during May, the same declined 1.6%, 0.1% and 0.5% during June, July and August, respectively. In fact, the decline in store traffic led to the closure of 39 stores during the first quarter of 2017. Persisting challenges in the Front Store business and competitive consumable categories had also affected the company’s overall sales figures.Cancelled Walgreens-Rite Aid Merger Fred's strategic plans for store expansion were gravely impacted by the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger on June 30. If the deal was to materialize, it would have positioned Fred’s as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). The professional, legal, banking and integration planning fees iincurred in connection with this deal, have become unyielding and hurt the company’s profit reserves.Lack of International Exposure Since the developed markets of Europe, America and Canada are already saturated, most retail companies are looking toward expanding themselves in developing nations such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia, amongst others. These nations offer great growth opportunity owing to rising population and an affluent middle class. Fred’s, however, is yet to strengthen footprint in these markets.Final Thoughts Such ongoing challenges have led Fred’s to deliver weak bottom-line performance over the past five quarters, posting a loss in each of them.Nevertheless, the company has been making significant advancement with its turnaround strategies that aims at reducing selling, general and administrative expenses and driving free cash flow. The turnaround plans also includes focusing on organization of its pharmacy business, to drive scripts into the stores and improve service to its patients. The company has also been emphasizing on internal reorganization and geographic expansion. However, such efforts are yet to bear significant impacts upon the company’s top-line performance.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

1434,CVS,"We issued an updated research on Sanofi, Inc. (SNY  -  Free Report) on Sep 26.Sanofi performed quite well in the first half of 2017. Earnings rose4.9% on a reported basis in the first half of 2017 and 2.7% at constant currency rates (CER) on a year-over-year basis.First halfnet sales rose 8.7% on a reported basis and 5.5% at CER.  In January 2017, Sanofi swapped its Merial Animal Health businesses with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business. Reflecting this exchange and full consolidation of Sanofi’s European vaccines operations, sales rose 2% at constant structure and CER. We remind investors that Sanofi terminated its Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) in Europe in December last year.A strong performance by Genzyme’s Specialty Care (Genzyme) and Vaccines units is making up for accelerated decline in the diabetes franchise to support the top line.In fact, at the second quarter conference call, Sanofi raised its previously issued profit outlook backed by a better-than-expected performance in the first half and cost discipline. However, a tough U.S. payer environment hurt sales in theDiabetesunit.Continued strong performance of the Genzyme unit, especially the multiple sclerosis drugs, Aubagio and Lemtrada, and rare disease drugs like Myozyme/Lumizymeand Fabrazyme is a positive. The Vaccines unit is also expected to perform well. Sales (including emerging markets) rose 14.3% at CER in the Genzyme unit and 24.5% at CER in the Vaccines unit in the first half of 2017.Meanwhile, Sanofi is quite optimistic about the sales prospects of its newly launched drug Dupixent for treating atopic dermatitis. The drug, which was launched in the United States in March 2017, generated sales of €26 million in the second quarter, backed by strong demand. Management was pleased with the drug’s uptake. We are optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company. Other than Dupixent, other new drugs like Kevzara, launched in the U.S. in June 2017,and Soliqua, a once-daily titratable fixed-ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia, launched in the United States in January 2017,should also bring in higher sales in the back half of the year.However, management expects U.S. diabetes franchise sales to decline faster in the second half due to the impact of formulary exclusion at CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group and difficult comparisons from last year. U.S. diabetes sales declined 19.1% in the first half of 2017.Sanofi’s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product, Lantus, facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan.In the cardiovascular franchise, it also remains to be seen if sales trends of Sanofi’s anti PCSK9 therapy, Praluent improve in the second half. Uptake of PCSK9 inhibitors like Praluent and Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Repatha have been slower than expected due to significant payer utilization management restrictions in the United States and limited market access in Europe. Praluent’s uptake could remain limited until guidelines supporting broader use of the treatment are issued and phase III cardiovascular outcome study data are out.Also generic competition will continue to hurt sales of many key drugs in Sanofi’s portfolio including its blockbuster drug, Plavix.Despite these challenges, we believe that new drug approvals, a solid pipeline and aggressive savings will pave the way for growth at Sanofi.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1435,CVS,"After a long-drawn tug-of-war with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), finally it was Walgreens Boots Alliance’s (WBA  -  Free Report) turn to secure the purchase of a number of Rite Aid (RAD) stores last week. The company had ended up purchasing 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total transaction value of $4.375 billion.However, the entire process has so far failed to make the investors happy.Stages of CommotionNotably, since 2015-end, Walgreens was caught in resolving the regulatory hurdle to acquire the entire U.S. retail pharmacy chain of Rite Aid. This effort eventually fell flat a couple of months back with FTC not approving of the mega merger.While the pharmacy-led, health and well-being enterprise giant came up with an amended agreement, the investors were in shock about Walgreens’ shelving of the $17 billion acquisition deal, which had once promised a strong platform to develop the company’s’ brand presence as well as overall future business growth.Investors eventually gained confidence delving into the original amendment’s details that mentioned about the buy of 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets for $5.175 billion. It was understood that the new agreement would enable Walgreens to purchase nearly half the Rite Aid business at a deal value, almost one-third of the original price. Notably, Rite Aid ran about 4,523 stores across 31 states and the District of Columbia as of Jun 3, 2017.Close on the heels of this development, the final amended terms of the deal, which demanded acquisition of another 250 lesser number of stores from Rite Aid, came as a big blow to the investors.Walgreens Still a Gainer?Fortunately, the answer is yes. The final agreement retained the clause to allow Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreen’s affiliate at a cost equivalent to Walgreens’ for about 10 years. Also, Rite Aid will provide Walgreens with certain transition services for up to three years post the deal closure.This apart, the deal’s financial outcome is pretty attractive. Post the new transaction’s initial closing, synergies of $300 million are expected to be entirely realized within four years of its initial completion.  This will be derived primarily from procurement, cost savings and other operational matters.Per Walgreens, this modified merger contract will also extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational plus financial benefits. It will help the company expand and optimize retail pharmacy network in key U.S. markets including the Northeast.Notably, the stores to be purchased are located primarily in the Northeast and the Southern United States, while the sites of three distribution centers to be bought are in Dayville, CT; Philadelphia, PA and Spartanburg, S.C.This partial consolidation with Rite Aid will help Walgreens gain a competitive edge over names like Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1436,CVS,"After four amendments, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) finally received a nod for the fresh proposal the latter put forward yesterday. The companies have been in talks since October 2015 to engage in a transaction – first a merger, which was terminated on antitrust concerns and replaced by Walgreens bid to buy Rite Aid stores. The second proposal, which was revised yesterday to acquire 250 lesser stores, eventually appeased the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).Shares of Rite Aid fell 12.1% to $2.40 following the news, while Walgreens was down 1.7% closing at $81.21.Despite yesterday’s fall, Rite Aid has grown 6.7% in the past month, outperforming the industry's increase of 5%. Meanwhile, Walgreens has improved only 0.8%, lagging the industry’s gain.The New BidWalgreens revised its proposal to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets for $5.175 billion, mainly to remove antitrust concerns. As part of the fresh bid, Walgreens will buy 1,932 Rite Aid stores, three distribution centers and related inventory in an all-cash deal. The company will now pay $4.375 billion for the deal.However, the new proposal retained the clause which allows Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreen’s affiliate, at cost equivalent to Walgreens for about 10 years. Meanwhile, Rite Aid will provide certain transition services to Walgreens for up to three years post the deal closure. The deal has successfully completed the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period.The stores to be sold under the amended deal are primarily situated in the Northeast and Southern parts of the United States. The three distribution centers, which are also part of the agreement, include those which are housed in Dayville, CT, Philadelphia and Spartanburg, SC.Now, the companies plan to carry out the transition of ownership of stores in a phased manner, beginning in October 2017. The transition is likely to be completed by spring 2018.Benefits to Rite AidThe transaction is likely to benefit Rite Aid in lowering debt position and improving financial leverage and balance sheet. The company intends to use the funds from this deal to pay down a part of its huge debt. The deal will also make Rite Aid a smaller, but stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates, which has been a hindrance for the company for quite some time now.Following the completion of the transaction, Rite Aid will operate about 2,600 stores and six distribution centers, alongside EnvisionRx — its pharmacy benefit manager; RediClinic and Health Dialog.The BackgroundWalgreens-Rite Aid had initially agreed to a merger agreement in October 2015, which fell apart after two years of investigation by the FTC in June 2017. Replacing the older agreement, Walgreens agreed upon a fresh bargain to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, associated distribution assets and inventory, for $5.175 billion as well as termination charges of $325 million.ConclusionWith the approval of this long awaited deal, Walgreens is now ready to become the No. 1 drugstore chain in the United States by size, leaving behind CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report). Further, Rite Aid will occupy the third spot. While Walgreens will gain from a significant expansion of its footprint, Rite Aid will be well poised to improve its financial leverage by paying down huge debts.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Still Wanting Exposure in the Drugstore Segment?Investors interested in the Drugstore space can invest in Herbalife LTD. (HLF  -  Free Report). The stock has gained whopping 39.6% year to date and has a VGM Score of A. Moreover, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1437,CVS,"Shares of Rite Aid (RAD  -  Free Report) fell more than 10% on Tuesday after Walgreens Boots (WBA  -  Free Report) received government approval to buy fewer Rite Aid stores than had initially been proposed.In order to clear a regulatory hurdle presented by the Federal Trade Commission, Walgreens Boots said it would only buy 1,932 stores from Rite Aid. The deal is still worth a whopping $4.38 billion, but that total is a full 254 fewer stores than the companies agreed to in June.Walgreens Boots also said that it intends to acquire three Rite Aid distribution centers located in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. The exchange and transition of these distribution centers will not begin for at least another year, however.Today’s approval looks to be the final chapter in what has been a lengthy saga involving Walgreens and Rite Aid. Earlier this year, Walgreens said it was calling off its nearly two-year operation to acquire its rival pharmacy company after numerous antitrust cases halted the deal.Instead, Walgreens would settle for acquiring just under half of Rite Aid’s domestic stores—a figure that has obviously since been reduced. Still, the store purchase plan should help widen Walgreens Boots’ foothold in the U.S., where it also competes with the likes of CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report).“With this process taking close to two years to come to a conclusion, we think the final outcome and the structure of the transaction were well anticipated,” an analyst at Pivotal Research Group told CNBC. “However, with each recent iteration of the transaction, the economics appear to be shifting more and more in Walgreens' favor.”The store purchases will begin in October and will be completed in spring 2018, Walgreens said. The company also noted that the acquisitions will not have a significant impact on the company’s earnings for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31, 2018, although it expects annual synergies to reach $300 million eventually.“We are confident in the path ahead and look forward to working together to shape the future of health care and deliver on the full potential these stores bring to our network,” Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina said in a press release.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1438,CVS,"The Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") seems to be getting harsher on drugstore chains Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report), which have been trying to appease the regulatory body since its initial merger pact in 2015. Per the latest developments and a word from sources, Walgreens is again planning to revise its deal to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, in order to get regulatory approval.The FTC is now close to giving decision on the Walgreens-Rite Aid’s latest deal, where Walgreens will acquire the aforementioned Rite Aid stores and related assets for $5.175 billion. However, Walgreens, which has been closely working with FTC, is currently considering revising deal to resolve some regulatory concerns. Though the exact tweaking for the number of stores that will be bought was not made known, sources expect a revised deal to be brought to light as early as next week. This would give FTC another 30 days to review the new deal and give its decision.Walgreens closed at $82.60, up a marginal 0.1% yesterday, while Rite Aid rose 3.8% to $2.73.Moreover, Rite Aid has rallied 21.4% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s 4.8% growth. Meanwhile, Walgreens has improved only 2.5%, also lagging the industry’s gain.The BackgroundWalgreens-Rite Aid had initially agreed to a merger agreement in October 2015, which fell apart after two years of investigation by the FTC in June 2017. Replacing the older agreement, Walgreens agreed upon a fresh bargain to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, associated distribution assets and inventory, for $5.175 billion as well as termination charges of $325 million.The aforementioned stores to be sold are primarily situated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern parts of the United States. The three distribution centers, which are also part of the agreement, include those which are housed in Dayville, CT, Philadelphia and Spartanburg, SC. Further, the new transaction allows Rite Aid to buy generic drugs sourced through a Walgreen’s affiliate, at cost price for about 10 years. Meanwhile, Rite Aid will provide certain transition services to Walgreens for up to three years post the deal closure. The initial deal was approved by the directors of both companies.ConclusionThe new deal to be put forward by Walgreens would mark the fourth revised proposal in the whole episode of establishing a successful transaction with Rite Aid.If the deal materializes, Walgreens will become the No. 1 drugstore chain in the United States by size, leaving behind CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report). Further, the sale of nearly half of its more than 4,500 stores would leave Rite Aid on the third spot. While Walgreens will gain from a significant expansion of its footprint, Rite Aid will be well poised to improve its financial leverage by paying down huge debts.Both Rite Aid and Walgreens currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Still Wanting Exposure in the Drugstore Segment?Investors interested in the Drugstore space can invest in Herbalife LTD. (HLF  -  Free Report). The stock has gained whopping 40.2% year to date and has a VGM Score of A. Moreover, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1439,CVS,"On Sep 12, we issued an updated research report on CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), a provider of integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Post a better-than-expected performance in the second quarter, CVS Health was observed trading significantly ahead of the industry. Per the last three months, the stock has inched up 2.5% in contrast to the industry’s 1.9% decline over the same period. On a positive note, strong Pharmacy Services numbers benefited from the upside in Specialty Pharmacy. Another encouraging fact is that despite a year-over-year decline in hepatitis C script volume in the recently reported second-quarter 2017 on lower new patient enrolment, CVS Health’s Specialty business growth outperformed the market.The company is currently working on integration of Omnicare’s specialty operation into the company’s existing specialty business profile. Besides, CVS Health’s Specialty Connect offering continues to experience strong surges in prescription volumes along with high satisfaction scores with patients, payers and providers.We are also impressed with the company’s robust PBM (Pharmacy Benefit Management) selling season. Incidentally, CVS Health had already confirmed a very successful selling season this year based on which, the expected revenue for 2017 was increased last quarter.Regarding 2018 PBM selling season, which has already begun from the start of this current year, the company had a successful second-quarter 2017 despite the magnitude of bidding opportunities being flat to down year over year.  While gross new business was $5.4 billion, net new business commendably reached $1.8 billion. These new business numbers include the loss of the FEP (Federal Employee Program) specialty contract but lack any impact from individual Med D PDP. The company has already completed about 70% of client renewals for 2018.However, the highly competitive retail pharmacy business poses severe threats. The company has delivered sluggish numbers within the retail Long Term Care business in recent past. Per the company, the decision to restrict itself from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully-insured prime networks was due to the negative impact on Pharmacy sales and script comps. Also, dull economic conditions in the United States might hamper company’s profit margin.Other Key PicksSome better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Chemed Corporation (CHE  -  Free Report). Edwards Lifesciences sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Lantheus Holdings and Chemed carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%. The stock has rallied roughly 22.2% over the last six months.Lantheus Holdings has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 12.5%. The stock has surged 41.2% over the last six months.Chemed has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. The stock has gained around 5.3% over the last six months.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1440,CVS,"It seems that the leaders of New York City have been striving hard to make the city smoke-free. In fact, the Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has reportedly issued a series of laws in April to reduce the number of smokers in the city over the next three years.Per the Aug 28 bill, the minimum price for a pack of cigarettes will now be $13 in New York. Notably, a packet of cigarettes currently costs $10.50. The latest price hike has made New York the most expensive city in the U.S. for cigarettes, as declared by some officials in the Health Department stated in sources. In the past too, the mayor has resorted to price hike as a tool to restrict smokers. Smoking rate in the city has declined from 21.5% in 2002 to about 14.3% in 2015. The rate is expected to decline to 12% by 2020 due to this price hike, as anticipated by some city health officials.The law was introduced in anticipation of making almost 900,000 smokers quit smoking as well as to reduce the number of retailers licensed to sell tobacco products in the city. Currently, about 8,300 retailers have a license to sell cigarettes.The mayor is also seeking to ban the sale of all tobacco products in pharmacies, as a result of which pharmacy chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.’s (WBA  -  Free Report) Duane Reade and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) will have to take cigarettes off their shelves. The new legislation also requires licensing of e-cigarette retailers and will force all residential buildings to have smoking policies, including banning cigarettes in common areas like hallways.We note that these measures will severely dent businesses of tobacco majors including Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report), Altria Group Inc. (MO  -  Free Report), British American Tobacco p.l.c. (BTI  -  Free Report) and Vector Group Ltd. (VGR  -  Free Report), which are already plagued by ongoing government restrictions related to selling and packaging.If we look into the share price performance of these tobacco stocks in comparison with the industry, we note that except Philip Morris, all the other stocks have underperformed the industry that declined 5.6% in the past six months. While Philip Morris gained 5.5% and British American declined 4.3%, Vector Group and Altria declined 7.8% and 15.4%, respectively, in the same time frame.Recently, the state government in India's capital directed Philip Morris and other tobacco companies to remove all advertisements in the city, warning them of legal action if they do not comply. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes, as it is responsible for a number of health issues.Governments around the world are imposing restrictions on tobacco companies which, in turn, are lowering cigarette consumption. The FDA has made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. The European Union and the FDA have proposed a ban on menthol in accordance with the Tobacco Control Act. Per the act, menthol has an adverse effect on health and thus should not be used in any product.Amid increasing government restrictions and declining smoking rates, the tobacco giants have introduced e-cigarettes and Reduced Risk Products to mitigate losses. Altria is expanding presence in the e-cigarette market steadily with its MarkTen and Green Smoke brands.On the other hand, Philip Morris has been gaining from its iQOS smokeless cigarettes since its launch in November 2014. The marketing and technology sharing agreement between Philip Morris and its peer Altria Group is also boosting the business of both the companies amid declining tobacco volumes.However, the FDA also imposed several restrictions on e-cigarettes. The FDA made it mandatory for all tobacco makers to seek marketing authorization for any tobacco product introduced after Feb 15, 2007. The law was extended to include e-cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and hookah. The FDA has currently deferred its reviews for products like cigars and hookah tobacco until 2021 and e-cigarettes until 2022.Bottom LineWhile price hike and lower availability of cigarettes do help smokers to quit smoking, as seen in the past, the ban also creates a serious black market for these products, which can be detrimental to all tobacco companies.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1441,CVS,"Sanofi, Inc. (SNY  -  Free Report) performed quite well in the first half of 2017 and looks well poised to carry on the momentum in the second half.While earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter, it met the same in the second. Earnings rose 4.9% on a reported basis in the first half of 2017 and 2.7% at constant currency rates (CER) on a year-over-year basis.First halfnet sales rose 8.7% on a reported basis and 5.5% at CER.  In Jan 2017, Sanofi swapped its Merial Animal Health businesses with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Consumer Healthcare (CHC) business. Reflecting this exchange and full consolidation of Sanofi’s European vaccines operations, sales rose 2% at constant structure and CER. We remind investors that Sanofi terminated its Sanofi Pasteur MSD joint venture with Merck& Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) in Europe in December last year.A strong performance by Genzyme’s Specialty Care (Genzyme) and Vaccines units is making up for an accelerated decline in the diabetes franchise to support the top line.In fact, at the second quarter conference call, Sanofi raised its previously issued profit outlookbacked by a better-than-expected performance in the first half and cost discipline despite a tough U.S. payer environment hurting sales in theDiabetesunit.Sanofi expects 2017 business earnings to be broadly flat at CER. This outlook compares favorably with the previous expectation of flat to down 3% at CER.So what will work in Sanofi’s favor in the second half?Continued strong performance of the Genzyme unit, especially the multiple sclerosis drugs, Aubagio and Lemtrada and the rare disease drugs like Myozyme/Lumizymeand Fabrazyme is a positive. The Vaccines unit is also expected to perform well. Sales (including emerging markets) rose 14.3% at CER in the Genzyme unit and 24.5% at CER in the Vaccines unit in the first half of 2017.Meanwhile, Sanofi, at the second quarter conference call, sounded quite optimistic about the sales prospects of its newly launched drug Dupixent for treating atopic dermatitis. The drug, which was launched in the U.S.in March 2017, generated sales of €26 million in the second quarter, backed by strong demand.Management waspleased with the drug’s uptake. We are optimistic on sales prospects of Dupixent, which could prove to be an important growth driver for the company. Other than Dupixent, other new drugs like Kevzara, launched in the U.S. in June 2017,and Soliqua, a once-daily titratable fixed-ratio combination of Lantus and Lyxumia, launched in the U.S. in January 2017,should also bring in higher sales in the back half of the year.However, management expects U.S. diabetes franchise sales to decline faster in the second half due to the impact of formulary exclusion at CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group and difficult comparisons from last year.U.S. diabetes sales declined 19.1% in the first half of 2017.Sanofi’s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product, Lantus, facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan.In the cardiovascular franchise, it also remains to be seen if sales trends of Sanofi’s anti PCSK9 therapy, Praluent improve in the second half. Uptake of PCSK9 inhibitors like Praluent and Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Repatha have been slower than expected due to significant payer utilization management restrictions in the U.S. and limited market access in Europe. Praluent’s uptake could remain limited until guidelines supporting broader use of the treatment are issued and phase III cardiovascular outcome study data are out.Also generic competition will continue to hurt sales of many key drugs in Sanofi’s portfolio including its blockbuster drug, Plavix.Despite these challenges, we believe that new drug approvals, a solid pipeline and aggressive savings will pave the way for growth in the second half.What Do the Numbers Say?So far this year, Sanofi’s share price has risen 22%, better than a 7.8% increase for the industry.The strong quarterly results and the back-to-back product approvals this year have led to an uptick in estimates as well. Sanofi’s earnings estimates for 2017 went up 2.5% while that for 2018 moved up 1.5% in the past 30 days. Sanofi’s earnings performance has also been pretty impressive, with the company reporting positive surprises consistently. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.10%.Sanofi carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1442,CVS,"CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) released interesting data indicating substantial potential in the flu vaccination market of the United States. Data confirmed that about 61% of the American population is either taking or planning to take a flu vaccination every year. Moreover, data also revealed a 2% rise in the flu vaccination taking population compared to the previous year’s survey results.Interestingly, CVS Pharmacy and MinuteClinic locations across the United States recently began offering flu vaccinations. Notably, CVS Health’s Pharmacy Services witnessed a 9.5% rise in the last reported second-quarter 2017. Also, revenues at MinuteClinic rose 8% year over year. We believe that the affirmative survey data will help the company gain traction in this space.Also, the survey’s findings indicate a 7% rise in employed flu vaccine receivers that prefer to get vaccinated at their workplace in partnership with local pharmacy or drugstore.Notably, the company has been on track to fortify its footprint in the market place. In August 2017, CVS Health and Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report) announced the launch of Cigna Health Works. Per the collaboration, leveraged on CVS Pharmacy and CVS MinuteClinic, retail health care services will be available for Cigna self-funded employer-sponsored health plans.Also, in July 2017, MinuteClinic partneredwith Alere eScreen Occupational Health Network whereby employees can visit MinuteClinic for a wide range of services required by employers including biometric screenings and vaccinations. Thus we believe the positive survey data further amplifies the importance of these strategic partnerships.Per a report by ReportsnReports, the Global Influenza Drugs and Vaccines market is projected to witness a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2022 period. Thus, favorable survey findings further indicate the array of untapped opportunities available within this space. We believe an aging population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the vaccinations market. However, this market is dominated by well established player like Emergent BioSolutions Inc. (EBS  -  Free Report).Moreover, CVS Health has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 1.7% as against the broader industry’s decline of 1.8%. The company has also outperformed the 1.2% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame.Zacks Rank & Key PickCVS Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1443,CVS,"Fred's, Inc.  has been in the red for quite some time now due to sluggish comps. The company has been struggling with declining sales that has been impacting its profits as well as overall growth. Also, it seems that the company is yet to recover from the cancelled Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) and Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report) merger. Such factors have hurt the performance of the company in the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that has been pulling down Fred's performance.Dismal Comps Trend and Declining Sales Fred’s has been posting dismal comps since past many quarters, as a result of the sale of low productive discontinued inventory. Declining traffic trends are also hurting comps. We note that the company’s July comp sales declined 0.1%, after posting a decrease of 1.6% in June and 0.8% in May.Sales were also affected by the closure of 39 underperforming stores in the first quarter of 2017. Continued challenges in the Front Store business and competitive consumable categories also affected the top-line. We note that Fred’s reported a year-over-year decline of 2.7%, 3%, 3.1% and 5.3% during March, April, May and June, respectively. The company’s total sales for July declined 3.5% to $150.5 million.Cancelled Merger - A Grave Disappointment Owing to various antitrust issues and unlikely FTC (Federal Trade Commission) clearance, Walgreens Boots Alliance decided not to proceed with its planned takeover of rival drugstore, Rite Aid Corporation. The cancelled Walgreens-Rite Aid merger also closed doors for Fred’s, which had inked a deal in Dec 2016 to buy 865 Rite Aid stores. The acquisition of these stores would have positioned Fred’s Pharmacy as the third-largest drugstore chain in the nation after Walgreens and CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report). Fred’s was left disappointed after the cancelled merger, which would have given the company greater negotiating power and would have also improved its healthcare growth strategy.  Moreover, the professional, legal, banking and integration planning fees incurred in connection with this deal, have also become unyielding and have hurt the company’s profits.Less International Exposure Fred’s does not have any presence in the developing markets which deprives it of the benefits of high growth opportunities in the developing nations like China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Russia and Southeast Asia. Since the developed markets of Europe, America and Canada are already saturated, most of the U.S. companies are looking toward the emerging ones, which offer great growth opportunity owing to the growing population and affluent middle class.Bottom Line In an effort to revamp its performance, the company has shifted focus to its pharmacy organization to drive scripts into the stores and improve service to its patients. Growth strategies of the company also include internal reorganization and geographic expansion.Although such efforts have improved Fred’s specialty business, they are yet to bear a significant impact upon the company’s top-line. Moreover, the management expects that the current headwinds combined with lower-than-expected sales trend would impact second-quarter results. Such weak fundamentals indicate that Fred’s is not a favorable stock currently.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

1444,CVS,"On Aug 9, we issued an updated research report on Rhode Island-based pharmacy retail giant, CVS Health Corp. (CVS  -  Free Report), which provides integrated offerings across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care.Post a better-than-expected performance in the second quarter, CVS Health was observed trading significantly ahead of the broader industry. Per the last three months’ share price movement, the stock has lost 1.9% over this period, narrower than the broader industry’s 4.9% loss.On a positive note, strong Pharmacy Services numbers benefited from the upside in Specialty Pharmacy. Per a recent data, three million people in the U.S. are currently in need of specialty treatment which has high potential costs. With management emphasizing that CVS Health’s specialty business remains a top priority for its customers, we believe it is well-positioned to tap this opportunity based on the broad, differentiated offerings, including the likes of Specialty Connect.The company’s strong PBM selling season also looks encouraging. Regarding 2018 selling season, despite the magnitude of bidding opportunities being flat to down year over year, the company had a successful quarter. While gross new business was $5.4 billion, net new business also reached an impressive $1.8 billion. These new business numbers include loss of the FEP specialty contract but lack any impact from individual Med D PDP (prescription drug plan). The company has already completed about 70% of client renewals for 2018. Despite a soft bottom line, the company narrowed its 2017 earnings outlook, indicating chances of recovery ahead. We believe, both the Omnicare and Target Pharmacy buyouts, which have already started to benefit CVS Health on multiple prospects, should drive the enterprise value significantly in the coming days.However, poor year-over-year Retail/LTC (long-term care)numbers along with margin debacle dragged the bottom line, last quarter. Notably, the highly competitive retail pharmacy market too seems to pose a threat. Also, the sluggish economic condition in the U.S. is a concern.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksA few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report). Notably, Edwards Lifesciences and Align Technology sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Myriad Genetics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 27.9%. The stock has added roughly 26.7% over the last three months.Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%. The stock has gained around 5.5% over the last three months.Myriad Genetics has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 13.8%.

1445,CVS,"CVS Health Corporation’s (CVS  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.33 were up a nominal 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The quarter’s adjusted EPS also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Earnings performance was sluggish year over year on disappointing Retail/LTC numbers as well as weaker margins.Without the one-time adjustments, reported EPS from continuing operations in the first quarter surged 24.4% year over year to $1.07.Net revenue in the quarter increased 4.5% year over year to $45.7 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.3 billion by a close margin. Strong revenue growth in Pharmacy Services segment was partially offset by a decline in Retail/LTC performance in the quarter.CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteQuarter in Details Pharmacy Services revenues increased 9.5% to $32.3 billion in the reported quarter, driven by growth in the specialty pharmacy volume, higher pharmacy network claim volume as well as brand inflation. This was, however, partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression.Pharmacy network claims processed during the quarter climbed 10.3% to 376 million on a 30-day equivalent basis, backed by net new business growth. Also, the Mail Choice processed claim count was 65.6 million, up 5.2% on a 30-day equivalent basis on the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings and a rise in specialty pharmacy claims.Revenues from CVS Health’s Retail/LTC dipped 2.2% year over year to $19.6 billion, primarily due to a 2.6% decrease in same store sales, continued reimbursement pressure and an increase in the generic dispensing rate.Front-end same-store sales were down 2.1% year over year. The shift of the Easter holiday to second-quarter 2017 from the first-quarter 2016 had a 75 bps positive impact on Front-end same-store sales. Front-store sales were, however, affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies, which were again partially offset by an increase in basket size.Pharmacy same-store sales also declined 2.8% in the reported quarter. Sales were affected approximately 410 bps due to recent generic drug introductions. Also, Pharmacy same-store prescription volumes were flat on a 30-day equivalent basis. This apart, marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 460 bps negative impact on same store prescription volumes.The generic dispensing rate (the proportion of all generic prescriptions to total number of prescriptions dispensed) soared 130 bps to 87.2% at the Pharmacy Services segment and 150 bps to 87.6% at the Retail/LTC segment.While gross profit dropped 1.1% to $6.9 billion, gross margin contracted 86 bps to 15.2%. Total operating margin during the quarter contracted 76 bps to 4.6% on a 10.2% plunge in operating profit.CVS Health exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.2 billion compared with $2.3 billion at the end of first-quarter 2017. Year to date, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.5 billion, up 34.1% from the year-ago period.During the second quarter, CVS Health opened 27 new retail stores and shut three retail locations. Further, the company relocated 10 retail stores. As of Jun 30, 2017, CVS Health operated 9,700 retail stores, including pharmacies in Target stores across 49 U.S. states as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Brazil.2017 OutlookCVS Health has narrowed its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to $5.83-$5.93 from the earlier band of $5.77-$5.93.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.87 is within this guided range. However, full-year operating cash flow guidance has been reiterated in the range of $7.7–$8.6 billion and free cash flow in the range of $6.0–$6.4 billion.For the third quarter, the company expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.47-$1.50. This projection takes into consideration the timing of the Medicare Part D operating profit between the third and fourth quarters, relative to the preceding year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $1.62, way above the company’s projection.Our TakeCVS Health posted better-than-expected second-quarter results with both adjusted EPS and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, poor year-over-year Retail/LTC numbers along with margin debacle resulted in a dull earnings performance by the company in the quarter.Nonetheless, year-over-year growth on the top line was due to a strong Pharmacy Services segment, benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy. An unimpressive bottom-line scenario also prompted the company to narrow its earnings outlook for 2017.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCVS Health has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) and Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1449,CVS,"CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise was 3.7%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCVS Health is optimistic about sustaining a solid year-over-year earnings trend in 2017 on the back of gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. However, there are several timing factors that have already affected the cadence of profit delivery in the first quarter. Plus, the same is expected to continue through the rest of 2017.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuoteThese factors include introduction and timing of break-open in generics, the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business, of the benefits from the company’s strategies to drive growth on the front-end and the same of share repurchases along with certain tax benefits among others. Keeping that in mind, on the last earnings call, it projected second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.29-$1.33, reflecting a decline of 2.5% to an increase of 1% year over year.This apart, the company is worried about its Retail/Long Term Care business, where revenues are expected to be down 2.5-4.25% from the year-ago period in the second quarter due to the restricted network changes. Additionally, the company expects its adjusted script comps to decrease in the range of 0.5-1.5% and the total same-store sales to be down in the 3-4.75% band in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.However, Easter shift into the second quarter is expected to leave a positive impact on the front-store comp growth of approximately 75 basis points.We also expect the company to benefit from its acquisition of Target Pharmacy, whose integration has been completed. CVS Health expects script performance to improve year over year, driven by the strength in patient care programs and Maintenance Choice.Also, it expects PBM revenues to grow 9-10.8%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes and specialty. Consolidated net revenues have projected a 3.25-5% rise during the second quarter. Overall, the company estimates to deliver healthy PBM growth on a successful PBM selling season. Specialty business is expected to record strong growth and SilverScript’s business also hopes to retain its good performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

1450,CVS,"Drugstore chain, Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) may seem like the fabled forbidden fruit of Eden for most at the moment, particularly after its merger deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) fell apart on Jun 29. Concurrently, the company also reported dismal first-quarter fiscal 2018 results and entered a fresh deal with Walgreens to sell 2,186 stores to the latter.The whole chain of events has drastically impacted the stock’s performance as evident from the 20% decline witnessed since the announcement. Further, the company has significantly underperformed the Zacks categorized Retail – Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry’s fall of 1.4% in the same time frame. Looking back, Rite Aid has declined as much as 67.4% in the last one year, compared with the industry’s fall of 15.7%. Let’s delve a little deeper and try to understand the reasons behind the slump.Reasons for the DeclineAs already stated, Rite Aid and Walgreens terminated its long-standing merger agreement following the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) closed door meeting on Jun 28, which dropped hints on the minimal chances of the deal being approved.The deal has been awaiting FTC’s approval ever since the announcement of the agreement in Oct 2015. FTC’s concerns were mainly regarding the lack of a strong competitor in the drugstore space. With Walgreens and Rite Aid being the second and third-largest drugstore chains in the U.S., the FTC believed the merger could give rise to a duopoly, leaving behind the industry leader (by size) – CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report).Further, Rite Aid’s dismal earnings results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, released simultaneously, disappointed investors. The company posted adjusted loss of 5 cents per share for the first quarter that was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents. Further, this compared unfavorably with the year-ago period earnings of 2 cents. Additionally, the top line remained soft, with comps declining on account of lower pharmacy and front-end sales. Moreover, unfavorable reimbursement rates continued to strain margins, as evident from the 100 basis points contraction in the adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter.Will the New Deal Provide Some Solace?While Walgreens and Rite Aid called off the merger, the two major industry players entered into another fresh deal. Per the deal, Walgreens will buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores, associated distribution assets and inventory. This all-cash deal worth $5.175 billion is expected to conclude in six months, on a cash-free and debt-free basis. Apart from this, Rite Aid will also get termination charges of $325 million from Walgreens, in cash.Management expects the new agreement to place the company as an independent drugstore chain, alongside being a pharmacy benefit manager with robust control in core markets. Well, Rite Aid will continue to operate its pharmacy benefit manager – EnvisionRX, RediClinic and Health Dialog. Further, the company intends to use the funds from this deal to pay down a part of its huge debt, thus improving leverage levels, easing balance sheet and improving financial flexibility.All said, this deal is likely to make Rite Aid a smaller, yet stronger firm with lesser exposure to the pressures of the aforementioned unfavorable pharmacy reimbursement rates.ConclusionWell, though the new deal is definitely a breather for the troubled drugstore chain, whether the companies’ succeed in getting FTC’s approval on this deal is yet to be seen. Further, if approved, how Rite Aid revives its troubled income statement and operations as an individual company will decide its fate. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock in the broader Retail-Wholesale space is Burlington Stores Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Further, the company’s long-term EPS growth rate of 15.9% and share price growth of 7.1% in the last six months help it to stand strong in the industry. Moreover, the company flaunts a superb earnings surprise history.

1451,CVS,"Shares of CVS Health (CVS  -  Free Report) rose 2.64% in the last trading session to close at $75.13, following the company’s announcement of a promising 2018 earnings outlook.Per management, banking on solid growth in scripts and claims, increasing purchasing power due to the Red Oak venture, and rising net benefits from the company's reorganization initiative, CVS Health expects to witness net revenue growth in the range of 0.75-2.5% for full-year 2018. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $192.07 billion, which signifies growth of 4.4% year over year.Segment Wise OutlookCVS Health has also been striving to return to growth in the Retail/LTC business. Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share in 2018 and beyond. Notably, it has been expanding partnerships with PBMs and health plans, and increasing participation as a preferred pharmacy in a larger number of Medicare Part D networks. Thus, for 2018, the company projects revenue growth in the range of 2.5-4% in this space, led by growth of 6-7% in the same store script. Moreover, CVS Health estimates same store sales to vary in the range of 2-3.5%.CVS Health expects to witness revenue growth of 1.5-3.5% in the Pharmacy Services segment with growth of roughly 8%. However, management of rebates for Aetna’s Medicare Part D business, a projected rise in generic specialty introductions, prevalent pricing pressures and decreased levels of brand inflation are expected to adversely impact this segment in 2018.2018 Operating Profit ForecastThis leading provider of integrated services across the entire spectrum of pharmacy care expects adjusted consolidated operating profit growth in the band of 1-4% in 2018. Notably, the company expects to record low-single digit adjusted operating profit growth in Retail/ Long Term Care (LTC) segment, along with a low- to mid-single digit growth in the Pharmacy Services business.However, the operating profit growth in 2018 might be adversely impacted by around 125 basis points (bps) due to the costs associated with the following two deals inked by the company of late —To begin with, the company’s divestiture of the provider of tailored services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers — RxCrossroads — to McKesson Corporation (MCK  -  Free Report) for a cash deal valued around $735 million. Secondly, the company recently inked a five-year agreement with Anthem, Inc. to provide services, including claims processing and prescription fulfillment to support IngenioRx, a new PBM. Notably, the agreement will be implemented on Jan 1, 2020, and will run through Dec 31, 2024.However, this guidance assumes the company’s major Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) acquisition deal to close at the end of 2018 instead of the second half, subject to approval by the company’s shareholders, regulatory bodies as well as fulfillment of certain other customary closing conditions. Thus, all the takeover-related expenses will not be included in the company's adjusted figures.Notably, during the announcement of this $69-billion deal, the company projected $750 million of near-term synergies, with low- to mid-single digit accretion in the second year post closure of the transaction. Many view the merger as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one which will lead to efficiency gains and solid cost cutting at CVS Health’s pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation Quote Benefits from the Latest U.S. Tax ReformThe latest U.S. tax legislation, which slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, is anticipated to benefit the company with an effective tax rate of 27% and an increased cash flow of around $1.2 billion in 2018.Revised Outlook for Q4CVS Health now expects to report a mid-teens Pharmacy Services segment's adjusted operating profit growth rate in fourth-quarter 2017 and around 4% for full-year 2017, largely due to weaker margin performance in the PBM client and retail network claims administration process. However, the company still expects fourth-quarter operating loss from its Retail/LTC segment to be at the lower end of the previously-provided range of 1.0% to 3.5%. Also, the company estimates adjusted EPS and consolidated operating profit growth at the low end of the previously-provided ranges of $1.88-$1.92 and 5.75-8%, respectively.Zacks Rank and Key PickCVS Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (BIO  -  Free Report).Bio-Rad Laboratories flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 25% and has gained 32.5% over the past year.
