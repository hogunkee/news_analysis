3,DRE,"Many funds reversed lower along with the broader market, but these two U.S. index ETFs managed to hold gains.Blue chips and small-cap stocks closed Friday with modest advances as tracked by the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index.IShares Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out intraday past a 141.92 flat-base buy point to mark a new high. But it pared its gain to 0.5%, closing just below the entry. It's formed a series of three bases almost right next to each other since December. Before that, IWM rose 10% from a flat-base breakout in November.The fund, launched in May 2000, has attracted $36.6 billion in assets. IWM has lagged the S&P 500 this year through June 8 with a 4.8% gain vs. the benchmark index's 9.7%, according to Morningstar Inc. But its one-year return of 20.8% has outpaced the S&P 500's 17.3%, and the ETF's 15-year average annual return of 9.07% is also ahead at 9.07% vs. 8.11%.Since May 19, IWM's 4% gain has doubled iShares S&P 500's (IVV) gain.Several of the tech names in IWM's top holdings took a beating Friday, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) and Coherent (COHR), which fell about 5% each. But its financial names helped offset some of the losses.SPDR S&P MidCap 400 (MDY) pared its gain to 0.3% Friday to close slightly below a 320.58 flat-base buy point. It had cleared the entry earlier in the session. The ETF started forming the current pattern after a 3% advance from a prior flat base and 7% from the one before.It's up nearly 6% year to date through June 8 and has slightly underperformed the S&P 500 for one-, three- and five-year average annual returns. But it's ahead of the benchmark index for the 10- and 15-year periods with respective returns of 8.2% and 9.8% vs. 7.2% and 8.2% for the S&P 500.The $18.8 billion fund, which was launched in May 1995, counts Everest Re Group (RE), Align Technology (ALGN) and Duke Realty (DRE) among its top holdings. Real estate investment trusts and other financials turned in a solid performance Friday.Moving over to Thursday's ETF picks, the featured pair of gold funds have pulled back from their cup-with-handle buy points as gold prices slid for a third straight session. But they're not too far from their entries. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) are 2% below their respective buy points of 123.17 and 12.54.RELATED:Gilded Gains?

4,DRE,"Apple (AAPL) is looking to differentiate Apple Music from other streaming music services, most notably Spotify, by adding more original, exclusive video content.Apple already has secured the rights to ""Carpool Karaoke"" and concert videos and is working on a show featuring hip-hop legend Dr. Dre. But now it wants to ramp up its production of music programming significantly and is in talks with Hollywood studios to make that happen, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.Apple executives have told people in Hollywood that they hope to start offering original scripted TV shows for Apple Music by the end of 2017, the WSJ reported.Apple wants to offer shows that are comparable to critically acclaimed programs like ""Stranger Things"" on Netflix (NFLX) and ""Westworld"" on Time Warner's (TWX) HBO, the report said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle chart pattern on Monday, clearing a buy point of 118.12. It had been building the pattern over the past 11 weeks.Apple stock slipped 0.42% to 119.25 on the stock market today.Apple has flirted with the idea of offering a streaming video service for years, including a possible ""skinny bundle"" featuring a ""best of cable"" channel package. But Apple has been unsuccessful in securing content deals.Offering a robust package of video content on Apple Music could give the company confidence to pursue its own over-the-top internet video network.Apple Music costs $9.99 a month for an individual membership and $14.99 a month for family membership, which gives up to six people access to the service. Apple also offers a student membership rate of $4.99 a month for college students. To get users hooked, Apple offers a three-month free trial.In December, Apple said it had more than 20 million subscribers to Apple Music. Spotify reported having over 40 million subscribers in September.

5,DRE,"Apple (AAPL) stock rose on Thursday as investors continued to weigh prospects for the company's iPhone 7 and other opportunities.Apple climbed 2% to 98.79 on the stock market today. Shares of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company have now risen in six of the past seven trading sessions.The down day was Wednesday, when Apple stock fell a fraction after research firm Kantar Worldpanel released data showing that Samsung is outselling Apple in U.S. smartphone sales. In the three months ending in May, Samsung accounted for 37% of all U.S. smartphone sales, with Apple at 29%.Looking just at their flagship models, Samsung held a narrower lead. Samsung's Galaxy S7 series accounted for 16% of sales in the March-May period, while the iPhone 6S series accounted for 14.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been above its 50-day moving average line since July 7. It and two other big-name tech firms are testing key support levels. For more details, read Alissa Williams' in-depth analysis.Of course, the Galaxy S7 launched in March, taking advantage of a natural lull in the annual iPhone release schedule. Apple is expected to release its 10th-generation handset, the iPhone 7, in September.Apple does a better job of holding on to its customers, Kantar said. Just 5% of Samsung smartphone purchases in the U.S. in the March-May period came from those switching from Apple, while 14% of Apple purchases came from those switching from Samsung.Meanwhile, Apple this week seemed to throw cold water on speculation about its intentions in video streaming.In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of internet software and services, said the company's experiments with original video production are projects designed to support current businesses.""We are only going into the content business (with projects) that we think are really tied to our products,"" Cue said. ""Right now, that's Apple Music.""That includes a Taylor Swift tour documentary for Apple Music subscribers. Apple also reportedly is producing a scripted drama from Apple employee and hip-hop icon Dr. Dre. Plus, Apple is making a reality TV show about software development called ""Planet of the Apps.""Cue dismissed the idea of Apple producing a traditional TV show.""We're not in the business of trying to create TV shows,"" he said. ""If we see it being complementary to the things we're doing at Apple Music or if we see it being something that's innovative on our platform, we may help them and guide them and make suggestions. But we're not trying to compete with Netflix (NFLX) or compete with Comcast (CMCSA).""

7,DRE,"Apple (AAPL) reportedly is looking to buy Tidal, a streaming music service run by rap mogul Jay Z, to add more exclusive content for its own service, Apple Music.Tidal has strong ties to popular artists such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna and Jay Z's wife, Beyonce. Tidal has 4.2 million paying subscribers, compared with 15 million for Apple Music and 30 million for industry leader Spotify.The Wall Street Journal reported the talks between Apple and Tidal late Thursday. It described the discussions as preliminary and cautioned that they might not result in a deal.New York Times music journalist Ben Sisario tweeted late Thursday that his sources told him that Apple has no intention of buying Tidal. The rumor might have been started to increase Tidal's perceived value, Forbes contributor Bobby Owsinski said in a post Friday.Samsung earlier this year was in talks to buy Tidal, but those negotiations felt through.Jay Z bought Tidal in March 2015 for $56 million from Swedish company Aspiro. He gave 16 famous artists and bands small stakes in the service in exchange for exclusive music releases.But Tidal has been rocked by management turmoil, churning through three CEOs in less than a year, the WSJ reported.Tidal charges $9.99 a month to stream its 40 million-song catalog or $19.99 a month for a high-fidelity version.Apple charges $9.99 a month for Apple Music for individuals. It also offers a six-person family plan for $14.99 a month.Apple Music was based on the streaming service Beats Music, which Apple acquired in its $3 billion purchase of headphone maker Beats Electronics in August 2014. As part of the deal, Apple gained the services of rap star Dr. Dre and music mogul Jimmy Iovine.The top music streaming services lately have been focused on exclusives to attract subscribers.Tidal is the only service offering the music catalog of late pop star Prince. It also was the first to stream Kanye's new album ""Life Of Pablo"" and Beyonce's latest ""Lemonade.""Apple had an exclusive on Drake's latest album ""Views"" and a concert film featuring Taylor Swift.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said an Apple Music-Tidal combination could make sense at the right price.""Jay Z purchased the service in March of 2015 for $56 million, and since then has added significantly to the quality of the services,"" Munster said. ""Our best guess is the deal price would be below $500 million.""Services like Apple Music are an important focus for Apple as it seeks to further monetize its user base, Munster said.Meanwhile, Spotify this week accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior for rejecting the latest version of its iOS app. Apple said the new Spotify app violated the App Store's ""business model rules"" by encouraging consumers to bypass Apple's billing system.Spotify said Apple's mandate to take a 30% cut of subscription revenue puts third-party apps at a competitive disadvantage to Apple's own services, such as Apple Music.Apple responded to Spotify's June 26 allegations on Friday, BuzzFeed reported.In a letter sent to Spotify general counsel Horacio Gutierrez, Apple general counsel Bruce Sewell said Spotify was seeking preferential treatment.""We find it troubling that you are asking for exemptions to the rules we apply to all developers and are publicly resorting to rumors and half-truths about our service,"" Sewell wrote.Apple stock was up a fraction, near 96, in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today.

It scours the Internet for conversations related to purchase decisions and tries to understand the context, meaning and sentiment or tone of the comments.The goal of the IBM Watson Trend App is to identify the hot-selling products of the holiday season.

16,DRE,"Do you have some mad money that's looking for a place to work in the stock market? Consider some REITs, which have boosted dividends this year. Likewise, consider sector mutual funds or ETFs that hold them.Why mad money? Because REITs still carry a risk of price declines if investors rotate out of them into higher-paying bonds if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates or the investors anticipate a rate hike.And real estate sector mutual funds as a group have lagged the S&P 500 so far this year through Nov. 5.Still, if you can wait out the storm — assuming that the storm actually passes — dividends paid by several have grown.And that trend might continue, writes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for both S&P Capital IQ and SNL Financial.That makes them attractive to income-hungry investors.""Recent research from SNL Financial reveals that REITs are hiking dividends at a rapid clip,"" Rosenbluth wrote in a report on Monday.One hundred and one, or 45%, of U.S. publicly traded REITs and property companies tracked by SNL real estate analyst Chris Hudgins have raised dividends at least once in the first 10 months of 2015, Rosenbluth reported.That was a faster pace than in prior years. The 101 REITs outnumber the 88 and 92 that increased dividends in the same periods of, respectively, 2013 and 2014, Hudgins' research says.Rosenbluth added: ""This is a pleasant surprise for many investors. The case against REITs is that their relatively high dividend yields (for stocks) will be less appealing as the yield on the 10-year Treasury moves higher as the Federal Reserve prepares to initiate a rate-hike sequence. Yet as Hudgins notes, 12 U.S. REITs and property companies raised their dividends in October, up from seven in September.""S&P Capital IQ likes three of the REITs, based on fundamentals.Here's what Rosenbluth wrote about each, with some updated yield figures: Simon Property Group (SPG) raised its quarterly dividend in late October by 3.2% to $1.60. Simon raised its dividend during all four quarters of 2015, and its annual dividend of $6.40 is 56% higher than it was three years ago.Simon has a 3.1% dividend yield. Crown Castle (CCI) increased its quarterly dividend 7.9% in October, which elevated the wireless-focused specialized REIT's dividend yield to 4.2%, higher than its peers' 3.9%.""CCI began paying dividends in February 2014 as it converted to a REIT, but in 18 months its quarterly dividend has nearly tripled to $0.89 per share,"" Rosenbluth wrote. Duke Realty (DRE), a diversified REIT, raised its dividend 5.9% in October.REIT HoldingsRosenbluth also noted that Duke, Simon and Crown were among the top 25 holdings for iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR) at the end of October. The ETF has $4.6 billion in assets spread across specialized REITs (24% of assets), retail REITs (20%), residential REITs (15%), office REITs (11%), and others. IYR has a 3.7% yield and a 0.43% expense ratio.Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ) — the largest REIT ETF, with $26 billion in assets — has large stakes in Simon and Duke. ""It has more exposure to retail and residential REITs but less exposure to specialized REITs,"" Rosenbluth wrote. ""It has an 0.12% expense ratio and a 3.9% yield.""Some mutual funds have exposure to those REITs as well.The $51.5 billion Vanguard REIT Index Fund has the same holdings as VNQ.Simon Property and Duke Realty are top-10 holdings of $4.5 billion Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio .All three REITs took price hits last week. Simon and Crown fell after Fed Chair Janet Yellen said that a rate hike in December is possible. Duke fell on Friday.S&P Capital IQ thinks the three are still good to buy and own based on fundamentals, attractively low valuations and appealing dividends.""Yes, those REITS were negatively impacted by (the) likelihood of higher rates and actions by the Fed,"" Rosenbluth told IBD. ""(But all) of them are buy recommends. No changes made, but there is more upside than before.""Follow Paul Katzeff on Twitter: @IBD_PKatzeff.

Apple ranked second with 31.7%, up from 31.2% in the spring and 29.8% last fall.Taken together, Apple's two headphone brands grabbed 75.9% of teen purchase intent in the latest survey.Coming in a distant third is Skullcandy (SKUL) with 8.9% of teen purchase intent. The percentage of teens planning to buy Skullcandy headphones has been relatively stable, down from 9.4% in the spring but up from 8.2% last fall, Piper Jaffray said.Trailing in fourth place is Bose with 3.9%, followed by Sony (SNE) (2.6%) and JVC (0.8%), the investment bank said.The percentage of teens planning to purchase headphones in the next six months increased to 60.4% in the fall survey, up from 56.3% in the spring and 57.6% in fall 2014.The percentage of teens asking for headphones as gifts was flat at 1.6%, Piper Jaffray reported.A survey released last week by the Consumer Electronics Association listed headphones and earbuds as the most popular tech items people planned to give this holiday season. Some 28% of respondents to a CEA survey said that they plan to buy headphones as gifts this season, followed by 27% for earbuds.Other popular tech gift items this season include tablets (26%), portable Bluetooth speakers (25%), notebook or laptop computers (25%) and smartphones (24%).RELATED: Teens cool with Apple, but with GoPro they can't even

39,DRE,"Apple (AAPL) launched its bid to stay relevant in the music industry on Tuesday with the debut of Apple Music, a streaming music service built on its acquisition last year of Beats.Apple made the subscription service available to its millions of mobile device users through an update to the iOS 8 operating system about 11 a.m. EDT.Apple Music features an on-demand streaming music catalog of over 30 million tracks, playlists curated by experts, a live global radio station called Beats 1, and a social network linking fans and artists called Connect.The service costs $9.99 a month after a three-month trial period. A family plan supporting up to six listeners costs $14.99 a month.Apple created Apple Music to protect its iTunes franchise, which has been eroded by the popularity of streaming music services like Spotify and Internet radio services such as Pandora Media (P).When Apple unveiled Apple Music on June 8 at its Worldwide Developers Conference, the company described it as a revolutionary service for fans and artists. It combines all the ways consumers listen to music — downloads, streaming and Internet radio — in one app.Subscribers also can use Apple's Siri voice-activated personal assistant to access music. You can tell Siri: ""Play me the best songs from 1994,"" ""Play the best FKA Twigs song"" or ""What was the No. 1 song in February 2011?""Personal technology reviewer Walt Mossberg at Re/code gave Apple Music a tentative thumbs up, but said the app is ""confusing.""Apple Music is ""uncharacteristically complicated by Apple standards, with everything from a global terrestrial radio station to numerous suggested playlists for different purposes in different places,"" Mossberg said. ""And the company offers very little guidance on how to navigate its many features. It will take time to learn it. And that's not something you're going to want to do if all you're looking for is to lean back and listen.""Where Apple Music might excel over rivals and help the recording industry is through music discovery. Through Beats 1 and curated playlists, Apple could expose music lovers to new artists.The first song played on Beats 1 was ""City"" by little-known U.K. rock band Spring King.""Apple Music aims to solve the issue of poor music discovery,"" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a research report this month.The success of Apple Music will prove whether Apple made the right decision in buying headphone maker Beats Electronics and its Beats Music streaming service for $3 billion. The deal, which closed last August, brought on board Beats co-founders and music industry luminaries Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.Apple Music launched in over 100 countries and could provide a boost to subscription streaming music in the U.S., U.K., France and Japan, IHS analyst Dan Cryan told IBD.""Apple is in a really interesting position to take on-demand music subscriptions to the mass market in countries like the U.S. and U.K.,"" Cryan said. The streaming market is still a relatively ""green field"" there because penetration rates are low compared with the overall population, he said.Apple has an edge over rivals by getting its music app distributed over millions of its smartphones, tablets and media players with a software update. ""It's a huge advantage for them to be able to deploy at scale to that many people,"" he said.If 10% of iPhone users were to subscribe to Apple Music, it would rival market leader Spotify, which has more than 20 million paying subscribers, IHS said. Spotify also offers an advertising-supported free service tier, which Apple Music does not have.If just 1% of the iPhone installed base were to subscribe to Apple Music, it would generate the equivalent of 10% of the global digital album and single sales expected in 2016, IHS said.Apple Music is important to Apple ""because music is fundamental to the mobile phone experience,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a note Tuesday. ""By having a compelling music experience, the hope is Apple will sell more iPhones.""But Munster said it's ""highly unlikely"" that Apple will match Spotify's subscriber count, which he pegged at 15 million.

42,DRE,"Audio and infotainment equipment maker Harman International Industries (HAR), an IBD Leaderboard stock, continues to score wins with high-profile customers, according to recent news reports.On Thursday, AutoWeek reported that the Harman/Kardon audio system will be standard in Daimler's (DDAIF) new Mercedes-Benz SL400, which AutoWeek says ""will now be the most affordable way to get into an SL-class on this side of the pond.""That news followed another report on the PhoneArena website that said Harman products will be included in the new Sharp Aquos Crystal smartphone.PhoneArena, a media site devoted to wireless technology, said the phone is equipped with a Harman Kardon sound effects engine when in headset mode as well as native compatibility with the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio Bluetooth speaker.These wins continue a recent run of good news for Harman, which has delivered four straight quarters of double-digit sales growth and five straight quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Much of that growth has come via deals to provide audio gear for cars and smartphones.The Stamford, Conn.-based company makes audio products, lighting solutions, GPS systems and other gear to the consumer and commercial markets, as well as digitally integrated audio and infotainment systems for the automotive industry.Its brands include JBL, AKG, Harman/Kardon, Infinity, Mark Levinson, Revel, Lexicon and Selenium.As reported this month in IBD's New America section, investors seem to have shrugged off concerns about Harman's competitive position after Apple (AAPL) agreed to buy Beats Music, a subscription streaming music service, and Beats Electronics, a maker of headphones, speakers and audio software.Beats was founded by hip-hop legend Dr. Dre and music producer Jimmy Iovine. As part of the $3 billion deal, Iovine and Dr. Dre joined Apple.Harman's shares slipped more than 1% to 106.34 on May 28, the day the Apple-Beats deal was announced. But the stock has since recovered — touching a nearly seven-year high of 118.60 on July 14 — and now trades near 115.The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97. It is the second-highest ranked in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronics group.Harman is an Apple partner as well as now a competitor.Zacks Equity Research said in an early-August note that ""Harman continues to expand due to its partnerships with the likes of Apple and Google (GOOGL), which is a significant positive. However, intensifying competition from Sony (SNE) remains a concern.""The analysts added that Harman has started integrating Apple's CarPlay and Google's Automotive Link into its embedded infotainment solutions. They also noted that in the latest reported quarter, Harman won contracts from Alfa Romeo, Hyundai, Kia and Toyota (TM), and expanded its relationship with Ford (F).Related: Car Systems Drive Growth At Audio Gear Maker Harman.

44,DRE,"Comcast, the nation's largest cable operator and Internet service provider, is sticking to its core businesses at a time when the media world is absorbing the seismic jolt of 21st Century Fox's gargantuan $80 billion offer for Time Warner.The cable giant's strategy is working. Comcast reported robust second-quarter earnings on July 22, fueled by a strong boost in its home Internet segment.Many industry players are trying to expand revenue streams in adventurous ways, such as Netflix (NFLX) deciding to create content, rather than simply deliver it through streaming and snail-mail. Apple (AAPL) stunned media and tech observers by acquiring the Dr. Dre-led headphones company, Beats, for $3 billion several weeks ago. Google (GOOGL) is moving aggressively into the potentially lucrative territory of ""wearables"" by marketing its invention Google Glass.Meanwhile, Comcast (CMCSA) has made a bet that size and scale matter and are efficient ways to reduce expenses. The approach has long been a hallmark of this financially savvy broadcasting and cable giant. Comcast made big headlines earlier this year when it offered $45.2 billion to acquire rival Time Warner Cable (TWC), the latest piece of its strategy to achieve growth by acquisitions. Regulators are reviewing the deal.""What's remarkable about Comcast is that it once started out as a regional cable company — and now it has its name on Rockefeller Center,"" said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University media professor who specializes in gauging the TV industry's impact on popular culture.By offering to buy Time Warner Cable, itself a huge player in the cable industry, the Philadelphia-based giant made a statement: We are quite content to build on its traditional strengths.Comcast is comfortable doing big deals to achieve growth. In 2011, it acquired NBCUniversal from General Electric and joined the heavyweights of network and cable TV broadcasting.There is no specific overlapping point in the U.S. where Comcast and Time Warner Cable compete with one another for customers. By the conclusion of 2013, Comcast and Time Warner Cable had roughly 21 million and 11 million Internet customers, respectively. As a combined entity, the pair would then command about two-thirds of the broadband cable market.Like every other large company in the media ecosystem, Comcast is trying to remain ahead of the curve today and, in the big picture, tomorrow and beyond.With so many entrepreneurs shaking the industry's foundation on a regular basis — remember both Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR) are only a decade or so old — it's essential that players like Comcast plan for the next wave of change. For instance, look at how much social media has transformed the communications industry.""Social media has definitely redefined the industry,"" said Anton Beyer, CEO of Up Capital Management Inc., a wealth management and financial planning firm in Granite Bay, Calif. ""Comcast has to be paying close attention on how to adapt to these kinds of changes. The whole media world is up for grabs, and consolidation will be a big part of that story.""Comcast's long-term strategy is evident. ""Comcast is looking for synergies that will cut costs, rather than (exclusively) boost revenue, and cost synergies are much more reliable,"" said Paul Carroll, a principal in the Devil's Advocate Group, a technology-centric consulting firm.""Comcast is also sticking to its core business, rather than trying something new so the additional size would likely lead to efficiencies, not complexity and inefficiency,"" Carroll said.Doing What It Does BestFor a company with Comcast's pedigree and clout, it makes sense to concentrate on what you can do well. ""If I were running Comcast, I wouldn't be trying to figure out how to adapt my product to the new world or even figuring out what the new new world will be,"" said Sam Hill, co-author of ""Radical Marketing: From Harvard to Harley, Lessons from Ten That Broke the Rules and Made It Big.""Yes, the watchword in today's media industry is to branch out and tap new kinds of revenue streams. At the same time, Comcast has determined that the strategy of focusing on producing solid financial results is wise because it enables the company to have the resources to remain competitive for a long time.""Today, media companies have to choose between being either hip, or profitable,"" said Charles Haddad, a professor at the Stony Brook University School of Journalism. ""Few media companies are both. You don't get any hipper — or more relevant — than Twitter and its many copycats, but it has never earned a dime. Nor are its executives close to figuring that out. Ditto with Amazon.""Despite its financial strength, this is a challenging time for Comcast. Its takeover attempt still requires the approval of the U.S. government. Comcast's lobbyists in Washington, D.C. must have an answer for the outcry by consumer groups who question whether such a monopoly might eventually harm customers since so much power would rest in the hands of one company, Comcast.Fighting Image ProblemPlus, Comcast must resolve its image problems with consumers. It hasn't always boasted a stellar reputation for service. To be fair, perhaps this is bound to be an occupational hazard for a cable company because the public loves to complain about it. To be sure, Comcast gets its share of negative publicity.For instance, Comcast recently had to live down what a MarketWatch headline proclaimed as ""the Comcast call from hell."" The fracas occurred when a Comcast customer tried by phone to terminate his account, only to encounter a rather overzealous customer-service representative. The Comcast employee basically wouldn't hear of it and kept the customer on the phone for a much longer than was necessary. http://blogs.marketwatch.com/themargin/2014/07/15/have-you-ever-had-a-cancellation-asad-as-this-comcast-experience/Much of Comcast's future rests on whether the government will approve its takeover of Time Warner Cable. This proposed deal enables Comcast to continue to grow by taking advantage of its core businesses and providing for the long term.""Comcast is aiming at a sweet spot that should stay sweet for at least a decade,"" Carroll pointed out. ""That sweet spot is the connection to the Internet, that everyone these days treats as being as basic as having electricity and water. Cable is easily the fastest way to connect to the Internet — much faster than DSL and wireless — so those who own cable have a big advantage.""

75,DRE,"Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) recently announced the ground breaking at Liberty Commerce Center in Butts County, GA. The move comes as part of the company’s effort to leverage on the Butts County's thriving industrial market.Particularly, the company has made this move for the 840,000-square-foot Building 1 (120 Midway Road), the first of two planned buildings, and expects to deliver it during the fourth quarter of this year. The Class A building is designed to get LEED® and Energy Star certifications.Notably, Liberty Commerce Center is expected to experience solid demand for space due to its strategic location with fast access to major interstates as well as vicinity to the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Particularly, firms looking for warehouse, distribution and light manufacturing space are likely to drive demand for this property.In fact, the region offers solid scope to Liberty Property for capitalizing on healthy growth of the e-commerce market. The company intends to set up a 240,000-square-foot sister building at 184 Midway Road to conclude the 80-acre complex. The location might be alternatively used for supporting an additional 266 trailer or 1,070 automotive parking spaces.Notably, the industrial real estate asset category has grabbed attention due to elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and a healthy manufacturing environment. This is opening up growth avenues for industrial REITs, including Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property.Particularly, Liberty Property is shifting its focus toward industrial properties due to favorable demand-supply conditions. The company plans to fund investments in industrial assets through proceeds from dispositions of office properties.The company’s industrial portfolio, spanning 94.2 million square feet of area, enjoyed occupancy of 97.0% at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, marking an expansion of 70 basis points from the prior quarter. Moreover, industrial rents escalated 14.8% on renewal and replacement leases signed during the quarter.Furthermore, the company plans to dispose its remaining sub-urban office properties in 2018. In numbers, it expects dispositions of at least $600-$800 million this year, with the majority being sub-urban office properties. On the other hand, it is aimed at fortifying its national industrial platform through acquisitions of $400-$600 million of industrial properties in key markets and commence $500-$600 million of development projects as well. These measures are anticipated to help the company achieve a favorable portfolio mix.Liberty Property currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, the company’s 2017 acquisition activity included 23 industrial properties comprising 35 buildings, with around 1.7 million square feet and five improved land parcels, aggregating around 25.1 acres for a total of $292.7 million.Moreover, concurrent with acquisitions, the company has been putting in concerted efforts to shed non-core properties in a bid to enhance its overall portfolio mix and provide capital for strategic acquisitions.

78,DRE,"Duke Realty Corporation’s (DRE  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of 30 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure came in lower than the year-ago figure of 31 cents.Total rental and related revenues of $179.4 million for the quarter jumped 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. Further, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $175 million.For full-year 2017, Duke Realty reported core FFO per share of $1.24 that came in 4 cents ahead of the prior-year tally of $1.20. Total rental and related revenues for the year witnessed a 7% rise from a year ago to $686.5 million.Quarter in DetailDuke Realty leased around 7.8 million square feet of space in the reported quarter. The company’s tenant retention for the quarter was 91.4%. Moreover, it registered same-property net operating income growth of 3.2% year over year. In fact, the company reported overall rent growth related to new and renewal leases of 19.9%.As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s total occupancy, including properties under development, was 93.8%, up 60 basis points (bps) from the prior-quarter end.

The fourth-quarter dividend will be paid on Feb 28 to shareholders of record as of Feb 15, 2018.Our ViewpointThe medical office asset sale enabled the company to turn itself into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT. However, such large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term. Additionally, the company has an extensive development pipeline that exposes it to operational risks, lease-up risks and entitlement delays.Nonetheless, Duke Realty is well positioned to benefit from escalating demand for industrial properties by offering modern distribution facilities in strategic in-fill locations. Also, during the quarter, the company paid a special cash dividend, which was primarily the outcome from the sale of its assets. Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors.Duke Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Duke Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuoteCurrently, Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Upcoming ReleasesWe now look forward to the fourth-quarter earnings releases of some other companies like EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Outfront Media Inc.

82,DRE,"We are in the heart of the Q4 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there are a number of Q4 earnings releases queued for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) and Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Jan 31.No doubt, the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equal chances to excel or fall behind.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm — CBRE Group Inc.  — the overall U.S. office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 13.0% during fourth-quarter 2017 amid an uptick in supply. Nevertheless, the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post-recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U.S. office markets. Moreover, solid demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment are helping the industrial asset category to grab attention.Further, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of the quarter, remaining stable year over year.Finally, mall traffic has been severely affected and retail landlords have consequently felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences inclining more and more toward online retail. However, retail REITs are putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, but expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities to boost traffic. However, the upfront costs associated with such efforts are likely to limit near term margin improvement.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the Finance sector, of which REITs are part, are expected to be up 8.4% year over year on 2.4% higher revenues. This represents the Q4 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole — i.e. after combining the reported actual results with the still-to-come estimates.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others might disappoint this earnings season. So let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ fourth-quarter results.Residential REIT — AvalonBay Communities — is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.In fact, the company is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the prior years, it is now likely to achieve stability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $555.2 million, denoting an expected increase of 7.1% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.24, indicating a 5.7% increase year over year.However, the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. Moreover, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. In addition, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.

QuoteIndianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — Simon Property Group — has been undertaking various initiatives, of late, to strengthen its relationship with customers. In addition, it is focusing on omni-channel strategies to gain popularity among retailers. Further, in the fourth quarter, the company initiated various programs and events to steer mall traffic.Nevertheless, with more and more consumers shifting to online purchases, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed. This has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. Also, retailers are reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures. While Simon Property is making efforts to beat these retail blues through various initiatives, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this might impede any robust growth in the company’s profit margins in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter 2017 revenues is currently pegged at $1.4 billion — indicating projected growth of around 0.5% year over year. Moreover, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at $3.12.

Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $386.3 million, denoting projected growth of 25.8% year over year.However, it should be noted that the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. In addition, supply of new units increased in a number of markets, including Dallas and Austin. Hence, any robust growth in its same-store portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the quarter to be reported. Also, high concession activity amid higher supply adds to its woes.As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.48, projecting a 1.3% decrease year over year.

Subsequently, in May 2017, the company inked a deal to sell its medical office buildings (MOB) portfolio for a price of $2.8 billion.While such streamlining measures are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact will likely drag the company’s quarterly results. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $175 million, indicating a decline of 14.3% year over year.

83,DRE,"As we tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle, a lot of activity can be noticed in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space. The Q3 earnings line-up for this week includes Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Improvement in the macroeconomic scenario has fueled demand amongst several asset classes in third-quarter 2017.Data-center REITs thrived amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure.As giant e-commerce chains continue to invade market share from physical retailers, greater inventory build-up and increasing focus on supply-chain efficiencies spiked demand for logistics infrastructure and warehouse facilities. This has driven the industrial real estate market’s growth during the quarter.Further, recovery in the economy and labor markets has resulted in increased manufacturing activities. This has helped warehouses and distribution centers enjoy higher occupancy and demand.    However, rising popularity of e-retail has become a key cause of concern for retail REITs. The increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon is putting pressure on the top-line figure for these REITs. Subsequently, the significant drop in mall footfall has compelled a number of retailers to opt for store closures and file for bankruptcy.Residential REITs enjoyed high occupancy rates and stable rent growth in the third quarter. Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Oct 25.Amid escalating demand for data centers, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to lure clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.  In addition to this, the company is anticipated to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions. We expect such diligent efforts to drive the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $593.2 million indicates a year-over-year increase of 8.6%.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Digital Realty is -0.26%. Although the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.

In fact, such short-term impact is expected to mar the company’s quarterly results.At present, Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -3.93%.

84,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.Last quarter, this commercial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.7%. Results were backed by improved operational performance from increased occupancy and rental-rate growth.The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being nearly 5.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuoteFurther, Duke Realty’s shares have climbed 8.6% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.8%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsIn recent years, Duke Realty has made strategic efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. This augurs well because the industrial-asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Furthermore, higher demand from e-commerce customers, third-party logistic providers and traditional warehousing customers also resulted in high demand for distribution centers. Given Duke Realty’s solid capacity to offer modern, bulk distribution properties, the company remains well poised to capitalize on this trend in the third quarter as well.Moreover, Duke Realty is making concerted efforts to lower its suburban office assets and turn into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. Subsequently, in the second quarter, the company generated $2.45 billion in proceeds by selling its medical office building (MOB) portfolio for $2.8 billion. This residual transaction is likely to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter.While such streamlining efforts are strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact will likely drag the company’s quarterly results.Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter to be reported remained unchanged at 29 cents, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Duke Realty is -3.93%.Zacks Rank: Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #3. This increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 26, has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

This augurs well because the industrial-asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations for improving supply chain efficiencies, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks have been increasing. This is helping the industrial real estate market to grow. Given Duke Realty’s solid capacity to offer modern, bulk distribution properties, the company remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.Duke Realty has made rigorous efforts to lower its suburban office assets as part of its strategy to concentrate on industrial assets. Subsequently, in May 2017, the company inked a deal to sell its MOB portfolio for a price of $2.8 billion. The company generated $2.45 billion in proceeds in the second quarter, through this sale. Further, in the third quarter, Duke Realty substantially accomplished the sale of seven of the nine medical office buildings, spanning 519,000 square feet. Such efforts are aimed at simplifying the company’s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT.While such streamlining efforts are strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed.

88,DRE,"Investors in the REIT space need not be disappointed by the FOMC meeting outcome and rate hike moves. This is because a number of REITs like Host Hotels & Resorts (HST  -  Free Report), Piedmont Office Realty Trust (PDM  -  Free Report) and Weingarten Realty Investors (WRI  -  Free Report) have announced their special dividends, which is definitely good news for income-seeking investors.Specifically, Host Hotels & Resorts has announced a special dividend of 5 cents per share. This is in addition to the fourth-quarter cash dividend of 20 cents per share, reaching the total dividend figure for the year to 85 cents. The dividend will be paid on Jan 15, 2018, to stockholders of record on Dec 29, 2017.Also, Piedmont Office Realty Trust’s board of directors recently announced a special cash dividend of 50 cents per common share, giving investors another reason to rejoice. The special dividend distribution was primarily due to taxable gains that the company realized on asset dispositions of around $396 million in 2017. This dividend will be paid on Jan 9, 2018, to shareholders of record on Dec 26, 2017.Usually, special dividends are paid by REITs on capital gains from the sale of assets to avoid paying taxes. Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.The other REIT — Weingarten Realty Investors — announced a special cash dividend of 75 cents per share, which is payable on Dec 29, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Dec 26, 2017. According to the company, this dividend will consist mainly of gains on property dispositions.Earlier, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) had announced a special cash dividend of 85 cents per share. This primarily resulted from the sale of around $2.85 billion of assets through Sep 30, 2017. This dividend was paid on Dec 12, 2017, to shareholders of record on Dec 1.Moreover, bringing in more good news for investors, particularly the income seeking ones, recently a number of REITs announced their dividend hikes.

89,DRE,"Investors in the REIT space are usually jittery when a rate hike is announced by the Federal Reserve and there is no exception this time too. However, instead of fretting over the rate that was increased by a quarter point in the recently concluded FOMC meeting, we ought to shift attention to the better outlook offered by the Fed in terms of GDP growth for 2018, a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a “strong” job market.This can be far more rewarding because REITs business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario. And why not? A fatter purse obviously gives tenants more power to demand real estate space and shell out for higher rents.More importantly, the technology wave is not only helping tech companies but is also driving demand for the related real estates. Take for example the e-commerce boom that has hugely affected retailers’ business model.No doubt, this has adversely impacted mall traffic in recent times, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, this technological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and substantially driving up demand for space at a number of asset categories.In fact, right from the time we use our smartphones, tablets or computers for a purchase, demand for REITs get a boost. This is because as we place our demand, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. Finally, the order is fulfilled through the industrial/logistics facilities and delivered at our doorstep.Now, REITs happen to own many of these cell towers, data centers and logistics facilities. So without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Going by numbers, per a forecast from Cisco, from 2016 to 2021, global Internet video traffic and mobile data traffic are estimated to witness a CAGR of 31% and 46%, respectively.The estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. All these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower REITs including American Tower (AMT  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International (CCI  -  Free Report) and data-center REITs such as Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty (COR  -  Free Report) and others.Moreover, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options. This is propelling demand for distribution facilities near population centers, which not only help in lowering delivery time but also reduce cost of delivery.Further, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. As such, demand from the e-commerce sector has been escalating and per a report by Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report), in third-quarter 2017, this sector accounted for nearly 25% of total U.S. leasing demand compared with 14.7% in the previous year.This is offering significant impetus for growth to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) and others. So shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Therefore, instead of being bogged down by the current rate hike news, tap the many novelties in the REIT sector. Since individual market dynamics play a critical role in determining performance of REITs, favorable conditions only pump up chances of further growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

The move will help the company expand its Silicon Valley Connected Campus.The new interconnected facility is slated for delivery in first-quarter 2018. Digital Realty expects making investments of around $75 million in this facility and benefit from the robust demand for data center space in Silicon Valley.Notably, data center REITs are experiencing a boom with the growing popularity of cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, as well as the use of third-party IT infrastructure by several companies. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. Amid these, Digital Realty also stands well to leverage on the growth potential with its strategic acquisitions and expansion efforts.In fact, the company’s existing holdings in Silicon Valley are nearly fully leased. The present Silicon Valley portfolio comprises 17 properties, aggregating more than two million square feet, with 99 megawatts of IT load. Moreover, the above-mentioned six megawatt new facility will likely support customer growth needs within the supply-constrained Santa Clara metro region.Last month, Digital Realty also announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhances Digital Realty’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley.Digital Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

92,DRE,"Use of leverage for real estate investment trust (REIT) business makes returns from this industry susceptible to interest-rate movements. This is because rise in interest rate affects the present value of future cash flows.However, when fundamentals of the underlying asset category, to which the REITs cater to, remain strong, there is scope for increasing future cash flows from the assets. This is how REITs emerge as winners even with rate hikes.For instance, the industrial asset category has grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market, and healthy manufacturing environment.Particularly, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options, fueling demand for warehouse distribution facilities.Amid this, the industrial investment momentum has gathered steam and superseded the overall commercial real estate market, with investors enhancing the industrial holdings, per a report from real estate services company, JLL Inc. (JLL  -  Free Report). In fact, investment sales aggregated $23.8 billion in the first half of this year. This marked more than 20% increase year over year.Also, industrial rents have touched an all-time high of $5.35 per square foot in the second quarter of 2017 amid the national historic low level of vacancy. While more new supply is coming to the market, there is dearth of quality vacant space in the market to absorb, per the report.Leasing activity for new construction is particularly led by e-commerce, logistics and distribution companies.

93,DRE,"Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) is well positioned to benefit from the escalating demand for infrastructure and efficient distribution networks amid an e-commerce boom. However, in order to benefit from this pro-business environment, the company is undertaking numerous development projects which could increase its operational risks by exposing it to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks. Shares of Duke Realty have outperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date.  The company’s shares have gained 11.2% compared with 6.2% growth registered by the industry. Also, its full-year 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share estimate moved 0.8% upward to $1.22 in a month’s time.The industrial real estate industry has been witnessing elevated demand for modern, bulk distribution properties and warehouses. This demand is stemming from growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations, in order to improve supply chain efficiencies. This is indicated by the quick lease up and high occupancy rates of these industrial properties.   In fact, Duke Realty recently leased 33 Logistics Park 1611, a bulk warehouse, to a leading logistics company in the nation. This property was delivered by the company in early July. It also leased 27,044 square feet of space in TransDulles Center 22815 to Legacy Scenic & Productions. Further, Duke Realty’s portfolio is well located in major industrial hubs. Such prime locations help in driving solid demand for its industrial properties.In addition, the company announced that it has started the construction of a spec industrial building in 33 Logistic Park, in a bid to provide a modern and up-to-date industrial space. These efforts to enhance its portfolio enable the company to capitalize on the increasing demand.The company’s balance sheet and liquidity position should keep supporting its construction plans.Duke Realty has been aiming at simplifying its business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. It is continuously disposing its suburban office assets and medical office business (MOB). In line with this, the company inked a deal with a subsidiary of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc., to sell its MOB portfolio for $2.8 billion in May 2017.  While the above discussed efforts to enhance its portfolio mix are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. Such short-term impact tends to drag the company’s quarterly results and hurt its profitability.Duke Realty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Seritage Growth Properties , Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report) and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

94,DRE,"Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) announced that it has successfully leased 33 Logistics Park 1611, a bulk warehouse, to a leading logistics company in the nation. Moreover, the company noted that it has commenced the construction of 33 Logistics Park 1620 — a spec industrial building.Both these properties are located at 33 Logistics Park — the Easton, PA-based industrial development. The company has a third property in 33 Logistics Park, which was unveiled in 2016. This bulk warehouse, which spans across 1.1 million square feet of space, is 100% leased.33 Logistics Park 1611 is a bulk warehouse spanning 628,475 square feet of space, which was delivered by the company in early July. The warehouse provides the tenant with a larger space and is strategically located for its operations.33 Logistics Park 1620, the 1,015,740-square-foot cross-dock building, will be delivered in April 2018. It is adjacent to Duke Realty’s other two properties. The property will be equipped with LED lights, four drive-in doors and 120 dock doors. In addition, it will provide parking space for 472 automobiles and 245 trailers. 33 Logistics Park is located on the eastern side of the Lehigh Valley near the four-way diamond interchange at Main Street, just off Route 33. The valley is a popular distribution hub as it is well connected to the New York City metropolitan area. Moreover, ease of transportation and sound connectivity to major interstate highways will boost demand for the above mentioned industrial properties.    Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies opting for consolidation of operations for improving supply chain efficiencies, demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks has been shooting up. This, in turn, has been stoking the industrial real estate market’s growth. Hence, the company is actively constructing properties which offer premium office space, in order to benefit from the accommodative industrial environment.In fact, construction of a spec industrial building also offers many benefits to tenants and developers. Spec buildings are not built to suit a particular tenant, offering the developer flexibility to lease the space to different tenants. Since the buildings are standard constructions, these give tenants an opportunity to customize the space according to their needs. Additionally, spec buildings are constructed in desirable locations — in or around important industrial hubs — and thus enjoy high absorption and occupancy levels.With a rapid rise in the number of spec projects in the nation, Duke Realty remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.The recovery in the economy has fueled demand for industrial and distribution space. In line with this, Duke Realty has been making diligent efforts to simplify its business model and turn into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT. In fact, in May 2017, the company signed a deal with a subsidiary of Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. to sell its medical office business and portfolio for $2.8 billion.The above discussed efforts of the company led its shares to rally 10.7%, outperforming 4.7% growth recorded by its industry, year to date.Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s full-year 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share estimate inched up 1.6% to $1.22, while the third-quarter 2017 estimate remained unchanged at 29 cents in a month’s time.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

96,DRE,"PS Business Parks, Inc. (PSB  -  Free Report) stock has outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past six months. The company’s shares have gained 11% while the industry recorded 3.8% growth, during this time period. Notably, there are enough reasons to expect a solid upside for this commercial real estate investment trust (REIT) stock. Particularly, the earnings outlook and operating fundamentals of PS Business Parks appear strong enough to drive the stock further in the near term.The company enjoys a well diversified portfolio situated across varied markets. It operates real estate properties including multi-tenant flex, office and industrial assets mainly in six major markets — California, Virginia, Florida, Texas, Maryland and Washington .This diversification helps in mitigating operating risks associated with a particular asset category or economic downturns in a specific region. Further, it provides greater ability to tap opportunities across different asset classes.The company has been making diligent efforts to expand its business around large population centers and diversify geographically. In fact, in June, it announced the acquisition of Fullerton Industrial Park and Northern Virginia Industrial Park in Springfield, VA for $14.3 million. The purchase of this multi-tenant industrial portfolio will strengthen PS Business Parks foothold in the Springfield industrial sub-market, where the company already owns an industrial portfolio with an impressive historical occupancy of 95% since 2000. Complementing its acquisitions, the company aims at portfolio repositioning to achieve a better mix in the long term. Particularly, buyout of strategic assets at a discount to replacement costs will enable the company to emerge stronger amid improving industrial market fundamentals in the United States. Moreover, it is disposing assets that do not suit its growth strategies.  In fact, in April, the company completed the sale of Orange County Business Center, situated in Orange County, CA and generated $73.3 million in net proceeds.Notably, the industrial real estate market is witnessing improving fundamentals amid the growth of e-commerce business. This is driving demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance their distribution and production platforms as well as address a large customer base and urbanization.Moreover, a healthy manufacturing environment, a recovering economy and job market gains are likely to drive demand for office space. Hence, amid strengthening fundamentals across different asset classes, PS Business Parks is well poised to gain from this trend with its strong portfolio of strategic properties. Also, its return on equity is 18.6% compared with the industry’s average of 5%. This reflects that the company reinvests more efficiently compared to the industry. Further, the company remains committed to boost shareholders’ wealth. In February 2017, it announced a 13.3% sequential hike in quarterly common dividend rate and has kept the rate unchanged. Given the company’s solid financial position and significantly lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend payout is expected to be sustainable.PS Business Parks also generates higher cash flow per share of $6.8 compared to the industry’s average of $1.91. Further, the company’s solid operating margins also keep us optimistic of its growth prospects. Specifically, it has a net margin of 43% against the industry’s average of 13.4%.Lastly, the trend in estimate revisions indicates a solid outlook for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operation (FFO) per share has witnessed 1.4% upward revision in two months’ time. Given its progress on the fundamentals, the stock is likely to perform well in the quarters ahead.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors can also consider other top-ranked stocks in the real estate space like Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Columbia Property Trust (CXP  -  Free Report).

97,DRE,"Investors’ decision to pour their hard-earned money into REITs based on underlying asset market fundamentals rather than brooding over the rate hike seems well thought out.This is because REITs have outperformed the broader stock market for four straight months.

Among the other decent-performing core, self-storage and data center REITs gained 7.03% and 6.68%. Industrial REITs posted growth of 2.65%.Meanwhile, though retail REITs have been fighting odds like store closures and bankruptcies, they are making a comeback by improving productivity of retail assets through attracting new and productive tenants and discarding low-yielding ones. These turnaround efforts are well reflected in the returns.Industrial REIT Has Room for GrowthFundamentals of asset categories are likely to continue to play a pivotal role in determining REIT returns and one sector that is positioned to excel is industrial REIT. This sector has logged a gain of 5.65% in the first six months of 2018, with enough room for decent gains in the days ahead as well.In fact, to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset value.Meanwhile, taking a recovering economy and healthy job market scenario as well as tax reforms into consideration, consumption levels are expected to remain elevated. And a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories are likely to drive demand for warehouse and logistics real estate, providing significant impetus to industrial REITs in the form of rent escalation apart from high occupancy.Thus, it is the right time to bet on some REIT stocks that have a favorable rank and solid scope for growth. As a bonus, these companies have seen positive estimate revision from analysts.Here are the four picks:  San Francisco, CA-based Terreno Realty Corporation (TRNO  -  Free Report) is an industrial REIT engaged in the acquisition, ownership and operation of industrial real estate in six major coastal U.S. markets — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami, and Washington, DC.

98,DRE,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) announced a special cash dividend of 85 cents per share. This was primarily the outcome from the sale of its assets. This dividend will be paid on Dec 12, 2017 to shareholders of record on Dec 1.Notably, this real estate investment trust (REIT) made a sale of around $2.85 billion of assets through Sep 30, 2017. Particularly, Duke Realty resorted to the sale of its medical office assets in recent quarters. This strategic move is aimed at simplifying business model and transforming into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT.Usually, special dividends are paid by REITs on capital gains from the sale of assets to avoid paying tax. Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of their annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.Along with special dividends, Duke Realty continues to pay regular quarterly dividend. In fact, concurrent with third-quarter 2017 earnings release, Duke Realty announced a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 20 cents per share. This marked a sequential hike of 0.5%. The third-quarter dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to shareholders of record as of Nov 16, 2017.According to management, after going for this special dividend that satisfies the minimum REIT distribution requirements, the company will retain a significant part of sale proceeds for reinvestment in its industrial portfolio as well as strengthening balance sheet.As a matter of fact, in the overall U.S. real estate market, industrial properties have grabbed attention on robust demand, a recovery in the economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce and a healthy manufacturing environment.Duke Realty too is poised for growth by leveraging on the improving fundamentals backed by its solid portfolio of industrial properties that spans more than 145 million rentable square feet in 21 major U.S. logistics markets.While we believe that the sale of its medical office assets would aid the company in focusing exclusively on industrial asset category, the dilutive impact on earnings from such sale of assets would be impossible to avoid in the near term.Duke Realty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Year to date, shares of the company have climbed 10.3%, outperforming 5.3% growth recorded by the industry.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Cedar Realty Trust (CDR  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) and Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

99,DRE,"Broader macroeconomic concerns as well as a rise in Treasury yield have affected returns on REIT stocks in recent months. However, the operating performance of this special hybrid asset class was decent in the third quarter.In fact, per a NAREIT media release, occupancy rates reached a record high in the third quarter, while funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, reported growth from the year-ago period.Specifically, the Q3 scorecard reveals that total FFO of $14.8 billion for the listed U.S. Equity REIT industry increased 7.8% year over year. However, the figure was 4.5% lower sequentially.Same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 3.2% year over year. Results were driven by segments like Manufactured Homes, Diversified, Single Family Homes, Industrial, and Data Centers, which witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 7.1%, 7.0%, 6.8%, 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively.Importantly, properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels. In fact, the occupancy rate climbed 50 basis points to a record high of 94.0%.Notably, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data center REITs. Moreover, the industrial asset category has hogged attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.The residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number at check. No doubt, shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and made their best efforts to replace with the ones which have departed.Among the S&P 500 REIT constituents, data center REIT — Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report) — and industrial REIT — Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) — delivered better-than-expected results in the quarter, with positive surprises of nearly 1.3% and 3.5%, respectively, in terms of FFO per share. Also, retail REIT, Regency Centers (REG  -  Free Report), and residential REIT, Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) surpassed estimates, registering a positive surprise of 4.4% and around 1.3%, respectively.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders. Dividend from Equity and Mortgage REITs aggregated $12.8 billion, denoting a 0.6% increase sequentially. Total dividends paid out were also up 4.1% from the prior-year quarter.Currently, Regency Centers has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Digital Realty, Duke Realty and Equity Residential carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

Also, the company purchased a land parcel, spanning 3.5 acres in Newark, NJ.

This helped the company improve its leasing metrics on a year-over-year (y/y) basis.The same-store portfolio of approximately 10.7 million square feet was 98.3% leased as of Jun 30, 2018, compared with 97.4% at the end of the prior quarter. Further, cash rents on new and renewed leases increased 33.9% for the quarter.The company enjoyed the ownership of 195 buildings — spanning around 12.5 million square feet, together with 11 improved land parcels, comprising 51.4 acres as of Jun 30, 2018. Additionally, four buildings are under redevelopment and will span across 484,000 square feet on completion. After considering redevelopment costs of $32.9 million, the total value comes up to $119.2 million.Notably, industrial REITs are sure to scale new heights, with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as elevated consumption levels. Moreover, with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, the demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be healthy, giving a significant impetus to industrial REITs like Terreno, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report).Encouragingly, in the past year, shares of Terreno have outperformed the industry.

Recently, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) announced that it completed the leasing of the third building at 33 Logistics Park in Lehigh Valley, PA.Notably, the property’s strategic location worked on the company’s advantage and thus, Duke Realty could achieve 100% occupancy for this development, spanning 2.7 million square feet. The property is on the east of Lehigh Valley, with access to the highway. Also, it could be connected to I-78, I-81 and I-80 very easily.33 Logistics Park has three buildings. Out of which, the other two got leased as soon as the construction was completed, one in early 2016 and another in July 2017. All the buildings have been leased by e-commerce and logistics companies.Duke Realty has another spec industrial building under construction, Central Logistics Park 53, which is located at the west of Lehigh Valley. It is expected to be completed by July 2019.On the other hand, Sysco Guest Supply and Genera Corporation have renewed leases in Illinois with Duke Realty. With this, the buildings occupied by them, enjoy full occupancy. Specifically, with the renewal, Sysco will continue occupying 93,880 square feet in Carol Stream 370, which is situated at 370 Kimberly Drive. Genera will also continue working from 4220 Meridian Parkway, which is a 192,600-square-foot building in Aurora.Industrial REITs are sure to scale new heights, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as elevated consumption levels. Moreover, with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, the demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Duke Realty, Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), in first-quarter 2018, availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents moved up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Moreover, it should be noted that Duke Realty has resorted to the sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class.In addition, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 12.8% in the past six months, outperforming 6.2% growth recorded by its industry.

102,DRE,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) is expected to gain from its portfolio of upscale hotels across markets with solid potential. Further, its productivity-improvement efforts are anticipated to drive performance over the long term.Demand is likely to rise amid improving corporate profits, business investment, consumer sentiment and low unemployment level. Particularly, group business demand is likely to be decent in the rest of the year with solid group booking pace.The company has a strategic capital-recycling program to improve its portfolio quality and strengthen its position in major markets. During first-quarter 2018, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of the 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion.Meanwhile, the company has been monetizing a considerable part of real estate in Washington DC and lowering its exposure in New York. Moreover, the company might be considering the shedding of a huge portfolio of non-core hotels, per news on Bloomberg. Although the properties that are expected to be sold have not been finalized, the value of the same in aggregate is likely to cross $2 billion, per the report.In addition, the company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for the year. This comprises $185-$220 million in return on investment (ROI) projects, and $290-$330 million in renewal and replacement projects. Such investments are likely to help the company enhance its portfolio quality and bolster revenues as well.Host Hotels has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. The company exited first-quarter 2018 with around $323 million of unrestricted cash and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. Notably, the company has no debt maturities until 2020. This provides the company with ample scope for deploying capital for long-term growth opportunities and at the same time carrying out redevelopment activities.Furthermore, in the past three months, shares of Host Hotels have gained 15.8%, outperforming its industry’s rally of 9.9%. The estimate revision trend for current-year funds from operations (FFO) per share is also decent.However, supply has ramped up in recent times. In fact, supply growth is expected to remain elevated in 2018 as well as 2019, particularly in markets where the company has exposure. The higher supply in some of the company’s key markets might affect its pricing power.Further, hike in interest rates can pose a challenge for Host Hotels. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company that would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate. Moreover, REIT stock yields become less attractive when treasury yields rise.Host Hotels currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

109,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) has clinched a lease deal with a furniture delivery and fulfillment service company — Metropolitan Warehouse & Delivery — for ePort 960. This facility is the company’s 220,200-square-foot warehouse property at 960 High Street in Perth Amboy.With this lease deal for the whole building, Duke Realty has achieved full occupancy for its New Jersey in-service portfolio. This highlights the elevated demand for modern warehouse properties closer to the New York metropolitan area, and reflects Duke Realty’s solid capacity to leverage on the favorable trend. Particularly, the ePort 960 property is well suited for last-mile fulfilment operations.ePort 960 was added to Duke Realty’s portfolio last year as part of its 3.1-million-square-foot New Jersey industrial portfolio acquisition, which comprised six buildings, as well as two development sites situated along the I-95 corridor. Further, the 960 High Street property is among the three new industrial buildings, which are together referred as the ePort Logistics Center owned by Duke Realty in Perth Amboy.Notably, of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction and last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs to scale new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3%, for the U.S. industrial market, in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Moreover, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This, in turn, is spurring demand for industrial space.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Specifically, it should be noted that Duke Realty has resorted to sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. The company already has 5.7 million square feet of industrial properties in its New Jersey portfolio besides having properties in other key markets. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.In addition, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 9.1% in the past three months, outperforming 4.2% growth recorded by its industry.

Construction of the facility, which is the second building of the project initiated by the company in 2016, will likely conclude by the first quarter of 2019.The first phase of development work, for a 256,210-square-foot building, finished last October. The building has been leased to a personal storage company, PODS.The new building will have 32-foot-high ceilings, 59 trailer parking spaces as well as 239 parking spaces. Further, the location of the building is extremely favorable as the tenants will be able to bring goods by utilizing the Port of Oakland, situated across the street, along with three interstate highways located near the site.Tenants are giving increased importance to these facilities as it can serve both as a last mile and first mile property. Thus, the company expects higher rental rates than the industry due to these facilities and the location advantage.Dan Letter, managing director of capital deployment in the Northwest for Prologis informed, “The fact that we’re going vertical on these buildings now has been in the works for over a decade.” He further added, “It’s right down the fairway of our corporate strategy, which is to continue to push into the urban core where consumption is rising the fastest.”The entire site will span across 675,000 square feet, with three buildings of warehouse and logistics.Specifically, amid e-commerce boom, recovering economy and job market gains, elevating consumption levels, and healthy manufacturing environment; the demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to remain robust. This, in turn, is offering significant impetus to industrial real estate investment trusts like Prologis, Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Particularly, with a large customer base, companies are shifting their strategies toward same-day delivery and other services, which are propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. As a result, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values and Prologis remains well poised to take advantage of this trend.In line with its efforts to capitalize on the favorable conditions surrounding industrial real estate markets, in April 2018, Prologis entered into a definitive agreement with DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) to acquire the latter in an $8.4-billion stock-for-stock deal, including debt assumption. Notably, the deal, which is anticipated to create near-term synergies of nearly $80 million, was unanimously approved by both companies’ board of directors.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has outperformed its industry in the past six months.

Net-leased for 11 years to Amazon Fulfillment Service, this buyout marks the company’s second property leased to Amazon.The purchase of this industrial property, which is situated on around 31.27 acres, in the Mobile, AL MSA, is a strategic fit. This is because it will help Monmouth Real Estate capitalize on the growing demand for the Port of Mobile due to the completion of the Panama Canal expansion.Per the company, over the past years, shipping container growth at the U.S. East Coast ports is surpassing that of the West Coast ports. Moreover, with two interstate highway systems and five Class-1 railroads serving the port, industrial real estate assets in the region are likely to experience solid demand for space.Of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance, and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization.As such, industrial REITs are scaling new heights.

(PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This, in turn, is spurring demand for industrial space.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated.

113,DRE,"Terreno Realty Corporation (TRNO  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has sold an industrial building in Hialeah, FL, on Jun 25, 2018. The property has been sold for approximately $24.3 million. Through this sale, Terreno recognized an unleveraged internal rate of return of approximately 11.5%.The property is situated at 215 SE 10th Avenue, on approximately 10.5 acres. It consists of an industrial distribution building, spanning around 302,000 square feet. It is 100% leased to a single tenant.

Specifically, Terreno targets functional buildings at in-fill locations, with high population density and which are situated near high volume-distribution points. The company is currently fortifying its portfolio in six major port cities — Los Angeles, Northern New Jersey/New York City, San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Miami and Washington, D.C. — which depict solid demographic trends and have strong barriers to entry that limit new supply.In fact, on May 7, the company shelled out $6 million to purchase an industrial property in Renton, WA.

114,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 26, after the market closes. Encouragingly, the same day, prior to the open of trading, this Indianapolis, IN-based industrial REIT is set to join the S&P 500 index.Last quarter, Duke Realty delivered a positive surprise of 10.34%. Results were backed by growth in revenues. Also, in-service occupancy reached a record level of 97.7% in the quarter.Additionally, over the trailing four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and met in the other, with an average beat of around 4.25%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuoteDuke Realty’s shares have climbed 4.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.2%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. This augurs well because the industrial real estate market has been experiencing solid growth, attributed to supply chain modernization and expansion, which is leading to higher demand from e-commerce customers, third party logistic providers and traditional warehousing customers.While there is a rising demand for modern logistics facilities with the vacancy rates tightening, new supply is still manageable which has been pushing up rents significantly in many of the markets.Amid this, Duke Realty is well poised to benefit from its capacity to offer modern distribution facilities in strategic in-fill locations. In fact, with over 135 million square feet of high-quality bulk distribution real estate in 21 major U.S. logistics markets nationwide, the company is anticipated to witness revenue growth from this asset category in the second quarter and witness high level of occupancy.However, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through consistent divestitures. Notably, the company completed significant disposition of office property in 2016, thereby exiting from the suburban office sector. Moreover, in May, the company made efforts to shed its medical office business and portfolio for $2.8 billion. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact tends to drag the company’s quarterly results and weigh on its profitability.Also, over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of funds from operations (“FFO”) per share for the to-be-reported quarter moved down 3.2% to 30 cents, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Duke Realty is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 30 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).This combination of a 0.00% ESP and a Sell rank makes it difficult to predict a beat this season.In fact, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report), slated to release second-quarter results on Jul 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #2.

115,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) is making concerted efforts to capitalize on healthy fundamentals of the industrial real estate market. Recently, the company announced that it started developing an 183,296-square-foot bulk warehouse at Glendale Heights in the Central DuPage submarket. The new building, situated at 990 North Avenue (Route 64) and close to I-355, is expected to be delivered in November 2018.Having decent freeway access, the construction of this building on a speculative basis seems a strategic fit for the company. This is because the Central DuPage submarket enjoys proximity to downtown Chicago and has densely inhabited neighborhoods in its surroundings.Moreover, the area is a preferred choice for companies, seeking last-mile distribution locations. Also, with limited availability, the submarket enjoys solid leasing activity. Duke Realty already has a presence in the submarket, with five other buildings, aggregating more than 1.3 million square feet. All the buildings are fully leased.Notably, industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs) are indeed firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability declined for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In order to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.In fact, despite supply picking up the pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.With recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated in the future. Moreover, with healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high.    Specifically, speaking about Duke Realty, we note that the company has resorted to the sale of suburban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 11.9% in the past three months, outperforming 4.7% growth recorded by its industry.

117,DRE,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report), Public Storage (PSA  -  Free Report) and UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Apr 25.Rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining REITs’ performance, not all players in the space are equally poised to excel or fall behind this season.Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps, year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE. Moreover, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest mark since CBRE started following the metric in 1989. High consumption levels, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment amid recovering economy and job market are fueling demand.However, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in the Jan-Mar quarter. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Furthermore, the self-storage industry is anticipated to experience solid demand backed by favorable demographic changes, improving job market and rising incomes, as well as events like marriages, shifting, death, and even divorce. Also, due to shorter leasing periods, this REIT has the power to adjust its rents quickly to any rate hike.Therefore, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.AvalonBay Communities Inc.Residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Additionally, increasing consumer confidence driven by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promises brighter prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT. Amid these, the company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy.However, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is expected to have put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.  (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?)In a March-issued operating update for the first quarter, AvalonBay stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3-2.4% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is $558.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 6.9% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share is pegged at $2.18, indicating projected increase of 4.3% year over year.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that AvalonBay is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.In fact, though AvalonBay has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -0.28% makes surprise prediction difficult.Moreover, AvalonBay has a mixed surprise history, as evident from the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteDuke Realty CorporationIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. Admittedly, this asset class has been witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is spurring demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, helping the industrial real estate market to record growth.Nonetheless, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, which includes the significant disposition of sub-urban office assets and medical office buildings. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed. Furthermore, the company faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of the commercial real estate. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors. (Read more: Duke Realty to Post Q1 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $183.8 million, indicating a decline of 15.7% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is 30 cents, pointing to an estimated year-over-year decline of 6.3%.Although Duke Realty has a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, its Earnings ESP of -1.70% lowers chances of any positive surprise this season.The story about Duke Realty’s decent surprise history is better told by the chart below:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuotePublic StoragePublic Storage is one of the largest owners and operators of storage facilities in the United States. High brand value, strategic acquisitions, robust presence in key cities and healthy balance sheet serve as major growth drivers for the company. The company is likely to be able to achieve reasonable rate hike for its existing customers. In addition, acquisition and expansion initiatives are anticipated to stoke growth.Amid these, the company remains well poised to record growth in revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $668.9 million, depicting projected rise of 3.6%. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at $2.46, indicating an expected rise of 5.1% year over year.Nevertheless, supply has been rising in a number of markets and this adversely affects the company’s pricing power. In fact, it operates in a highly fragmented market in the nation, with intense competition from numerous private, regional and local operators. This, in turn, limits the company’s power to raise rents and turn on more discounting.

Additionally, it has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter. Specifically, the company is predicted to benefit from favorable demographic trends. There is a steady demand for rental apartments from both new millennial households and empty nesters. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, the company has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail landlords’ ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. Consequently, concession levels are estimated to have remained at the higher end, while UDR’s pricing power might have been limited in the quarter.

118,DRE,"If the rate hike in March and projections for the number of increases this year and in the next have made investors skeptical about their investment in the REIT industry, then perhaps this is the right time to reconsider.This is because total returns from REITs not only rebounded in March, but also outshined the S&P 500’s gain. Particularly, according to REIT.com, the broadest index of the U.S. REIT industry — the FTSE Nareit All REITs Index — locked in a gain of 3.74% in the month, while the S&P 500 incurred a loss of 2.54%.While REITs’ dependence on debt for business and the fact that these are considered bond substitutes, for their high and consistent dividend-paying nature, made investors skeptical, it seems that they are now thinking otherwise. Rather, they are emphasizing individual market dynamics which end up playing a crucial role in the performance of REITs.For example, take the industrial REITs which registered 4.59% growth in March. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially, but also shrunk 20 bps year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE.Admittedly, this asset class is witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is driving demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms.Particularly, with a larger customer base, e-commerce boom and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other such options, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid rise in asset values.And why not! According to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This is surely spurring demand for industrial space.In fact, despite supply picking up pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Further, a healthy manufacturing environment, a recovering economy and job market gains are likely to drive demand from other sectors besides e-commerce. So, shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Currently, Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and have a projected growth rate of 4.6%, 4.4% and 6%, respectively.

119,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) recently announced developing a 277,222-square-foot build-to-suit facility in Maple Grove for Minneapolis-based ILLUME. The building will serve as new headquarters for the candle manufacturer.The construction of the facility, which will have office/manufacturing/warehouse spaces, is scheduled to commence in second-quarter 2018 and significant completion is expected in first-quarter 2019.Specifically, the building is being built on 12.65 acres of land and will have more than 20,000 square feet of Class A office space on two levels. In addition, there will be more than 75,000 square feet of light manufacturing, 36′ clear height, and parking for accommodation of up to 275 cars.The facility with modern features will be positioned within Duke Realty’s master-planned project — Arbor Lakes Business Park — situated adjacent to Arbor Lakes Retail. Further, with amenities, such as more than 140 retailers, 65 restaurants and five hotels in its vicinity, the property will likely help ILLUME lure more employees and drive growth.Notably, Duke Realty had resorted to the sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. The latest move is in sync with its expansion efforts and the company already enjoys ownership of approximately five million square feet of industrial space in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.In addition, recently, the company completed the acquisition of a 3.1-million-square-foot industrial property in New Jersey. The move has helped the company expand its New Jersey industrial portfolio to 5.6 million square feet.As a matter of fact, the industrial real estate asset category has grabbed attention, of late, due to elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market, and a healthy manufacturing environment. This is opening up growth opportunities for industrial REITs like Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report).Duke Realty is well positioned to benefit from escalating demand for industrial properties by offering modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations. The company enjoys ownership and operations of industrial properties spread across nearly 146 million rentable square feet of space. These properties are located across 21 key logistics markets. However, large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term. Further, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns.Duke Realty currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

120,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of a 3.1 million-square-foot industrial property in New Jersey. The move has helped the company expand its New Jersey industrial portfolio to 5.6 million square feet.The latest acquired portfolio includes six newly built warehouses and two land sites for future development. Located along the I-95 corridor, the acquired portfolio enjoys proximity to New York City and boasts features suitable for improved product storage and distribution like 36′ clear heights and sufficient automobile and trailer parking.While the buildings in the acquired portfolio were delivered within the past year, Duke Realty has already started developing a 661,000-square-foot warehouse on one of the acquired sites, 429 Delancy Street in Newark. The company expects to deliver this building by 2018-end. Further, a 194,000-square-foot warehouse has been planned on an acquired parcel at 5 Ethel Boulevard in Wood-Ridge.Duke Realty’s expansion in New Jersey is a strategic step. The company is focused on enhancing its portfolio in Tier I distribution markets.In 2007, the company made a foray into the New Jersey market with the acquisition of a former GM plant in Linden. Soon after, the company started the site’s redevelopment. Later on, the company delivered three modern warehouses on the site, which are presently fully leased.  In 2013, the company expanded its New Jersey portfolio by acquiring three buildings in Cranbury and Logan Township spanning 1.3 million square feet in total.  Again in 2017, the portfolio was enhanced with a 156,256-square-foot building buyout in Teterboro.Notably, the industrial real estate asset category has grabbed attention due to elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and a healthy manufacturing environment. This is opening up growth opportunities for industrial REITs like Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report).Duke Realty had resorted to the sale of sub-urban office assets and medical office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. In fact, the latest acquisition helped the company in making a fast deployment of a substantial part of its proceeds from its last year’s $3 billion medical office building portfolio sale.In fact, Duke Realty enjoys ownership and operations of industrial properties spread across nearly 146 million rentable square feet of space. These properties are located across 21 key logistics markets. Nevertheless, large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term.

121,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) has started developing Fairfield Logistics Center 7940 — a 284,865-square-foot bulk warehouse in Fairfield. The move comes as part of the company’s concerted efforts to capitalize on healthy fundamentals of the industrial real estate market.The new building, situated on the Seward Road close to its intersection with Tylersville Road and in proximity to a number of Duke Realty industrial properties in the Cincinnati metro area, will likely be delivered in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be accessible through multiple routes and is within five miles of both I-75 and I-275.Having considerable access to highways, the construction of this building on a speculative basis, which will provide modern warehouse space for users with immediate needs, is a strategic fit for the company. This is because the Cincinnati metro area enjoys a central location which offers distributors the scope to reach a bulk of the U.S. population in a one-day drive. Duke Realty already has a robust presence in the region, with several of its properties, including Union Centre Industrial Park in West Chester, and its existing portfolio has at or near 100% occupancy.In fact, with Fairfield Logistics Center 7940 being located in the TriCounty submarket and enjoying highway accessibility, it is likely to be a preferred choice for companies seeking last-mile delivery facilities.Of late, demand for modern distribution facilities have been getting a significant boost as companies are compelled to enhance, and renovate their distribution and production platforms to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction and last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.These have helped the industrial REITs scale new heights. Per a study by the commercial real estate services firm, CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3%, for the U.S. industrial market, in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents inched up 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square foot, denoting the highest level since 1989.Particularly, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high, giving significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Specifically, Duke Realty has resorted to sale of suburban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 10.3% in the past three months, outperforming 6.2% growth recorded by its industry.

122,DRE,"Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will construct a new bulk distribution facility spanning 635,000 square feet in Flower Mound, a northern suburb of Fort Worth, TX. Notably, 71% of the facility has been preleased to Pittsburgh-based architectural paints and coatings supplier — PPG.The remaining 185,000 square feet of area in the building will be available for lease. The building will feature 36′-clear height and cross-dock configuration. It is scheduled to be delivered in May 2019.The bulk warehouse is situated at 1001 Lakeside Parkway in the company’s Lakeside Ranch business park. This industrial development is strategically located north of DFW International Airport and has convenient access to important highways. The new facility will strengthen Duke Realty’s foothold in North Texas, where the company has sizable in-fill industrial developments.  The company’s focus to expand its industrial portfolio in the Dallas-Fort Worth area is a strategic fit as the area has been witnessing robust demand for warehouse and distribution facilities, with nearly 20 million square feet of industrial space under construction. In fact, this industrial real estate investment trust has more than 15.8 million square feet of industrial properties in North Texas.PPG will use the facility as a distribution center for its architectural paints and coatings operations in the Southwest U.S. The distribution facility will be the largest centre for PPG in the United States and Canada. Further, it will enable the company to grow its presence in the Fort Worth area, as well as complements Duke Realty’s new stores in the area.Industrial real estate investment trusts (REIT) are indeed firing on all cylinders, supported by growth in e-commerce that has compelled companies to enhance, and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Furthermore, with the recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. Hence, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to shoot up.

125,DRE,"Of late, Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) has been experiencing solid demand for its industrial properties. Recently, the company announced that its speculatively developed 166,392-square-foot industrial building — Turnpike Crossing 6747 — has been completely leased within three months of delivery. This building marks the company’s third 100% leased industrial building in its Turnpike Crossing industrial park.Notably, Turnpike Crossing enjoys a solid advantage for its location and accessibility. While Turnpike Crossing 6747 is fully leased to five companies, the prior-developed buildings in the park — Turnpike Crossing 1315 and 1333 — are 100% leased to six companies. The company is also considering a fourth building, spanning 146,250 square feet of space, in Turnpike Crossing. In fact, South Florida’s Turnpike Crossing encompasses 67.2 acres which can accommodate 882,850 square feet of area in up to six, modern, Class A warehouses.Furthermore, Duke Realty noted that the completion of 387,180 square feet in new leases, renewals and expansions in its metro-area portfolio, since the beginning of 2018, along with the 2.7 million square feet in leases signed in 2017, helped the company’s 9.7-million-square-foot Cincinnati metro-area portfolio achieve full occupancy.Notably, the industrial real estate asset category has grabbed attention due to elevated demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and a healthy manufacturing environment. This is opening up growth opportunities for industrial REITs, including Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report), Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report).Particularly, Duke Realty has resorted to sale of sub-urban office assets and medical office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. Moreover, the quick leasing of its properties built on a speculative basis underscores the robust demand in the market for modern, first-class distribution space.In fact, Duke Realty enjoys ownership and operations of industrial properties spread across nearly 146 million rentable square feet of space.

126,DRE,"Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) is well positioned to benefit from an escalating demand for industrial properties by offering modern distribution facilities in strategic infill locations. Also, the medical office asset sale enabled the company to turn into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. However, large-scale asset dispositions are expected to have a dilutive effect on earnings in the near term. Further, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns.In January 2018, Duke Realty reported  fourth-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (FFO) per share of 30 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure was lower than the year-ago tally of 31 cents. Total rental and related revenues of $179.4 million for the quarter jumped 11.5% on a year-over-year basis. Further, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $175 million. The results reflected growth in same-property net operating income on the back of solid rental increase.Notably, the industrial real estate market has been witnessing elevated demand for modern, bulk distribution properties and warehouses. This demand is stemming from the growth of industries and companies opting for measures to improve supply chain efficiencies. This is helping the industrial real estate market to grow. Given Duke Realty’s solid capacity to offer such properties, it remains well poised to capitalize on this trend.In fact, as part of its strategy to concentrate on industrial properties, in recent years, the company has made concerted efforts to lower exposure to suburban office assets. Further, it divested its medical office business in the prior year. Such efforts are particularly aimed at simplifying the company’s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT.Moreover, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors. Duke Realty has raised its regular common dividend rate by 5.9%, 5.6% and 5.3% in fourth-quarter 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, the company contributed $70 million toward special dividend in 2015. Also, during fourth-quarter 2017, the company paid 85 cents as special dividends.Nevertheless, as Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, this included the significant disposition of suburban office assets and MOBs in recent times. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. Such moves tend to drag the company’s quarterly results and weigh on its profitability.Though the company’s large development pipeline is encouraging for its future growth, it increases operational risks by exposing it to rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks. The company also faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of commercial real estates. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Further, shares of Duke Realty have underperformed its industry in the past six months, declining 13.3% compared with the industry’s descend of 8.6%. Currently, Duke Realty carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

129,DRE,"Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report) recently announced signing of lease with 4PX Express USA for ePort 1000, which is the company’s 354,250-square-foot warehouse property at 1000 High Street in Perth Amboy.The leasing of space to the 3PL focused on e-commerce fulfillment and logistics solutions highlights the elevated demand for industrial real estate properties in the market amid the exponential growth in the e-commerce industry. Particularly, this facility is perfectly suited for e-commerce fulfilment in the New York metropolitan area.Notably, ePort 1000 was added to Duke Realty’s portfolio in November 2017 as part of its 3.1 million-square-foot New Jersey industrial portfolio acquisition, which comprised six buildings, as well as two development sites situated along the I-95 corridor. Further, 1000 High Street property is among the three new industrial buildings, which are together referred as the ePort Logistics Center owned by Duke Realty in Perth Amboy.Industrial REITs are indeed firing on all cylinders and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report) — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In fact, to support the e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.Moreover, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution-center space compared with traditional retailers. This is surely spurring demand for industrial space.In fact, despite supply picking up pace, demand remains robust, creating scope for rental rates to grow in several markets. This is offering significant impetus to industrial REITs like Prologis, Duke Realty and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to flourish.Going forward, with a recovering economy and job market gains, as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to soar.Specifically, speaking about Duke Realty, we note that the company has resorted to the sale of sub-urban office assets and medical-office buildings in the past, in a bid to transform itself into a domestic-focused industrial property REIT. This augurs well amid the favorable market environment in this asset class. The company already has 5.7 million square feet of industrial properties besides having properties in other key markets. However, the dilutive impact of asset dispositions on earnings, stiff competition and rate hike remain concerns for the company.In addition, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 8.4% in the past three months, outperforming 3.8% growth recorded by its industry.

Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are expected to decline on a year-over-year basis.Last quarter, this commercial real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line FFO per share. Results witnessed same-property net operating income growth on the back of decent rental growth.The company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters and met estimates on one occasion, with the average beat being 5.1%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Realty Corporation QuoteNotably, Duke Realty’s fundamental strength has helped its shares gain 0.9% in the past three months, outperforming decline of 4.3% recorded by the industry.Will the stock’s rally continue post the first-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Factors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsIn recent years, Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. Admittedly, this asset class is witnessing improving fundamentals amid economic recovery and growth of e-commerce business. This is driving demand for warehouse space as companies are compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms, which is helping the industrial real estate market to grow.In fact, per a study by the commercial real estate services firm — CBRE Group Inc. — availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. The figure not only marked a contraction of 6 basis points (bps) sequentially but also a decline of 20 bps year over year, on average, across 50 markets that are followed by CBRE.However, Duke Realty is enhancing its portfolio mix through continued divestitures, which includes the significant disposition of suburban office assets and medical office buildings. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect on earnings cannot be bypassed.Further, the company faces significant competition from developers, owners and operators of the commercial real estate. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors.Moreover, over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the first quarter remained unchanged at 30 cents, reflecting a lack of solid catalyst. Also, it points to a year-over-year decline of 6.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $183.8 million, indicating a decline of 15.7% year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Duke Realty will likely beat estimates this season.

(PSB  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter results on Apr 24, has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.
