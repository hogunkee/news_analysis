0,MCO,"General Electric (GE) could be in line for a credit downgrade after Moody's (MCO) Investors Service changed the GE's outlook to negative Wednesday.Moody's reaffirmed credit ratings for GE and GE Capital, but said the lower outlook, which could be a precursor to a credit downgrade in the months ahead, ""reflects the added headwinds to restoring GE's credit profile"" due to a $1.5 billion reserve recorded in relation to a Justice Department probe into GE Capital's discontinued mortgage business.It is yet another blow for the beleaguered conglomerate and came as management was feeling the full fury of investors at the firm's annual shareholder meeting.Meanwhile, the aviation unit could face new competition in the engine market, as Rolls-Royce and Boeing (BA) rival Airbus (EADSY) have sealed a deal for a new collaboration.Dow Jones industrial average component GE sank 4.3% to close at 14.05 on the stock market today.Earlier this month, JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa wondered how long credit-rating agencies can ""remain on the sidelines with their commentary, seemingly giving GE precious time to work their way out,"" given a host of problems.Problems dogging the 126-year-old industrial giant include ""material changes in fundamentals,"" little progress on asset sales, delays in revenue recognition restatements, a lack of ""clean numbers"" and an SEC investigation, according to Tusa. He pointed out that during the Great Recession, the company was AAA-rated, but still ended up needing a bailout.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

""It is a lot of change, change is not easy in any organization … the company is going to come out stronger.""And the firm now faces a further threat in the lucrative jet engine field, as Rolls-Royce and Airbus have inked a deal to collaborate on development of the UltraFan.The British company wants the new engine to be 25% more fuel efficient than the earliest version.Both widebody and narrow-body planes will be able to use the UltraFan due to its scalable design. Rolls-Royce currently only makes engines for widebody jets.A more immediate target for Rolls-Royce is fixing issues with its Trent 1000. The engine's parts have been wearing out quicker than expected. Boeing's 787 Dreamliner jets use the Trent 1000.GE's engine business is in the spotlight due to the ongoing FAA investigation into the fatal Southwest Airlines (LUV) accident. The Boeing 737 involved was powered by an engine made by CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines.The engine exploded, causing the first fatal U.S. airline accident in almost a decade.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN: After GE Earnings Restatement, This Bad News Is 'Almost A Certainty' If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?

2,MCO,"General Electric (GE) needs to boost its target for raising capital, even after its new transportation deal, to hit deleveraging targets, and may also have to consider another dividend cut, according to JPMorgan.GE still must come up with billions of dollars in additional capital to fix its balance sheet, analyst Steve Tusa wrote Tuesday, while reaffirming an underweight rating on GE shares and a year-end price target of 11.""With little available cash flow to naturally de-lever, we don't see how, from a risk mitigation perspective, a company of this size and complexity cannot be seriously considering at least a dividend cut and/or a more aggressive approach to reinforcing its capital base,"" he said.On Wednesday, CEO John Flannery warned there will be no profit growth at its core power business this year, adding that the company will see how its turnaround plans play out to determine the dividend.That may have been interpreted as leaving the door open to another cut, but sources told CNBC Thursday that GE doesn't have plans to cut its payout in 2019.Shares rallied 3% to 14.60 on the stock market today after diving 7% Wednesday on Flannery's bearish profit comments.JPMorgan's analysis followed news that GE's transportation unit will combine with Wabtec (WAB) in an $11.1 billion deal, providing GE with $2.9 billion in cash at the merger's close.But in Tusa's view, GE needs roughly $32 billion in capital, far more than its target of $20 billion in asset sales, to lower its debt-to-adjusted earnings ratio to 2.5.He identified possible sources of capital, saying its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE) could be monetized for roughly $20 billion, while its stake in the merged Wabtec company could yield about $2 billion with other divestitures raking in $4.5 billion or so. But that would still leave a shortfall of $6 billion, Tusa said.Meanwhile, Reuters reported Tuesday that GE is looking for ways to sell off its insurance business, which forced the company to book a steep charge earlier this year.GE had promised in November to shed $20 billion in assets to soothe ratings agencies and find ""their way to get to 2.5x leverage,"" Tusa noted.But he found its leverage ratio is actually worse than generally accepted, estimating it at 4.4x vs. the 3.9x figure that Moody's (MCO) has estimated in its credit ratings.Moody's assumptions on GE's leverage recently ticked up from 3.2x in the fall of 2017, Tusa noted, after the firm included the impact of higher restructuring costs on earnings. Meanwhile, GE's pension obligations remain significant.Against that backdrop, the ""current dividend payout ratio remains too high for the company to deleverage over time simply from running its business,"" Tusa said.The stock bears a 48-cent annual dividend, yielding 3.1%, after the company sliced its dividend payout in half in November.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Boeing Pounces On Lion Air Deal; Stock Soars On China's XiGE Will Offload One Of Its Oldest Businesses In New CEO's Biggest Deal

3,MCO,"General Electric (GE) got a price target hike based on the outlook for next year's earnings and free cash flow, but the troubled industrial conglomerate's shares could still go lower in the shorter term.Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy raised his price target to 15 from 13 in a note to clients Thursday, citing his estimate for 2019 EPS of $1.05 and industrial free cash flow (FCF) of 93 cents per share. He also raised his 2019 revenue view to $126.49 billion from $125.4 billion.But he maintained a hold rating on GE stock, saying he remains on the sidelines ""absent a more material, dynamic breakup.""Prospects for 2018, however, are a different story. McCarthy warned GE management is likely to lower core 2018 EPS and industrial free cash flow guidance after it announces further reductions in its sprawling portfolio, likely in Q2, adding downside risk to GE shares.While GE management has kept its 2018 EPS guidance at $1-$1.07, McCarthy cut his EPS outlook this year to 90 cents from 95 cents and trimmed his revenue view to $122.49 billion from $124.42 billion.GE is restructuring its businesses, and has signaled even its flagship power, health and aviation units could become separately traded companies.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

CVS shares fell 2.9%, recovering somewhat after the Aetna news followed the Amazon report. Amazon shares changed little during regular trading but surged 7.8% late after reporting quarterly results that sailed past estimates.Meanwhile, news about Amazon's pharmacy licenses sent Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) down 3.2%, while a host of drug distributors also got whacked.

Marsh & McLennan (MMC) leapt above the 81.10 buy point of a base-on-base pattern.

Its insurance broker industry group was one of Friday's best.Moody's (MCO) edged above its 135.30 buy point. The provider of credit ratings for institutional investors saw slow trading, about two-thirds less volume than normal. That made the breakout suspicious.Building industry stocks, as well some leisure and health care industry groups, also made gains of more than 1% in today's trading.The medical products industry group is another one showing bullish behavior, with two more breakouts in the group Friday.Baxter International (BAX) topped the 63.24 buy point of a flat base. ResMed (RMD) broke out past a 79.73 buy point of a cup-without-handle base. Although the price gains were strong, volume was disappointingly weak in both stocks. Still, the breakouts followed one by Boston Scientific (BSX) on Thursday. Shares of the medical device maker followed through on Friday, despite lackluster volume on that breakout.Consolidated Edison (ED), a utility that serves the New York-New Jersey area, rose above the 85.23 buy point of a flat base.

12,MCO,"Companies in November added the most workers to U.S. payrolls since June, data from Automatic Data Processing (ADP) showed Wednesday.Private payrolls climbed by 216,000 — beating forecasts for 170,000 — after a 119,000 gain in October that was revised down from 147,000. Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and builders, reduced head counts by 11,000 after a 20,000 decrease last month. Service providers boosted payrolls by 228,000 after a 138,000 increase.Hiring managers' need for more workers is helping to sustain the job-market progress that Federal Reserve officials have noted ahead of their December meeting, at which they're expected to raise interest rates for the first time in a year. The ADP report may also help bolster economists' forecasts for private payrolls before Friday's release of November employment data from the Labor Department.""There is little evidence that the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election dampened hiring,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics (MCO), said in a prepared statement. Moody's produces the figures with ADP.Hiring in construction rose by 2,000, after a drop of 16,000 in October.

13,MCO,"Deutsche Bank AG said it reached a $7.2 billion agreement to resolve a years-long U.S. investigation into its dealings in mortgage-backed securities, removing a legal hurdle that fueled investor angst.Deutsche Bank will pay a $3.1 billion civil penalty and provide $4.1 billion in relief to consumers under a settlement in principle with U.S. authorities, which was announced by the Frankfurt-based bank in a statement early Friday. The firm expects pretax charges of about $1.2 billion this quarter because of the fine.While the deal is below the Justice Department's initial request of $14 billion, Germany's biggest lender still faces U.S. investigations into other matters and potentially expensive civil suits. Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has made resolving litigation a priority as he seeks to restore confidence in the lender.""The financial consequences, if any, of the consumer relief are subject to the final terms of the settlement, and are not currently expected to have a material impact on 2016 financial results,"" the bank said.Ahead of Friday’s statement, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods had estimated a fine exceeding $9 billion would cause the bank’s capital to fall to dangerous levels requiring action.The bank will publish preliminary 2016 results as scheduled on Feb. 2, it said.Deutsche Bank had set aside 5.9 billion euros ($6.2 billion) for all of its outstanding legal costs as of Sept. 30, when its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, stood at 11.1 percent. The bank targets a level of at least 12.5 percent in 2018. Each $1 billion of litigation costs not covered by provisions would lower the ratio by 20-25 basis points, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Arjun Bowry has estimated.In a related case, the Justice Department sued Barclays (BCS) for fraud over its sale of mortgage bonds after the bank balked at paying the amount the government sought in negotiations. The lawsuit announced on Thursday is rare for big banks, which typically settle with the government rather than risk drawn-out litigation and a possible trial.The Obama administration is pressing to wrap up investigations of Wall Street firms for creating and selling the subprime mortgage bonds that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. Authorities have already extracted more than $46 billion in fines from six U.S. financial institutions over their dealings in mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America (BAC), which had the largest such settlement, agreed to pay $16.7 billion over bonds that were worth four times those of Deutsche Bank.Concern about whether Deutsche Bank had enough capital roiled markets and pushed the stock to a record low after it said in September that the U.S. Justice Department had made the opening request of $14 billion and that it had no intention of paying that amount.The consumer relief will include ""loan modifications"" and other assistance to homeowners and borrowers over at least five years, the bank said.The agreement doesn't resolve probes into whether the bank manipulated foreign-currency rates and precious metals prices and whether it facilitated transactions that helped investors illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. Deutsche Bank also faces civil lawsuits related to claims that its traders manipulated key interbank interest rates. It isn't clear how much more wrapping up these cases will cost.Deutsche Bank already has paid more than $9 billion in fines and legal settlements worldwide since the start of 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes settlements related to violations of U.S. sanctions, rigging of interest-rate benchmarks and allegations that it defrauded U.S.-backed mortgage issuers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.A slump in earnings, negative interest rates and challenging markets have caused the bank to continue to struggle this year. Cryan's strategy, announced in October 2015, called for cost cuts and the elimination of dividends for two years to preserve capital. Deutsche Bank has said it may not be profitable in 2016 as it focuses on moving past its legal battles.At least four other European banks remain under investigation over the role of their mortgage-backed securities business: Credit Suisse (CS), UBS (UBS), HSBC (HSBC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). In addition to Bank of America, U.S. banks that have settled include Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Wells Fargo (WFC) and Moody's (MCO) have disclosed U.S. investigations into their mortgage-backed securities dealings and have said they're cooperating.

14,MCO,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) continued to build its stock portfolio last year while shedding bond holdings.On Saturday, Berkshire released its list of stock holdings, along with full-year 2015 and fourth-quarter financial results.Buffett's top 15 stock holdings include what he calls the company's ""Big Four"" investments: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire purchased additional shares of IBM during the year, boosting its total ownership to 81.03 million shares, or an 8.4% ownership stake at the end of the year vs. 7.8% at the end of 2014. Wells Fargo grew to 500 million shares, or a 9.8% stake, up from 9.4%.At Coke and American Express, share buybacks raised Berkshire's percentage ownership. Its 400 million shares of Coke are a 9.3% stake, up from 9.2%. And it owns 151.6 million shares of American Express, or 15.6%, up from 14.8%.Buffett said a major Berkshire equity position that's not on the list of 15 is Bank of America (BAC).""We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At year-end, these shares were worth $11.8 billion,"" he said, adding that it's likely Berkshire will buy them just before the options expire.Buffett added: ""It is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth-largest equity investment.""Berkshire's class B shares closed up 1.7% in the stock market today, and they are up nearly 10% from a Feb. 3 intraday low. Although its position improved, its stock still traded below both its 50-day and 200-day averages.American Express rose 0.4%, Coke ended flat, IBM fell 0.8%, but Wells Fargo slid 2.4%.Among other Berkshire top stock holdings, it has 46.6 million shares of IBD Leaderboard stock AT&T (T) (0.8% ownership), 24.7 million shares of credit rating and research agency Moody's (MCO) (12.6%), 18.5 million shares of dialysis services company DaVita Healthcare Partners (DVA) (8.8%), and 22.16 million shares of heavy equipment maker Deere (DE) (7%).Berkshire has also been buying big blocks of oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX) since last summer, fueling speculation that it may be Buffett's next acquisition target. As of Dec. 31, Berkshire owned 55.38 million shares or 10.5% of the company, and its stake has since risen to around 15%. Phillips was up 1.5% at 80.27 Monday.Meanwhile, for a sixth year in a row, Buffett reduced his bond holdings amid continued low yields. Berkshire owned about $25 billion in aggregate, on an amortized cost basis as of Dec. 31, down from nearly $35 billion at the end of 2009, Bloomberg said. Buffett said bonds are such a poor investment tool that they ""should come with a warning label.""At the end of 2015, his biggest bond holdings were in foreign bonds, followed by corporate bonds, U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

16,MCO,"Verisk Analytics has watched its stock price soar to new highs, again and again, after its quarterly earnings reports. The stock notched a new high a couple of weeks ago after the company reported second-quarter earnings. The same thing occurred after it posted first-quarter and 2014 fourth-quarter results.Verisk (VRSK) provides risk assessment services and decision analytics to professionals in a variety of fields, including property/casualty insurance, financial services, health care, government, human resources and energy — the last of which it entered in May via the biggest acquisition in its history.The company has been on a pretty good roll of late, with three straight quarters of accelerated earnings gains.Earnings AccelerateAfter the close on July 28, Verisk posted a 35% year-over-year earnings increase — its biggest in at least a dozen quarters. Results easily surpassed consensus analyst views. The next day Verisk stock climbed 9% to a record high of 79.88 intraday before closing up 7% to 78.60.Similar spikes occurred on April 29, a day after Verisk reported Q1 results, and on Feb. 25, the day after it reported 2014 fourth-quarter earnings.How does Verisk view such stock action?""It's always interesting to try to understand that. Fundamentally, I'd say all of our verticals are doing well,"" said Eva Huston, Verisk's senior vice president and chief knowledge officer.In addition, she told IBD, the company has ""a lot of consistency"" in terms of financial performance.""Investors value that,"" she said.That consistency is partly the result of having expertise that spans more than 40 years.Verisk was founded in 1971 when Insurance Services Office, or ISO, launched operations as a not-for-profit advisory and rating organization providing services for the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry. The original business remains part of the company's Risk Assessment segment. Verisk also operates a Decision Analytics segment, which now makes up the bulk of the business.The Risk Assessment segment primarily helps property/casualty customers define, measure and manage risk via the flagship ISO subsidiary as well as several other units. The products and tools include data and statistical services, actuarial services, standardized insurance policy programs, underwriting information and rating-integrity tools.Its Decision Analytics segment provides a wide variety of customers with tools to help them make informed decisions about managing their assets and risk. These tools are used to predict future losses, select and price risk, detect and prevent fraud and quantify losses that have already happened.Decision Analytics Drive GrowthIn the second quarter, the Decision Analytics business posted a 24.6% revenue increase to $325.9 million, with more than half of the gain coming from the insurance sector. Revenue in the Risk Assessment segment grew 6% to $171.7 million.Total revenue for Verisk rose 17.5% to $497.6 million. Organic revenue, which excluded recent acquisitions and other items, grew 9.4% year over year.Verisk's second-quarter earnings came in at 77 cents a share, up 35.1% from a year earlier and well above consensus estimates for 66 cents.Technology Pays BackMuch of Verisk's recent profit growth can be traced to what it calls a ""build it once, sell it many times"" revenue model, as well as investments the company has made in new solutions, Huston says.""Over the past few years we have been doing more investing in our business, thinking up new analytics to help customers run their businesses better,"" she said.Huston cites the company's investments into its new software platform called Touchstone. Touchstone is designed to perform advanced analytics to help companies better assess their risk.""That took a fair amount of investment, but it allows us to increase our revenue growth,"" Huston said. ""We are now providing a solution that might have been used in a small portion of the insurance industry before, but can now be used by underwriters and a wider portion of the industry.""Similar investments have been made in Verisk's aerial imagery tools. Among other things, these tools let insurance customers view structures from their computers to assess associated risk. This lets them avoid the time and cost of visiting the structures themselves.Verisk's biggest investment came in May, when it closed its $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie, a Scotland-based provider of data analytics and commercial intelligence for the energy, chemicals, metal and mining industries.One major benefit of the acquisition — the biggest in Verisk's history — is that it greatly expands the company's global footprint.""Wood Mackenzie has offices around the world — in Tokyo, Hong Kong, China, Australia, all throughout Europe,"" Huston said. ""We can leverage that footprint into selling our existing solutions into those markets. For example, we have the opportunity to expand our footprint into China, where we didn't have a presence.""In a recent report, JPMorgan analyst Andrew Steinerman noted that ""WoodMac has the ability to transform Verisk on the global front,"" though the acquisition ""bears risk due to its energy end market."" He also expects reinvestments in WoodMac ""to boost revenues over the medium term.""The deal has already paid bottom-line benefits, notes Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Arash Soleimani: ""Verisk's (Q2) outperformance relative to our estimate stemmed mostly from likely recurring tax benefits associated with WoodMac's UK domicile and higher-than-expected gross margins.""Apple And Android AppsMeanwhile, Verisk continues to broaden its product lineup. On Aug. 5, it announced that its Verisk Insurance Solutions unit launched the ISO ClaimSearch mobile application available on Apple's (AAPL) iTunes and Google 's (GOOG) Google Play.The app gives subscribers, including adjusters and investigators, a new tool that provides real-time access to the company's database of claims.""ISO ClaimSearch mobile users will see instant search results to help them investigate and adjust claims more efficiently, whether they're on a roof, in a salvage yard, in a home, at a business, or at a catastrophe site,"" Carlos Martins, vice president and general manager of ISO ClaimSearch Solutions, said in a statement.Users will be able to securely access the claims inquiry function on ISO ClaimSearch via their iPhone, iPad or Android phone and tablet.Verisk has an IBD Composite Rating of 95. The company belongs to IBD's Commercial Services-Market Research group, which ranks No. 64 of 197 industries tracked. The group's biggest stocks by market cap are Thomson Reuters (TRI) and Moody's (MCO).

"
105,MCO,"As managed-care organization Centene readied its first-quarter report in April, investors were getting very nervous.
"
106,MCO,"This year brought the first quarter when the managed-care industry faced a new health-insurer fee imposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The fee will continue to rise through 2018.
"
107,MCO,"It was also the first full quarter of sales for Gilead Sciences' (GILD) mega-blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. While Sovaldi has far greater efficacy and lower toxicity than the traditional regimen of interferon, the $84,000 price tag for a full round of treatment — combined with the sheer volume of infected patients — led some insurers to grumble that it would break the bank.
"
108,MCO,"Centene's (CNC) largest competitor, UnitedHealth (UNH), seemed to confirm some of those fears when it reported its Q1 a week before Centene. Its results missed estimates, and one reason it gave was the $100 million in hepatitis C payouts.
"
109,MCO,"Centene seemed especially vulnerable to a similar impact, given the nature of its user base. Centene's specialty is the Medicaid managed-care business, which it conducts under state contracts. It also has a growing presence in ""correctional health care"" — that is, prisons. Thus its customers are largely poor and/or imprisoned,making them more likely to have hepatitis C.
"
110,MCO,"Consensus Crushed
"
111,MCO,"So it came as an enormous relief to Wall Street when Centene came out and crushed the consensus Q1 numbers and raised its full-year outlook. Profit jumped 36% over the year-earlier quarter to 57 cents a share, beating estimates by 14 cents, while revenue rose 37% to $3.46 billion, more than $200 million above the Street's consensus.
"
112,MCO,"Centene's chief strategy was to be well prepared, especially on the Sovaldi front, says Leerink analyst Ana Gupte.
"
113,MCO,"""They have been on watch far more than the commercial payers,"" Gupte told IBD. ""They've been trying to make sure they get some public-policy attention (so) they get some support from the broader health-care community with state Medicaid negotiation, so they get the reimbursement that they're seeking.""
"
114,MCO,"If the state does not put Sovaldi on its preferred formulary — such as in Texas, where Centene does a large amount of business — then Centene just won't pay out. This result has made Sovaldi even more controversial, as some regard it as inhumane to deny people such a superior drug. Centene CEO Michael Neidorff said on the Q1 conference call that the company has to follow state policy, but remarked, ""It is important to note these new therapies are curative; thus it is possible that longer-term savings will be realized from reducing other medical costs associated with hepatitis C.""
"
115,MCO,"At the same time, Centene has also been playing the other side of the market through the other segment of its business, specialty services. In April last year it acquired AcariaHealth, one of the largest independent specialty pharmacies in the U.S., which also happens to be one of the largest managers of hepatitis C care. That business actually makes more money from the purchase of expensive drugs.
"
116,MCO,"In his April 16 initiation report on Centene, UBS analyst A.J. Rice cited the specialty business as a key differentiator from Centene's peers.
"
117,MCO,"""The specialty services complement CNC's core Medicaid Managed Care business, diversify the company's revenue stream, provide higher-quality health outcomes to CNC's membership and others, and assist in controlling costs,"" Rice wrote. ""We believe the company's ability to cross-sell specialty products, including behavioral health, disease management, and pharmacy, has helped CNC to reprocure existing or win new business in the recent years.""
"
118,MCO,"Centene's rate of new business wins — it has captured 89% of the contracts it has bid on — has especially caught Wall Street's attention and driven its growth. When the company went public in 2001, it was operating in just three states. Today, it is in 20, and is the largest pure-play Medicaid MCO in the country.
"
119,MCO,"Analysts are expecting more growth as Medicaid coverage expands due to the ACA rollout. Rice said that new eligibility rules that went into effect at the start of this year could bring 80,000 new members to Centene, coming to about $240 million in revenue. The company is also expanding its membership rolls through buyouts, most recently when it acquired Community Health Solutions' contract with Louisiana, bringing 200,000 lives aboard.
"
120,MCO,"ObamaCare Exchanges
"
121,MCO,"Centene has also jumped into the ACA's new health insurance exchanges in nine states through its Ambetter brand. Neidorff said in April that its financial impact on 2014 would be minimal, but he said that by the end of the current quarter enrollment should reach about 70,000.
"
122,MCO,"""In the long run, we view this initiative positively,"" FBR analyst Steven Halper wrote in a May 19 note, but he added, ""Initial enrollment figures have been lackluster, and the company has indicated that it will reach the low end of its previous membership expectations from this segment.""
"
123,MCO,"Some analysts' investment theses on Centene include the possibility that it will be bought. In early June, in fact, there were rumors that non-profit hospital chain Ascension Health was looking to buy a health insurer active in 18 states, leading Gupte to speculate that Centene or WellCare Health Plans (WCG) was the target. That drove the stock to a new high until Citigroup debunked the rumor, but Centene may still be an attractive candidate in a consolidating industry.
"
124,MCO,"""Ascension was a long shot, particularly with Centene,"" Gupte said. ""But it's hardly the only company that's interested.""
"
125,MCO,"Analysts expect Centene's profit to grow 29% this year to $3.71 a share, then climb another 20% next year to $4.47.As managed-care organization Centene readied its first-quarter report in April, investors were getting very nervous.This year brought the first quarter when the managed-care industry faced a new health-insurer fee imposed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

345,MCO,"When the market uptrend resumed on April 29,  Moody's (MCO) broke out of a base in heavy volume.The base, however, was an oddly shaped cup with handle. The move to the bottom of the base involved only one week — a 22% dive in huge volume in the week ended Feb. 8.Normally, bulls like to see a stock consolidate in an orderly fashion.What was behind the dive?Companies that provide credit ratings have been and are the targets of lawsuits, government probes and general scapegoating efforts. As IBD reported on Feb. 8, concerns swirled that Moody's might become a target of the feds. The Justice Department at that time initiated a $5 billion civil suit against Standard & Poor's.In Q1, Moody's took a charge of 14 cents a share related to litigation settlements.CEO Raymond McDaniel said at a recent conference call that Moody's was the target of about four dozen U.S. lawsuits since the financial crisis and three dozen have been settled one way or another.The company's earnings have been rising since EPS declines in 2008-09.In the past three quarters, earnings grew 39%, 77% and 28%. Revenue climbed 30%, 33% and 13%. Pretax margin was 38.6% last year, the best in four years.Moody's Corp. pays a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share. The payout has doubled since late 2009, and the annualized yield is 1.3%.Increases in the payout appear likely. CFO Linda Huber said at the conference call that ""dividend yields could use a little bit of work.""About half of the company's cash balance is overseas. Huber confirmed that a high U.S. tax rate is keeping the money there.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) sold 1.75 million shares recently but still holds 26.7 million shares.

444,MCO,"Warren Buffett’s impeccable knack for investment has enabled him to beat markets most of the time since 1964, when he took over the reins of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A, (BRK.B  -  Free Report). This makes Buffett the unrivaled investment guru, widely followed by equity investors across the world.His investment acumen is evident from the way Berkshire Hathaway has grown into a conglomerate, piece by piece, over the years as a result of numerous small and big acquisitions. Now, Berkshire Hathaway houses more than 90 subsidiaries, selling everything from ice-cream to insurance under one roof.Buffett manages a huge portfolio of equities, cherry picked by himself and invested in float primarily generated from Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance business. Buffett eyes bargain stocks and mostly considers the intrinsic value (fair value of a stock calculated by its future earnings power) of a stock for making investment.His investment apart from value also includes understanding of the business, competitive advantages and capable management. These iron clad rules of value investing and his prowess to read Wall Street like a book has earned his securities portfolio impressive returns on investment for the past several years, a trend which continued this year too despite markets’ bull run.How Have the Markets Been This Year?The bull run of the U.S equity markets is now 9 years old, the second-longest in recent financial history. The 2017 boom was marked by Donald Trump’s take over of the White House, which pushed major indices to multiple highs on several occasions. The indices were favored by Trump’s pro growth policies to boost the economy and corporate profits, cut taxes, loosen regulations, increase spending and inflation.Trump promised to double the pace of economic growth from 2%, create 25 million jobs over 10 years, and make the domestic economy the strongest in the world. The positive sentiments sent the stock markets rallying.Performance of Buffett’s Equity PortfolioDespite equity markets’ strong rally, Buffett was able to emerge as a winner. The value of his investment portfolio as of Dec 31, 2017 was $157.65 billion, up 29% from Dec 31, 2016, which compared favorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 17.2% during the same time frame. The top five positions account for nearly 60% of the portfolio: Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co., Apple Inc., (AAPL  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola and Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report).5 Stocks That OutperformedWhile Buffett’s portfolio includes equity investments in several publicly traded companies, some of them like Coca Cola, Wells Fargo, Kraft Heinz Co. and Philips 66, which reserve big chunks, gave sub-par returns.Nevertheless, the portfolio returns outshone the markets. Here are some stocks that helped to deliver returns.

445,MCO,"One of the most-favored approaches for investors with a high-risk appetite is the Driehaus strategy. Investors can pick momentum stocks using it to eke out satisfactory returns. The strategy was formulated by Richard Driehaus using the buy high and sell higher principle. Its success has helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

Also, the subsidiary’s senior debt rating of Baa3 has been upgraded from Ba1.Additionally, BankUnited’s long-term counterparty risk ratings and long-term counterparty risk assessments of Baa3 and Baa2(cr) have been upgraded to Baa2 and Baa1(cr), respectively.Reasons Behind Rating UpgradeMoody’s has taken into consideration BankUnited’s efforts to transform its business model into a commercial bank, which reflects solid financials. The rating agency believes that this transformation will lead to a foreseeable level of profits, even post mid-2019, when the loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC expires. Post the expiration of the agreement, Moody’s feels that the profitability will fall marginally. However, Moody’s has already taken this into consideration while assigning the ratings.Further, in a year, BankUnited’s loan portfolio witnessed growth of 11% for the period, ending Mar 31, 2018. It was another favorable factor that led to the rating upgrade. Moreover, the bank’s capital profile is expected to remain robust, even after the decline in capital ratios, due to the expansion of its franchise.Additionally, its rapid commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth has also led to a CRE concentration at 2.7 times BankUnited's tangible common equity base as of Mar 31, 2018, down from 3.4 times, which was recorded at the end of 2016.Nevertheless, the rating agency feels that the bank’s funding profile is weaker than other regional US banks.What Can Drive Ratings Up or Down?A further upgrade in ratings is possible if the company’s funding profile improves and funding costs witness a decline. Growth in the commercial banking franchise and robust asset quality can also result in an upgrade.A rating downgrade could occur if the company’s asset quality or profitability deteriorated. Further, ratings can also be downgraded if BankUnited’s concentration risk prominently rises.In the past year, BankUnited’s shares have rallied 25.4%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.8%.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

448,MCO,"Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG  -  Free Report) on Jun 25 announced that it will move part of its production out of the United States to avoid European Union EU tariffs. The announcement “surprised” President Donald Trump, who had earlier appreciated the iconic American motorcycle manufacturer for “building things in America.”Understandably, Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from China, the EU, Mexico and Canada along with threats of raising tariffs on imported cars and auto parts have raised worries among automakers, including Harley-Davidson.Fears of a trade war have already started taking its toll on a number of industries, with automakers suffering the most. Higher import duties mean a significant blow to the profits of a number of domestic automakers. Given this scenario, the imminent trade war will result in collateral damage for the entire auto industry.Harley, General Motors to Shift ProductionHarley announced that it will be shifting some of its production out of the United States to avoid EU tariffs. Harley’s decision follows Trump’s announcement of levying tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the EU. Consequently, the EU announced tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods, including motorcycles. This would raise tariffs on U.S.-made motorcycles from 6% to a staggering 31%.Understandably, Harley can avoid the tariffs by shifting some of its production from the United States, as the company doesn’t intend to raise retail or wholesale prices. Harley accounted 16% of its sales from China in 2016, its biggest market outside the United States. Moreover, EU tariffs could result in Harley’s profits declining 5-8% in 2018.Similarly, General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) will be making its new Chevrolet Blazer at its Mexico plant. General Motors believes that Mexican plants have cheaper labor costs compared with U.S. plants. The decision could help General Motors avoid EU and China tariffs. However, it could also prove costly for the company as importing those vehicles back to the United States might attract higher tariffs.Ford Sales Drop in ChinaFord Motor Company’s (F  -  Free Report) China sales declined 29% in May from the year-ago period. The company’s vehicles sales in China came in at 61,744 units in May. Analysts see sentimental reasons stemming from the ongoing U.S.-China trade spat behind this drop. Ford is an iconic American brand and maybe Chinese consumers are upset with the United States.Something similar had happened in 2012, when sales of Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC  -  Free Report) and Nissan Motor Co’s (NSANY  -  Free Report) China sales declined significantly during a dispute between the Chinese and Japanese governments. Toyota has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Broader Auto Sector Might Suffer  It’s not only the automakers but the overall auto sector, comprising carmakers, motorcycle manufacturers, car dealers, auto parts and transportation companies, that will feel the heat. According to a Moody’s (MCO  -  Free Report) report released on Monday, Trump’s proposed tariffs could harm the credit rating outlook for the global industry. The report also said that tariffs would be a negative for domestic carmakers like Ford and General Motors.Last week, Trump threatened to impose 20% tariffs on auto imports from the EU. Also, tariffs would particularly hit General Motors as it depends heavily on imports from Mexico and Canada to support its U.S operations. While 30% of General Motors’ U.S. unit sales are imported from Mexico and China, Ford imports 20% of its vehicles from these two countries. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) manufactures almost 50% of its vehicles in the United States, while the rest is primarily imported from its Mexico and Canada plants.  Catch-22Understandably, the trade spat between the United States and China, EU, Mexico and Canada now looks more like a double-edged sword. While producing vehicles in the United States could lead to higher tariffs in China and the EU, producing vehicles in Mexico and Canada and importing them back to the United States could mean paying higher import duty.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

449,MCO,"Long-term ratings for UBS Group AG (UBS  -  Free Report), along with long-term senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings have been upgraded by Moody's Investors Service — a rating arm of Moody’s Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). Notably, the outlook on the long-term deposit and senior unsecured ratings has been revised to stable from rating under review.UBS Group AG's long-term deposit rating of Aa3 has been upgraded to Aa2, and A1 long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings have been raised to Aa3. Both Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) and Adjusted BCA of baa1 have been upgraded to a3.Additionally, Counterparty Risk (CR) Assessment and Counterparty Risk Ratings of Aa3(cr) and Aa3 have been revised upward to Aa2(cr) and Aa2, respectively. Yet, UBS Group's Ba1(hyb) preferred stock ratings have been affirmed.All this concludes the review for upgrade, initiated in April 2018 by Moody’s.Rationale Behind UpgradeThe rating agency has taken into consideration the company’s efforts to cut exposure to capital intensive capital-market activities, along with volatile fixed income product lines. Moody’s believes this has reduced the complexity of UBS Group AG’s investment banking business and has better aligned it with wealth and asset-management businesses, with greater focus on equities, foreign exchange and advisory segment. This restructuring will help combat the volatile earnings trend which the company has faced so far.Further, Moody’s reviewed the group’s risk governance framework. The company’s business planning, capital allocation and distribution processes are restricted by the outputs of its board-approved capital management and stress testing framework, which requires the company to maintain a common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio of around 13%. Per the rating agency, UBS Group AG’s improved credit profile is being supported by maturation and better embedding of its revised risk governance framework of the company’s various business segments.Moody's also considered UBS Group AG’s ability to further improve its profitability levels or to sustain current levels under less favorable market conditions. Thus, Moody's concluded the stability and earnings potential of the group's key earnings sources, i.e. its global wealth management and asset-management businesses, as well as its Swiss domestic universal banking businesses, will likely have sufficient loss-absorption capacity to mitigate risks and earnings volatility related to the capital market businesses.Additionally, Moody’s believes UBS Group AG's significant incremental legal charges if any, will not negatively impact  its solid capitalization level and metrics as the company has improved its profits, and provisions recorded in previous years are sufficient to meet additional charges.Also, the rating agency is positive on the company’s strong liquidity profile, robust risk-based capital ratios and solid leverage ratios. Moody's expects UBS Group’s risk-based capital ratios to remain above its peers. It also expects the company to continue growing its capital stock and maintain solid capital ratios despite expected regulatory pressures over the next three to five years.Shares of UBS Group AG have lost around 16.1% over the past six months on the NYSE compared with the 11.4% decline recorded by the industry.Currently, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderBank of Montreal (BMO  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

452,MCO,"Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report) will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, 2018, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.11%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterSynchrony Financial expects a rise in its allowance for loan losses from the prior-year period due to seasonal trends and catastrophic events. This is expected to adversely impact first-quarter results.Nonetheless, continuing with the previous trend, the company’s total interest and fees on loans are expected to increase in the first quarter on the back of the Retail Card platform and loan receivables growth.Revenues in the to be reported quarter is likely to be driven by strong deposit generation, loan receivables and increased online purchases, and growing CareCredit receivables. Synchrony Financial’s continuous efforts to drive organic growth through digital innovation, data analytics and innovative marketing plus promotions and value propositions in the cards are anticipated to drive the top line in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.9 billion, reflecting 8.3% year over year increase.The company’s agreement with PayPal during the fourth quarter of 2017 supporting its consistent reach within the rapidly-growing digital payments channel is likely to aid first-quarter results.Share buybacks and a lower tax incidence due to tax rate cut will likely provide additional boost to the bottom-line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 74 cents, increasing 21.3% year over year.However, increase in lower yielding payment solution receivables is will likely weigh on margin expansion in the first quarter.Also, a rise in spending on strategic investments is assumed to hurt the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Synchrony Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Synchrony Financial has an Earnings ESP of -2.02%.

However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Hence, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the same industry that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:CIT Group, Inc.

453,MCO,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Oaktree Specialty Lending Corp. (OCSL  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in OCSL.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen three estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 53 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 42 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Oaktree Specialty Lending has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 10 cents a share from 14 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15.1% in the past month.Oaktree Specialty Lending Corp.

454,MCO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MCO due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Moody's Beats on Q1 Earnings & Revenues, Affirms ViewMoody's reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $2.02 per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78. Also, the bottom line improved 35% from the year-ago quarter.Results were attributable to impressive revenue growth, reflecting strong issuance in the quarter. Also, both Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s Analytics segments witnessed improved performance. However, higher expenses were on the downside.After taking into consideration amortization of all acquisition-related intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses, Moody’s net income was $372.9 million or $1.92 per share. This compared favorably with net income of $345.6 million or $1.78 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues & Costs IncreaseQuarterly revenues of $1.13 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion.

Foreign currency translation favorably impacted segment revenues by 3%Corporate finance revenues improved, driven by strong U.S. investment grade bond, EMEA bank loans and growth in recurring revenues. Also, structured finance revenues witnessed a rise, mainly driven by strength in securitization markets.Further, financial institutions’ revenues improved, primarily reflecting growth in issuance from EMEA banks and U.S. insurance companies, partly offset by a fall in activity from Asian and U.S. banks. However, the company recorded a decline in global public, project and infrastructure finance revenues due to a decrease in U.S. municipal issuance.Moody’s Analytics revenues jumped 33% year over year to $406.8 million, mainly driven by higher non-U.S. revenues. Notably, foreign currency translation favorably impacted the segment’s revenues by 4%.The segment recorded growth in research, data and analytics revenues, professional services revenues and Enterprise Risk Solutions revenues.Balance SheetAs of Mar 31, 2018, Moody’s had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.38 billion, up 16% from Dec 31, 2017 level. Further, Moody’s had $5.5 billion of outstanding debt and $910 million of additional borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility.Share RepurchasesDuring the reported quarter, the company repurchased 0.3 million shares for $43.4 million.2018 GuidanceManagement anticipates earnings per share to be $7.20 to $7.40, while adjusted earnings (excluding nearly 40 cents per share of acquisition-related intangibles and roughly 5 cents per share related to acquisition-related expenses) are expected to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.85 per share. Both projections include a roughly 65 cents per share benefit resulting from the U.S. tax reform and an estimated 20 cents per share benefit related to the tax accounting for equity compensation.Moody’s anticipates revenues to increase in the low-double-digit percent range. Operating expenses are projected to rise in the low-double-digit percent range.Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 48% and operating margin is expected to be in the 43-44% range.Moody’s expects cash flow from operations to be about $1.7 billion and free cash flow of about $1.6 billion. Capital expenditures are likely to be about $120 million while depreciation and amortization expenses are estimated to be around $200 million.Share repurchases are estimated to be $200 million. Moody’s kept the dividend payout ratio of 25-30% intact.The effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22-23%.Segment Outlook for 2018MIS segment revenues are likely to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. The company expects U.S. revenues to rise in the low-single-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenues are projected to grow in the high-single-digit percent range.Also, corporate finance revenues are expected to increase in high-single-digit percent range while both financial institutions revenues and structured finance revenues will likely grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. However, public, project and infrastructure finance revenues are expected to decline in the low-single-digit percent range.Regarding MA segment, Moody’s anticipates revenues to grow in the mid-20s percent range. Excluding Bureau van Dijk, segment revenues are expected to rise in the low-double-digit percent range.U.S. revenues are expected to increase in the low-double-digit percent range while non-U.S. revenues are estimated to be up in the mid-30s percent range.Research, data and analytics revenues are expected to increase nearly 40%. Excluding Bureau van Dijk, RD&A revenues are expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range. Revenue contribution from Bureau van Dijk will be reduced approximately $16 million due to a deferred revenue adjustment required as part of acquisition accounting.Further, enterprise risk solutions revenues are likely to grow in the low-single-digit percent range while professional services revenues are anticipated to increase in the high-single-digit percent range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

Further, the figure outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $134.5 million.Total operating expenses came in at $165.1 million, reflecting a decline of 12.5% from the prior-year quarter.

456,MCO,"CIT Group Inc.’s (CIT  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 68 cents per share compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s adjusted earnings of 46 cents.Results benefitted from lower expenses and a fall in provision for credit losses. The quarter witnessed overall improvement in credit quality. However, a decline in revenues hurt the results to quite an extent.Upon considering several non-recurring items, net income was $157 million or 85 cents per share, compared with $17 million or 8 cents per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues & Expenses DeclinedTotal net revenue (GAAP basis) was $604.8 million, reflecting a decline of 6.7% from the prior-year period.Net interest revenue was $269 million, down 6.3% from the prior-year quarter. Also, total non-interest income was $335.8 million, reflecting a decline of 6.9% year over year.Net finance margin decreased 56 basis points year over year to 3.07%.Operating expenses (excluding restructuring costs and intangible assets amortization) were $286 million, down 2.5% from the prior-year quarter.Credit Quality ImprovesNet charge-offs were $27.7 million, down 19.5% from the prior-year quarter. Also, provision for credit losses was $4.4 million, decreasing 81.1% year over year.Further, non-accrual loans decreased 2.9% year over year to $256.8 million.Strong Balance Sheet, Capital Ratios ImprovedAs of Jun 30, 2017, interest bearing cash and investment securities amounted to $10.3 billion, comprising $4.8 billion in cash and $5.5 billion in investment securities.As of Jun 30, 2017, Common Equity Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 14.4% and 16.2%, respectively, as calculated under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, compared with 13.4% and 14.0% in the prior-year quarter.Our ViewpointSluggish growth in industries where CIT Group provides finance is expected to dent the company’s performance in the near term. Moreover, despite certain cost-savings measures, expenses are expected to increase in the long term due to the company’s strategic plan and continued investments in the franchise.However, the company’s efforts toward becoming a leading regional commercial banking institution through restructuring and streamlining are commendable.CIT Group Inc (DEL) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  CIT Group Inc (DEL) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CIT Group Inc (DEL) QuoteCurrently, CIT Group carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among other stocks in this space, Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.

457,MCO,"Moody's Investors Service — a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) — affirmed all the ratings of Comerica (CMA  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries. The banking giant’s long-term issuer rating and a senior unsecured rating have been affirmed at A3. The bank’s subsidiary has deposit ratings of Aa3/Prime-1 and a standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA) of a2.The bank’s counterparty risk assessments is A1(cr)/Prime-1(cr).Further, Comerica’s shelf registration has been assigned prospective ratings. The shelf senior unsecured and subordinate is rated at (P)A3, while (P)Baa1 is assigned for cumulative preferred stock, and (P)Baa2 for non-cumulative preferred stock.The rating firm’s outlook for the bank remains “stable”.Rationale Behind the AffirmationThe rating affirmation follows Comerica's strong asset quality performance and traditional credit culture, including conservative underwriting standards. Moreover, solid liquidity position is another driving factor.Per Moody’s, the bank’s capital position is below the median of its peers, and Comerica’s inconsistent earnings due to the historical low level of interest rates posed a credit challenge.Further, Comerica maintains modest growth targets and a diversified loan mix with no exposure to real estate. Nevertheless, though the bank is exposed to an above-average energy exposure due to its Texas footprint, it met Moody's expectations in asset-quality performance and risk management during the energy sector slump.Per Moody's, rising rates aiding Comerica's profitability is expected to record a lower payout ratio. In addition, capital metrics of the bank are expected to remain stable in the near term, along with its modest growth expectations.However, per the rating agency, Comerica might get removed from the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act which might result in higher shareholder returns and lower capital ratios. Notably, this act amplifies total consolidated assets from $50 billion to $250 billion of a bank to get qualified for a systemically important financial institution (SIFI).Comerica currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company’s stock has gained around 24% over the last six months, outperforming 2.2% growth recorded by the industry. Stocks to ConsiderBankUnited, Inc.

458,MCO,"Shares of LendingClub Corporation (LC  -  Free Report) plunged 17.4% since its Investors Day conference last week. Investors turned bearish as the company lowered its fourth-quarter 2017 outlook within a month.What’s the New Q4 Guidance & Why was it Lowered?LendingClub provided the details related to its new outlook in the Investors Day presentation. The company now expects fourth-quarter 2017 revenues, GAAP net income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to be nearly $3 million lower than what it guided in November.LendingClub now projects net revenues to be in the range of $155-$160 million, down from previous outlook of $158-$163 million. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net loss are expected to be in the range of $16-$20 million (lower from $19-$23 million) and $10-$6 million (wider than prior loss estimate of $7-$3 million), respectively.Further, LendingClub’s 2017 revenues are projected to be approximately in the $573-$578 million range and adjusted EBITDA between $42 million and $46 million. Notably, the company is expected to report a net loss of $72-$68 on GAAP basis.The main reason for reduced fourth-quarter outlook is related to the “timing impact” of holding residual from the company’s recent securitization deal. While securitizations help LendingClub in originating more loans and thus earn additional origination and servicing fees, they expose the company to more risk as it has to retain part of securitization deals on the balance sheet.2018 OutlookLendingClub’s 2018 guidance includes $25 million operating expenses related to investments in automotive refinancing platform and technology upgrades while not taking into consideration any legal costs.Further, LendingClub’s 2018 revenues are projected to be approximately in the $680-705 million range (up 18-22% year over year). This shows that the company is on track for its long-term revenue target of 15-20% rise year over year.Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated between $42 million and $46 million (rising 87.5% at the mid-point). Notably, LendingClub is expected to report a net loss of $53-$38 on GAAP basis, reflecting a year-over-year improvement.Road Ahead Expected to be BumpyLendingClub grew rapidly in the last few years. But the company’s asset quality deteriorated as high-risk borrowers defaulted. This, in turn, led to some of the investors moving away from the company.Nonetheless, LendingClub tightened its underwriting methods earlier this year. Therefore, the company was now expected to meet its financial targets. So, this reduced outlook made the investors apprehensive.LendingClub’s shares have plunged 33.1% so far this year against industry’s growth of 17.8%.Currently, LendingClub carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth ConsideringSome stocks in the finance space worth a look include Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), FS Bancorp (FSBW  -  Free Report) and Bank of Commerce Holdings (BOCH  -  Free Report).Moody's has witnessed a positive earnings estimate revision of 5% for the current year over the last 60 days.

459,MCO,"Credit rating agency, Fitch Ratings recently downgraded industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) related to both short-term and long-term issuer default ratings. Despite the downgrade, its shares remained resilient and rallied 1.6% to close at $18.41 yesterday.Rating CutCiting relatively low margins and less-than-anticipated free cash flow, Fitch lowered the long-term and short-term issuer default ratings for GE to ""A+"" from ""AA-"" and to ""F1"" from ""F1+"" with a negative outlook, respectively. The rating agency noted that GE was plagued by a weaker performance in the power segment’s gas turbine business owing to lackluster demand patterns and higher inventory in the market.Fitch further pointed out that although GE intended to improve its profitability by reducing overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the beleaguered power segment that sells electrical generation equipment, execution risks remain. In addition, cash flow is likely to be adversely affected by the suspension of dividends by GE Capital.    The current rating downgrade is the second of its kind. Earlier this month, Moody’s Investor Service, the credit rating business of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), lowered GE to ""A2"" from ""A1"" owing to likely challenges in the power segment which might persist till 2019.Shares Defy the NegativityDespite the negative undercurrent, the company’s share price moved up as investors seemed to repose some faith in the latest restructuring process of the company. CEO John Flannery has decided to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses. GE further intends to have asset sales worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity.Flannery has termed 2018 as a reset year and expects the company to stage a turnaround to reward its shareholders with risk-adjusted returns. Critics, however, have widely raised concerns about the efficacy of such steps.However, shares of GE have underperformed the industry year to date, with an average loss of 41.8% compared with a decline of 4.4% for the latter.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

460,MCO,"Associated Banc-Corp’s (ASB  -  Free Report) ratings outlook has been upgraded to stable from negative by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). The rating agency had lowered the outlook last year following the continued slump in energy prices.At that time, Moody’s had downgraded ratings of BOK Financial Corp. (BOKF  -  Free Report), Hancock Holding Co.  and Cullen/Frost Bankers for similar reasons.Further, the ratings of Associated Banc-Corp and its subsidiaries have been affirmed. The company's senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings have been maintained at Baa1. Moreover, long-term and short-term deposit ratings for its subsidiary — Associated Bank, N.A. — have been retained at A1 and baseline credit assessment at baa2.Reason for the Upgrade in OutlookImprovement in profitability supported by rise in interest rates, cost control efforts and strong credit quality led Moody’s to upgrade Associated Banc-Corp's outlook. Per the rating agency, no change in the company's liquidity or capital positions is expected in the near term.Moody’s projects loan loss provisions to remain at low levels, mainly driven by an improved performance of Associated Banc-Corp's energy loan portfolio, given the stable oil prices and a reduced exposure to energy sector loans.Notably, Associated Banc-Corp expects asset quality to continue improving with oil and gas allowance decreasing gradually.Why the Ratings are AffirmedPer Moody's, Associated Banc-Corp has a strong liquidity position, given its stable deposit base. Further, the company is focused on strengthening its commercial as well as consumer client base in Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota.  Additionally, improving asset quality is a positive for the company. Associated Banc-Corp’s exposure to energy loans decreased to 27% of Moody's tangible common equity as of Sep 30, 2017 from 35% last year. The rating agency expects less probability of a rise in loan loss provisions for energy exposure.Nonetheless, Moody’s pointed that Associated Banc-Corp’s relatively high exposure to commercial real estate remains a credit negative. Also, the company’s tangible common equity/risk-weighted assets ratio compares unfavorably with its peers, though it witnessed progress based on increase in earnings and steady capital deployments.Notably, shares of Associated Banc-Corp have risen 7.6% over the past year, marginally underperforming the industry’s growth of 8.4%. Associated Banc-Corp carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Moody'sis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MCO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.47 per share for MCO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43 per share.

463,MCO,"S&P Global Ratings recently downgraded the ratings of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries. The Wall Street biggie’s long-term issuer credit rating has been downgraded to ‘A-’ from ‘A’ and short-term issuer credit rating from ‘A-1’ to ‘A-2’. The credit profile has also been changed to ‘a’ from ‘a+’.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been affirmed at “stable”.Rationale Behind the DowngradeFollowing the consent order by the Federal Reserve which puts a cap on increasing assets beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017) for Wells Fargo due to poor governance and controls, S&P also downgraded the bank’s ratings.Per the rating agency, the regulatory risk of Wells Fargo seems more than expected, and duration of operational and governance improvement also is likely to take longer time. It has been more than a year since the news of the banking giant’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Moreover, the Fed’s latest move has escalated reputational headwinds for the bank which might result in more customer attrition impacting financial performance and credit metrics.Rating Outlook AffirmationAffirmation of stable outlook depicts S&P’s expectations of improved compliance and operational risk management of the bank with meeting the provisions of the Fed consent order. Further, the rating agency anticipates the banking giant to receive independent third-parties’ review confirmation of its processes on improvement plan by Sep 30, 2018.Additionally, competitive position of the bank in core businesses are predicted to be minimally affected due to regulatory growth restrictions, and S&P expects the bank to maintain its earnings growth and stable asset quality over the next two years. Capital equity Tier 1 ratio is also anticipated to be above the company's long-term target of 10%, and the S&P’s risk-adjusted capital ratio is likely to remain at the higher end of the 7-10% range.Rating Action by Other FirmRecently, Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), affirmed all the ratings of Wells Fargo and its subsidiaries. The bank’s long-term deposit rating has been affirmed at A2, senior debt rating at Aa2 and subordinated debt rating at Aa3. The bank’s counterparty risk assessments is Aa1(cr)/Prime-1(cr). The bank’s subsidiary has deposit ratings of Aa1/Prime-1 and a stand-alone baseline credit assessment (BCA) of a2.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been downgraded to “negative” from “stable”.ConclusionCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. Also, the recent assets cap put on the bank by the Fed has disappointed investors. Therefore, it is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s year-to-date performance reflects investors’ disappointment.

464,MCO,"The Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China has approved Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard . The company is set to complete the $24-billion cash-and-stock deal.Favorable tidings on the regulatory front have accelerated the deal’s progress. Recently, the Federal Trade Commission gave its approval for the acquisition. However, the acquisition is a subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.Formation of BD Interventional: A New SegmentAfter the completion of the deal, Becton, Dickinson will establish a third business segment — BD Interventional. Notably, Bard will be integrated in this vertical. Becton, Dickinson is already a leading player in interventional specialties solutions. The company promotes positive clinical outcomes using minimally invasive and percutaneous techniques for obtaining samples of liver, breast, lung and kidney biopsy. Further, the company provides facilities for peritoneal drainage at home.In April 2017, Becton, Dickinson signed the agreement. Per management, the company is on track to become one of the biggest medical technology devices company in the world with this buyout.Becton, Dickinson operates in two segments currently — The BD Medical segment and The BD Life Sciences segment. Post deal closure, the company projects growth in adjusted earnings starting fiscal 2019. The strategic acquisition is expected to generate benefits from complementary businesses and geographical expansion.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price Becton, Dickinson and Company Price | Becton, Dickinson and Company Quote Moody's Not HappyMoody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of  Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), downgraded Becton, Dickinson's senior unsecured notes to Ba1 (LGD 4) from Baa2 and its commercial paper rating to ‘Not Prime’ from Prime-2. The lackluster rating reflects Becton, Dickinson's aggressive acquisition strategy. In this regard, the company’s latest deal to acquire Bard has been signed just two years after the $12.5-billion CareFusion buyout.Per Moody’s, the acquisition is likely to almost double Becton, Dickinson's debt load (including assumed debt issued by Bard). Further, the company’s pro-forma leverage (debt/EBITDA) will increase almost five times after the closure of the deal, indicating looming concerns for the stock.Although, Becton, Dickinson expects to reduce debt/EBITDA ratio below three times within three years of closing, Moody’s believes this is unlikely to happen.On a positive note, Moody's believes that the company's cost-saving targets are achievable. In this regard, Becton, Dickinson expects $300 million of cost savings by fiscal 2020. Moody's also expects Becton, Dickinson to make use of free cash flow for debt reduction.What’s in the Cards Post Deal Closure?Becton, Dickinson announced that it will divest soft tissue core needle biopsy products and Bard's Aspira product line of tunneled home drainage catheters and accessories for $100 million to Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (MMSI  -  Free Report), contingent to the completion of the buyout.Coming to the strategic advantages, Becton, Dickinson will generate high-single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share by fiscal 2019. The company will be able to expand to new areas where Bard currently operates — fast-growing vascular access segments, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), midlines and drug delivery ports.Moreover, the acquisition is expected to strengthen the combined entity’s footprint in the home healthcare market in the United States. A research report by ‘Markets and Markets’ reveals that the home healthcare market is expected to reach a total of $349.8 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 9%.Price Performance & Zacks Rank Over the last six months, Becton, Dickinson has outperformed the industry in terms of price performance.

Thus, its Moody’s Investors Service (MIS) division continued to witness steady rise in revenues.Further during the year, Moody’s continued with its efforts to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. In line with this, the company acquired Amsterdam, Netherlands-based Bureau van Dijk in August 2017. Driven by the rise in demand for analytics, its Moody's Analytics division recorded solid revenue growth.Given the strong underlying business performance, Moody’s persistently revised its earnings outlook upward for 2017. Earnings are now projected to be $6.18 to $6.33 per share (up from the previous outlook of $5.69-$5.84).Driven by the strong fundamentals and improving operating environment, investors are bullish on the stock. Shares of Moody’s have jumped 56.4% so far this year, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 20%. The stock has even surpassed S&P 500 rally of 20.1% year to date. Now, let’s check out the factors which are likely to provide an impetus to Moody’s stock.Driven by the improving global economy, tightening monetary policy and rise in global M&A and IPO activities, Moody’s is expected to witness an increase in bond and bank loan issuance revenues as well as higher monitoring revenues related to new ratings. Therefore, corporate finance revenues, the largest revenue contributor at the MIS division, will record a rise in 2018.Further, Moody’s is currently focused on investing in technology platform and processes to boost operations. Also, the company is undertaking initiatives to diversify into the emerging and fast growing professional services and enterprise risk solutions sectors.These efforts are well supported by Moody’s’ strong balance sheet and cash flow position. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion. This will support the company’s diversifying plans.Moreover, management expects Bureau van Dijk deal to be accretive to its 2018 adjusted earnings (excluding purchase price amortization and one-time integration expenses).However, mounting expenses and stiff completion are expected to remain concerns. Despite these issues, analysts seem to be optimistic about Moody’s prospects. Over the last 60 days, the stock has witnessed three upward estimate revisions (no downward revisions) for 2018. Thus, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $6.54 shows 10.3% year-over-year growth for 2018. Further next year, revenues are projected to witness a 10.3% rise to $4.51 billion.Other Stocks Worth a LookSome other top-ranked stocks in the finance space worth considering are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), MoneyGram International, Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Southern First Bancshares, Inc. (SFST  -  Free Report). All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2.

467,MCO,"All the ratings of Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by Moody's Investors Service, the rating arm of Moody’s Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). This Chicago, IL-based healthcare real estate investment trust’s (REIT) senior unsecured debt rating is affirmed at Baa1.

Per the rating firm, the company’s streamlining efforts have concentrated its geographic footprint and helped Citigroup in making its business more durable and increased focus on institutional client and consumer customer base.Why are the Ratings Affirmed?Per Moody's, Citigroup faces tremendous competition in various key businesses, including retail banking and credit cards in the U.S., as well as capital markets worldwide. The bank is striving hard to improve returns for its shareholders.Among others, management aims to return capital over earnings, along with the capital released by DTA utilization, only after recording Common Equity Tier One ratio at 11.5%, down from the current ratio of 13%. The company believes this would help drive profitability and achieve its target of return on tangible common equity of 11% by 2020.Additionally, Citigroup has been putting in efforts to improvise profits in its lines of business, including the credit card and retail bank unit in the United States, as well as the CitiBanamex franchise in Mexico.

473,MCO,"The ratings of MB Financial, Inc. (MBFI  -  Free Report), along with its subsidiaries, have been kept under review for a possible upgrade by Moody's Investors Service — a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). Moreover, the rating agency will review the Chicago-based bank's senior unsecured rating of Ba1 and baseline credit assessment of baa3, along with its lead bank’s issuer rating of Ba1.In addition, the rating outlook has been changed to ‘Review for Upgrade’ from the current ‘Stable’.Rationale Behind the ReviewThe review follows the announcement of the stock-cash acquisition deal with Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report), headquartered at Cincinnati, OH, under which MB Financial will be merged with Fifth Third, for a total value of $4.7 billion. However, the deal awaits meeting all customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals and MB Financial shareholders’ approval. MB Financial, with about $20 billion in assets, serves middle-market customers as a leader with its strong deposit franchise, customer-centric corporate culture and commercial expertise. Per Moody’s, post-merger, MB Financial’s strengths and Fifth Third’s huge corporate lending, capital markets, wealth management and the payments business will benefit customers with complementary capabilities of both banks.Furthermore, MB Financial's diversified sources of earnings and core base of retail deposits justify its baa3 standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA). Per Moody’s, though the bank has weak liquidity and low tangible capitalization, stable net interest margin and steady fee income generation are positive factors. Moreover, concentrated commercial real estate lending and loan growth support baa3 BCA.Conclusion The rating outlook is valuable for firms since it preserves investors’ confidence in the stock and boosts its creditworthiness in the market. An upgrade in the same increases investors’ confidence and reflects the company’s strong financials.MB Financial’s shares have gained 15.2% in the last six months compared with 4.7% growth recorded by the industry.

481,MCO,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell. The company is expected to report stable revenues in its Corporate Finance line, the largest revenue contributor at the Moody's Investors Service (“MIS”) division.Backdrop for bond issuance during the first quarter was not quite favorable. Rising interest rates are likely to have slowed down corporates’ involvement in debt issuances to some extent. Hence, investment grade bond, high yield bond and leveraged loan issuances volume deteriorated year over year.Nevertheless, Corporate Finance revenues are expected to remain stable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $353 million for the to-be-reported quarter.Nonetheless, quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities was healthy. Therefore, Moody’s will likely witness a rise in Structured Finance revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $116 million, reflecting 16% growth from the prior-year quarter.Further, MIS division’s another revenue source — Financial Institutions — is anticipated to report $117 million of revenues, up 4.5% from the prior-year quarter.  Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance unit revenues are projected to remain stable year over year at $98 million as municipal bond issuance slowed in the to-be-reported quarter.Overall, the MIS division is projected to witness year-over-year growth in the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the division’s revenues is $688 million, reflecting an increase of 3%.Other Factors at PlayHigher revenues from Moody's Analytics (“MA”) division: Moody’s continues to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. Given the rise in demand for analytics, the company’s MA division is expected to show a rise in revenues. The division’s all three business units are anticipated to witness higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. So, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its revenues of $422 million indicates a surge of 37.5% from the prior-year quarter.Strategic deals/investments to support revenues: Moody’s is likely to show revenue growth on the back of its strategic acquisitions and investments. These have increased the scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. However, strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to impact quarterly revenues to some extent.Expenses to remain high: As Moody’s continues with its inorganic growth strategy, acquisition and restructuring costs are expected to remain high. So, overall expenses are anticipated to rise during the quarter.Now, let’s see what our quantitative model predicts.According to our proven model, Moody’s has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Moody’s is +3.09%.Zacks Rank: Moody’s carries a Zacks Rank of 3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.78 reflects a year-over-year improvement of 21.1%.

483,MCO,"Who doesn’t want to get as lucky as Warren Buffett in the investment world? Since Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s (BRK.B  -  Free Report) inception, the holding company has yielded a stellar return of nearly 21%.Buffett’s investing style has always remained simple: buy shares in great companies and hold them for a significant period of time. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time. They also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Such companies tend to come from sectors such as financials, technology, and consumer discretionary. The Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates is already providing the much-needed windfall to financial service providers, as well as computer and software makers.Things have been looking up for consumer stocks as well.  A record low jobless rate and a series of highs for the stock market has buoyed optimism on household finances and the economy. Lest we forget, the Dow Jones had touched 23,000 in intraday trade for the first time on Oct 17. The blue-chip gauge, in fact, logged its fourth 1,000-point climb over the past 12 months, the most it has ever posted in a calendar year.Thus, let us focus on the Oracle of Omaha’s favorite companies that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price.Trump Tax PlanThe tax code hasn't been refurbished since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan, along with a divided Congress, broadened the tax base and lowered marginal tax rates.Recently, the House of Representatives, led by Speaker Paul Ryan, passed a $4.1-trillion budget legislation that paved the way for the much awaited tax code rewrite.  Such a tax cut would include trimming the business tax rate to 20% from 35%.The lowering of the domestic tax rate will result in repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. This should, ultimately, boost the economy and drive interest rates. Higher interest rates boost bank profits by increasing the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Non-banking financial institutions should gain immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally occurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Moreover, big companies from the tech sector also have massive overseas cash piles. Bringing back funds held overseas will let these companies carry out share buybacks, pay dividends, and get involved in M&A activities.The tax plan aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25%, and 35%. The current top rate is 39.6%. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force in the continued strength of big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest in such bellwethers. Confidence in US Economy Highest in 13 YearsThe U.S. consumer sentiment index, in the meantime, touched 101.1 in October, up from 95.1 in September, as per the University of Michigan’s findings.  This key economic indicator, which measures attitudes on future economic prospects, scaled its highest level since 2004.Americans think the economic scenario right now is “as good as it gets.” The index for the current economic condition rose to 116.4 from 111.7. The U.S. economy is already growing close to the range projected by the White House, while the manufacturing and service sectors accelerated at a record pace last month.Investors’ sentiments were buoyed by narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit and a rebound in exports in August from July. This is quite encouraging, as analysts had feared that hurricanes might affect trade data in August, with exports delayed due to storms.Household optimism was largely driven by underlying strength in the labor market. A clearer view of last month’s labor market data, in fact, showed that keeping the effects of the hurricane aside, the U.S. employment scenario is continuing to tighten.The unemployment rate declined to 4.2%, the lowest since February 2001, while wages increased 0.5% to average of $26.55 an hour, per the Labor Department data.

484,MCO,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) has been growing organically as well as inorganically backed by its strong capital position. The company is pursuing growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service for public fixed-income securities. It has increased its exposure to the banking and insurance industry, branching into the emerging and fast-growing professional services and enterprise risk-solutions’ sectors.Further, a positive trend in estimate revisions reflect optimism over the company’s earnings growth prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Moody’s current-quarter earnings has moved up one cent per share over the last 60 days. Also, the current year’s earnings estimates have climbed 3.2%. As a result, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Moody’s have rallied 45.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s growth of 7%. What Makes Moody’s a Solid Pick?Earnings Strength: Moody’s recorded an earnings growth rate of 12.9% over the last three to five years compared with 7.4% for the industry it belongs to.

Further, the top line is expected to increase 10.3% in 2017 compared with no growth for the industry.Impressive Capital Deployment: Moody’s capital deployment plan is commendable. In December 2016, the company announced a 3% dividend hike. Further, Moody’s had remaining repurchase authorization worth nearly $600 million, as of Jun 30, 2017. Given its solid liquidity position and earnings strength, the company should be able to sustain this level of capital deployment.Strong Inorganic Growth: Moody’s has grown significantly over the years through several strategic acquisitions that provided it with increased scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. Recently, the company acquired Amsterdam, Netherlands-based Bureau van Dijk. In February 2017, it acquired the structured finance data and analytics business of Frankfurt-based SCDM. The company will continue to pursue acquisitions (especially in Asia and Latin America) that are strategic fits and suitable for diversifying revenue base.Some better-ranked stocks from the finance space are The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS  -  Free Report), AeroCentury Corp.

485,MCO,"Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), placed the long-term ratings of Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries, including the principal bank subsidiary, Bank of America N.A., on review for a possible upgrade.Also, BofA’s counterparty risk assessments have been placed on review for probable upgrade. Notably, the rating agency affirmed all short-term ratings of the company.Improving Profitability & Conservative Risk Profile Support the UpgradeThe primary reason for placing BofA’s ratings under review is the continuous improvement in profitability and conservative risk profile. These support Moody’s belief that the company will be able to sustain its profits over the long term.BofA has been witnessing a steady rise in profitability over the past two years. Legacy mortgage servicing and legal issues, which were dragging down the bank’s profitability, have ebbed gradually. Also, its cost savings efforts have supported profitability.Further, BofA’s businesses have been aided by improvement in the operating environment. Higher interest rates and favorable macroeconomic developments continue to support its earnings.The rating agency will be evaluating the possibility and sustainability of further improvements in BofA’s profitability. It will be specifically looking into the effect of higher deposit beta on the company’s future earnings growth.Additionally, Moody’s will be taking into consideration the sustainability of BofA’s conservative risk profile that aided the bank in showing resilience under the Federal Reserve’s severely adverse stress test scenarios. Further, the company’s restrained approach toward loan growth compared to several other big banks will be assessed.BofA’s credit profile has strengthened, mainly driven by the recent improvements in capital position. While the company remained conservative compared with other big banks in returning capital to shareholders, Moody’s anticipates this to change overtime.Though increase in capital deployment activities (with the approval from the Fed) may result in a slight deterioration in the company’s capital position, continuously improving profitability and strong balance sheet will likely provide support.Moody’s also expects that BofA’s strong liquidity position will remain steady at the current levels.Our TakeRise in interest rates, potential lesser regulations, and BofA’s efforts to enhance loans and deposits are expected to support top-line growth. Hence, this will definitely bolster its profitability further.Shares of BofA have rallied 10.1% so far this year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.1%.Currently, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of stocks in the banking space worth a look include Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) and Community Bank System, Inc. (CBU  -  Free Report). Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Zions was revised 8.9% upward for the current year, in the last 60 days.

486,MCO,"Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report), recently affirmed all the ratings of Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries. The Wall Street biggie’s long-term deposit rating has been affirmed at A2, senior debt rating at Aa2 and subordinated debt rating at Aa3. The bank’s counterparty risk assessments is Aa1(cr)/Prime-1(cr). The bank’s subsidiary has deposit ratings of Aa1/Prime-1 and a stand-alone baseline credit assessment (BCA) of a2.However, the rating firm’s outlook for the bank has been downgraded to “negative” from “stable”.Rationale Behind the DowngradeFollowing the consent order by the Federal Reserve which puts a cap on increasing assets beyond $1.95 trillion (as of Dec 31, 2017) for Wells Fargo, Moody’s downgraded the bank’s rating outlook to negative from stable.It has been more than a year since the news of the banking giant’s alleged involvement in unfair sales practices hit headlines. Moreover, the recent move by the Fed has increased reputational headwinds for the bank which might result in more customer attrition impacting financial performance and credit metrics. Therefore, the rating firm downgraded the outlook to negative.The allegation led to many setbacks involving the bank’s shattered image, numerous lawsuits, triggered federal and state investigations, congressional hearings and the bank’s former CEO — John Stumpf — losing his job. Further, suspension of business relations of the bank with states, including Illinois and California, were noted.Thus, post scandal, the bank undertook a number of steps to restore its reputation. It initiated an internal probe and hired a consultant to review its sales practices. Additionally, management proposed to eliminate sales goals for its retail banking business earlier than planned.According to Moody’s, Wells Fargo implemented aggressive sales strategies without proper risk-management practices and governance which resulted in the sales scandal. The rating firm expects the compliance and operational risk-management program of the bank will be improved going forward as required by the Fed. Therefore, future assessments of Moody’s of the bank’s corporate governance will depend upon the effectiveness of the bank in carrying out the initiatives for improvement.    Further, on the Fed’s approval, Wells Fargo will appoint independent third-parties to conduct the review of its processes and submit the results by Sep 30, 2018. The outcome of evaluation of such review by the Fed will decide the removal of recent sanctions on the bank.Ratings AffirmationMoody’s affirmed Wells Fargo's ratings on expectations of the bank’s strong credit metrics and liquidity position. Despite litigation issues, the company’s asset quality and capital ratios have marked improvement. In addition, profitability metrics are on an upswing, aided by lower tax rate and controlled expenses.ConclusionCurrently, the banking giant is caught in a horde of litigations over several malpractices which have come into the spotlight. Also, the recent assets cap put on the bank by the Fed has disappointed investors. Therefore, it is going to be a long and expensive journey for Wells Fargo till it gets all the dust settled.The bank’s year-to-date performance reflects investors’ disappointment. Shares of Wells Fargo have declined 5.6%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 0.5%.Currently, Wells Fargo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Stocks to ConsiderComerica (CMA  -  Free Report) has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the last 60 days.

487,MCO,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results on Feb 9, before the opening bell. The company is expected to witness a year-over-year rise in revenues in its Corporate Finance line, the largest revenue contributor at the Moody's Investors Service (“MIS”) division.Backdrop for bond issuance (driven by tightening of credit spreads and a rise in long-term yield curve) during the fourth quarter was favorable. Hence, investment grade bond and leveraged loan issuances volume improved year over year, mainly in Asia.So, Corporate Finance revenues are expected to increase. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $313 million indicates 12.6% improvement from the last-year quarter.Apart from this, quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities improved modestly. Therefore, Moody’s will likely witness a slight rise in Structured Finance revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $132 million, reflecting marginal growth from the prior-year quarter.Further, MIS division’s another revenue source — Financial Institutions — is anticipated to report $97 million of revenues, up 9% year over year.  Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance unit revenues are projected to remain stable year over year at $103 million.Overall, the MIS division is projected to witness year-over-year growth in the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the division’s revenues is $650 million, reflecting an increase of 6.9%.Other Factors Influencing Q4 ResultsHigher revenues from Moody's Analytics (“MA”) division: Moody’s continues to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. Given the rise in demand for analytics, the company’s MA division is expected to show a rise in revenues. The division’s all three business units are anticipated to witness higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. So, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its revenues of $418 million indicates an increase of 25.1% from the prior-year quarter.Strategic deals/investments to support revenues: Moody’s is likely to show revenue growth on the back of its strategic acquisitions and investments. These have increased the scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. However, strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to impact quarterly revenues to some extent.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly sales of $1.08 billion reflects 14.3% year-over-year growth.For 2017, sales are expected to be $4.12 billion. Notably, Moody’s projects revenues to increase in the low-teens percent range in 2017.Expenses to remain high: As Moody’s continues with its inorganic growth strategy, acquisition and restructuring costs are expected to remain high. So, overall expenses are anticipated to rise during the quarter.For 2017, management expects adjusted operating expenses to rise in the low-double-digit percent range, while operating expenses are projected to decline in the range of 20-25%.Now, let’s see what our quantitative model predicts.According to our proven model, Moody’s has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Moody’s is +2.33%.Zacks Rank: Moody’s carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 2.9% upward over the last 30 days to $1.43 reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 16.3%.For 2017, Moody’s expects earnings per share to be $6.18 to $6.33, driven by strong underlying business performance. This includes CCXI gain of 31 cents, the purchase price hedge gain of 36 cents, net amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of 23 cents and net acquisition-related expenses of 11 cents. Excluding these, adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.00.Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Moody's Corporation QuoteEarnings Schedule of Other StocksBoth Ares Capital Corporation (ARCC  -  Free Report) and LendingClub Corporation (LC  -  Free Report) are expected to announce results on Feb 13, while Hercules Capital, Inc.

488,MCO,"American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 18. The performance is likely to reflect gains from its four strategic focus areas — strengthening leadership in the premium consumer segment; extending leadership in commercial payments and in particular with small and medium-sized enterprises; enhancing its digital platform; and strengthening its global integrated network to provide unique value. Results should also benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.Revenues in the to-be reported quarter should see an upside from accelerated growth in billings and continued strong growth in loans and fees. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues net of interest expense are expected to be $8.5 billion, up 7.8% year over year.The company has suspended its share buyback program for the first half of 2018, in an effort to build up capital. The bottom line will thus be bereft of the benefit of share buyback.Factors Affecting Q1 ResultsGrowth in Billed Business: The first quarter should reflect an increase in worldwide billed business across its diverse customer segments and geographies. U.S. proprietary consumer and international proprietary consumer billings growth should remain strong. The company saw strong performance from middle market and small business customers, while large and global commercial customers grew at a more modest pace, in the last quarter and the same should be seen in the first quarter. Global Network Services billed business should grow at a slower rate over the year than the proprietary business as a result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in Europe and Australia. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate card billed business is expected to be $275 billion, up 9.1% year over year.Increase in Loan and Recievables: Card Member loan and receivables growth should be seen as the company continues to expand its relationship with existing customers and acquire new Card Members. This should have, however, led to an increase in provisions for losses, lending delinquencies and net write-off rates. The increase in delinquencies and net write-off rates were primarily due to the seasoning of recent loan vintages and a shift in mix over time toward non-cobrand lending products, which have higher write-off rates but also drive higher net interest yields.Increase in Total Cards in Force: Total cards in force, which reflects the number of cards that are issued and outstanding, will likely increase in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 116 million up 4.5% year over year.Higher Spending on Card Member Engagement: Spending on rewards, Card Member services and marketing and promotion expenses should show an uptick due to recent enhancements to rewards on the company’s U.S. Platinum products, continued strong growth in its Delta cobrand portfolio and higher levels of engagement in many of its premium services. American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise  American Express Company Price and EPS Surprise | American Express Company QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Express is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: American Express has an Earning ESP of -4.67%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), its negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  PJT Partners Inc.

489,MCO,"If you are an avid investor, you must also be a diehard fan of the Oracle of Omaha. Warren Buffet has consistently beaten the markets for decades by accumulating positions in some of the world’s sought-after companies. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time, while they also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Thus, let us focus on Buffet’s favorite companies that are likely to make the most of the first-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price. But before we do so, let us look at his top stock holdings from his darling sectors:Financials Scoops Up Top SpotBuffett has huge stakes in several financial stocks. He has, particularly, liked American Express since the 1960s. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) holds around 151.6 million shares of the credit card giant, valued at $15 billion. When it comes to banks, Berkshire has a sizeable position in Bank of America, which is nearly $20.4 billion. Buffett’s second-largest holding is America’s second most profitable bank, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). Berkshire holds 452.8 million shares of Wells Fargo, which indicates that Buffett is quite optimistic about the current financial environment.A recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. But, this time around, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities (read more: Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks).Consumer Goods Comes SecondBuffett has a sizeable position in consumer stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz. Coca-Cola is much trusted as Buffet has assured that he will never sell shares in the renowned beverage company. Berkshire held around 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, making it the company’s fourth-largest holding. Kraft Heinz is another consumer staples firm where Buffett and his company has 325.6 million shares, worth $25.3 billion.Consumer staples seems to be the safest option at a time when markets are plagued with widespread uncertainty. Trump talk of Syria bombing, unabated trade tensions, high profile departures in the Trump administration and midterm election year spell a rough phase for stocks. Staples, on the other hand, is generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the state of the larger market.Tech Takes Third SpotThe Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates, in the meantime, has already provided the much-needed windfall to computer and software makers. Any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%, per the latest tax law.The lowering of the tax rate will encourage big tech companies to bring back funds held overseas. This in turn will let these companies carry out share buybacks, pay dividends, and engage in M&A activities. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) will make the most of the positive tax overhaul initiative by repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. It is also the most valuable holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.Industrials & Airlines in FocusBuffett has the fourth-largest stake in the Industrials sector. And why not? Improving global economies and firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.But, Buffet has started to show keen interest in airlines which he earlier used to steer clear of. He believes that planes being more efficient and relationships between unions being better will certainly help airlines fly high. Buffett holds several airlines, but, Southwest Airlines is the most valuable.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Consider in Q1 EarningsAs mentioned above, American business magnate Warren Buffet’s preferred sectors are poised to gain in the near term. But, not all of his choices from the aforesaid sectors will report a significant uptick in Q1 earnings.We have, thus, figured out three of his top stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP. This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett particularly likes Moody’s as the company continues to post strong numbers, so there’s some real money-making potential there. The company, in the most recent quarter, declared an operating income of $462.8 million.The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on Apr 27. Moody's has an Earnings ESP of +0.85%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.9%, better than the industry’s estimated growth of 21.4%.Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett favors Mastercard as an increasing number of customers are switching to cashless payments, as it is preferred by most businessmen.The company is likely to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on May 2. Mastercard has an Earnings ESP of +2.39%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 29.7%, well ahead of the industry’s projected growth of 15%.Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) is a payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities to electronic payments.Buffett likes Visa as the company has the same competitive advantages and business qualities that Mastercard possesses.Visa is expected to report earnings results for the March quarter on Apr 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.25%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.2%, above the industry’s projected growth of 15%.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

490,MCO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Moody's Beats Q2 Earnings Expectations, Guides UpMoody's reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33. Also, the bottom line improved 16% from the year-ago quarter.Better-than-expected results were attributable to impressive revenue growth, reflecting strong issuance in the quarter. Also, both Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s Analytics segments witnessed improved performance. However, higher expenses were on the downside.After taking into considering unrealized gain on a foreign currency collar to economically hedge the Bureau van Dijk euro-denominated purchase price and acquisition-related costs, Moody’s net income was $313.6 million or $1.61 per share. This was up from $258.1 million or $1.30 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Increase, Costs RiseRevenues of $1 billion beat Zacks Consensus Estimate of $943.7 million. Also, revenues grew 8% year over year. The quarter witnessed higher domestic and international revenues. The impact of foreign currency translation was insignificant.Total expenses were $543 million, up 5% from the prior-year quarter. A rise in operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization costs were partially offset by a decline in selling, general and administrative expenses. The reported quarter also included $6.6 million of acquisition-related expenses.Adjusted operating income of $497 million jumped 13% year over year.

Thus, even though the company’s performance remained solid, outlook remained unchanged. Also, pressure on profitability is anticipated as the disposition of the non-core assets continues.However, Moody’s expects the company’s profitability to be benefited as a result of the reduction in expenses. Further, steady earnings provide support to the ratings. Also, despite the regulatory pressure, Credit Suisse is likely to maintain its capital position.The outlook reflects a robust capital position, decent management of risk and sound liquidity position.Credit Suisse currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

496,MCO,"Ratings of Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and its subsidiaries have been affirmed by the Moody's Investors Service, the rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). The company’s senior debt rating has been affirmed at A3. Further, the outlook has remained stable.Why the Ratings Were ReiteratedThe ratings affirmation is indicative of Morgan Stanley’s consistent improvement in profitability in the past few years. This reflects strong growth in the company’s Wealth Management segment and its efforts to strengthen efficiency through efficient cost control.Apart from these, rebound in Morgan Stanley’s fixed income sales and trading operations and robust capital markets related business performance despite low volatility across the industry support profitability. The rating agency anticipates that these factors along with lower tax rates will likely boost bottom-line growth over “the near-to-medium term.”These credit positives are marginally offset by faster pace of growth in loan (mostly tied to low risk secured loans to Morgan Stanley’s wealth management clients), which is significantly “above the aggregate US bank loan growth rate or the growth rate of nominal US GDP.” Also, the company shows more vulnerability to stress as it has “experienced a greater decline in its capital ratios under the Federal Reserve's severely adverse DFAST stress test than has any of its closest US peers.”Driven by this, Morgan Stanley has been gradually increasing its share repurchase authorization. But Moody’s anticipates the company to return more capital to the shareholders in the coming years as its profitability continues to improve. Though this will lower the company’s capital ratios, these are expected to “remain above than median of its global investment bank peers.”What Could Make Moody's Change the RatingsRatings of Morgan Stanley are not likely to be upgraded in absence of considerable lower dependence of its earnings to the capital markets operation. Also, improvement in capital and liquidity ratios along with lower volatility in earnings will support the ratings upgrade.However, Morgan Stanley’s ratings could be downgraded in case of deterioration in credit quality and a rise in illiquid risk assets. Further, worsening liquidity profile and any indications of control or risk management failures may lead to lowering of the company’s ratings.The company’s shares have rallied 26.9% in the past year, outperforming 25.9% gain of the industry. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

497,MCO,"Ratings of SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) have been reiterated by Moody's Investors Service, an arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). The company’s long-term issuer rating and senior debt rating of A3 has been affirmed. Also, the rating agency kept the outlook stable.Further, its main bank subsidiary — Silicon Valley Bank — has been rated Aa3/Prime-1 for deposits with an issuer rating of A3. Also, its standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA) remained at a2 and its counterparty risk assessments at A1(cr)/Prime-1(cr).Reasons for the Ratings AffirmationThe ratings are based on SVB Financial’s earnings strength and impressive asset quality. Also, the company’s robust liquidity and capital position as well as sustainability of its business model supported growth.Per Moody’s, SVB Financial has a “niche business model banking venture capital, private equity, and technology, life science companies.” These provide the company with low-cost funding sources, thus supporting its strong liquidity position.Further, per the rating agency, the company’s credit quality is better than the similarly rated peers, although “its business focus has led to an above-average growth rate, sector concentrations and appetite for sizable single credits”. Though the company witnesses asset quality volatility owing to business model, these are “near the median of similarly-rated peers.”Also, this business model is sustainable as SVB Financial continues to display “expertise and knowledge of the sectors it serves, as well as its long-standing relationships with venture capital and private equity firms.”Moreover, the bank’s strong internal capital generation and absence of shareholder payout help it maintain a solid capital position. The rating agency assesses SVB Financial’s robust liquidity and high capital ratios as buffers to credit volatility and risks related to above-average loan growth.What Could Make Moody's Change the RatingsSVB Financial’s BCA ratings could be revised upward by the rating agency if the company witnesses meaningfully slower pace of loan growth as well as “reduced sector and borrower concentrations” on assumption that other financial metrics are stable.On the flip side, in case SVB Financial’s liquidity position and underwriting standards weakens, the rating agency may downgrade its ratings.Shares of SVB Financial have jumped 58% in the past six months, outperforming 21.2% rally of the industry. SVB Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth a LookA couple of stocks in the same space worth a look are Cathay General Bancorp (CATY  -  Free Report) and Columbia Banking System, Inc.

Adjusted earnings per share of 3 cents were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Further, the figure compared favorably with the prior-year quarter’s loss of 4 cents.The results largely benefited from top-line growth and rise in loan originations.

The company recorded a rise in global public, project and infrastructure finance revenues mainly driven by increased U.S. public finance issuance as well as strength in infrastructure finance.Moody’s Analytics revenues jumped 32% year over year to $440.8 million, mainly driven by higher non-U.S. revenues. Notably, foreign currency translation favorably impacted revenues by 3%.The segment recorded growth in research, data and analytics revenues, professional services revenues and Enterprise Risk Solutions revenues.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2017, Moody’s had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.18 billion, down 47% from Dec 31, 2016 level.

500,MCO,"CIT Group Inc.’s (CIT  -  Free Report) ratings outlook has been upgraded to positive from stable by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report). Further, the rating agency affirmed the company's Ba2 senior unsecured, Ba2 subordinate shelf, Ba3 preferred shelf, B1 non-cumulative preferred shelf and B1(hyb) preferred stock ratings.Per Moody’s, CIT Group's ratings reflect its competitive position in commercial finance operations, revenue diversity, robust liquidity and rational “capital targets.”Moreover, long-term and short-term deposit ratings for its subsidiary — CIT Bank — has been retained at Baa2 and Prime-2, respectively. Further, baseline credit assessment at ba1 has been affirmed.Why was the Outlook Upgraded?Expectations of funding stability and a decline in funding costs, steady improvement in profitability, restructuring initiatives and strong credit quality led Moody’s to upgrade CIT Group's outlook. Also per the rating agency, the company’s efforts to divest non-core operations and “repayment of associated market debt” take it a step closer to its objective of becoming a leading national middle-market bank.Moody's expects CIT Group to complete the previously announced divestiture of its European railcar leasing business, NACCO, and its Financial Freedom reverse mortgage servicing business and loan portfolio this year. These are projected to lower the company’s operational risk.While Moody’s expects CIT Group’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to decline this year owing to its efforts to reward shareholders, the company’s capital position will remain strong.Our TakeCIT Group’s efforts to simplify operations and improve efficiency, a rising rate scenario and strong balance sheet position are expected to support growth.Shares of CIT Group have jumped 26.6% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rise of 6.4%.CIT Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth ConsideringA couple of stocks in the finance space worth a look are Houlihan Lokey, Inc.

501,MCO,"The Sage of Omaha published his annual letter on Feb 24. He remained bullish on U.S. stocks over the long term. After all, stocks have performed better than bonds in the long run. Inflationary pressure is also brewing looming concern. This will affect bonds more than stocks because of their lower returns.Corporate America, in the meantime, has received a massive permanent tax break, which will further boost profits. Changes to the tax law has already provided the much-needed windfall to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK-B, whose market value rose 21.9% in 2017, edging past the S&P 500’s return of 21.8%.Given the positives, investing in Berkshire’s largest stock holdings seems judicious. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time.Buffett’s Annual Letter to Shareholders: Stay Invested in StocksWorld’s third richest man, Warren Buffett, urged investors to ignore gyrations in the equity market, guidance from market pundits with fancy credentials and resist the temptation to scoop up bonds. He added that investors with long-term goals like pension funds and savings-minded individuals will make a “terrible mistake” if they measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks.As the investor’s investment horizon increases a diversified portfolio of equities do better than bonds. Lest we forget, the S&P 500 that mirrors a huge cross-section of American businesses has returned an average of 10% per year, while long-term government bonds have returned 5% to 6%.Treasury Yields RiseTreasury yields are scaling record highs after a significant rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Federal Reserve will hike rates more times than anticipated.The labor market has come a long way since the Great Recession, with wages growing at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009. Several states have also raised wages. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).Rise in bond yields, in the meantime, might tempt investors to take money away from equities and invest in bonds. But, Buffett cautioned that long-term bonds tend to generate less return than stocks and with rising inflation, bonds can really become a dumb investment. Needless to say, rising inflation erodes the value of the principal on fixed income securities.Buffet Thanks New Tax Code for Big GainsBuffett told investors that Berkshire got a lift from the new tax code. He wrote that Berkshire made a $65.3 billion net gain in 2017, which increased the per-share book value of both Class A and Class B stock by 23%. However, only $36 billion came from the company’s operations. The rest came from the new U.S. tax code, which slashed corporate taxes and in turn boosted profit margins.The House of Representatives passed the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years. The headline-grabbing move lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, while any income brought back from overseas is taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).5 of Berkshire’s Largest Stock Holdings to Buy NowAs mentioned above, business magnate Warren Buffet prefers investing in stocks rather than bonds.

502,MCO,"Barclays’ (BCS  -  Free Report) senior unsecured debt and the Baa2 long-term issuer ratings, and the Prime-3 short-term issuer ratings have been placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, a rating arm of Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report).Additionally, the baa2 standalone baseline credit assessment (BCA), the A1 long-term deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings, the Prime-1 short-term deposit ratings and the A1 (cr) long-term Counterparty Risk (CR) assessment of the bank’s operating entity Barclays Bank PLC are under review for probable downgrade. Nonetheless, Barclays Bank's Prime-1(cr) short-term CR assessment has been reiterated.Reasons for Probable Ratings DowngradeAndrea Usai, Senior Vice President at Moody's said, “The review for downgrade on Barclays reflects the group's ongoing credit weaknesses and likely impact of ring-fencing implementation, which have been the main drivers for the negative outlook since last September.”Barclays is restructuring its operations given the impending requirement to separate its domestic retail and business banking operations from other business, per the U.K.'s ring-fencing rules. The company intends to fulfil this by April 2018 with Barclays Bank becoming its non-ring-fenced bank.Therefore, Barclays’ existing U.K. retail and business banking operations will be transferred to the newly created ring-fenced bank — Barclays Bank U.K. As this new entity will become more dependent on risky wholesale and capital markets activities, it will lead to rise in risk profile and earnings volatility. Overall, these would result in “a weaker standalone credit profile for Barclays Bank.”At present, Barclays Bank’s ratings are supported by Barclays’ strong businesses, solid loan growth and diversified funding sources, partially offset by weaker net profitability (expected to continue over the next few quarters) and capital markets activities.What Will Moody’s Review?As part of review, Moody’s intends to reassess the standalone credit profiles of Barclays Bank (following the rind-fencing) and broader Barclays. This will include whether business diversification going forward will support stable profits “sufficient to maintain the one-notch positive adjustment for Business Diversification, currently included in the BCA for Barclays Bank.”Moody’s also plans to assess the expected loss for each instrument class issued by Barclays, Barclays Bank and Barclays Bank U.K. through its advanced Loss Given Failure analysis. Further as a result of implementation of ring-fencing, Moody’s for the first time will provide “separate notional BCA to the broader Barclays group.”Our TakeBarclays’ restructuring and business simplifying efforts have ended successfully and will likely continue to result in decrease in expenses. Also, driven by these efforts, the company intends to announce dividend of 6.5 pence per share (subject to regulatory approvals) in 2018.While Moody’s review (expected to be completed over next few weeks) may weigh on the stock in the near term, improving global economy will support Barclays’ profitability.Over the last six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied 17.9% on the on the NYSE, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereNotably, other than Barclays, the rating agency have put some other finance companies including E*TRADE Financial Corporation (ETFC  -  Free Report) and U.S. Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report) under review.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

503,MCO,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, which handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33. Also, the bottom line improved 16% from the year-ago quarter.Shares of Moody’s rose nearly 2.4% in the pre-market trading. Notably, the price reaction during the full trading session will provide a better idea about how the investors accepted the results.Better-than-expected results were attributable to impressive revenue growth, reflecting strong issuance in the quarter. Also, both Moody’s Investors Service and Moody’s Analytics segments witnessed improved performance. However, higher expenses were on the downside.After taking into considering unrealized gain on a foreign currency collar to economically hedge the Bureau van Dijk euro-denominated purchase price and acquisition-related costs, Moody’s net income was $313.6 million or $1.61 per share. This was up from $258.1 million or $1.30 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues Increase, Costs RiseRevenues of $1 billion beat Zacks Consensus Estimate of $943.7 million. Also, revenues grew 8% year over year. The quarter witnessed higher domestic and international revenues. The impact of foreign currency translation was insignificant.Total expenses were $543 million, up 5% from the prior-year quarter. A rise in operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization costs were partially offset by a decline in selling, general and administrative expenses. The reported quarter also included $6.6 million of acquisition-related expenses.Adjusted operating income of $497 million jumped 13% year over year. Adjusted operating margin came in at 45.7%, up from 44.2% in the year-ago quarter.Segment Performance ImprovesMoody’s Investors Service revenues jumped 10% year over year to $686.7 million, driven by growth in U.S. revenues as well as international revenues.Strong global leveraged finance issuance led to growth in global corporate finance revenues. Also, global structured finance revenues witnessed a rise mainly driven by increased issuance of U.S. CLOs.Further, global financial institutions’ revenues improved, primarily reflecting rise in issuance from infrequent issuers. However, owing to a fall in U.S. issuance and a change in mix of European infrastructure issuance, the company recorded decline in global public, project and infrastructure finance revenues.Moody’s Analytics revenues grew 4% year over year to $313.8 million, mainly due to higher U.S. revenues. Foreign currency translation impact was immaterial.The segment recorded growth in research, data and analytics revenues (up 7% year over year to $180.9 million) and stable Enterprise Risk Solutions revenues of $97.3 million. However, global professional services revenues declined 5% from the prior-year quarter to $35.6 million.Strong Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, Moody’s had total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $3.4 billion, up 51% from $2.22 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 0.7 million shares for $79.5 million.Upbeat 2017 GuidanceFor 2017, Moody’s now anticipates revenues to increase in the high-single-digit percent range. This was revised up from the prior growth projection of mid-single-digit percent range.Operating expenses are projected to decline in the range of 25–30%. Adjusted operating expenses are estimated to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range.Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 47%.Earnings per share for 2017 are now projected to be $5.69 to $5.84 (up from the previous outlook of $5.46–$5.61). Adjusted earnings are now expected to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.50 (up from the prior outlook of $5.15–$5.30).Our TakeMoody’s results reflect a decent performance. The company remains well positioned for growth on strong market position, strength in its diverse operations and strategic acquisitions.Moody's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Moody's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Moody's Corporation QuoteCurrently, Moody’s has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

505,MCO,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is slated to report its second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 21, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to record marginal growth on a year-over-year basis.Driven by an increase in revenues, Moody’s’ first-quarter earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, rise in operating expenses was an undermining factor.Also, the company’s business activities and prospects encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 for the just-concluded quarter moved up by a penny over the last seven days.Moody’s boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.7%.The company’s price performance has been impressive as well. Its shares have gained 34.3% year to date, significantly outperforming the Zacks categorized Miscellaneous Financial Services industry’s rally of 6.7%.Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Moody's Corporation Quote Before digging deeper into the factors that are likely to influence the results, let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of Moody’s beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Moody’s is +4.51%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.39 is more than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33.Zacks Rank: Moody’s currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, increases the chances of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected Results  Favorable corporate bond issuance environment: Backdrop for bond issuance (driven by tightening of credit spreads and pull back of long-term yield curve) during the second quarter was favorable. Thus, investment grade bond and leveraged loan issuances volume remained strong year over year. So, Moody’s corporate finance revenues are expected to rise.Structured products issuance trend remain strong: Quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities remained robust. So, Moody’s will likely benefit from this trend and witness a rise in structured finance revenues during the quarter.Strategic deal to support revenue growth: Moody’s is expected to record revenue growth on the back of its strategic acquisitions, which has increased scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. However, strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to impact quarterly revenues to some extent.Expenses to remain high: As Moody’s continues with its inorganic growth strategy, acquisition and restructuring costs are expected to remain high. So, overall expenses are anticipated to rise during the quarter.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other finance stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% and a Zacks Rank #3. It is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 21.Zions Bancorporation (ZION  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Jul 25.

507,MCO,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report)  may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Moody's Corporationis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for MCO in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.39 per share for MCO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for MCO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 4.51% heading into earnings season.Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Moody's Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that MCO has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Moody's Corporation, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.

508,MCO,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20.7%. In all the trailing four quarters, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This represents an average positive earnings surprise of 10.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNCR has been the global leader in self-service ATMs for several years in terms of market share. The company remains the largest supplier of ATM machines in the Asia-Pacific and North America while maintaining its leadership in the Asian and European markets.The company reported encouraging first-quarter 2017 results. Also, revenues and earnings increased on a year-over-year basis, primarily on strong growth in its software business.NCR recently announced that its APTRA OptiCash software will be deployed by Banca Comerciala Româna (""BCR""), a financial group in Romania and a member of Erste Group, across its network. We believe that the installation will help year-over-year cost savings on cash management services.The company recently won a deal from Japanese Restaurant and Jazz venue, Yoshi, for its restaurant operations transformation. Per the deal, the restaurant will implement NCR’s point-of-sale (POS) platform which will not only help it modernize its outlets but also enhance customers’ experience by reducing transaction time.According to Don Zimmerman, general manager at NCR Hospitality, “As the leader in hospitality technology, we want to make everyday easier for restaurant operators with the best possible software solutions for their business to help increase revenues and bottom line results.”By 2020, RBR Research expects India to install base similar to the size of the U.S., trailing only China. Currently, India is the world’s fourth largest ATM market, with China, the U.S. and Japan holding the first three spots. This creates huge opportunities for companies like NCR.Continuous product launches, growing popularity of its self-service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are key catalysts. Continuous deal wins also drive growth.However, similar offerings from the likes of Diebold Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) remain concerns.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NCR will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 75 cents per share. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: NCR carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.51% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (CHKP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.90% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

509,MCO,"LendingClub Corporation (LC  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 1 cent, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 2 cents. However, the figure compares favorably with the prior-year quarter’s loss of 2 cents.The results largely benefited from top-line growth and rise in loan originations. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) showed impressive growth. However, a decline in loan balance and escalating expenses were the major headwinds.Results for the reported quarter included several significant items. Including these, consolidated net loss was $92.1 million compared with net loss of $32.3 million in the year-ago quarter.For 2017, the company reported nil adjusted earnings per share, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 1 cent but compares favorably with the prior-year’s loss of 10 cents. Consolidated net loss was $154 million compared with $146 million in 2016.Revenues & Costs RiseTotal net revenues increased 19.9% year over year to $156.5 million. The rise was primarily due to higher volume of loan originations. However, the figure marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $157.2 million.For 2017, net revenues of $574.5 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $575.3 million. The figure jumped 14.7% year over year.Total operating expenses came in at $247.8 million, reflecting a considerable rise of 52% from the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to a class action litigation settlement of $77 million.Adjusted EBITDA totaled $19 million against adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $0.9 million in the prior-year quarter.In the reported quarter, loan originations were $2.4 billion, up 22.7% from the year-ago quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $402 million, down 22% from the prior quarter. Loans were down 14% sequentially to $2.9 billion. Total stockholders' equity was $928 million, down 5% from the Dec 31, 2016 level.GuidanceConcurrent with the results, management provided guidance for first-quarter 2018 and full-year 2018.First-quarter 2018Total net revenues in the range of $145-$155 millionAdjusted EBITDA in the range of $5-$10 millionStock-based compensation of nearly $19 millionDepreciation and amortization and other net adjustments of roughly $11 millionNet loss in the range of $25-$20 million Full-Year 2018Total net revenues in the range of $680-$705 millionAdjusted EBITDA in the range of $75-$90 millionStock-based compensation of nearly $77 millionDepreciation and amortization and other net adjustments of roughly $51 millionNet loss in the range of $53-$38 million Other DevelopmentsLendingClub announced that it has reached a preliminary settlement of $125 million for the class action lawsuits filed in federal and California state courts arising from legacy issues disclosed by the company in 2016.Per the terms, LendingClub’s insurance will be covering $47.75 million. Further, the remaining $77.25 million were reflected in fourth-quarter net loss and will be paid from liquid assets of nearly $650 million held as of Dec 31, 2017.Our ViewpointLendingClub’s revenue growth is commendable on the back of strong loans originations. Also, rising adjusted EBITDA is impressive. However, declining loan balance is a headwind. Also, its exposure to numerous legal hassles will keep expenses elevated in the near term.LendingClub Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise LendingClub Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | LendingClub Corporation QuoteLendingClub carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Performance of Stocks in the Same SpaceAmerican Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.58, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.6%.

511,MCO,"The markets hate the unknown and unpredictable, and the simmering tension in the Korean peninsula is a bit of both. Investors and politicians across the world seem to be apprehensive about the global reaction to North Korea's sixth and also its biggest nuclear weapons test this Sunday.With the potential for conflict over North Korea’s act in the forefront of everyone’s minds, stock markets are on tenterhooks as well. In fact, according to some South Korean officials, North Korea appears to be setting up the test for another intercontinental ballistic missile.Back home, geopolitics and severe hurricanes rocked Wall Street’s calm, as markets remained skittish in the aftermath of North Korea’s nuclear test and a second potent hurricane — Irma — expected in the United States in as many weeks.Amid such a fickle environment that could rapidly escalate, it was no surprise that investors sought asset security as gold prices flared up and the U.S. Treasuries strengthened.However, we feel that in such a scenario, investors should look beyond gold and government securities. We have created a multi-faceted screen for you that will give investors stability and profit growth potential farther than the next quarter.Making Sense of ProfitsIt is common knowledge that Wall Street is obsessed with the bottom line. But are higher profits necessarily better? Are these really a true indicator of the staying power of a company’s earnings?While dollar profits trump all other measures hands down for sheer shock value, these do not relate profits to the size of the company, its sales, resources or shareholder capital. The only profitability measure that reasonably works across industries is the ratio of return generated on the dollars invested in a business.The most popular among these ratios is Return on Equity (“ROE”), favored by both Wall Street analysts and investors alike. However, since the ROE measure receives the most attention from the investor community, executives focus heavily on this metric as well. Companies can exploit financial strategies (like increasing debt leverage and stock buybacks funded through built-up cash) to artificially maintain a healthy ROE for a while and conceal weakening operational profitability.So, let’s shift our focus to a different bottom-line metric which garners far less attention from executives and investors alike — Return on Invested Capital (“ROI”).The Lesser-Known ROI MetricEssentially, ROI shows how optimally management has been directing the capital under its control into profitable investments. It paints a clear picture of how efficiently a company is employing its capital and whether its competitive positioning is allowing it to produce good returns from that capital.Also, we will focus on large caps, which are big, established companies in the stock market, and have a comparatively softer risk profile. By virtue of their dominant market position, global footprint and relatively consistent cash-flow stream, these companies tend to be more reliable investments — which is called for in the current geopolitical environment. Also, ROI is particularly relevant for assessing companies that have a large amount of capital.Our ScreenNonetheless, it might be quite difficult for investors to single out such companies, as we need companies which have generated strong ROIs over a sufficiently long period of time, in order to determine a robust trend.So, we have created a three-faceted screen to shortlist such companies for you. Only those companies which have generated ROIs in excess of 15% on average over the last five years can get past our screen. Their current ROI (over the trailing 12 months) also needs to be at least 15%.In addition, to ensure that we hone in on stable companies, which have an established history of generating profits, our screen allows only those companies which have a market capitalization north of $10 billion.Needless to say, these companies must have a solid Zacks Rank too. A favorable Zacks Rank shows positive analyst interest and brighter prospects for the company.These stocks have proven their mettle consistently during challenging times and look set to outperform peers effortlessly through efficient usage of assets. Just five companies got through our screen, and here they are:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Boeing is one of the world's major aerospace firms, and designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services, and supports commercial jetliners, satellites, military aircraft, human space flight, missile defense, and launch systems, and services globally.The aerospace giant generated an impressive average ROI of 33.2% over the last five years and boasts a current ROI of 64%.Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company has seen a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017, which is now pegged at $9.97, up from $9.42 witnessed a couple of months back. This move denotes decidedly bullish analyst sentiment for the stock.Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report)Texas Instrumentsis a global semi-conductor company, and one of the world's leading designers and suppliers of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits.In the past five years, this Zacks Rank #2 stock generated an impressive ROI of 18.9% on an average and has a current ROI of 28.4%.Analysts envision a healthy future for the company, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings trended up sharply over the past 60 days, from $3.92 to $4.13 per share, thanks to 13 upward estimate revisions.Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report)Based in Foster City, CA, Gilead Sciences focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for several indications.This Zacks Rank #2 stock generated an average ROI of 37.1% in five years’ time and its current ROI is pegged at 28.5%.Analysts have great expectations from the company this year and have been revising its 2017 earnings estimates upward for the past couple of months. Gilead’s 2017 estimate inched up from $8.16 to $8.76 over the past 60 days.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report)IDEXX Laboratories is a global leader in providing diagnostic, detection, and information products to the animal health industry, as well as quality assurance products and services to the food and water industries.In five years’ time, the company recorded an average ROI of 34.6% and boasts a current ROI of 45.8%.Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 stock over the past two months, with five upward estimate revisions for its 2017 earnings. This has led to a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017, which is now pegged at $3.17, up from $3.05 witnessed 60 days ago.Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report)Moody'sprovides credit ratings, and credit, capital markets, and economic related research, data, and analytical tools worldwide.This Zacks Rank #2 stock generated an average ROI of 36.3% over the last five years, with a current ROI of 34.9%.Over the past couple of months, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company, with two upward estimate revisions for 2017 earnings.

512,MCO,"Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is slated to report its third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell. The company is expected to witness a fall in revenues for its Corporate Finance line, the largest revenue contributor at the Moody's Investors Service (“MIS”) division.Backdrop for bond issuance (driven by tightening of credit spreads and a rise in long-term yield curve) during the third quarter was not much favorable. Hence, investment grade bond and leveraged loan issuances volume remained muted sequentially.So, Corporate Finance revenues are expected to decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Corporate Finance revenues of $302 million indicates a 15.2% fall from the last quarter.Apart from this, quarterly issuance volume for commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations and asset backed securities remained slow. Therefore, Moody’s will likely be hit by this trend and witness a decrease in Structured Finance revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Structured Finance revenues is $110 million, reflecting a fall of 7.6% from the prior quarter.Further, MIS division’s other revenue source — Financial Institutions — is anticipated to report $97 million of revenues, down 4.9% sequentially.  On the other hand, Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance unit revenues are projected to witness a 2.9% rise from the last quarter to $108 million.Overall, MIS division is projected to show a sequential decline in the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MIS division revenues is $623 million, reflecting a fall of 9.3% from the prior quarter.Other Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsHigher revenues from Moody's Analytics (“MA”) division: Moody’s continues to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. Given the rise in demand for analytics, the company’s MA division is expected to show a rise in revenues.  The MA division’s all three business units are anticipated to witness higher revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Hence, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for MA division revenues of $351 million indicates an increase of 11.8% sequentially.Strategic deals/investments to support revenues: Moody’s is likely to show revenue growth on the back of its strategic acquisitions and investments. These have increased the scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. However, strength of the U.S. dollar is likely to impact quarterly revenues to some extent.Overall, Moody’s is projected to show 1.7% sequential dip in revenues, mainly owing to dismal MIS division’s performance. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $983.4 million reflects 7.2% year-over-year growth.Expenses to remain high: As Moody’s continues with its inorganic growth strategy, acquisition and restructuring costs are expected to remain high. So, overall expenses are anticipated to rise during the quarter.Now, let’s see what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Moody’s will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. This is because it has Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Though a favorable Zack Rank increases the predictive power of ESP we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings the to-be-reported quarter has been revised 4.3% upward over the last seven days to $1.44, with two out of three estimates moving up. The Zacks Consensus Estimate reflects a year-over-year improvement of 7.5%. On the other hand, on a sequential basis, earnings are projected to show a 4.6% decline.Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Moody's Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Moody's Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some finance stocks worth considering, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Ellington Financial LLC (EFC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results on Nov 6.

514,MCO,"Aflac Inc.’s (AFL  -  Free Report) third-quarter results, scheduled for Oct 25, are expected to benefit from increased revenues from its U.S. segment. This unit has been performing strongly as evident by increasing revenues since 2010 for the past many years, a trend that continued through the first half of 2017.We expect the same to continue in the third quarter given a number of growth initiatives in this segment such as the adoption of Everwell for increased penetration, delivery of value-added services and increased client retention; product partnering to drive improved account values and employee access; and investment in administrative capabilities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is $1.6 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 6.7%.Aflac’s top line remains sufficiently exposed to a challenging operating environment, primarily in Japan. The persistent low interest rate environment has led the company to deemphasize sales of first-sector (life insurance) products in Japan.The curtailment of these products has led to a decline in revenues by 0.3% in 2016 and 3% in first-half 2017.  The restriction on sale of first-sector products, which carry higher premiums, is further expected to suppress top-line growth in the region in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this segment is pegged at $3.8 billion, which signifies a decline of 7.9% year over year.The company is in the process of converting its Japan branch into a subsidiary. The conversion will enhance Aflac's business development flexibility. The company booked approximately $14 million in pretax costs associated with its Japan branch conversion in the first half of 2017. The conversion remains on track and the company expects to incur conversion costs of $120 million to $130 million pretax through mid-2018. These costs will hurt the company’s margins in the coming quarters.Aflac derives almost 70% of total revenues from Japan, which exposes it to significant foreign currency volatility, which may hurt its margins.However, the company’s continued efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Aflac has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.31%.
