1,ZTS,"Pharmaceutical company Zoetis (ZTS) plans to acquire Abaxis (ABAX) for nearly $2 billion — propelling Abaxis stock to break out in morning trades Wednesday.The deal values Abaxis at $83 a share in cash. Abaxis makes chemical analyzers used in human and veterinary patients. Zoetis, a pharmaceutical company, makes drugs for use in animal health. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year.Raymond James analyst John Ransom called the price tag rich. It represents a 15.7% premium to Abaxis stock's prior closing price and only a 5.7% premium to the high seen in January. For Abaxis shareholders, the price is reasonable. But the firm is unlikely to get another bid, he said in a note.""We view this price as somewhat rich relative to an asset that had not performed exceedingly well of late, with core chemistry growth somewhat of a question in the mind of investors,"" he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut investors rewarded Abaxis stock. On the stock market today, Abaxis shares popped 16.2% to close at 83.34. It had been consolidating with a buy point at 78.63 and was among stocks near a buy zone on Tuesday. Zoetis shares dipped a fraction to 82.85.Zoetis sees the deal as boosting its animal diagnostics exposure. The firm estimates that market is valued at north of $3 billion, with a compound annual growth rate of 10% over the past three years. Zoetis expects that segment to continue outgrowing the overall animal health market.""Together, we can bring more veterinarian customers a broader range of products that fit into our comprehensive solutions and innovations, from prediction and early detection of disease in animals to prevention and treatment,"" Zoetis Chief Executive Juan Alaix said in a written statement.Raymond James' Ransom says the deal makes sense for Zoetis, which is already in 45 countries. This will save Abaxis time and expenses of slowing building out its global infrastructure. Recently, Abaxis expanded in Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.Zoetis is ""a logical (and very interested) buyer,"" Ransom said. In 2016, it bought Scandinavian Micro Biodevices for $80 million to expand its pipeline in veterinary diagnostics. The smaller firm made ""lab on a chip"" diagnostics.The acquisitions of Scandinavian Micro Biodevices and Abaxis suggest Zoetis has ""a desire to more meaningfully enter the field beyond the existing rapid assay product line,"" he said.Abaxis Chief Executive Clint Severson sees ""a prime opportunity to grow our business as part of Zoetis."" In the fiscal year ended March 31, Abaxis generated $244.7 million in sales, up 8% vs. last year. That year, about 83% of its sales were from diagnostics and services in the veterinary market.""Zoetis has the global presence and direct veterinary customer relationships to deliver greater value to more customers around the world and accelerate growth of our international operations,"" Severson said in a prepared statement.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

5,ZTS,"Paycom Software (PAYC) gets plastered by sellers after posting Q1 results late Tuesday, down as much as 10%. Former IBD 50 name Zoetis (ZTS) is slammed more than 7% after its Thursday report.And just a few weeks earlier, Micron Technology (MU) is sent packing to the showers, batted down nearly 20% in the span of 10 trading sessions. Why? March 22. Good fiscal Q2 numbers.Sense a pattern here?The months of January, April, July and October never fail to remind investors how stocks can soar or plunge on quarterly results. This peculiar pattern, in a way, presents a challenge to all U.S. stock investors. Have you been trading stocks the IBD way for a few months or for a few decades? All it takes is just a few quarterly results among high-powered growth stocks to know the risks of holding a big position right before the news.Earnings results are Wall Street's version of the double-edged sword.You're a smart trader. Your goal: maximize the profits in big winners and minimize losses in weaker plays. So, consider these four suggestions that can help you navigate choppy waters. They likely carry more weight now as IBD's current outlook stands at ""uptrend under pressure.""Tip 1: Study the stock's long-term character. Let's revisit Paycom. The HR management software firm and Leaderboard name cleared a base Feb. 9, 2017, a day after posting exceptional results (EPS up 80% in Q4 2016, revenue up 35%). But a pair of key follow-on buy points came in between quarterly results. The first and second pullbacks to the 10-week moving average came during the weeks ended March 31 and June 16 the same year.However, Abiomed (ABMD) has acted differently. The heart-pump firm broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 during the week ended April 28, 2017, a week before it shared fiscal Q4 results.A more recent breakout past a five-week flat base at 200.48 took place on Jan. 5 this year, three weeks before the next quarterly report.Tip 2: Count, count, count. That is, check the number of bases that stocks in your portfolio have created. Has your stock built a third, fourth or fifth base? Chances of a severe post-earnings slide go up. (Readers can use the pattern recognition service on MarketSmith to save time in counting bases.)A stock must rise at least 20% from a correct entry point in a primary base or the top of a base on base before it can form the next-stage base.If your stock is in an earnings turnaround and you scooped shares on an early-stage breakout, you likely may see more strong quarterly results ahead that can keep the rally humming. Apple (AAPL) is not an IBD 50 play, but it still serves as perhaps one of the finest examples in 2017. Through the March quarter, the iPhone giant has now strung together five straight quarters of double-digit profit growth. That's not easy for a firm that logged $229 billion in revenue in fiscal 2017.Tip 3: Pocket your gains on the way up. Have you heard of the expression, ""betting with house money""? It means you've sold part of your position in a winning stock and no one can take those profits away. But you keep some shares to participate in further upside. A great earnings report can carry a market leader further. But it's smart portfolio strategy to at least snatch partial gains when your stock rises 20% to 25% past the most recent breakout point. Want to aim for 30%, 40% profits? Sure. But never forget that most pigs get slaughtered.Tip 4: Check the Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Has this proprietary measure, found in Stock Checkup and in IBD's stock research tables, weakened in recent weeks? If so, perhaps institutions have been dumping more shares than usual. Why? They may lack confidence about the upcoming three-month results or next quarter's outlook.

9,ZTS,"From A to Z — Adobe Systems (ADBE) to Zoetis (ZTS) — $17.8 billion MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has the sort of leading stocks that lift the portfolio into the ranks of top mutual funds.Additional top stocks like Netflix (NFLX), Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are also big reasons why the fund is in a groove, outperforming the broad market as well as its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. over short, intermediate and long periods, ranging from year-to-date to one, three, five and 10 years.So far this year, going into Wednesday, the fund was up 8.22% vs. 5.27% for its direct rivals and 1.79% for the big-cap bogey. Netflix was up 75% this year. Adobe advanced 32%. Amazon was up 29%. Lululemon had gained 20%, while Zoetis climbed 19%. Netflix, Lululemon and Amazon happen to be members of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, for one, is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing-trading environment. Details on past trades are accessible to SwingTrade subscribers and trialists. Free trials are available.Paul Gordon, who manages the fund along with Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel, says the fund uses a classic investment strategy. ""The underlying philosophy is that over time stocks follow earnings and cash,"" he said. ""We look for companies that grow earnings and cash flow above market-average rates across economic cycles. We look for companies with strong competitive positions in growing industries that have pricing power, good management teams and quality characteristics such as recurring revenue, low capital intensity and attractive balance sheets.""And the fund is patient. ""We have a long investment time horizon, which you see in our low (annual) turnover,"" he said.The fund has not changed its approach during the recent market volatility. But the fund added to some names on price dips. ""Volatility in the market sometimes provides an opportunity to collectively add to secular growth companies that we like,"" Gordon said.Netflix's earnings per share grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past six quarters.As IBD reported Tuesday, Netflix stock gapped up that morning after it crushed expectations for new subscriber growth in the first quarter and guided higher than views for the current quarter.The streaming service's push into original programming is a key strategy.""Netflix has about 120 million subscribers around the world,"" Gordon said. ""They've had success ramping up subscribers. The real excitement (generated by their) January (earnings) call was the lack of (departures by customers) following their price increases, which proves the market's confidence in their long-term pricing power.""Lululemon's share price has uptrended for nearly a year, reversing an approximately yearlong downtrend. ""The issue that Lululemon faced was that it grew very rapidly for a number of years,"" Gordon said. ""They took several years to reinvest in the company, which hurt profitability. Now they seem to be coming out the other side.""Gordon added, ""As revenues continue to increase and costs increase at a slower pace, it benefits their earnings growth.""The fund trimmed modestly in recent disclosures. Gordon describes the trims as ""just selectively trimming some into (share price) strength.""Amazon, Gordon says, is firing on all cylinders. ""Its e-commerce business continues to take significant incremental share of every retail dollar that's spent,"" he said.He calls Amazon Web Services the No. 1 player in its space. ""To drive down costs to customers and invest in new services, a web services provider needs scale,"" he added. ""Amazon has that scale."" Also, it continues to post significant revenue growth, he says.The segment of Amazon's e-commerce business that involves third parties selling through Amazon — its so-called 3P business — has higher-margin growth than its 1P business, sales of inventory owned by Amazon itself, Gordon says.Adobe's share price barely slipped during the recent market volatility. Adobe owes its resilience to its leadership status and to its switch to subscription revenue from sales of packaged software. ""Adobe has very strong competitive positions in growing markets,"" Gordon said. ""And it continues to experience the benefits of moving to a subscription-based business model.""The MFS team likes both faces of Zoetis' business. Its farm-animal medicine business is steady because farmers can't afford to lose livestock. Its pet-medicine business thrives on sentimentality. ""The company calls it the humanization of pets,"" Gordon said. ""In the 1950s your dog slept in a doghouse. Now the dog sleeps on the bed with you.""Gordon added, ""Zoetis is the largest competitor in animal health, an industry growing in the mid-single digits with fewer risks than human health, given that there is no third-party payer risk.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeRetirement Savings: More Americans Than Ever Have $1 Million Or More

""Looking forward, we expect the U.S. economy to expand at a faster than 3% growth rate, faster than the trajectory of the last several years, due to an uplift from a synchronized global recovery,"" the managers told shareholders in their Q4 commentary.They're betting on companies that they think can maintain above-average earnings growth no matter what the broad market is doing.

People are spending more at veterinary clinics on their pets.The farm-animals segment is less growthy but more stable. It does not fluctuate much as the broader economy speeds up and contracts because the cost of vaccines and other health products is small compared with overall costs of running a farm. Also, it's crucial for a farm to maintain the health of its livestock.The company is better focused than rivals that are part of large, more diverse pharmaceutical companies.EPS grew 8%, 25% and 47% the past three quarters.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:How A Top Oppenheimer Fund Is Coping With Blah GDP GrowthYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

19,ZTS,"Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) caters to a niche clientele, keeps pushing back the launch of its next product, and trades at a multiple of about 60 times earnings.XTo investors, that might sound like a big ""no thanks.""Yet Wall Street pros laud this veterinary diagnostics company's management as ""brilliant,"" with an ""unbelievable grasp of their business.""""Simply put, the company's execution continues to be second to none,"" Raymond James analyst John Ransom said in a recent note to clients.Ransom went on to say: ""Further, it is not often that a player in any space with dominant (approximately) 60% market share is able to maintain the base in highly competitive markets, yet Idexx posted placement numbers that suggest it could even be gaining share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor one thing, the niche market in question is the veterinary market, one that may sound small in number. There are fewer than 66,000 veterinarians across 31,000 animal health clinics in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Annually, though, vets serve millions of very passionate customers: pet owners. And, well, their pets.About 68% of U.S. households have a pet, according to the American Pet Products Association. That translates to nearly 90 million dogs and more than 94 million cats — not to mention the multitudes of birds, fish and other creatures hanging out in people's homes. Its most recent annual survey reveals that dog owners spent an annual average $731 on routine and surgical vet visits combined. Cat owners shelled out $427.Idexx is the industry leader in supplying vets with the technology to run those in-clinic tests and blood work. It caters primarily to beloved canines and felines in the U.S. and abroad. Like Raymond James' Ransom, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro pegs the company's stateside market share at a hefty 60%.No. 2 player Abaxis (ABAX) has cornered a quarter of the American market, while smaller competitor Heska (HSKA) has about a tenth. VCA unit Antech Diagnostics and Zoetis (ZTS) —the latter of which is acquiring Abaxis — also number among its rivals.Water treatment and livestock products account for a sliver of Idexx's revenue, but the big money comes from its companion animal diagnostics business. That includes a suite of in-clinic products such as chemistry panels, rapid test kits, veterinary instruments and analyzers. There are also external laboratory services such as diagnostic imaging and testing.The companion animal diagnostics unit brought Idexx more than $1.7 billion in net revenue in 2017, or 86.5% of its overall $1.97 billion haul for the year.When a person simply takes a pet to the vet, it is likely to result in Idexx's tests and equipment being used. In the U.S., some kind of diagnostic test is administered about 40% of the time people bring their fluffy friends to the clinic, Idexx said during its investor day presentation last August.Pet owners tend not to object. In fact, millennial pet owners are more likely than their older peers to say ""money is no object to me when it comes to my pets,"" according to Idexx survey work. Forty-one percent of 19- to 36-year olds felt that way, vs. 36% of Gen Xers and 21% of Baby Boomers.As younger people get laser-focused about their careers and wait longer to get married and have kids, ""(they) go out and get the dog at 24, 25,"" years old, said Massaro.Millennials, he said, are ""prioritizing pets over some other things that maybe people from one or two generations ago held in greater esteem.""Idexx's most recent quarter was lauded by analysts, as per-share profit rose 55% to $1.01 a share and revenue grew 16.5% to $538 million, topping views for 93 cents and $526 million, respectively, according to Zacks Investment Research.The company has seen success with SediVue, the industry's first in-clinic urine sediment analyzer. And its recently launched product, Catalyst SDMA, an in-clinic test used by vets to look for kidney disease, was adopted by 42% of its North American customers in the first few months of its debut. Idexx Chief Executive Jonathan Ayers contends that's ""an amazing, amazing accomplishment.""""Nothing happens fast in veterinary,"" he told analysts on the call. ""The adoption rates are typically very slow. And in that context, the adoption of SDMA on the slide has been exceptional. And so we're very, very pleased with the success we've had.""The quarterly beat reinforced Piper Jaffray's bullish call on the companion animal industry, and William Blair analysts said they ""believe the long-term investment merits of Idexx remain very compelling.""""They beat on every single line, every single reference category,"" said Canaccord Genuity's Massaro, adding that ""it gets down to extremely strong commercial execution. (Idexx has) one of the most savvy sales organizations I've ever seen."" He points to the company's unusually large direct sales force — 435 sales reps in North America and more than 100 in Europe — as a particular strength.Shares of Idexx ended trading Thursday down close to 1% to 202.37 but barely remained above a 202.36 buy point. Shares were up marginally on Friday. It broke sharply out of a cup-with-handle base in high volume following the company's earnings report on May 4.Management also lifted its full-year earnings guidance by 2 cents to $4.06 to $4.20 and organic revenue outlook to 10.5% to 12.5% growth on a currency-neutral basis. It reaffirmed its sales outlook, adjusted for exchange rates, at 12% to 14% growth.Even though Raymond James' Ransom had high praise for the company, he only reaffirmed his market perform rating in the same note to clients, citing the high price-to-earnings multiple as a hindrance to a more positive rating.That comes after Idexx has, on more than one occasion, pushed back the launch of its SNAP Fecal Dx, which will allow vets to test, in house, for the presence of hookworm, whipworm and roundworm infections.Canaccord's Massaro brushed off the delay. In his view, that Idexx continues to ""crush their numbers, raise their guide without a product launch coming. (It) tells me and the Street they're beating their numbers.""It's ""startling that Idexx can consistently trade almost three times the premium multiple of other good health care companies,"" said Massaro. For example, Hologic (HOLX), a medical imaging company that he calls the ""undisputed leader in 3D mammography,"" trades at about 19 times earnings (vs. Idexx's 60 times earnings).But Idexx's consistent beat-and-raise quarters and model of nearly 90% recurring revenue — ""unusually high for a health care number"" — bolster his confidence.Idexx's management team has an ""unbelievable grasp of their business,"" he said.William Blair analyst Ryan Daniels believes that the company is ""a durable business franchise that warrants a premium multiple,"" and wrote in early May that the firm ""would be more aggressive with share purchases on pullbacks.""More broadly, Raymond James' Ransom said in April that investors shouldn't expect growth to ramp up in the end-market for companion animal diagnostics. That means shares of companies like Idexx, Abaxis and Heska are ""more likely to move on individual successes (share gains, new product launches, etc.) than to move uniformly on an all-encompassing cyclical dynamic.""But given the baseline growth rate of the animal health diagnostics industry, Canaccord Genuity's Massaro says that means that ""even the worst company in the space would grow 6% to 8%"" each year.""It really is a spectacular industry,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Medtech Stock Breaks Out After Zoetis Snags It For $2 BillionStocks Showing Improving Market Leadership: Idexx Laboratories Earns 84 RS RatingThis Top Medical Stock Breaks Out After Its Beat-And-Raise

31,ZTS,"There's a dirty little secret in investing. It's sort of like those studies that show a pretty woman or a handsome man is more likely to be hired than someone who is ugly.Stocks are no different. A stock will be forgiven chart flaws more readily if the fundamentals are not just good but beautiful. Different rules for different folks? Well, yes. Who said life was fair?Netflix (NFLX) is a good example of a beautiful stock. Earnings grew 191% last year and are expected to surge 118% this year.The stock broke out in January and then advanced more than 60% to a March 12 high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq scored an intraday high within a day of Netflix's high.The Nasdaq then corrected about 11%. Netflix fell almost 19%.If a stock has so-so fundamentals, then that bigger-than-average pullback might be regarded as a serious flaw. But for a hot growth stock, a sharper correction is accepted, and a quicker rebound is expected.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThere's more.Netflix's decline stopped near its 50-day moving average. The stock bounced off the line Tuesday and added a nice cushion since. This is Netflix's first trip to the 50-day line since its January breakout. The bounce provided a secondary entry, or did it?Volume was quiet on the rebound until Wednesday when turnover was 29% above average. Was the 29% spike in volume sufficient to create a buy area?Many investors would say yes. Why? Because Netflix's fundamentals are beautiful. Shares have continued to climb.Netflix's return on equity, a gauge of financial efficiency, was almost 18% last year — the best in six years.Annual sales jumped 32% in 2017, above the five-year growth rate of 26%. The Street expects sales to jump about 35% this year.Netflix will report Q1 results Monday after the close.The market's new uptrend could create more buy candidates for bulls to corral. Besides Netflix, are there others in the Big Cap 20?Several stocks are well-positioned for possible buys. Let's look at the chart and the fundamentals.Cloud-based tech software developer ServiceNow (NOW) is a tough read chartwise.The stock has made multiple trips to the 50-day line since a July breakout. However, if a chart reader interprets a consolidation from Oct. 23 to mid-December as a flat base, then the recent trip to the 50-day line is its first. The prudent interpretation is to treat the stock as extended.ServiceNow grew earnings 75% and 70% the past two years.Other stocks showing promise are online brokerage E-Trade Financial (ETFC), robotic surgery equipment maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS).Annual EPS growth for those three stocks was 21% to 25%, good but not all that pretty.RELATED:Millionaires Are More Common These DaysOld Advice Is True Advice: Follow The Rules In InvestingWhen To Sell A Great Stock That You Made Money On

38,ZTS,"AB Large Cap Growth (APGAX) is in an elite group of top mutual funds. It is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. That takes extraordinary consistency. For $6.3 billion Large Cap Growth and other U.S. stock mutual funds, the bogey they've beaten is the S&P 500. Across all categories, only 22% of eligible funds managed the four-time feat.More impressively, AB Large Cap Growth outperformed in all four time periods in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. How hard is it to gain entry to the winners' circle? Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.To become a top mutual fund like this, lead manager Frank Caruso, co-manager John Fogarty and senior research analyst Vinay Thapar have assembled a diversified portfolio that includes leading stocks in auto parts, health care, financials and technology such as Copart (CPRT), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Zoetis (ZTS), S&P Global (SPGI) and Nvidia (NVDA).Holding periods vary, but the stocks in the past 12 months have risen from 48% for Edwards to 49% for S&P Global, 55% for Zoetis, 63% for Copart and 116% for Nvidia.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Caruso and his team have been trimming one of those leading stocks because of a growing competitive threat. Below, Caruso describes which of those stocks he has reservations about and why.Meanwhile, overall finding stocks that persistently outperform the market depends, Caruso says, on finding ""idiosyncratic opportunities to invest.""Sixty-one-year-old Caruso and his colleagues — Fogarty, 48, and Thapar, 39 — discussed that and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from their offices in Manhattan.IBD: This portfolio is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. What does it take to outperform so consistently over periods as short as 12 months to 10 years?Frank Caruso: We focus on looking at businesses, not stocks. We are attracted to businesses with differentiated competitive positions, companies that produce higher than average levels of profitability, profitability that exceeds the fair cost of capital.Here's our secret sauce: we start by looking for good businesses, then we obsess over each company's idiosyncratic opportunities to invest and to earn high returns on capital.IBD: What exactly do you mean by 'idiosyncratic opportunities to invest'?Caruso: It is an investment opportunity that is company specific. It occurs when a company takes action that can put upward pressure on profitability. Take Nike (NKE). They've been chasing low-cost labor since the 1960s. We noticed patent filings that looked like new manufacturing technology. If they could build shoes with robotized machines, they could build plants closer to consumers, saving on tariffs, duties and shipping.IBD: The fund is fairly concentrated, with just 47 stocks as of Jan. 31. Why do you prefer a concentrated approach?Caruso: First, we think we're good at researching companies. And we want to get paid for research.Second, having around 50 names allows us to get exposure to some larger-cap companies and also seed the portfolio with sometimes younger and more exciting companies.Forty-seven is near the small end of our portfolio size range. We may have been in the low to mid sixties when we first took over this portfolio in 2012. We were still shaping the portfolio to our vision.IBD: Auto auctioneer Copart is one of your smaller names with a market cap under $12 billion. It has posted three straight quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration. What's the driver?Caruso: They're probably not the type of business in a lot of growth portfolios. They have high profitability, and they are high versus their cost of capital. Yet it's surprisingly stable. One secular trend that gives us confidence in the sustainability of their performance is that as autos become more complex, it leads to more attractive salvage rates. With more and more cars, it's too expensive to repair ones that get damaged. So Copart's supply of inventory gets bigger.IBD: You began your current stake in August. Why then?Caruso: Over a multiyear period, Copart's infrastructure did not perform efficiently to exploit new inventory when it arose due to (hurricanes). So the company invested money to upgrade its capabilities. In the August hurricane season, investors questioned whether Copart had done enough, lowering Copart's share price. We bought on that uncertainty.IBD: For the most part, you've been building your stake in Edwards Lifesciences. Why?Vinay Thapar: They pioneered development of transcatheter aortic valves. Before that, patients had to do through open-heart surgery and go on a bypass machine to have their valves repaired. Edwards got around that by engineering a product that could be inserted by snaking a catheter through an artery in the leg.It is far more minimally invasive and results in faster discharge from the hospital. The average patient cost is 10% to 15% less than the open-heart procedure. Yet the product has higher than average gross margins and operating margins. We expected an uplift in return on the company's invested capital (ROIC), and that has occurred. There's about an 18% ROIC, which is close to the upper echelon in other companies.The company forecasts the market to be about $5 billion-plus by 2021, and it's only $2.5 billion to $3 billion now. Beyond that, they're looking at using the same procedure for a different valve, the mitral valve, which would be a new market.IBD: Zoetis is another name in which you've been building your stake. What's fueling your interest?Thapar: They're the leader in pharmaceuticals for animal health. Our thesis is that after their spinout from Pfizer, they had an opportunity to improve their operating performance. They right-sized their number of SKUs (items for sale), they closed manufacturing facilities. Those improved their gross margin. And they committed to investing in higher returning R&D projects.Their single-digit top-line growth above the market growth rate, along with cost improvements, had led to higher returns. Going forward, their pipeline of products is yet to be reflected in their stock price. And they've committed to reduce their inventory balance, which will improve their return on invested capital.IBD: S&P Global is another holding whose EPS growth has accelerated. Why has that happened?Caruso: We're modeling annual revenue growth in the 6% area for the next four or five years, along with low single digit earnings growth.Their index business has been a big part of their success. And their ratings business is a best-in-class franchise. In a low-rate environment with a good level of volatility, the expectation is that if there's an increase around the world, their ratings business should benefit and maybe some parts of their index business.IBD: You've been in Nvidia a long time. Does this story have much runway left in front of it?Caruso: It's been in this portfolio since 2014. Their graphical chips have found new applications. Think AI (artificial intelligence), think hyperscale data centers, think VR (virtual reality), think auto vision.But Nvidia's GPUs are general purpose chips. And we think there are application-specific chips from early-stage companies that will become competitive for market share in the next 15 to 18 months. So we've been trimming our position.IBD: Booking Holdings (BKNG) is Priceline's new name. Why do you like that particular online travel agency?John Fogarty: They changed their name to reflect their primary assets in the online travel portfolio. Their appeal is their dominant position in Europe, where the hotel market is far more fragmented than in the U.S., where the industry is dominated by chains. Booking can take advantage of Europe's fragmentation, so they enjoy a higher commission rate as a result.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you introduce it?Fogarty: We began to buy it in the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth of PayPal is essentially riding the increased adoption of online payments and, in particular, mobile payments. We're attracted to their rising return on assets trajectory — not just their growth, but their increased profitability.IBD: Anyone want to add any comments?Caruso: John summarized our thoughts about PayPal. It's taking market share, we expect it to grow in the high teens over the next three years and it complements our Visa (V) exposure.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing trading environment.

49,ZTS,"TCW Select Equities Fund (TCGEX) is enjoying a big rebound from 2016, thanks to a steadfast focus on leading stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Mastercard (MA) and Zoetis (ZTS). Not only are they poised for future growth, they have climbed 33%, 36% and 22% respectively this year.XLast year the $909.2 million fund lagged nearly its entire large-cap growth peer group tracked by Morningstar Direct. This year's rally — the fund's 26.51% year-to-date gain going into Thursday topped 89% of its direct rivals as well as the S&P 500's 13.19% advance — fits in with the fund's long-term outperformance.The challenge last year was that the market rotated toward value-oriented stocks in materials, industrials, energy and financials, and away from the more growth-oriented stocks that fund manager Craig Blum likes. ""The 2016 struggles have pretty much unwound in 2017,"" Blum said. ""We're not hoisting any trophies. We've got the rest of the year to go. But we're proud to have delivered some upside (to our shareholders) and be on our way to recovering from 2016.""Over the past 10 years, the fund is in the top 28% of its peers. In 2015, it outran 98% of its peers.Even in 2016 when the fund fell 8.07%, the fund stuck to its knitting. ""We never changed our approach,"" Blum said. ""We stayed resolute in our focus on quality stocks and growth.""And with a portfolio of 32 names as of June 30, ""focus"" is the right way to describe the portfolio. It ranges between 25 and 35 names. It aims for companies capable of long-term price appreciation through earnings growth. The quality part of the equation? ""We want companies capable of durable, sustainable earnings growth, which have a wide moat around their businesses, that are capturing market share and have balance sheet strength,"" Blum said.The technology sector is where Blum is looking for a lot of those stocks now. He had a 40% tech weighting as of Aug. 31. ""We find a lot of disruptive forces there,"" he said. ""And we want a large opportunity. Many tech companies have large total addressable markets.""Amazon is one of those tech names. The e-commerce and cloud-services giant was still a top-10 holding as of June 30 even though Blum made small trims in recent disclosures. ""We work with long-term and short-term price targets,"" he said. Amazon is at or near its short-term target, he adds, ""but we feel quite confident in our long-term thesis.""He added, ""Amazon's spending on fulfillment center expansion and aggressive investment in Amazon Web Services (AWS) are justified."" More big enterprises are shifting data center operations to services like AWS, he says. ""In the long-term this spending will be value accretive,"" he said.He says the Whole Foods acquisition is not related to his Amazon trims. ""We are constructive on the Whole Foods acquisition over the long-term for a variety of reasons,"" he said. Among them, he calls the takeover an opportunity to speed up Amazon Prime membership sign-ups. It's also a big increase in Amazon's distribution and fulfillment capabilities.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is on IBD's Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks. One emerging Amazon strength is that it is becoming a consumer-electronics maker in its own right with the popular Echo digital assistant products.Mastercard is a relative newcomer. Blum began to buy in January. Blum calls the stock — which is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals — an attractive play on growth in e-commerce and card penetration.Blum also owns Visa (V), but likes Mastercard's outlook slightly better because it has more room to grow. Mastercard is developing technologies and advertising services that, if successful, will be new sources of revenue and earnings growth.For one, it is developing technology that could enable banks to wring more information out of the stodgy Automated Clearing House (ACH) network that banks use to manage services such as processing of payroll, direct deposits, tax payments, consumer bills and money transfers from one account to another.Zoetis is another newcomer. Blum began to buy in May. ""The growthier part of the business is the companion-animals segment,"" Blum said. ""There's a secular trend of folks spending more at veterinary clinics on their pets.""The farm-animals segment is more stable, which Blum likes. It does not fluctuate much as the broader economy speeds up and contracts because the cost of vaccines and other health products is small compared to overall costs of running a farm. Also, it's crucial for a farm to maintain the health of its livestock.Also, Blum says the company is better focused than rivals that are part of large, more diverse pharmaceutical companies. ""Those rivals aren't able to integrate marketing and research-and-development the way Zoetis is,"" Blum said. ""Their focus is a competitive advantage.""That durability of revenue and earnings is something that Blum values among several of his holdings. ""It's appropriate to maintain a balanced view,"" he said. ""It's good to combine higher beta, more aggressive growth companies with more defensive names like Zoetis.""Why? Because you never know when a recession could start. ""Since 1900, the average business cycle has lasted 47 months,"" he said. ""We're now 99 months into this one. We're cyclically bullish short-term. But our eyes are wide open midterm.""RELATED:Should You Join Lawsuits Mushrooming In Equifax Hack?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

53,ZTS,"The end-of-summer blahs and elevated geopolitical uncertainty took their toll on the stock market and stock mutual funds in August, which notched their first losses of the year.XAfter having fallen nearly 2% around mid-August, the broad stock market in the form of the S&P 500 rallied to close the month with a 0.31% gain. It was lifted by such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Visa (V) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as well as technology leader Grubhub (GRUB).Lagging, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 0.35% on average. Large-cap growth funds did best, tacking on 1.47%, while small-cap value funds did worst, losing 2.44%. ""Overall, investors generally treaded water in August,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""The good news pretty much offset the bad news. The market did not turn decisively either way.""The broad benchmark's modest gain extended the market's winning streak to 10 months. The S&P 500 edged up to an 11.93% gain year to date. U.S. diversified stock funds were left with a 9.05% year-to-date return.Mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD expect many of their opportunities for new gains to come from technology innovators and from ""quality"" companies — firms capable of churning out earnings growth even in a slow economic growth environment.Factors that heartened investors last month included a weak dollar, which boosted U.S. exports, said manager Daniel Strickberger, whose $211 million Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund (TSAGX) topped 95% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct in August. In addition, manufacturing showed strength, based on the monthly Institute of Supply Management report. Overall U.S. employment posted gains, though less than in July.""Retail sales and consumer sentiment were pretty good,"" Joy said.But negative factors included soft inflation numbers, which is a sign of tepid overall economic growth. The defeat of health care reform signaled that tax reform and infrastructure spending are uncertain, Joy said.And geopolitical tension involving North Korea contributed to investors' skittishness, Strickberger said.In addition, low inflation could help persuade the Federal Reserve to slow its interest-rate hikes. ""Interest rates are heading to where they were six to nine months ago,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 97% of its large-cap growth rivals last month. ""Over the long run, falling rates usually help utilities and hurt financials.""In contrast to U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, world stock mutual funds eked out a 0.84% gain in August. Latin American funds led that charge, rising 4.35%.Many investors sought safe havens last month. Taxable bond funds in general advanced an average of 0.51%. They were led by U.S. Treasury bond mutual funds, which gained 1.93%. Muni funds also advanced on average. And precious metals stock mutual funds topped sector fund categories, racking up a 6.10% advance.Despite August's market blahs, Ameriprise's Joy is guardedly optimistic going forward. U.S. economic growth remains muted but positive, he said. Global growth, at least in developed markets, is at its strongest since the recession. Many foreign central banks are continuing monetary policies that support stocks. And he expects large U.S. businesses to continue to benefit from a weak dollar through at least year-end.Model portfolios that Ameriprise recommends to its financial advisors' clients remain overweight in the technology sector, which in general still has room to run, Joy said. Those model portfolios' weightings in emerging markets stocks have also been boosted but are still underweight.China remains strong. Latin American economies are healing, he said.Fidelity's DuFour also sees attractive trends in the tech sector. Digital advertising, electronic payments and the growth of exchange traded funds (ETFs) ""are areas to get excited about,"" he said. He cited holdings as of July 31.A digital advertising name in which he had a stake was Adobe Systems (ADBE). Its business model has morphed. It used to sell its programs via computer disks through brick-and-mortar retailers. Customers would have to upgrade by buying new disks every few years.""They've evolved into software-as-a-service, where you pay on a monthly basis, and you've always got access to the latest version of a program,"" DuFour said.Once you create your digital product, Adobe also can monitor the online traffic it attracts and help clients manage online advertising campaigns. In addition, they have a commercial image library. That multiservice approach positions Adobe to benefit from the growth of digital media and online advertising, DuFour said.""PayPal (PYPL) is growing with the growth of electronic payments around the world,"" DuFour said. ""They have done a good job of increasing the number of places that accept PayPal, and they have a higher percentage of online transactions than physical store ones. As online commerce grows at the expense of physical stores, they are net gainers.""PayPal also owns Venmo, which is a payments service that lets users divvy up payments for shared goods or services. It is popular among millennials.S&P Global (SPGI) is poised to benefit from the growth of ETFs. The company has exited education books and ownership of Businessweek to focus on three areas in which the company provides data to clients. One of those areas consists of the indexes that customers like State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) license for the ETFs that they build and operate. ""S&P Global's business is very exciting and has very substantial margins,"" DuFour said.In other sectors, Touchstone's Strickberg cites Zoetis (ZTS) as ""the sort of quality, predictable growth company we like. We want companies that will prosper whether U.S. GDP growth is 0% or 3%,"" he said.Roughly half of sales by the developer of animal medicines and vaccines are for livestock rather than pets. Commercial agricultural sales don't fluctuate much in economic ups and downs. That steadiness makes it ""the kind of business we look for,"" Strickberger said.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX), a large-cap growth fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, edged up 0.36% last month. It owns ASML Holding (ASML), a Dutch maker of lithography systems used to create computer chips. Shares have climbed 39% this year.The stock has a very strong 98 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.IBD'S TAKE: ASML's A SMR Rating means the semiconductor equipment maker is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula. Buying stocks with high SMR ratings at proper buy points increases your chances of investment success.  RELATED:Here's An Easy Routine To Get You Started In Stock InvestingWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Some Investors Turns More Defensive Even As Market Rises Again

But volume was lackluster, ending right about the average daily turnover of 2.25 million shares. Zoetis, which makes veterinary vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and other products, has a middling EPS Rating of 83.Thinly traded Korn/Ferry International (KFY) cleared the 36.17 buy point of a base but closed below the entry.

"
66,ZTS,"Abiomed's earnings in fiscal Q4 ended March 31 totaled 28 cents a share excluding one-time items. That was up from just 9 cents in the year-earlier quarter and 14 cents above analysts' consensus, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 34% to $67.6 million, some $5 million above the Street's average estimate.

67,ZTS,"For the full fiscal 2015, sales rose 25% to $230.3 million while profit jumped 250% to 63 cents a share. Abiomed added $25 million to its fiscal 2016 sales guidance, now $285 million to $295 million. It did not issue EPS guidance but said it expects an operating profit margin in the 12%-to-16% range.
"
68,ZTS,"The beat was especially notable, given that the launch of the firm's new Impella RP heart pump was dampened by snowstorms in the Northeast during the quarter, which canceled most of the training sessions required for physicians using the Impella for risky heart procedures.

115,ZTS,"The election of a Republican president and both houses of Congress that triggered a Trump Bump in stocks — especially those that could benefit from corporate tax reform, financial industry deregulation and infrastructure spending — was nine months ago. But Karen Hiatt, lead manager of $951.8 million AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund (PGWAX), is already hedging bets based on those policy initiatives as well as the fund's usual fundamental criteria.X""That is accurate,"" Hiatt said. ""The portfolio would benefit from passing of legislative initiatives given the resulting lift to earnings growth in several holdings — but outperformance is not reliant on it.""Two areas where her fund is looking for more opportunities are the consumer discretionary and technology sectors. ""Our goal is to uncover stocks with earnings growth that exceeds the market — we are finding more interesting ideas in consumer discretionary and tech that fulfill that goal,"" she said.Individual investors and fund shareholders can benefit from insight into the fund's moves. The fund's 16.00% average annual gain over the five years going into Wednesday topped the S&P 500's 14.80% as well as 79% of the fund's large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The large-cap growth funds as a group averaged a 14.40% yearly gain.MGM Resorts International (MGM) is a consumer discretionary stock in which the fund started its current stake in February 2017 and has enlarged its position since then. A key attraction for Hiatt and co-manager Raphael Edelman is an expected surge in MGM revenue when its Cotai casino opens in Macau. That's forecast for the second half of this year.MGM has also been selling properties and leasing them back from asset manager MGM Growth Properties (MGP). That arrangement lets MGM Resorts focus on its core strengths, while retaining revenues from the properties, Hiatt says.The fund boosted its stake in Amazon.com (AMZN) in Q1 after having increased its position in Q2 and Q3 2016, then trimming in Q4.The e-commerce titan's earnings per share has slowed for four straight quarters, slumping from 992% in the first quarter of 2016 to 38% in Q1 2017. But Hiatt sees no problem. The decline in earnings stems from Amazon's investments in various businesses. ""The Amazon story is really about revenue opportunities that they create for themselves,"" she said. ""We have seen market share shift toward Amazon, away from other retailers. We've seen their success in Web Services, which is very high margin.""Those are reasons why the stock has climbed despite the EPS growth slowdown. ""Investors give them a pass on (near-term) earnings growth, knowing they have investments that are necessary for future growth,"" Hiatt said.Applied Materials (AMAT) is another name in which the fund has been building its position. EPS has grown at a triple-digit pace for three quarters in a row. The company has benefited from several trends, she says. It has benefited from the increased complexity of semiconductor manufacturing. And it benefits from its leadership role in OLED technology — organic light emitting diode technology — where demand has risen.Additional drivers are the Internet of Things, the ongoing rise of Big Data and the proliferation of smartphones and social media. ""All require more semiconductors,"" Hiatt said. ""So Applied Materials not only has earnings upside but also valuation upside that the market has not yet appreciated,"" she added.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials' average EPS growth was 139% in the past three quarters. You can check out more of Applied's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Broadcom (AVGO) is yet another stock in which the fund has built its stake. ""Broadcom fits the thesis of consolidation in the semiconductor space, but they have also diversified their exposure within semiconductors by acquiring other chipmakers,"" Hiatt said. Avago Technologies acquired Broadcom, keeping the latter's name. Another key takeover last year was of Brocade Communications Systems. Hiatt said, ""They acquire companies, divest the ones that don't fit their model, then leverage their own distribution to drive synergies with the remaining businesses.""In other sectors, animal medicine maker Zoetis (ZTS) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio, which has ramped up its stake in the stock. ""This is an animal health business that was spun off from Pfizer (in 2013),"" Hiatt said. ""It gave Zoetis the opportunity to focus on innovation. That can create value, and we believe that's happening here.""The company has a high corporate tax rate, ""so if any corporate tax (reform) comes through (Congress), that would be an added bonus,"" Hiatt said.RELATED:AllianzGI Fund's Bets On Regional Banks Are Paying OffWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Find And Track The Best Mutual Funds

116,ZTS,"Tech stocks highlighted Monday action in the stock market today as Apple (AAPL) retook a buy point and Nvidia (NVDA) hit a new high. The Dow Jones industrial average was on track for a 10th straight win.XPowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rose 0.4%, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) held gains of about 0.1%.Chips led the upside among sector funds as VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) up more than 1% apiece. Component stock and graphics chipmaker Nvidia rallied more than 2% to a new high. SOXX has formed a cup with handle with a potential buy point at 151.75.Consumer staples, biotech and retail also advanced.Oil plays slid along with West Texas intermediate crude prices, which fell 0.8% to $49.17 a barrel. VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) were down about 2% each. United States Oil Fund (USO) dipped 0.4%, while PowerShares DB Oil Fund (DBO) was flat.Energy, banks and most gold plays also lagged.Two midcap exchange traded funds are in a buy zone after a test of their 50-day moving average lines.Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO) found support after pulling back from a July 25 intraday peak. A prior bounce off the 50-day early last month yielded a 3% gain.The 13-year-old fund, which tracks the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Index, has amassed $19.9 billion in assets. The biggest sector weightings as of June 30 were consumer cyclical, at nearly 17%, technology at 16%, financial services at 15% and industrials at 13.5%, according to Morningstar Inc.Top holdings included Fiserv (FISV), Newell Brands (NWL) and Western Digital (WDC). The index is market-cap weighted, but individual stock positions tend to be no more than about 0.7%. The top five holdings accounted for less than 4% of assets.Unlike many other index providers, CRSP ranks all stocks by market cap, then builds its indexes based on set percentages. For instance, the top 70% of the market is considered mega-cap, while the next 15% makes up CRSP's midcap universe.It also minimizes turnover by allowing holdings to be shared between two indexes, so a company with a shifting market cap can be moved to the next index in stages, instead of all at once.VO has trailed the S&P 500 this year with a 10.3% gain vs. the benchmark index's 11.7% through Aug. 2. It slightly outpaces the S&P 500 over the past five years, at 14.9% to 14.6%, and for the past 10 years with an 8.3% return vs. 7.9%.Market-cap-weighted indexes usually lead to lower turnover. VO's annual turnover is 15%. Its expense ratio is an ultra-low 0.06%.IShares Russell Mid-Cap (IWR), featured in this column May 30, also found support at its 50-day line. The ETF staged a breakout June 1 and managed a small advance before pulling back below the 50-day in early July.The fund, which marked its 16th anniversary last month, has attracted $15.6 billion. It tracks the Russell MidCap Index (also market-cap weighted) and also has a low annual turnover: 11%. IWR carries a 0.20% expense ratio.Prologis (PLD), Zoetis (ZTS) and Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) were among its top five holdings, which accounted for just over 2% of total assets. IWR also lags the S&P 500 on a YTD basis with an 8.8% gain. It pulls ahead of the benchmark index for the past 10 years (8.2% to 7.9%) and the past 15 years (11.6% to 9.5%).Thursday's picks, First Trust US Equity Opportunities (FPX) and iShares Edge MSCI U.S. Quality Factor (QUAL), have found support at their respective 50-day lines.RELATED:3 Sector Gainers And Losers; 2 Equity Plays Near Buy ZoneWhich 2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Own Nvidia As Top Holding?Dow Holds Up, Oil Reverses Higher; 2 Big-Dividend Plays Near Breakout

117,ZTS,"In the wake of a weak earnings report, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) has a ""long road ahead"" as rival Mylan (MYL) prepares to launch a copycat of Teva's Copaxone drug and the U.S. generics environment worsens, an analyst said Thursday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva dove to a 17-year low with shares collapsing 19.9% to finish at 11.23, though earlier they crashed as much as 22.6%. The stock hit its lowest point this decade, touching a low it last saw in May 2000.For the quarter, Teva reported $5.61 billion in sales, up 1%, in line with the consensus. But adjusted earnings of $1 per share lagged the average view of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $1.03 and toppled 20% year over year.The biggest source of pain came from Teva's generics unit which plunged 8% to $3 billion. In the U.S., generic drug sales fell 9%. European sales increased 6% to $985 million. Sales for the remainder of the world declined 18%, while over-the-counter sales decreased 22%.President Donald Trump has said he'd like to install a competitive system to bring down drug prices. To that end, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has pledged to speed generic approvals and lower drug costs.IBD'S TAKE: Teva isn't the only drugmaker that struggled in the third quarter. Dow's Pfizer fell to a seven-week low as several drugs in its legacy medicines unit lost market exclusivity. Head to The Income Investor for more on what befell Pfizer in the quarter.Teva acknowledged the decline in the U.S. was ""mainly due to challenging market dynamics including pricing declines resulting from customer consolidation into larger buying groups and accelerated FDA approvals for generic versions of competing off-patent medicines.""Specialty medicines also declined 1% to $2 billion. In the U.S., sales fell 4% to $1.5 billion, partially offset by increases of 10% and 12% in Europe and the rest of the world, respectively. The unit brought in 36% of total sales for the quarter, Teva said in a news release.The biggest declines for Teva were from its Azilect, a Parkinson's disease drug, and Copaxone, a multiple sclerosis medication. Azilect toppled 64% to $36 million and Copaxone, Teva's largest moneymaker, plunged 7% to $987 million after the FDA approved generic versions of the drug.Respiratory drugs climbed a collective 30% to $351 million as sales of oncology drugs inched up 12% to $302 million.Teva cut forecasts, citing earlier generic competition for multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone. Teva now sees 2017 adjusted profit of $3.77-$3.87 per share vs. prior guidance of $4.30-4.50. Full-year revenue will be $22.2 billion-$22.3 billion, compared with previous guidance of $22.8 billion-$23.2 billion.Analysts had previously called for adjusted income of $4.11 on $22.69 billion in sales.For the fourth quarter, the new 2017 guidance implies sales of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion and 70-80 cents adjusted earnings per share. Both metrics lagged consensus expectations for $5.82 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $1.07 per share.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat summed up Teva's quarterly report and guidance cut in one sentence: ""This will be a long road ahead for Teva.""Animal health specialist Zoetis climbed 4.3% to close at 67.31 after topping analysts' views for sales and adjusted income in the third quarter.Zoetis wrapped the period with adjusted profit of 65 cents a share and revenue of $1.35 billion, above expectations for 63 cents on $1.325 billion, respectively. Sales grew 9% and adjusted profit rose 25% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The firm also raised full-year targets. For 2017, it sees adjusted earnings of $2.34-$2.39 per share on $5.23 billion to $5.28 billion in sales. Analysts had modeled adjusted profit of $2.34 a share on $5.21 billion in revenue.RELATED:How Blood-Disease Data Sent These 2 Biotech Stocks FlyingNeurocrine, Exelixis, Juno Stocks Rocket After Crushing ViewsMylan Topples As President Named In 'Mind-Blowing' Antitrust Scheme

118,ZTS,"Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) stock rocketed to a two-month high Wednesday after a U.S. board tossed out a key patent protecting AbbVie's (ABBV) most important drug, arthritis medication Humira, thus clearing an obstacle for a similar treatment from Coherus.Late Tuesday, the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board ruled against AbbVie in a patent review and invalidated the dosing patent for Humira in rheumatoid arthritis. This increases the chance of a launch by Coherus in 2019 of what is known as a biosimilar. Like generics, biosimilars are intended to be cheaper alternatives to patented drugs, but are produced using living material rather than chemicals.Small-cap biotech Coherus and No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) are working on copycats of AbbVie's top moneymaker. Humira is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn's disease and an arthritis that affects the spine.""This does not mean that Coherus or Amgen or anyone can launch tomorrow, but it does trigger a process that is likely to result in launch at least one year, and possibly two years, earlier than consensus expects,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.Still, Porges kept his market perform rating and 72 price target on AbbVie stock. At the close on the stock market today, Coherus was up 7.9% at a two-month high of 23.80. AbbVie stock fell 2.2% to 65.37.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 88, meaning it is outperforming nearly nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still trails Zoetis (ZTS) stock with a CR of 93 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for the latest.In 2016, Humira brought in $16.08 billion in sales, accounting for 63% of AbbVie's total revenue. Last year, the patent protecting Humira's composition of matter expired. So the patent invalidated Tuesday was seen as the main obstacle for biosimilars.Biosimilars can now use the same bi-weekly 40-milligram injection technique that AbbVie uses for Humira without infringing on AbbVie's patent. But AbbVie also has prevailed in protecting three formulation patents set to expire in 2022.""And since they were upheld, either a biosimilar needs to wait till 2022, or try to work around them,"" Raffat wrote in a note to clients. ""To our knowledge, Coherus has been very public about their intent to do so.""Meanwhile, AbbVie is also fending off a patent battle with Amgen. Amgen's biosimilar, Amjevita, was approved in September, but Amgen has said it won't launch amid litigation. A district court trial date has been scheduled for fall 2019.""Technically, just the act of going through district court and appeals court could drag into a 2021 time frame,"" Raffat said.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young says the decision was simply ""a positive for Coherus and a negative for AbbVie."" She notes that Coherus is also working on a copy of Amgen's bone-marrow stimulant, Neulasta.Young questions whether AbbVie's pipeline is robust enough to offset a decline in Humira sales. Evercore's Raffat notes that AbbVie is about ""to enter a very data-rich period for its pipeline.""RELATED:Vertex Big Winner In Biopharma Q1 As AbbVie, AstraZeneca Dip

119,ZTS,"X The major indexes rose to a mixed close Thursday, as a successful health care reform vote in Congress outweighed the negative effects from a sharp dive in oil prices.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rebounded from midsession lows to grasp fractional gains at the closing bell. The Dow Jones industrial average fought a good fight, also rising from lows to end with the thinnest of losses. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 ending down 0.2%.A 217-213 vote in the House of Representatives moved the GOP health care reform bill — the American Health Care Act — through to the Senate, moving Congress closer to its pledged repeal of the Affordable Care Act.Oil prices clearly hindered the session, with West Texas Intermediate crude dropping nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel — its lowest price since Nov. 29. Oil-related stocks posted five of the S&P 500's 10 widest losses. Oil-related industries posted four of the session's five worst losses. Caterpillar (CAT), which has a high correlation to oil prices, tumbled 2.3% to the bottom of the Dow industrials, followed closely by Chevron (CVX), down 1.8%, and Exxon Mobil's (XOM) 1.3% decline.Among the stocks pounding out big gains on earnings, Railcar America (RAIL) spiked 23%, Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) soared 18%. Fitbit (FIT) rose 12% and fiber optic communication gear maker Lumentum Holdings (LITE) notched an 11% gain.Regeneron Phamaceuticals (REGN) was the top dog among S&P 500 stocks, springing up 7% despite reporting mixed Q1 results. But robust sales of its Eyelea treatment for macular degeneration cheered investors, sending the stock to less than 5% below a 453.06 buy point in a flat base. Aggressive investors may have charted an alternative buy point at 401.31.Animal health drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS) clawed out a 6% gain after delivering first quarter results above analyst targets. The move retook a 56.60 buy point in a three-month flat base. Shares ended extended above the buy point and at a new high.Ferrari (RACE) swept ahead 7%, stretching to new highs and extending a rebound from the 10-week line in April.On the downside, Avon Products (AVP) crumbled 20% and steel producer Ryerson Holding (RYI) collapsed 15%.Facebook (FB) posted a mild 0.7% loss after reporting stronger-than-expected earnings and sales growth in the first quarter. Jefferies lifted the stock's price target to 192, from 175, following the late Wednesday report. Shares remain extended after an April rebound from the 10-week moving average.Tesla (TSLA) dropped 5%, erasing all but 3% of the stock's gain above a flat-base buy point of 287.49. It received a price upgrade, to 190 from 185, from JPMorgan, but the brokerage continues to be cautious on the stock, giving it a market weight rating.RELATED:2 Top Stocks Near Buy Zones: Investing Action PlanFitbit's Pulse Races After Q1 Beat, But There's Much Still To Prove

For those who prefer to buy when an ETF bounces off its 50-day moving average, both funds are also within striking distance from a recent rebound.XVanguard Growth (VUG) closed Monday just shy of a 129.87 flat-base buy point. It found support near the 50-day line last week and is up about 2% from the support line. Shares advanced nearly 8% from their prior touch of the 50-day line to the June 2 intraday high.The fund, which tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index, has attracted north of $27 billion in assets. Technology was for the biggest chunk of assets, at almost 28% as of June 30, followed by 18% in consumer cyclical and 15% in health care, according to Morningstar Inc. Consumer defensive and industrials made up about 9% each.The tech-heavy stance is evident in the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's class A (GOOGL) and class C (GOOG) shares. Those five names accounted for nearly one-fifth of total assets; each of the stocks have rallied more than 20% this year.VUG has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date by 17.3% to 11.1% through July 14. It's slightly outpaced the benchmark index based on three- and five-year average annual returns. For the 10-year period, the ETF returned an average annual 8.6% vs. 7% for the S&P 500. VUG carries a 0.06% expense ratio.Also closing in on a flat-base entry, at 109.85, and within 2% of its recent bounce off the 50-day line is iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth (IWP). The fund advanced nearly 5% from a late-April breakout from a flat base to the start of its current pattern.The $7.7 billion fund, which celebrated its 16th anniversary Monday, provides exposure to domestic midsize companies that are expected to grow their earnings at an above-average pace vs. the market. Top holdings as of July 13 included drugmaker Zoetis (ZTS), chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) and Illumina (ILMN), a maker of gene-sequencing systems.Technology was also the biggest sector weighting for the fund, at 23% of assets. IWP, whose 15-year average annual return of 10.8% is ahead of the S&P 500's 9% gain, has a 0.25% expense ratio.Monday's emerging markets picks were little changed: iShares Emerging Markets Dividend (DVYE) remains just below a 41.40 flat-base buy point, while SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) is still in buy range from a 30.88 flat-base entry.RELATED:For Outsize Dividends, Check Out These 2 Hot Emerging Markets PlaysLook Outside The U.S. For Top Dividend Funds So Far This YearCan The Bull Keep Running In The Second Half?

124,ZTS,"Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) immuno-oncology drug Opdivo showed promise in an early trial of 19 patients with advanced cervical cancer, the drugmaker said Friday during the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago.Of 24 women with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancers, 20.8% saw a reduction in the size of their tumors. At the median, progression-free survival was 5.5 months. The disease was controlled in nearly 71% of patients.But partial or complete responses were only seen in cervical cancer patients. Of those 19, five responded to treatment with Opdivo. Across all cancer types tested, Opdivo presented with severe or life-threatening adverse responses in 12.5% of patients.All cancers tested in the study are linked to the human papillomavirus, which is tied to 90% of cervical cancers, about 75% of vaginal cancers and 69% of vulvar cancers, Bristol said in a news release. HPV is spread through sexual contact.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol stock was up 0.8% to 54.97.IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 62, meaning it outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags drug leader Zoetis (ZTS), which has a CR of 94 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated drugmakers.""The first assessment of Opdivo's activity in women with advanced cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancers enrolled in this cohort of (the study) supports further investigation, especially because these patients have very limited options if chemotherapy or radiation fails,"" said Dr. Shinto Cheng, in a statement.Typically, patients with these types of cancer are first treated with chemotherapy alone or combined with radiation.

129,ZTS,"Pfizer (PFE) stock popped Thursday on a report the drugmaker is considering selling its consumer care business for $14 billion, less than two months after the firm opted against a long-rumored corporate breakup.Evercore analyst John Scotti expects the potential transaction to garner 7 cents earnings per share in 2018, at the midpoint of the forecast, assuming after-tax proceeds of the sale are used for share buybacks.The potential sale makes sense, Scotti wrote in a research report Thursday, as Pfizer reassesses its future. Pfizer walked away from a $160 billion merger with Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) in April, after lawmakers looked to crack down on tax-inversion deals, where U.S. companies were setting up their headquarters in lower-tax regions such as Ireland. Pfizer also had long mulled a corporate breakup, splitting up its innovative and essential health divisions, but scrapped that idea in September.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) bought Pfizer's then consumer care business in 2006. Pfizer built that unit back up with its 2009 acquisition of Wyeth. Later, Pfizer sold its nutrition business to Nestle and spun off its animal health business, Zoetis (ZTS).""Thus, the sale of the current portfolio of consumer products appears to be a logical next step that will allow Pfizer to focus on its core competency — developing and selling innovative drugs,"" Scotti wrote.IBD'S TAKE: How will Trump's presidency affect drug and biotech stocks? Get the full skinny on IBD's Industry Themes.Reuters first reported the potential customer care sale late Wednesday, citing anonymous sources. The unit pulls in $3.5 billion in sales annually. Scotti likened it to Bayer's $14.2 billion acquisition of Merck's (MRK) consumer care business, a $2 billion annual unit.On the stock market today, Pfizer stock climbed 4.3% to 33.49, above its 50-day line, ramping for a second consecutive day following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. Shares rose 7.1% on Wednesday.Drug and biotech stocks have rebounded on Trump's election. Trump is seen as less likely to challenge drug prices vs. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who unveiled a plan last year to cut the spiraling price tags on drugs.Trump, though, has promised to tackle the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), which investment bank RBC said Tuesday could cause a dip in biotech stocks on the uncertainty of new, not-yet-outlined national health care.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth graph to show Zoetis was a spinoff.RELATED:Pfizer Will Likely Overpay For M&A Post Allergan Breakup-Flop: JeffriesUnexpected Twist: Pfizer Scraps Breakup Following Dead Allergan Merger

130,ZTS,"Eli Lilly (LLY) aims to take another bite out of the animal-health market, buying a unit of Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim, which itself is acquiring Sanofi's (SNY) animal-health business.Zoetis (ZTS), spun out of Pfizer (PFE) in 2013, is the No. 1 animal-health company, but Boehringer likely will become No. 2, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in an email to clients Wednesday, and Lilly's Elanco unit will get bigger.Lilly stock rose a fraction in the stock market today, while Zoetis stock fell a fraction, to 52.18. Zoetis stock has been forming a flat base, with a possible buy point of 52.71.Lilly agreed to pay $885 million for Boehringer's Vermedica unit, which includes common vaccines for dogs, cats and other animals, as well as an Iowa manufacturing site. These include common vaccines for bordetella, parvovirus and rabies. Zoetis sells rabies, and other, vaccines for cats and dogs.Scotti said he spoke with Lilly representatives, who said the Boehringer vaccine portfolio, with the deal expected to close early next year, would generate about $200 million in annual revenue, about 5% of Elanco's total sales. Elanco accounted for 16% of Lilly's 2015 revenue. Lilly bought the animal-health division of Novartis (NVS) in early 2015.Scotti said Lilly indicated it will maintain its operating profit margin target of high 20s-30% by 2020, up from about 19% last year. He says Zoetis has targeted about 34% for its operating margin by 2020, where it's currently above 30%.""Coupled with our robust food animal portfolio, this addition further strengthens Elanco's position in the global animal health business,"" Lilly CEO John Lechleiter said in the company's press release.Boehringer said in June it would sell the Vermedica unit, as antitrust regulators reviewed its acquisition of Sanofi's animal-health business.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly and Zoetis are in IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs group, which ranks just No. 137 out of 197 groups tracked. Still, within the group, Zoetis ties Depomed with the highest Composite Rating, at 83. CR is a broad measure of performance, looking at key metrics such as earnings and sales growth. Above 80 is good, but in general you should target companies with CR ratings in the 90s.RELATED:Zoetis Among Companies On Radar Of The Janus Forty Fund ManagersLilly Upgraded On Potential For Alzheimer's Drug

162,ZTS,"Shire (SHPG) stock launched to a six-month high Thursday, leading the drug industry, after unveiling strong Phase 3 results for a drug to treat a rare condition that causes swelling under the skin.Intraday on the stock market today, Shire stock was up 4.3% to close at 190 after earlier rising as much as 5.5%, touching a high last achieved in November. IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, though, sank a collective 0.3%.The trial, dubbed Help, tested Shire's drug lanadelumab in patients with hereditary angioedema, a genetic condition that affects one in 10,000 to one in 50,000. Symptoms include episodes of swelling in the face, extremities, gastrointestinal tract and upper airway.Lanadelumab proved clinically meaningful and met all its goals in the trial, Shire said. At the 300-milligram dose administered every two weeks, angioedema attacks decreased by 87% on average vs. a placebo.At each dosage, a higher proportion of patients vs. the placebo were attack-free for the entire 26-week study period. Of those studied, 52% experienced three or more attack each month at their baselines, 65% had a history of laryngeal attacks and 56% were on long-term treatment.Nine in 10 patients completed the 26-week study. Of those, 96% chose to continue in a longer-term safety study.IBD'S TAKE: Shire stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, meaning it outperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags Zoetis (ZTS), which leads the group with a CR of 93. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the best-rated stocks.RBC analyst Douglas Miehm noted Wall Street was broadly expecting strong results from the Help study, but ""there was a risk that data would not match those generated in the Phase 1 trials and as such we expect the shares to see 3%-4% upside in response to the news.""Overall, this removes an overhang on Shire stock, Miehm wrote in a note to clients. He kept his outperform rating on Shire stock.Shire plans to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration by late 2017 or early 2018.

164,ZTS,"If you've ever searched the thousands of stocks that trade and wondered if it was just you who had trouble finding good stocks to buy, have no fear. You are not alone.The money managers at Janus Forty (JDCAX), which has chalked up some of the best performance gains over multiple time periods among U.S. mutual funds, limit their holdings to 40 stocks for a reason.""We don't think there are that many great ideas at any point in time,"" said lead manager Douglas Rao.Compared with mutual funds that own 100 or more stocks, Janus Forty also can get to know the companies it owns better, he says.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersTalking about the reasons he likes gaming company Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Rao said: ""We like to invest with owner-operators or managers who act that way. They think long-term. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick is one of those guys. He and his management team bought close to 25% of the company.""Janus Forty is an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31. Only 9% of U.S. diversified stock funds met that standard.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceTop-performing holdings this year include Boston Scientific (BSX), up 32%,  Facebook (FB) up 24%, Time Warner (WTX) up 23% and Amazon (AMZN) up 17%. The fund has lightened its positions in Boston and Facebook in its latest reporting period, held steady in Time Warner and increased Amazon. General Electric (GE), the top holding at about 5.25% of assets, is about flat for the year and yielding 3%.This hasn't been Janus Forty's best year. The $2.2 billion fund was up 3.02% for the year through Aug. 31 vs. 7.82% for the S&P 500. But it has an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning that its share-price performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Rao, 42, has been on board since 2013. Nick Schommer, 38, became co-manager this year. The helmsmen talked with IBD about their approach and the current investing climate from their offices in Denver.IBD: The fund is concentrated. Why do you focus on just your 40 best ideas?Rao: We don't think there are that many great ideas at any point in time. I take my cue from Warren Buffett, who called diversification ""di-worsification."" He said you should know your ideas one to 10 better than ideas 70 through 80. And ideas one through 10 should have more conviction.For us, 40 is a naturally comfortable level in terms of having the ability to know the companies we invest in.IBD: Does concentration entail a greater risk of volatility?Schommer: I wouldn't say it that strongly. We help to manage volatility by holding different buckets of growth stocks.IBD: How do stocks in each bucket differ?Schommer: Seventy percent to 80% of our portfolio is in compound growth companies. Those are companies with well-defined competitive moats, which have years of growth ahead of them, high earnings visibility and lower risk. They trade at a slight premium to the market but have much better growth.Ten percent to 15% is in blue-sky companies. Those are growth companies that have less well-defined competitive moats than compound-growth stocks. But we expect blue-sky companies to solidify their moats and graduate into compound-growth companies. They have big opportunities. But we make their positions small to manage risk.The third bucket holds special situation stocks. These are future compound growth stocks. Meanwhile, there is a business issue or a financial leverage issue that the company has to execute against. For example, GE over the past year has been divesting its GE Capital business. It hasn't been very attractive, but GE has been reinvesting in its (remaining industrial, nonfinancial) business and returning capital to shareholders. One of the keys to the success of blue-sky and special-situation companies is that they have to graduate into being compound growth companies. That's what we want with GE.IBD: What other key traits do stocks in each bucket share?Rao: We start with the same filter: Does the company have a competitive advantage? Do we believe it is sustainable? Whichever bucket a stock is in, we look at that the same way.IBD: What percent of blue-sky and special-situation companies do graduate?Rao: I'd guess about 65%. Maybe 75%.IBD: The fund was in the top 2% of its Morningstar large-cap growth category in 2015. This year it's more middle of the pack. Why has this year been more challenging?Schommer: In general, the market this year rewarded lower volatility sectors, areas without a lot of growth, sectors where naturally we tend to (take a pass on investing). The sectors that were rewarded this year were consumer staples, utilities and energy. Those tend to be sectors that are not large positions in the portfolio.Those companies may meet our business-model hurdle, but not a lot of them meet our growth hurdle. And now, particularly, they are not attractive from a valuation perspective.The market has treated them as income substitutes and given them premium valuations due to low yields in fixed income. We have instead focused on investments like Zoetis (ZTS), an animal health care company that has characteristics similar to a consumer staples company but with better growth prospects and a more reasonable starting valuation.Energy is another area that has been a good performer this year after a difficult 2015. There are a limited number of energy companies that meet our business model criteria. Most are price-takers tied to the commodity price.IBD: You've slightly trimmed your stake in Facebook. What are your concerns?Rao: It's hard to talk about it without talking about Google (GOOGL) (Alphabet). Both have become dominant platforms for advertising dollars shifting from traditional channels to digital.The reason Facebook has been so effective in monetizing these digital advertising dollars is that they have high consumer usage of their properties. (Chief Operating Officer Sheryl) Sandberg and her team, under the leadership of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have done a good job of pivoting the company away from being desktop-computer-based to being one of the dominant app providers on a global basis outside China.With WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook itself, the consumer is engaged with it to such an extent that advertising dollars move there.IBD: Which bucket is Boston Scientific in?Rao: It's in compound-growth. We bought it maybe two years ago. It started as a special situation. It had a fairly significant legal overhang with Johnson & Johnson suing them for $5 billion or $6 billion.We thought the case was questionable. They brought in a new CEO named Mike Mahoney, who had been at Johnson & Johnson. He came in to reinvigorate their cardiology franchise, which had missed a product cycle. He felt there was a pipeline there that needed to be pushed toward commercialization. The market was concerned with the litigation and factoring little growth for their cardiology products.Soon, they settled the Johnson & Johnson suit for about $1 billion. They've accelerated revenue growth and their margin growth, which had been half their competitors'. They've closed the gap. Execution has been fantastic. We expect more.IBD: Why is Activision Blizzard another position you've increased?Rao: This was another special situation. They bought King Digital, which had the popular Candy Crush game. But the market soured on King after it went public.CEO Bobby Kotick has made a number of strategic pivots. The King acquisition got them into mobile. They've gone from being a company serving 60 million to 70 million consumers through desktops and consoles to serving 500 million consumers... Another 1 billion-plus people watch those games played.Also, they've transitioned more to digital downloads than (dependence on customers) buying a console. That removes the middle man, so Activision's margins become higher.But it's still a special situation because mobile users from the King acquisition have been shrinking. We would like top see them re-engage those consumers.IBD: Amazon (AMZN) has gone up and down in size in the portfolio. Why is that?Rao: We had reduced exposure at the end of last year. They had a disappointing Q4 announcement in January, and the stock got punished. We added back after it sank dramatically.Amazon is the dominant player in e-commerce, and e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales continues to increase. And as Amazon continues to deliver faster fulfillment times, it will gain market share.Another leg of the stool is Amazon Web Services. This gets us to the idea of investing with owner-operators. In 2014, many people saw AWS as a money pit. Fast forward to today, most analysts see its worth as over $100 billion. Microsoft is doing a nice job in web services, but AWS is the dominant provider. Everyone from the CIA to GE is moving more of their business onto AWS. You don't have to have an electricity plant at your house. So why do you need your own data center?IBD: Celgene (CELG) is yet another company in which you've built your stake. What's your thesis?Rao: We reduced our position in the middle of last year. Then this year it went down about 35% from its high in mid-2015. Our analysts felt confident that it was trading at a big discount to our view of its intrinsic value.IBD: Did you trim your Priceline (PCLN) stake because slow global growth means less travel?Rao: This is another business that benefits from network effects. Their core business is Booking.com, which is hotel booking for Europe. They have a similar business in Asia called Agoda. We reduced it given its exposure to Europe and terrorist attacks and higher levels of management turnover than we were comfortable with.IBD: You've also trimmed NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). What are your concerns?Schommer: It's in special situations because it was the merger of two leading semiconductor companies, Freescale and NXP. They are the No. 1 or 2 in their end markets, which gives them a disproportionate share of profits in those lines. And they can invest more in R&D than competitors.But after the merger, the financial leverage of the business increased to a level that was above normalized operating levels. So part of why it is a special situation is that we're watching for reducing the balance sheet to a more comfortable level.IBD: Adobe (ADBE) is another trim. What's your thesis?Rao: They were one of the first to transition from selling software in shrink-wrap to a subscription model. The transition was to a much larger market. But in the transition, revenues and margins declined.We trimmed because the company has largely made the transition to a subscription business and the market is now rewarding them for this higher quality revenue.RELATED:This Top Fund Manager Likes Three Types Of Growth StocksWhat To Do When Your Fund Gets A New ManagerMutual Fund Awards 2016: Top U.S. Equities Funds

165,ZTS,"Shares of animal-health giant Zoetis (ZTS) rose to a 13-month high in early trading Wednesday after the company beat Q2 estimates and modestly raised its guidance.Earnings grew 14% over the year-earlier quarter and beat analysts' consensus by 11%, while sales rose 3% and topped estimates by 3%. Zoetis' U.S. pet-care business did especially well, with 17% growth, helped by the canine itching treatment Apoquel, as well as the newly approved oral flea killer Simparica. International growth was more modest, partly as a result of the company's planned cutbacks for operating efficiency.""Livestock revenues were also strong and the U.S. cattle business started recovering after a relatively weak performance in Q1, which was due to a mild winter and lower demand for Zoetis products in that segment,"" noted Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email.The company added $25 million to its full-year sales guidance, now $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. It also added 3 cents a share to its EPS range, now $1.86 to $1.93. That would mean just 7% earnings growth this year, a slowdown from previous years, but the company has guided a rebound in 2017, and that outlook remains unchanged.Zoetis shares rose 3% to 51.21 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Zoetis' move Wednesday brought it to a 52-week high, a bullish sign that IBD tracks with the New Highs list. That would preferably be accompanied by a high Relative Price Strength Rating, but Zoetis has a modest RS of 63.

166,ZTS,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) were rising Monday as the company continued to fill out its new management lineup by appointing a new chief financial officer.Valeant nabbed Paul Herendeen from animal-health company Zoetis (ZTS), where he has been executive vice president for the last two years. He also was CFO for a number of years at Warner Chilcott before its 2013 buyout by the company that eventually became Allergan (AGN). Valeant's current CFO, Robert Rosiello, will become head of corporate development and strategy.The role of CFO is crucial because of Valeant's recent accounting scandal, which resulted in the company restating the last couple years of earnings. Rosiello wasn't implicated because the trouble really happened before his June 2015 appointment, under the previous CFO Howard Schiller, who took most of the heat when Valeant's auditing committee produced its report in March. At the same time, CEO J. Michael Pearson quit.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant became the poster child for a drugmaker relying on price increases to goose revenue. Learn how much other big-cap drugmakers are relying on price vs. demand.RBC Capital Markets analyst Douglas Miehm wrote that the change is probably due to matching the talent with the job.""We view the new role for Mr. Rosiello favorably, as he worked for McKinsey for over 30 years and has advised companies in the health care, consumer-product and technology sectors on M&A ventures and operational strategic initiatives,"" Miehm wrote in a research note.Valeant stock rose 8.8% to 31.27 in the stock market today, above 31 for just the second day in the past three months-plus.The rise might also have been fueled by a wider bounce in drug stocks viewed as buyout targets in light of Pfizer's (PFE) $14 billion buyout of Medivation (MDVN). In Valeant's Q2 earnings call, CEO Joseph Papa said he was prepared to sell off about $8 billion worth of assets, and some on Wall Street have wondered if a buyer might acquire the entire company now that it's down 87% from its 52-week high.RELATED:

167,ZTS,"Drug stocks popped a collective 1.4% midday Thursday after the GOP health care bill to repeal and replace major portions of ObamaCare narrowly passed in the House.Following the vote, IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group rose to a one-month high. Generic drug and biotech stocks, on the other hand, advanced just 0.5% apiece.Zoetis (ZTS) stock lifted 6.3%, but that followed a consensus-crushing first quarter earlier in the day. Also up, Endo International (ENDP) stock rose 3.5%, Mallinckrodt (MNK) stock popped 2.3% and Eli Lilly (LLY) stock was up 2.1%.Analysts had said uncertainty regarding President Trump's health care ambitions would weigh on the biotech and pharma market this year. In April, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges told Investor's Business Daily it doesn't seem as if ""the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are now rated No. 19 out of 197 groups tracked.

168,ZTS,"Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock popped Tuesday after AstraZeneca (AZN) said its type 2 diabetes drug didn't reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in a trial, leaving Eli Lilly (LLY) to break the tie in 2019.On the stock market today, Novo Nordisk fell 2 cents to 41.48, while AstraZeneca was up 0.4% to 34.08. Shares of Lilly, a diabetes rival, were up 1.3% to 77.99.AstraZeneca's drug Bydureon met its goal in a Phase 3 study. It did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke, in patients with type 2 diabetes — meeting a Food and Drug Administration requirement.But it also didn't reduce the risk, as Novo Nordisk's Victoza and semaglutide did in earlier studies. Victoza cut the risk of cardiovascular events by 13%. Semaglutide trimmed the risk by 26%, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.These drugs could also have a cardiovascular benefit, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients. So far, AstraZeneca's Bydureon and Sanofi's (SNY) Adlyxin failed to cut the risk of cardiovascular events, but Novo Nordisk's two drugs have.IBD'S TAKE: AstraZeneca has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it has outperformed eight in 10 stocks in key growth metrics over the past 12 months. But it still lags leader Zoetis (ZTS), which has a CR of 92 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated drugmakers.Lilly will provide the tiebreaker in 2019 when it unveils the results of a trial of diabetes drug Trulicity. Like drugs from AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, Trulicity belongs to a class of drugs that increase insulin secretion while inhibiting glucose release at certain levels.Fernandez forecasts the entire class of drugs growing to $9 billion in worldwide sales by 2021, up from $5 billion in 2016.In the meantime, Novo's drugs will maintain their leadership position in the class, dubbed GLP-1 receptor agonists, Fernandez said. The class is underused in diabetes treatment, though a positive heart effect in AstraZeneca's trial could have boosted their prominence.Though ""Lilly's Trulicity (is) gaining share in the GLP-1 class,"" he said, ""Novo counts on (the) once-weekly semaglutide launch to stem the tide.""Novo could also benefit from an update to the label on Victoza, reflecting the drug's ability to curb the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes patients.RELATED:Conference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer TreatmentLilly Could Grab Diabetes Share From Dow's J&J On Amputation WoesDow's Pfizer, Eli Lilly Topple To 3-Month Lows On Downgrades

268,ZTS,"The report's figures only account for deals with disclosed values.Venture-backed startups turned into IPOs at a slower rate in Q1, and into acquisitions at the slowest pace since 1995, data released on Monday show.A new report from the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters says growth is expected later this year and notes that seven of eight new IPOs trade above their offering price.Most IPOs the report cited were in information technology and the rest were in biotech and medical fields. The largest was ModelN (MODN), a maker of revenue management software for life sciences and tech industries, which raised $120 million.In Q1, there were just eight U.S. initial public offerings of venture-backed startups, raising $672 million. That's 52% less than the same number of IPOs raised in the fourth quarter, the NVCA and Thomson Reuters said Monday.First-quarter IPOs that IBD has written about include 3D printer maker ExOne Co. (XONE), Internet money transfer firm Xoom (XOOM), electric utility smart-grid network enabler Silver Spring Networks (SSNI), ad management firm Marin Software (MRIN), Pfizer's (PFE) animal-health spinoff Zoetis (ZTS) and molecular technology biotech Entanta Pharmaceuticals. Of those, ExOne is up the most since its debut, 25%. All the others are flat or have fallen except Zoetis, which is up 5%.The NVCA/Thomson Reuters figures were down from 19 IPOs in Q1 2012, and off 60% in total dollar terms. The average raised per IPO fell to $84 million from $88.6 million.""First-quarter IPO and acquisitions activity is often subdued as year-end reporting and forward planning take priority, but this year political, taxation and sequestration concerns weighed even more heavily on the exit market for emerging growth companies,"" John Taylor, the research chief for the NVCA, said in Monday's report.But he noted that public market valuations have been up lately, and said ""quality companies tell us they are starting the process toward an exit later in the year.""He sees stronger volume likely in the second and third quarter but says the quality of companies going public or getting acquired in 2013 ""will have to be solid"" in this environment.There are 25 venture-backed companies in the pipeline that have filed for an IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the NVCA says. But the Jobs Act that went into effect in April enables confidential registrations, and the NVCA says many observers say most VC-backed startups take this IPO path.The report noted 77 venture-backed M&A deals in Q1, 10 of which had aggregate value of $984.3 million. The largest mergers and acquisitions transaction it counted was Illumina's (ILMN) $350 purchase of Verinata Health. Second was Medicines Co.'s (MDCO) $185 million acquisition of Incline Therapeutics.The report's figures only account for deals with disclosed values.

283,ZTS,"Florham Park, NJ-based Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) is one of the leading global animal health companies focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of animal health medicines and vaccines, with a focus on both livestock and companion animals. The company came into existence following Pfizer’s decision to spin off its animal health business in 2013.Zoetis’ diversified portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals should continue to drive top-line growth at the company. The company’s top line should continue to benefit from the addition of products acquired from Abbott Laboratories (February 2015), Pharmaq (November 2015), Nexvet (July 2017) as well as from the performance of Apoquel and other key brands. In this scenario, investor focus remains on top-and bottom-line numbers.Zoetis’ track record has been impressive with the company beating earnings estimates consistently. In fact, Zoetis’ earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.54%.Currently, Zoetis has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below:Earnings Beat: Zoetis reported earnings per share of 75 cents beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents in first-quarter of 2018.Revenues Beat: Zoetis posted revenues of $1.37 billion slightly surpassing the Zacks consensus estimate of $1.33 billion.Key Stats:  During the first quarter, Zoetis received approval for swine vaccine, Fostera, in the United States. The company continued to expand the availability of companion animal products – Cytopoint received approval in Mexico & Switzerland and Simparica was approved in Thailand & Serbia. Several major cattle products, including Inforce 3 and Spectramast DC, also received approvals in new geographies.2018 Outlook Reiterated: Zoetis maintained its outlook for 2018. In 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $2.96 to $3.10 per share on revenues of $5.675 billion and $5.800 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $3.04 per share on revenues of $5.75 billion.Share Price Impact: Shares of the company were up 0.1% in-pre-market trading.Check back later for our full write up on this ZTS earnings report later!Zoetis Inc.

284,ZTS,"Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the opening bell.Zoetis’ performance has been encouraging, with the company surpassing expectations in each of the previous four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 4.54%.Zoetis’ share price movement shows that the stock has outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has moved up 17.8% against the industry’s decline of 2.1% during this period.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company continues to strengthen its diverse products portfolio through lifecycle innovations, strong customer relationships and access to new markets and technologies.The company reported impressive results through 2017, mainly driven by strong demand for its companion animal business. Zoetis’ dermatology drugs – Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica – have performed well due to increased penetration and continued uptake. We expect the trend to positively impact first-quarter results.Moreover, the company is working on expanding the reach of Simparica. It received approvals in several countries and for new indications in the fourth quarter of 2017. These will further boost the sales. In December 2017, the company announced the launch of Vanguard CIV H3N2/H3N8, the latest vaccine in the company’s canine influenza virus (“CIV”) portfolio.In the fourth quarter of 2017, livestock sales were driven by sales of cattle and poultry products. However, favorable weather drove incidence of disease risk higher in cattle.We expect the company to throw more light on its acquisition strategy and its impact on its pipeline, following the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals, in July 2017.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Zoetis in the to-be reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of 69 cents) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of 70 cents), is -0.72%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zoetis currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Zoetis Inc.

QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release.Emergent Biosolutions Inc.

Livestock sales were up 14% on a reported basis (up 11% operationally) in the quarter mainly driven by balanced growth across the portfolio.

287,ZTS,"The pharma and biotech stocks kicked off 2018 on a strong note, carrying on the momentum gained last year. Though the sector has been struggling lately, probably on broader market pressure, it is expected to rebound as the year progresses.Innovation, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), strong results, product approvals and positive data flow should act as catalysts for pharma and biotech stocks.M&As to Accelerate Last year was not particularly great as far as M&A deals were concerned. Industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson acquired Actelion for approximately $30 billion, while Gilead acquired Kite for $11.9 billion. However, this year, expectations of an increase in M&A activity are high. The new tax law, which cuts the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is expected to spur merger activity. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and Celgene CELG have already announced two deals each so far this year.Sanofi announced deals to buy Belgian biotech company Ablynx and hemophilia-focused biotech Bioverativ BIVV. Celgene announced deals to buy Juno Therapeutics, Inc. JUNO, which focuses on the development of CAR-T therapies, and Impact Biomedicines, which will add a late-stage JAK2 kinase inhibitor, to Celgene’s pipeline.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has proposed to buy Australian oncolytic immunotherapies maker Viralytics Ltd. to strengthen its presence in the fast-growing immuno-oncology market. While some of these companies are looking to replace sales of blockbuster products that are facing loss of patent exclusivity, others are looking to build their pipelines both through acquisitions as well as licensing agreements.Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines are highly sought after. Niche disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), immuno-oncology and multiple sclerosis are in demand. Treatments for orphan diseases are also much sought after, with quite a few deals being signed in these areas. With the Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) -- Kite and Celgene -- Juno acquisitions and the approval of the two CAR-T therapies in the United States last year – Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead’s Yescarta -- interest in immuno-oncology has picked up significantly.Innovative PipelinesPharma and biotech companies continue to work on bringing innovative treatments to market. There could be significant catalysts in the coming quarters in the form of important new product approvals as well as major data read-outs, especially in key therapeutic areas like immuno-oncology, Alzheimer’s, central nervous system disorders and immunology/inflammation.Cancer Remains a Key Therapeutic AreaAlthough several new treatments have emerged in the field of cancer, interest in this area remains high with the disease being one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality across the world. Even though a lot of progress has been made in this area, companies are aiming to bring out newer and better treatments. Focus in this area has increased with the recent FDA approval of CAR-T therapies Kymriah and Yescarta.The approval of Kymriah and Yescarta marks the beginning of a new era in the treatment of cancer. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T-cells to fight cancer. The acquisition of Kite by Gilead and the potential acquisition of Juno by Celgene have led to renewed interest in this area.Major players in this field include Bristol-Myers, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Merck and Roche.Immuno-oncology deals are being inked by companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Celgene, Merck KGaA, Bristol-Myers BMY, AstraZeneca AZN, AbbVie ABBV and Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report). Interest in PARP inhibitors has also increased considerably as they could well be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology.According to IMSQuintiles, 68 new cancer drugs were approved for 22 indications from 2011 to 2016. Worldwide costs for cancer therapeutics and supportive care drugs shot up from $91 billion in 2012 to $113 billion in 2016 with the United States accounting for 46% of the costs. More than 600 molecules are in late-stage development, with the majority being targeted therapy.New Product Sales Should Ramp UpSales of products that have gained approval over the last two years, as well as line and usage extensions, should boost growth. Recent entrants like Novartis’ psoriasis treatment Cosentyx, Merck’s PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda and Pfizer’s cancer treatment Ibrance have already achieved blockbuster status and are key contributors to the top line. Meanwhile, cancer treatments like Lynparza, Kyprolis, Keytruda, Opdivo and Imbruvica should also bring in more sales thanks to label expansions.Higher Number of Drugs Approved in 2017In 2017, the FDA granted approval to 46 novel drugs, more than double of last year’s total tally of 22. Key approvals this year include, Novartis’s Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, TESARO’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease), AbbVie’s Mavyret (HCV) and Gilead’s Yescarta among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.Some of the key drugs currently under FDA review with decisions expected in a couple of months include Teva’s fremanezumab (migraine), Amgen’s Aimovig (prevention of migraine), J&J’s apalutamide (pre-metastatic prostate cancer) and AbbVie’s elagolix (endometriosis with associated pain). Meanwhile, the agency is working on streamlining the development process for drugs for rare diseases as well as targeted cancer therapies. Earlier this month, the FDA proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of treatments being developed for neurological disorders such as muscular dystrophies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), migraine and epilepsy that aren’t adequately addressed by available therapies. The FDA is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications.According to the IMSQuintiles report, the late-phase R&D pipeline for the industry indicates that there should be about 40-45 new brand launches every year through 2021.Tech Tie-Ups to Pick Up PaceThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) could well be the future of healthcare as pharma companies look to innovate and keep up with technology to help patients and physicians better monitor and track diseases.IoMT involves the bringing together of technology and medical devices and applications. Chronic diseases, which require frequent monitoring, can be tracked effectively so that patients receive timely and proper treatment. Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Fitbit and Samsung S Health help users achieve their fitness and health targets.Pharma and tech companies are now taking things a step further and collaborating to make devices that can track chronic and lifestyle associated diseases like diabetes, which are becoming rampant.In fact, the scope for innovation in this area -- contact lenses that can detect glucose levels, devices that monitor caloric intake, bioelectronic medicines that may treat a wide range of chronic diseases, robotic-assisted surgery – is seemingly endless.Stock PicksAlthough the sector may face some volatility due to the drug pricing issue, pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas, cost-cutting, share buybacks, new products, increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should help maintain investor confidence in this sector.Companies like Pfizer, AbbVie, Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report), Zoetis, Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report), Bioverativ, Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. AMPH, Horizon Pharma Public Ltd. Co. (HZNP  -  Free Report), Summit Therapeutics plc (SMMT  -  Free Report), Gemphire Therapeutics Inc. (GEMP  -  Free Report) etc. are all Buy-ranked stocks. While Regeneron and Bioverativ are Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, others carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.ConclusionAll said and done, the pharma sector’s fundamentals remain strong -- robust pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, growing demand for drugs (especially for rare diseases), an aging population and increased health care spending should support growth.

Is there any chance for a rebound for this drug maker?Q4 Earnings: A Deep DiveLast week, Endo reported results for its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter.Earnings from continuing operations were 77 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus but declining significantly from the $1.77 reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues came in at $769 million, also topping our consensus estimate but falling 38% year-over-year thanks to the loss of marketing exclusivity in the first half of 2017 for its first-to-file products: the generic version of Zetia and the generic version of Seroquel XR, both of which were launched in Q4 2016.Looking at Endo’s three main segments, U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals sales were down 21% to $228 million, while U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals recorded sales of $499 million in the quarter, down 43%.Its International Pharmaceuticals division brought in sales of $41 million, down from $70 million in the year-ago quarter due to recent divestitures.The Outlook AheadManagement expects revenues between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion, with earnings in the range of $2.15 and $2.55 per share, both metrics well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.06 billion and $2.86 per share, respectively.As a result, analysts have been cutting their estimates for 2018.For the current quarter, four analysts cut their outlook in the last 30 days, and earnings are expected to decline over 55% for this time period.11 analysts have revised their estimates downward for the current fiscal year, with earnings estimates projected to fall about 38.5% in that time frame.Looking at the next fiscal year, eight analysts have slashed their outlook in the last month, but earnings could grow about 4%. The current consensus has dipped from $3.08 to $2.46 per share.What’s Next for Endo?Shares of Endo are down about 6.7% so far this year, and have sunk well over 36% in the past one year. In comparison, its broader industry, Medical-Drugs, has managed to gain 1.31% and 1.64%, respectively.Endo International PLC Price and Consensus Endo International PLC Price and Consensus | Endo International PLC QuoteThe company is currently trading at a forward P/E of 3.08.Last year was rocky for Endo. The company quickly became a big litigation target for U.S. states in 2017, and is currently being sued by Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Mississippi for fraudulent marketing regarding their opioid drug Opana ER.With these lawsuits still open, there’s no clear picture for investors on what may be the outcome, and Endo could face damaging consequences.Additionally, both its Branded and Generic businesses have faced intense pressure thanks to new competitors and changing market conditions.For investors wanting a drug maker stock with more near-term potential, they should consider Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report), a company that develops and manufactures veterinary vaccines and medicines. It’s a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank right now, and anticipates 25% earnings growth for the current year.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

The company came into existence following Pfizer’s decision to spin off its animal health business in 2013.Zoetis’ diversified portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals should continue to drive top-line growth at the company. The company’s top line should benefit from the addition of products acquired from Abbott Laboratories (February 2015), Pharma (November 2015), Nexvet (July 2017) as well as from the performance of Apoquel and other key brands. In this scenario, investor focus remains on top-and bottom-line numbers.Zoetis’ track record has been impressive with the company beating earnings estimates consistently.

291,ZTS,"Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15 before the market opens.Zoetis’ performance over the last four quarters has been mixed, with the company surpassing expectations thrice and meeting the same once. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 4.51%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zoetis’ share price movement year to date shows that the stock has outperformed the industry. The stock has moved up 27.8% as against the industry’s decline of 2.1% during this period. Factors to ConsiderZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company continues to strengthen its diverse products portfolio through lifecycle innovations, strong customer relationships and access to new markets and technologies.The company’s companion animal business has been performing well. Apoquel and other product launches continue to drive growth. The company expects to see stronger growth from its companion animal portfolio in 2017 driven by its dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica, and ongoing uptake of new vaccines. In December 2017, the company announced the launch of Vanguard CIV H3N2/H3N8, the latest vaccine in the company’s canine influenza virus (CIV) portfolio.Concurrent with the third-quarter earnings call, Zoetis raised its 2017 outlook. The company expects earnings in the range of $2.34-$2.39 per share and revenues of $5.225-$5.275 billion. The improved outlook also hints at the possibility of better results in the fourth quarter.Zoetis completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals, in July, 2017. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Zoetis’ pipeline of solutions for chronic pain management in dogs and cats, which represents an area of high-need in companion animal health.We expect management to throw more light on its acquisition strategy.Zoetis is working on returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. The company also hiked its dividend by 20% in December 2017 which will be payable in March 2018.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Zoetis this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP is -0.82%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zoetis currently has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Zoetis Inc.

292,ZTS,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced that it has completed the divestment of its global women’s health business to privately-held private equity firm, CVC Capital Partners. The deal was closed for $703 million in cash.The divested portfolio includes products across contraception, fertility, menopause and osteoporosis categories. The drugs in the portfolio include Ovaleap, Zoely, Seasonique, Colpotrophine and Actonel, which are sold outside the United States. These products will now be sold by Theramex, a women’s health unit previously held by Teva.The sale is part of Teva’s planned divestment of specialty products in women’s health.We remind investors that Teva had signed a definitive agreement for this sale with CVC Capital Partners in September 2017. Moreover, the company also signed another definitive agreement with Foundation Consumer Healthcare for the sale of its Plan B One-Step and brands of emergency contraception.CVC Capital Partners has appointed Anish Mehta, former head of International Business Development at Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), as Theramex’s chief executive officer.In a separate SEC filing, Teva reported that it has entered into a settlement agreement with Allergan, jointly dismissing the working capital dispute arbitration. Allergan will pay Teva $700 million as part of the settlement.Teva’s shares rose 3.8% on Feb 1, following the news. However, shares of the company have declined 38.5% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 24.9%. Teva’s decline can be attributed to industry pressure, generic competition for its blockbuster drug, Copaxone, and a massive debt load. Teva also suffered a another setback in October 2017 as Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) launched its generic version of the 40 mg formulation of Copaxone, much earlier than expected.In order to combat these challenges, Teva has divested some non-core assets to cut its significant debt load and aims to cut its global workforce by more than 25% over the next two years.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited Price | Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderTeva carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Zoetis Inc.

294,ZTS,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to include stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to zero in on stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main aspects that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 11.Here are seven of the 11 stocks that made it through the screen:Tempur Sealy International, Inc. (TPX  -  Free Report) is involved in the development, manufacturing and marketing of bedding products in North America and internationally.

295,ZTS,"Investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks seems judicious as they are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows for the investor.The drug sector had a good run in 2017, bouncing back after drug pricing issues dampened its performance in 2016. Importantly, the sector saw a considerable increase in new drug approvals last year. The FDA approved 46 novel drugs last year, more than double of 2016’s tally of 22.The Large Cap Pharma industry witnessed an impressive rally in 2017, up 16.3% against a decline of 5.2% in 2016. The run was propelled by encouraging quarterly results, increased demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion. Strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products also boosted the sector.These factors are expected to play an instrumental role in 2018 as well, which may take the large-cap drug sector to new highs. The industry is already up 3.9% so far this year.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #100, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.The passing of the tax overhaul bill by the Congress is a cherry on the top. The slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% is likely to further boost profit margins.Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations, leaving these companies with extra cash in hand. This may lead to strategic deals like merger and acquisitions this year, which were relatively fewer in 2017.Most drug companies with a large market cap have seen their share price rise in 2018 so far. Here we present four companies, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), which outperformed the industry last year and have the potential to repeat the same performance in 2018.Johnson & JohnsonThe company's stock was up 21.3% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s shares were boosted by the approval of two drugs, Tremfya for plaque psoriasis and Juluca for HIV, along with several line extensions to its major drugs including Xarelto, Simponi Aria, Stelara and Imbruvicain 2017.The trend is expected to continue in 2018. J&J has several regulatory applications for label expansion of its key drugs under review. Potential approval to these line extensions will certainly boost the company’s growth prospects. Meanwhile, there are several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones lined up for 2018.Moreover, J&J’s pharma segment’s growth accelerated in third quarter of 2017 after slowing down in the first half due to a number of factors including competition for some key drugs like Remicade and Concerta. The upside is expected to continue in 2018.AbbVieThe stock of the company was up 54.4% in 2017. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In 2017, the company reported a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie also expects several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones in 2018, which is expected to further aid the company. The data readout from the pivotal phase III TRINITY study on Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer will be an important catalyst for the stock. Moreover, a FDA decision is expected on the new drug application (""NDA"") for elagolix for endometriosis, which was granted priority review in October last year.AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira, has been performing well despite competitive pressure. The company expects the drug’s performance to continue, which will boost the topline. Imbruvica is also doing consistently well with multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.Novo-NordiskShares of the company increased 49.7% in 2017. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3.This company was granted approval to expand the label of its diabetes drug, Victoza, to include treatment of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes in August 2017. Moreover, a new diabetes drug, Fiasp, received approval in September 2017 for treating adults with diabetes. In December 2017, the FDA approved Ozempic, a semaglutide once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It also received approval for Rebinyn for hemophilia B in the United States and Refixia for the treatment of adolescents and adults with the same indication in Europe.In 2018, the company expects a U.S. launch of Ozempic and an approval for the same in Europe, which will certainly boost the company’s revenues.Moreover, the company serves almost half of the insulin market and a quarter of the diabetes market. The growing diabetes market will certainly boost the topline.ZoetisThe company's shares rose 34.6% in 2017. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company has a diversified portfolio of livestock and companion animal products. In2017, the company increased its share of the dermatology products for dogs market to 59%. The companion animal business has been performing well, along with the launch of Apoquel and Cytopoint. The company acquired Nexvet Biopharma last year, which boosted its pipeline of solutions for chronic pain management in dogs and cats. The company also expanded the reach of its poultry diagnostics products into major European markets.In 2018, Zoetis topline is expected to benefit from Cytopoint, which was launched in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company expects cattle herd size to increase in 2018, which will drive growth.ConclusionWith a strong product portfolio, consistently successful pipeline developments and anticipated growth in demand for drugs, these companies will likely attract investor attention this year as well.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

(ZTS  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 earnings of 65 cents per share increased 25% year over year on a reported as well as operational (excluding foreign impact) basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents.

The company has a diverse portfolio of products for livestock and companion animals.Revenues in the United States segment were up 6% year over year to $680 million. Sales of companion animal products in this geography were up 21%, primarily due to higher sales of dermatology portfolio and product launches, especially Simparica. However, livestock revenues declined 6% mainly due to decreased sales of cattle products, partially offset by higher sales of poultry medicated feed additive products.Revenues at the International segment grew 12% year over year (up 11% operationally) on a reported basis to $654 million. Livestock sales were up 10% on a reported basis (up 9% operationally) in the quarter mainly due to increased sales of fish products in Norway and cattle products in Brazil, Argentina and Australia. Moreover, sales of companion animal products grew 15% on a reported as well as operational basis, reflecting higher sales of Simparica and Apoquel.2017 Outlook RaisedZoetis increased its sales and earnings outlook for 2017.

However, sales at the Healthcare division were disappointing last quarter with only cancer drug, Erbitux registering sales growth. The Mar 2017 recommendation from National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for Erbitux’s use in combination with either Folfiri or Folfox as a first-line treatment for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in the UK is expected to boost sales.However, competitive pressure and price reduction are expected to hurt sales of infertility drug, Gonal-f. Meanwhile, a year-over-year weakening of euro against dollar is expected to positively impact total sales for the company.In Mar 2017, the company received approval for Bavencio for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) followed by approval for advanced bladder cancer in May 2017 in the U.S.. The drug may bring in some sales this quarter. Moreover, the company is developing the drug in partnership with Pfizer Inc.

The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 6.98%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Zoetis’ share price movement year to date shows that the stock has outperformed the industry. The stock has moved up 19.7% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.2% during this period.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Zoetis is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.33%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zoetis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.The combination of Zoetis’ Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company continues to strengthen its diverse products portfolio through lifecycle innovations, strong customer relationships and access to new markets and technologies.Concurrent with the second earnings call, Zoetis increased its 2017 outlook. The company expects earnings in the range of $2.30–$2.37 per share and revenues of $5.15 billion–$5.25 billion. The improved outlook also suggest a better results in the third quarter.

302,ZTS,"Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CNAT  -  Free Report)is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after the market closes.Conatus’ earnings history has been disappointing. The company surpassed expectations on one occasion only, missing in two and registering in-line results in another with an average negative surprise of 19.01%. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative surprise of 72.73%.Conatus’ shares have decreased 11.6% so far this year. This compares unfavorably with the industry’s 22.7% registered increase during the period.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming release.Factors at PlayWith no approved product in Conatus’ portfolio at the moment, the company is yet to generate revenues. Hence, investors’ focus will be on the company’s progress with emricasan, an orally active pan-caspase protease inhibitor.Emricasan is currently under evaluation in various phase IIb studies for treatment of chronic liver disease including NASH fibrosis. With the initiation of ENCORE-LF clinical trial in May, there are now four ongoing emricasan phase IIb clinical studies. These include three ENCORE programs on patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in various patient populations and a fourth ENCORE study on POLT-HCV-SVR patients.In August, Conatus announced completion of enrollment in ENCORE-NF study. Data from all these studies are expected between 2018 and 2019.The company also plans to soon initiate an additional study — ENCORE-XT — on emricasan under the ENCORE program.Conatus has an exclusive option, collaboration and license agreement with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the worldwide development and commercialization of emricasan. In July, the company announced that it has received an amount of $7 million from Novartis with the deal becoming effective. This amount is likely to benefit the company’s third-quarter revenues.Operating expenses at the company, particularly research and development costs, are expected to rise due to continued investment toward the development of emricasan.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Conatus will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But this is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Conatus has an Earnings ESP of -264.28%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of a loss of 17 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Conatus currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

Overall, the company has an average trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 2.47%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 7.14%.Perrigo Company Price and EPS Surprise Perrigo Company Price and EPS Surprise | Perrigo Company QuotePerrigo’s shares have lost 19% so far this year, while the industry witnessed an increase of 18.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company this quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterPrice erosion and changing market dynamics across Perrigo’s Prescription Pharmaceuticals (Rx) segment is likely to continue hurting the company’s performance. The company continues to expect a tough drug pricing environment to impact the segment’s performance. It anticipates price erosion of approximately 9-10% at the Rx segment in the coming quarters.The Branded Consumer Healthcare (BCH) business, a part of Consumer Health Care International (CHCI) segment, is still being impacted by unfavorable market dynamics in countries like Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. This BCH segment is projected to underperform in the yet-to-be-reported quarter due to lower-than-expected revenues from certain high-margin products.The U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division has been conducting an investigation at Perrigo, seeking information about the latter’s drug pricing practices. In May, the company announced that search warrants were executed at its corporate offices associated with the ongoing investigation. Hence, the company’s pricing strategies might get affected by such probes.However, Perrigo’s constant focus to pursue additional branded OTC opportunities in the U.S. market as well as product acquisitions and new products launches in the Rx segment are expected to boost sales in the future quarters. The ongoing restructuring initiatives and operating expense discipline are expected to support the bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Perrigo is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Perrigo is -2.13% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 92 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 94 cents.

304,ZTS,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell.The company’s performance has been mixed so far. In the last four reported quarters, it surpassed earnings estimates on two occasions and missed in two. Overall, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 0.45%.Regeneron’s share price movement shows that the stock outperformed the Zacks categorized industry in the year so far. Specifically, the stock has rallied 39.8% during this period, while the industry gained 11.5%.Last quarter, Regeneron Pharma missed earnings expectations by 13.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterRegeneron Pharma’s key growth driver, Eylea, is likely to continue to contribute to the company’s top line growth.  However, growth pace for the drug has slowed down and the company expects the same to be in single digits in 2017.We note that Regeneron Pharma has a global development and commercialization agreement with Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report) outside the U.S. for Eylea. Product revenues from ex-U.S. Eylea sales are recorded by Bayer.The company is working on expanding Eylea’s label into diabetic retinopathy in an ongoing phase III study.Apart from Eylea, investors will remain focused on the performance of the PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent. Sales of Praluent have failed to impress so far.In Jan 2017, Kevzara (sarilumab), an anti interleukin (IL)-6 receptor monoclonal antibody was approved in Canada for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have an inadequate response to or intolerance to one or more biologic or non-biologic Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs. In May 2017, the FDA also approved Kevzara for the same indication. In Jun 2017, the European Medicine Agency`s (EMA) also approved the drug for the same indication. The approval of Kevzara will further boost the company's portfolio. In addition, the company is currently enrolling patients in a study for the treatment of polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis.The company also received a boost when the FDA approved its Dupixent (dupilumab) Injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Pricing will play a key role in the uptake of the drug and we expect the company to throw more light on the same.During the second-quarter earnings call, focus will be on the company’s performance, particularly Eylea and Dupixient launch. Investors are also expected to await updates on the company’s pipeline. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Regeneron Pharma is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayAs a development-stage company, Agios does not have approved products in its portfolio yet. Investors are thus expected to keep an eye on pipeline updates at the earnings call.It is worth mentioning that the company has several interesting candidates in its pipeline. Its cancer pipeline comprises Idhifa (enasidenib), AG-120 (IDH1 mutant inhibitor) and AG-881 (pan-IDH mutant inhibitor). Notably, Agios is developing enasidenib and AG-881 in collaboration with Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report), which should bring in collaboration revenues.Idhifa is presently under FDA review for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutation. The company expects the FDA to give its decision on Aug 30, 2017.Idhifa is being evaluated in several phase I dose-escalation studies, evaluating both hematological and solid tumor cancers with IDH2 mutations. Last month, the company announced positive efficacy and safety data from the ongoing phase I dose-escalation and expansion study evaluating Idhifa in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML) and an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation. Agios and Celgene intend to initiate a high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome study on enasidenib in 2017.Apart from Idhifa, Agios is also planning to initiate a phase III study on AG-120 in front-line AML patients with an IDH1 mutation soon. The company plans to explore a similar regulatory path for AG-120, which could lead to an NDA submission in the U.S. this year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Agios is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate stands and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of $1.52 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Agios has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report), which is scheduled to release results on Aug 8, has an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Zoetis is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ZTS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 54 cents per share for ZTS, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ZTS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.89% heading into earnings season.Zoetis Inc.

However, no sales from the drug will be recorded in the second quarter.Nerlynx is also under review in the EU for the same disease. Several additional studies on Nerlynx targeting different types of breast cancer patient populations are currently underway. Puma believes that Nerlynx can also be developed for treatment of other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other tumor types which over-express or have a mutation in HER2. In June, the company announced positive results from a single cohort of a three-arm phase II study evaluating neratinib for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain.In addition, several phase II combination studies on neratinib for the treatment of breast cancer, are ongoing.In Apr 2017, Puma presented an encouraging additional data from breast cancer studies at the San American Association for Cancer Research Annual (AACR) on neratinib. These include interim data from a phase II trial on patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer, who had completed trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy; interim phase I/II data from the NSABP FB-10 trial of neratinib plus Kadcyla (T-DM1) in HER2-positive MBC; and finally, a phase II data from SUMMIT study on HER2-negative breast cancer patients with HER2 mutations.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Puma is likely to beat estimates this quarterbecause it has the right combination of two key ingredients.

Price and Consensus  Zoetis Inc. Price and Consensus | Zoetis Inc. QuoteFactors to ConsiderZoetis derives the majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals.

The company expects earnings in the range of $2.26–$2.36 and revenues of$5.10 billion–$5.225 billion per share. The company’s companion animal business has been performing well of late. Apoquel and other product launches continue to drive growth. The company expects to witness stronger growth from its companion animal portfolio in 2017 driven by its dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica, and the ongoing uptake of new vaccines.Zoetis expects to witness growth in the livestock business as it overcomes product rationalization impacts.In May 2015, Zoetis announced comprehensive operational efficiency initiatives that are expected to generate cost savings of more than $300 million by the end of 2017.Zoetis recently acquired Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Zoetis’ pipeline of solutions for chronic pain management in dogs and cats, which represents an area of high-need in companion animal health.We expect management to throw more light on its acquisition strategy.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Tesaro, Inc.

309,ZTS,"Endo International plc (ENDP  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.82%. In fact, it pulled off a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive surprise of 14.4%.Shares of Endo’s have declined 34.8% year to date against the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 3.7%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterWe believe 2017 will continue to be challenging year for Endo as the generics base business and the legacy branded pain franchise are expected to decline further.In fact, its Generics base business is under significant pressure due to intensifying consortium pricing pressures and additional competitive entrants and product discontinuations as well as discrete factors, including destocking and shifts in purchase timing owing to market conditions.The company expects the underlying rate of base business price erosion to be in the high single-digit in 2017 (excluding the impact of product discontinuances, the full-year impact of prior year competitive events, and the impact of expected new competitive events in 2017). The segment is projected to decline in the high single-to-low double-digit percentage range in the same year,  which will be partially offset by growth in its sterile injectables and new launch revenues, respectively.Meanwhile, Endo’s Branded segment continues to be under pressure due to additional competitive entrants as well as a continuous rise in the number of public policy and regulatory actions including the recent CDC guidelines related to opioid prescribing and divestiture of Strenda.Also, international revenues in 2017 are expected to decline in the mid to high 20% range, reflecting the divestiture of Litha as well as the competitive pressure for Paladin and the impact of foreign exchange on Somar.In Jul 2017, Endo announced that it will withdraw opioid pain medication Opana ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride extended release) from the market following the FDA’s request in June. The move comes in wake of the widespread opioid abuse epidemic. Consequently, the company expects to incur a pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $20 million in the to-be-reported quarter to write-off the remaining net book value of its drug.On the second-quarter earnings call, investors are expected to focus on the company’s performance. Updates on its restructuring efforts across the Generics product and R&D portfolio as well as its manufacturing facility network are expected by the investors.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Endo this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.35%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 75 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 74 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Endo currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision. Endo International PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Endo International PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Endo International PLC QuoteStocks to ConsiderHere are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Tesaro, Inc.

QuoteFactors at PlayWith no approved products in its portfolio, Juno does not generate any product revenue yet. Thus, investors’ focus will primarily be on the company’s cash burn and pipeline updates.Juno is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on CAR and high-affinity TCR technologies. This is a hot therapeutic area with huge commercial potential. Presently, the company’s most advanced pipeline candidates include JCAR017 and JCAR014, which use CAR T-cell technology to target CD19.JCAR017 is in a phase I study for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and in a phase I/II study in pediatric and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL). A pivotal trial for JCAR017 in r/r DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) is expected to start in 2017. The company plans to bring JCAR017 to the market for NHL as early as 2018 and for multiple indications by the end of 2019.Encouraging data from an early-stage study evalauting JCAR014, in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who failed treatment with ibrutinib, was presented in Dec 2016. Insights from studies of JCAR014 are being applied to the development of JCAR017 for the treatment of B-cell malignancies.However, the company faced a major setback last year related to the development of its lead pipeline candidate, JCAR015. In Nov 2016, Juno announced that it is discontinuing the development of JCAR015 for r/r ALL due to the toxicity witnessed in a phase II ROCKET study.We note that at the time of releasing the first-quarter results, Juno has maintained its expectations of cash burn of $270–$300 million for 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Juno is likely to beat estimates this quarter.
