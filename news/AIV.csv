3,AIV,"Despite the Brexit volatility, sparked by the U.K.'s June 24 vote to withdraw from the European Union, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds eked out a 1.79% gain on average in the second quarter, even as they lost 0.52% in June alone, according to Lipper Inc.The S&P 500 tacked on 2.46% in Q2, after inching up 0.26% in June.That's it for the good news. Stock fund managers are seeking durable-growth stocks as a hedge against the uncertainty, volatility and slowdown in corporate earnings that several told IBD they see in the months -- or longer -- ahead.Click Here To See A List Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""Before Brexit, the (investment) world was almost back to normal,"" said Matthew Ward, co-manager of Schroder U.S. Large Cap Equity strategy, which is run as a separate account. The Federal Reserve was edging toward an interest rate increase. First-quarter panic over the pace and sustainability of China's growth was subsiding. U.S. economic indicators were OK, with jobs and wages growing, home values inching up and consumers feeling confidence.""Then, Brexit,"" Ward said. ""We're back to uncertainty, and the market hates uncertainty.""As a result, going forward Ward says the stocks he wants are in a narrow group that have shown an ability to grow earnings regardless of the macro environment.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""Our biggest overweight is in consumer discretionary,"" he said. ""It reflects our confidence in consumers. And in some durable secular trends. Amazon (AMZN) is at the top of our list.""Similarly, James Abate, sole manager of $156 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX) and of $53 million Multi-Asset Real Return (DHMUX), sees the best prospects for growth increasingly concentrated within an elite group. ""We're concentrating in names that somehow can buck the trend in terms of economic malaise,"" said Abate, who is also Centre's chief investment officer. ""The names in the new Nifty 50 bucket include Amazon, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Nvidia (NVDA) and General Mills (GIS).""Jim Swanson, lead manager of $3.4 billion MFS Diversified Income (DIFAX) and chief investment strategist of MFS Investment Management, was already bearish on stocks pre-Brexit.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance The outlook was already dim for corporate earnings growth, he said. He added that companies globally had already lost purchasing power. U.S. selling and general administrative costs, as well as labor costs, are rising. Productivity here, in Europe and in China is falling.Post-Brexit, the dollar is up vs. the Chinese yuan, which will hurt U.S. exports and U.S. multinationals' earnings, he said. A global movement toward trade protectionism, if realized, would also hurt earnings.""Brexit or not, we need to see excess capacity come out of the world manufacturing system and the return of some inflation so that companies can pass along price increases,"" Swanson said.Despite the threats to U.S. corporate earnings, Swanson is overweight in U.S. stocks vs. their Japanese and European peers, which have growth outlooks that look even dimmer to him. And he is underweight in stocks vs. bonds and cash.""U.S. corporate bonds are the place to be,"" he said. He's favoring a mix of high-grade and high-yield debt.Small-cap growth funds led market-capitalization and style groups among U.S. diversified stock funds in Q2, gaining 3.85%.World equity mutual funds barely advanced in Q2, edging up 0.27% while losing 0.64% in June. Latin American funds led all foreign regions, advancing 8.72% in Q2 and 10.72% in June.Up 26.16% year to date, Latin American funds have benefited primarily from a rebound from an excessive sell-off last year, as well as a rebound in the Brazilian real vs. the U.S. dollar and a bounce for oil and other commodities, according to Peter Taylor, a manager of $7.4 billion Aberdeen Emerging Markets (ABEAX) and $3.5 million Latin American Equity Fund (ALEAX). Brazilian stocks have also benefited from the ouster, at least temporarily, of President Dilma Rousseff and in market-friendly fiscal reforms, he says.The quarter's volatility enabled precious metals funds to lead sectors by soaring 40.63% in Q2, more than half of that in June.Going forward, Swanson feels best about the technology sector among U.S. stocks. ""Its free cash flow is the highest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors,"" he said. ""Despite talk of bubbles, the sector is trading cheaper than utilities in Ohio. Yet tech companies change the world.""Software is due to benefit from an overdue upgrade cycle, he says.His second-favorite sector is health care. ""Health care spending keeps rising as a portion of U.S. GDP,"" he said. ""It's priced fairly, not cheaply. It has the best profit outlook after tech.""Consumer discretionary is his third-favorite sector. ""Forward price-earnings ratios are high, but we're seeing year-over-year profit growth that's almost as good as tech's,"" he said.Among tech stocks, Facebook (FB) is one that Ward likes. ""They have exceptional top-line growth,"" he said. ""And they're growing their opportunities."" For one, viewers are tolerating a tripling of videos being shown by advertisers, which allows Facebook to triple the number of ads it inserts among videos.In health care, Ward says share prices have been beaten down, largely by investor concerns that drug pricing will draw additional regulatory scrutiny. But he still likes individual stocks in the sector, including Amgen (AMGN).""It is the cheapest with pharmaceuticals,"" he said. And it is creating market opportunities with a number of biosimilars, which are harder than previous generation treatments for rivals to replicate.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Ward likes Amazon because of top-line growth and its use of Prime to draw new site users. He also likes Amazon's use of its warehouse for storing inventory without the expense of purchasing it.Tractor Supply (TSCO) is another consumer discretionary name he likes. It caters to customers whose income is double the national average and who pursue a rural lifestyle, he says. Its sales are triple its next six competitors combined. Its scale enables Tractor Supply to customize inventory for different regions.In staples, he likes Monster Beverage (MNST). Its new carbonated drink, Mutant, and its distribution arrangement with partner Coca-Cola (KO) should keep growth in the high single digits or low double digits, he says. Wall Street expects low single digits, which makes the stock attractively valued, he says.David Harden, president of Summit Global Investments and lead manager of two of its funds -- $125 million U.S. Low Volatility Equity (LVOLX) and $11 million Small Cap Low Volatility (LVSMX) -- says that amid volatility he likes stocks with stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.One trait shared by stocks he likes is stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.Another trait is low two-year beta. Each one's beta is below 1.0, which means each is less volatile than the overall stock market.

6,AIV,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, has received support from a broad coalition in the company’s appeal of the California court decision for its case against Airbnb. Particularly, the group backs Aimco’s measures to hold Airbnb legally responsible for engaging in brokering and endorsing illegal short-term rentals.Going by facts, per a December 2017 U.S. District Court ruling, Airbnb was provided ""immunity"" from liability for illegal short-term rentals brokering at Aimco’s apartment communities. This was granted on the basis of the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA) which protects online-service providers from the responsibility for the content users post.However, last month, Aimco filed its Ninth Circuit brief in the company’s appeal of the December 2017 ruling. And now the coalition has filed amicus briefs in support of Aimco’s appeal that the CDA does not offer such broad immunity to Airbnb.Among the members in the coalition, are names like National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association; the California Apartment Association and Avalon Bay Communities; the League of California Cities, International Municipal Lawyers Association and California State Association of Counties; the American Hotel and Lodging Association; and others. All these strengthen Aimco’s appeal and raise hopes for the reconsideration of the ruling.Moreover, an amicus brief, pointing out the troubles created by Airbnb to affordable housing and stable communities, has been filed with the court by a group of New York neighborhood associations.According to Aimco's legal representative Mike Williams, ""Airbnb is a full-fledged real estate broker of illegal short-term rentals and should be held to the same level of scrutiny and accountability as a 'brick-and-mortar' broker engaged in comparable unauthorized activities.""According to Aimco and the parties supporting its appeal, rather than focusing on Airbnb’s act of publishing of property listings, the company should be held legally accountable for illegal short-term rental activities, as such doings pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of full-time residents. In fact, per the company, though prospective Aimco residents go through criminal background checks, several Airbnb customers are not thoroughly examined and are unknown trespassers. These customers not only pose a risk to safety but have also triggered disruption and damaged property at Aimco’s apartment premises.Such a support from the broader fraternity is a positive for the company. Moreover, Aimco is making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions. The company’s portfolio is diversified in terms of geography and price point, and its revamping efforts have the capability to drive long-term growth.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets, which is affecting other residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), is also anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new-lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the past three months, shares of the company have underperformed the industry. While the stock has inched up 1.8%, the industry has rallied 4.6% during this period. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

7,AIV,"If stellar job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for a robust revival of the apartment market fundamentals, then we should, perhaps, think twice.This is because per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), with several markets experiencing flat rents, U.S. apartment rents have increased at an annual pace of just 2.3% as of mid-2018 — marking the slowest pace in eight years. While a mid-2018 occupancy level of 95.0% is still healthy, the deceleration in rent growth suggests that a competitive leasing environment is building up fast, and curbing landlords’ pricing power.While there was a moderation in the first quarter too, but the January-March quarter usually has a sluggish leasing period due to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand. Therefore, achieving a solid pricing power in the second quarter is significant, as otherwise, landlords find it difficult to recoup the same later in the year. This is because prior to the onset of the seasonal slowdown in leasing, pressure of filling units is more prevalent in the market than pushing rent levels north.However, during Q2 this year, the market recorded a pricing increase of 1.8%. In fact, rent growth was slower than the pace experienced during the same period in the earlier years. In the 2014-2017 period, rent growth in the April-June quarter averaged 2.3%.Furthermore, this turbulent environment is unlikely to end any time soon and offer respite, as the struggle to lure renters will definitely continue into the upcoming quarters as well, when much of new supply is expected to come on course.According to the RealPage report, the “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level for four consecutive quarters. Additionally, through mid-2019, annual deliveries will keep adding on to the flow with around 300,000 units.Therefore, landlords’ ability to command more rents will most likely remain stunted and concessions might be rampant in the near term. This, again, is feared to cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, American Homes 4 Rent (AMH  -  Free Report), AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report).While AvalonBay and Equity Residential currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Aimco and American Homes 4 Rent carry a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), underlining downward revisions of the 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share estimate in recent months.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

8,AIV,"The U.S. residential REIT industry’s growth in rent is slowing and there is no near-term respite in sight.Per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage, with several markets experiencing flat rents, U.S. apartment rents increased at an annual pace of just 2.3% as of mid-2018, denoting its slowest pace in eight years. While a mid-2018 occupancy level of 95.0% is still healthy, the deceleration in rent growth suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up, and curbing landlords’ pricing power.Even though solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations of a revival of the U.S. residential real estate market fundamentals, the struggle to lure renters will quite obviously continue in the upcoming quarters, when much of new supply is likely to come on course.According to the RealPage report, the “annual pace of completions” has climbed above the 300,000-unit level for four consecutive quarters. Further, through mid-2019, annual deliveries will keep adding on to the flow with around 300,000 units. So the stressed environment is anticipated to continue in the near term and curtail residential landlords' ability to command more rents and affect concession levels.Moreover, the student housing sector, which is part of the residential REIT industry, is lately experiencing a slowdown in leasing velocity and compression in rent growth amid demand supply imbalances. Specifically, properties away from campus are feeling the brunt.Industry Lags in Terms of Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the broader economic recovery wasn’t enough for enhancing investors’ confidence in the industry’s growth prospect. Elevated supply affected the performance of residential REITs over the past several quarters.The REIT and Equity Trust - Residential Industry, which is a group within the broader Zacks Finance Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 3.9%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Finance Sector have rallied 12.1% and 4.0%, respectively.One-Year Price PerformanceResidential REIT Stocks Trading CheapFor REITs, price-to-FFO (funds from operations) multiple is a common measure for valuation. This is because FFO is a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs rather than net income as it indicates cash flow from their operations.FFO is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting the gains on sales. This is done because although per GAAP accounting norms, REITs are required to depreciate their investment properties over time, in reality many properties experience value appreciation over time.So, to offset that impact, depreciation and amortization are added back. Moreover, gains on sales of property are subtracted since such sales are considered nonrecurring in nature.Thanks to the underperformance of the industry over the past year, the valuation looks really cheap. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/FFO of 18.31. When compared with the highest level of 20.63 and median level of 19.18 over the past year, there is plenty of upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 20.08 and the median level is 20.17.Price-to-FFO (TTM)Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak FFO per Share OutlookSolid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations of still-healthy apartment market occupancy despite high deliveries in the near term. Also, shortage in construction labor and rising expenses might somewhat impede the growth momentum of supply.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. While the earlier valuation discussion shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is the industry's FFO per share outlook. FFO per share revisions trend for the constituent companies usually influences their stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up FFO per share expectations and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus FFO per share expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Zacks REIT-Equity Trust – Residential industry This becomes even clearer if we focus on the aggregate bottom-up FFO per share revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $2.71 FFO per share estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar FFO per share estimate for every company in the REIT - Equity Trust - Residential industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the FFO per share of the industry for 2018, but how this value has evolved recently.   Current Fiscal Year FFO Per Share Estimate RevisionsAs you can see here, the $2.71 FFO per share estimate for 2018 is down from $2.73 at the end of May and $2.75 at the end of the month prior to that and $2.94 this time last year. Looking at the aggregate FFO per share estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group’s FFO per share potential.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Cloudy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust – Residential industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183, which places it at the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Revenue Trend of Residential REITs Shows Some PromiseWhile the near-term prospects look unwelcoming for investors, the uptrend in revenues over the past years appears promising. This might support long-term growth in FFO per share. Bottom LineFinally, in the present demand-supply scenario, a deceleration of fundamentals is anticipated. Therefore, pressure on new lease rates, occupancy as well as retention would persist, while concession activity to lure renters is expected to remain high.Moreover, for REITs, rate hike remains the biggest near-term challenge as the use of leverage for REIT business makes the returns from this industry susceptible to interest rate movements. Also, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money-market accounts. Although, the short-term nature of lease for residential REITs usually helps in adjusting rents quickly to any rate hike, the current lower pricing power is likely to erode some of that benefit.Now it’s time for investors to consider portfolio reshuffling and stay away from some stocks from the said industry, which are unlikely to bounce back in the near term. Among these are:(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Apartment Investment & Management Co.

9,AIV,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AIV due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Aimco’s Q1 FFO In Line With Estimates, Revenues BeatAimco reported first-quarter 2018 pro forma FFO of 60 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure indicates a 3% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 58 cents.Results displayed growth in property NOI, supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018.In the reported quarter, total revenues of $247.7 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $243.7 million. In addition, the reported figure came in marginally higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $246.5 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (before utility reimbursements) increased 2.6% year over year to $144.9 million while expenses (net of utility reimbursements) increased 2.1% from the prior-year quarter to $38.9 million. Consequently, same-store NOI climbed 2.7% to $106 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 30 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.3%. Rental rates on new leases were up 0.4% whereas rental rates on renewal leases increased 4.9% from the expiring lease rates.As of Mar 31, 2018, Aimco had cash and restricted cash on hand of $91 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities was around $2 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter under review, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $79 million and available capacity was $509 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit, backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7% to $2,052. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home was 49%, 35% and 16%, respectively, in first-quarter 2018.GuidanceFor full-year 2018, the company updated its pro forma FFO per share guidance to $2.39-$2.49 from $2.42-$2.52 provided earlier.The company projects same-store NOI growth to be in the range of 1.70-3.10% and revenue growth to be in the range of 2.10-3.10%.For second-quarter 2018, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance of 57-61 cents.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to three lower.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and Consensus Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and Consensus | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AIV has a subpar Growth Score of D, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of F. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate investors will probably be better served looking elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, AIV has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

10,AIV,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — has been making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions. However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new-lease pricing ability.Recently, Aimco reported in-line results for first-quarter 2018 with respect to pro forma funds from operation (FFO) per share. The results displayed growth in property net operating income (NOI), supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018.Notably, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and greater-than-expected growth. Through these efforts, the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7% to $2,052 in first-quarter 2018. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. In the reported quarter, the percentage of A, B and C+ home was 49%, 35% and 16%, respectively.Moreover, in April 2018, in sync with its portfolio revamping strategy, Aimco opted for the acquisition of six apartment communities in Philadelphia for $445 million. Further, the company plans to sell its asset-management portfolio along with four affordable garden-style communities for $590 million. Also, during the first quarter, the company invested $47 million in redevelopment and development. Such efforts are expected to help the company enhance its overall portfolio quality and achieve a favorable mix for long-term growth.Additionally, due to changing lifestyle, people, on an average, are settling later in life and thereby buying homes later, leading to a rising tendency of living in a rented home. Further, as renting is the only viable option for customers, who cannot avail mortgage loans or are unwilling to buy a house at present, demand for Aimco’s premium properties are expected to continue to rise in the coming quarters.Also, the company has been on track to enhance its balance sheet and liquidity position, and bring down leverage. Aimco is focusing on boosting its financial flexibility by increasing the pool of unencumbered apartment assets.Nonetheless, apartment supply remained elevated in the first quarter. Particularly, new supply is competing with some of the company’s higher-rent properties. This high supply is a concern because it curtails landlords’ ability to command more rent and results in lesser absorption.However, although Aimco’s effort to sell non-core assets and buy properties in higher-growth infill areas is a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be avoided in the near term.Further, hike in interest rate remain a concern for Aimco. This is because the company’s ability to refinance existing debt would be restricted, while the interest cost on new debt would increase. This could adversely affect the company’s results and consequently dent its dividend payout.Moreover, amid rising rates, not only the financing costs will increase, but the common stock buyers will also demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock.In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has underperformed the industry.

However, these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018.In the reported quarter, total revenues of $247.7 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $243.7 million. In addition, the reported figure came in marginally higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $246.5 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (before utility reimbursements) increased 2.6% year over year to $144.9 million while expenses (net of utility reimbursements) increased 2.1% from the prior-year quarter to $38.9 million. Consequently, same-store NOI climbed 2.7% to $106 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 30 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.3%. Rental rates on new leases were up 0.4% whereas rental rates on renewal leases were up 4.9% from the expiring lease rates.As of Mar 31, 2018, Aimco had cash and restricted cash on hand of $91 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities was around $2 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter under review, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $79 million and available capacity was $509 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit, backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7% to $2,052. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home was 49%, 35% and 16%, respectively, in first-quarter 2018 compared with 51%, 35% and 14% recorded in the year-ago quarter. GuidanceFor full-year 2018, the company updated its pro forma FFO per share guidance to $2.39-$2.49 from $2.42-$2.52 provided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2.48.For second-quarter 2018, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance of 57-61 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 62 cents.The company projects same-store NOI growth to be in the range of 1.70-3.10% and revenue growth in the range of 2.10-3.10%.DividendOn May 2, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the first quarter. This marks a 6% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on May 31 to stockholders of record as of May 18, 2018.Bottom LineAimco’s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions are likely to drive long-term growth. In addition to this, the company has a solid portfolio, diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to help meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteAimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Results reflect better-than-expected revenue numbers for the quarter. The company also reaffirmed its 2018 guidance.Reflecting positive sentiments, shares of Mack-Cali climbed nearly 4.4% to $18.10 during regular trading session on May 3.In fact, total revenues of around $139 million comfortably exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $130.2 million.However, on a year-over-year basis, core FFO per share fell 10.7%, while revenues declined 7.3%.Quarter in DetailAs of Mar 31, 2018, Mack-Cali’s consolidated core office properties were 85.2% leased, which shrunk 240 basis points (bps) from the prior-quarter end. Same-store cash revenues for the office portfolio descended 2.8%, while same-store cash net operating income (NOI) fell 8.7%.  During the reported quarter, Mack-Cali executed 41 lease deals, spanning around 265,885 square feet of space, at the company’s consolidated in-service commercial portfolio. This comprised 21% for new leases, and 79% for lease renewals and other tenant-retention deals.Further, for the core portfolio, rental rate roll up for first-quarter 2018 deals was 5.1% on a cash basis. For new transactions, rental rate roll up was 4% on a cash basis, while for renewals and other tenant retention deals, it was 5.3% on a cash basis.Moreover, for the company’s residential same-store portfolio, which comprised 3,156 units and 97.3% leased at the quarter’s end, NOI inched up 1.3% in the quarter.Portfolio ActivityMack-Cali completed dispositions of 20 properties, comprising 1.7 million square feet of space, for $232 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.84.The company projects office occupancy (year-end % leased) of 84-86% and dispositions of $375-$425 million for full-year 2018. This will mark completion of the company’s major disposition program. Sales in future will occur on a select one-off basis.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Mack-Cali in Q1. The company has been making solid progress with respect to the 2015 strategic plan, aimed at focusing on waterfront and transit-based office holdings, and luxury multi-family portfolio growth. Nevertheless, such plans involve significant upfront costs, which might drag down the company’s profit margins. In addition to these, it has been aggressively disposing assets. While such measures are a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings from huge asset sales cannot be bypassed in the near term. Rate hike also remains another concern.Mack-Cali currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Mack-Cali Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Mack-Cali Realty Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Mack-Cali Realty Corporation QuoteWe now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report), EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report) and Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report).

13,AIV,"We are in the last leg of the Q1 earnings season and 343 S&P 500 members have already reported their quarterly results, as of May 2. Going by the encouraging trends, the first quarter looks well poised to record robust earnings and revenue growth. Earnings for the S&P 500 members, that have already reported, are up 24% from the same period last year, on 9.5% higher revenues, with 78.4% outpacing EPS estimates and 75.8% beating on revenues.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings in the first quarter, for all the S&P 500 members, are projected to be up 23.1% on 8.6% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for Q1, let’s concentrate on earnings of the Finance Sector, which includes real estate investment trusts (REITs) too. Total earnings of companies in the sector, which have reported quarterly figures so far, have climbed 27.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues. Particularly, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a vital role in determining REITs’ performance, not all the companies in this space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season. In fact, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have affected returns from this industry, so far, this year. Let’s take a look at REITs scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 7, and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) — commonly known as Aimco — has a diversified portfolio, both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to have aided the company to meet the increase in demand for apartment properties from echo boomers — children of the baby-boomer generation — in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, Aimco has been making concerted efforts to revamp its portfolio through property sales and by reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth. (Read more: Aimco to Report Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?)Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operation (FFO) per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 60 cents. This indicates a 3.5% increase year over year. For the first quarter, management projects pro-forma FFO per share in the band of 57-61 cents.Our proven model shows that Aimco has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a favorable Zacks Rank of 3.Over the trailing four quarters, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and reported in-line numbers in the other two, which is depicted in the graph below:Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteOmega Healthcare Investors, Inc.(OHI  -  Free Report) invests principally in long-term care facilities located in the United States and the U.K. It provides lease or mortgage financing to qualified operators of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and, to a lesser extent, assisted living facilities (ALFs), independent living facilities, and rehabilitation and acute care facilities.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for rental income of $195 million reflects a marginal increase from the year-ago figure of $193 million.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 75 cents reflects year-over-year decline of 12.8%. Further, the consensus estimate for sales is $216.3 million for the to-be-reported quarter, underscoring a fall of 6.65% year over year.Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.

(APLE  -  Free Report) has a portfolio consisting of hotels, guest rooms and resorts. At the first-quarter end, we anticipate the company to have witnessed year-over-year expansion of its portfolio, with ownership of 241 hotels and 30,585 rooms.Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from guest rooms at $275 million indicates 2.2% improvement from prior-year quarter. Overall portfolio occupancy is expected to have moderately increased to 75%.While its FFO per share are estimated to have remained unchanged, revenues might have increased year over year.Despite a favorable Zacks Rank of 3, the Earnings ESP of 0.00% lowers chances of an earnings beat. Also, in each of the preceding four quarters, the company’s results outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion, missed in two, and met in another, as depicted in the graph below:Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc. QuoteEquity Commonwealth(EQC  -  Free Report) primarily owns office buildings located throughout the United States. Notably, majority of its portfolio consists of office buildings located in central business districts, or CBDs, of major metropolitan markets. Amid rising supply of office assets, vacancy rates ticked up and rent growth slowed in the first quarter. This is expected to have impacted the quarterly performance of Equity Commonwealth.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues of $71.9 million indicates a steep decline of 27.8% from the year-earlier quarter. Furthermore, the company’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of 17 cents for the first quarter remained unchanged, over the past month. The figure reflects 37.04% decline from the prior-year quarter.In fact, an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), along with Earnings ESP of 0.00%, makes surprise prediction difficult.Over the last four quarters, the company missed the FFO per share estimates in three occasions and beat in another, resulting in an average negative surprise of 5.35%. This is depicted in the graph below:Equity Commonwealth Price and EPS Surprise  Equity Commonwealth Price and EPS Surprise | Equity Commonwealth QuoteSunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.(SHO  -  Free Report) is a lodging REIT that owns and manages hotels, primarily in the upper-upscale and upscale segments, which are particularly operated under franchises owned by nationally-recognized companies, such as Marriott, Hilton, InterContinental and Hyatt. The company has a high quality and well diversified portfolio, located in the most dynamic locations of the country. Significant capital investments, in a bid to reposition the portfolio, are expected to have boosted the operating performance of the company.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter revenues is pegged at $258.3 million and represents 8% year-over-year decline. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share remained unchanged at 19 cents, over the past month, and indicates an estimated year-over-year fall of 20.8%.Nonetheless, it has an impressive surprise history, beating estimates in each of the past four quarters, as depicted in the graph below:Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.

Core FFO per share improved 5.1% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.94.Results reflect growth in net operating income (NOI) and high occupancy level.Total revenues of $347.3 million in the quarter grew 3.5% year over year.

Financial occupancies of 97.1% expanded 60 basis points (bps) year over year.Essex Property exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $139.1 million, up from $61.1 million recorded at the end of 2017.Notably, in January 2018, the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. As of Apr 27, 2018, the company had around $1.2 billion in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the reported quarter, the company repurchased 16,834 shares of its common stock for a total of $3.8 million (including commissions), at an average price of $224.13 per share.

However, the company’s revenue miss remains a disappointment. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets.The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term.

17,AIV,"Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) of 43 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. However, the adjusted FFO per share fell shy of the year-ago quarter tally of 44 cents.Results reflect margin improvement through better productivity. However, the year-over-year decline mainly reflects increase in interest expenses and additional tax expenses. The company has also raised its outlook for full-year 2018.The company generated total revenues of around $1.35 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 billion, but marginally (0.1%) slipped from the year-ago tally. The year-over-year decline mainly reflects the impact of dispositions of five hotels in 2017 and in early 2018.Notably, during the quarter, Host Hotels completed the acquisition of 301-room Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa for $1 billion.Quarter in DetailsDuring the reported quarter, comparable hotel revenues increased 1.5% year over year to nearly $1.3 billion. Comparable hotel revenue per available room or RevPAR (on a constant dollar basis) was up 1.7% year over year, driven by a 170 basis points (bps) expansion in occupancy, partly offset by a 0.6% decrease in average room rate. For domestic properties, comparable hotel RevPAR was up 1.6% while the same for International properties climbed 9.3%.For the first quarter, comparable hotel EBITDA increased 3.7%. Comparable hotel EBITDA margin improved 60 bps, reflecting improvement in operating efficiencies, higher ancillary revenues and a tax rebate at one property.Finally, the company exited first-quarter 2018 with around $323 million of unrestricted cash and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver part of its credit facility. In addition, as of Mar 31, 2018, total debt was $4.3 billion, having an average maturity of 4.8 years and an average interest rate of 3.9%. Notably, the company has no debt maturities until 2020.Host Hotels did not buy back any shares in 2018. It has $500 million of capacity available under its current repurchase program.Capital InvestmentsDuring the first quarter, the company expended around $115 million on capital expenditures — $29 million was return on investment (ROI) capital projects and $86 million for renewal and replacement projects.OutlookHost Hotels has raised its outlook for full-year 2018. The company now expects 2018 adjusted FFO per share in the range of $1.67-$1.73, denoting a 5 cents increase at the midpoint from the earlier guidance of $1.60-$1.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.67.The company’s full-year projection includes comparable hotel RevPAR (constant U.S. dollar basis) growth of 1.5-2.5%, reflecting growth of 50 bps at the midpoint. Moreover, the company continues to expect capital expenditures of $475-$550 million for the year.

Strategic capital-recycling program and a healthy balance sheet bode well for long-term growth. Opportunistic acquisitions in top-growth markets in the United States, including Maui and San Francisco, augur well for long-term growth. Nevertheless, supply growth, specifically in the company’s key markets, remains a concern. In addition to this, dilutive impact of asset sales cannot be bypassed.

18,AIV,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) — commonly known as Aimco — is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 7, after the market closes. While funds from operations (FFO) per share will likely increase on a year-over-year basis, revenues are expected to decline.In the last reported quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO.Results displayed growth in same-store property NOI and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and reported in-line numbers on the other two. Overall, the stock witnessed an average positive surprise of 0.82%. This is depicted in the chart below:Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteShares of Aimco have outperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have lost 7.4%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 8% over the last six months.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsPer the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marked a slow-leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in the first quarter. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Furthermore, Aimco has a diversified portfolio, both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to aid the company to meet the increase in demand for apartment properties from echo boomers — children of the baby-boomer generation — in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, Aimco has been making concerted efforts to revamp its portfolio through property sales and by reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact is likely to drag the company’s quarterly results.Further, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is a lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 60 cents. This indicates a 3.5% increase year over year. For the first quarter, management projects pro-forma FFO per share in the band of 57-61 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $243.7 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 1.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Aimco has the right combination of the two key ingredients —positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat in the first quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Aimco has an Earnings ESP of +0.24%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Aimco carries a Zacks Rank #3.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:HCP Inc.

19,AIV,"If solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for a robust revival of the apartment market fundamentals, then we should perhaps think twice.This is because the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market indeed moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking and rent growth slowing down. And there seems to be no respite from this choppy environment any time soon, with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too.Of course, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand. However, a whole lot of new supply is the ultimate culprit, fueling competition and curbing landlords’ pricing power.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth pace shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This not only marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017 but, in fact, denoted the slowest growth since third-quarter 2010. Notably, the market had achieved an annual price increase of 5.3% in the third quarter of 2015, which represented this economic cycle’s highest rent growth.Also, occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Although the overall occupancy level is still healthy, the deceleration suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up, and any robust upturn in occupancy seems elusive in the near term.This is quite obvious when so much of new supply is likely to come on course. According to the RealPage report, during the last half of 2017, across the nation’s 150 largest metros “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level. Further, through early 2019, “scheduled new supply” will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace.Admittedly, the performance of residential REITs in recent quarters has been affected by elevated supply of new units in the market. The anticipation of continued stress in the environment might impact landlords’ ability to command higher rents and fill up vacant spaces. So, pressure on new lease rates, occupancy as well as retention would persist, while concession activity to lure renters is expected to remain high.Now it’s time for investors to consider portfolio reshuffling and discard some stocks from the said sector, which are unlikely to bounce back in the near term. Among these are:AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), a residential REIT, which owned or held direct or indirect ownership stake in 288 apartment communities as of Dec 31, 2017. The company’s shares have underperformed its industry, in the past three months. During this time period, shares of the company have lost 4.8%, whereas the industry incurred a 2.8% loss. Additionally, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised 1.3% and 1.6% downward in two months’ time, reflecting bearish analyst sentiment.Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, has ownership stakes in 182 communities across 22 states and the District of Columbia. The company’s shares have declined 3.8% and underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 FFO per share have both been revised 0.8% downward in a month’s time.Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) — commonly referred as MAA — enjoyed ownership stake in 100,489 apartment units as of Dec 31, 2017. The company’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past three months, with a 4.1% decline. Moreover, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 FFO per share being revised 0.8% downward in the last month.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

20,AIV,"The lawsuit of Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — against Airbnb, which alleged that the short-term rental website has allowed tenants to violate their lease agreements through unauthorized subleases, has proceeded in the Florida court.Further, the court dismissed Airbnb’s premise which was supposedly protected by the Communications Decency Act. Per the act, online-service providers are protected from the responsibility for the content users’ actions.Aimco alleged that its high-end apartment communities’ tenants in Los Angeles complained about noisy Airbnb tourists and therefore more security staff had to be employed for property monitoring, tracing and expelling of unlawful Airbnb guests. Per the court, the company was right to claim compensation due to increased expenses because of enhanced security, damage caused to their properties and reduction in value of the properties. Further, the court allowed Aimco to put a perpetual ban if they succeed at the trial.Cindy Lempke, Aimco‘s spokesperson informed, “Aimco will vigorously pursue its remedies for Airbnb's illegal use of our properties that disrupts the residential living experience, tramples on private property rights, and reduces affordable housing options for middle class renters. We are confident that we will be successful in our efforts to stand up for working families who need housing and want to maintain a tranquil home life, free from the intrusions that are created by illegal short-term rentals.""Though this verdict by the court is favorable for Aimco, elevated apartment supply remains a concern for the company. Particularly, new supply is competing with some of Aimco’s higher rent properties. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is a concern because it curtails landlords’ ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption.In the past six months, shares of the company edged down 8.1% against the industry’s decline of 8.4%.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks from the REIT space include Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report), Extra Space Storage Inc.

21,AIV,"In the recently-issued operating update for the first quarter of 2018, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3–2.4% year over year.Notably, in the prior quarter, the company had reported 2.2% growth in total revenues for established communities. Results indicated increase in average rental rates and economic occupancy. Specifically, for fourth-quarter 2017, average rental rates were up 2.1% year over year, while economic occupancy inched up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.AvalonBay has high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country, which enable the company to generate steady rental revenues. In fact, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth, which is encouraging. Based on its strong fundamentals, we expect this uptrend to continue. Increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for AvalonBay.However, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the near term and this has emerged as a pressing concern for the residential REITs, including AvalonBay, Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Particularly, for AvalonBay, considering the regions, deliveries are projected to increase in both Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, supply continues to be most noticeable in the urban submarkets. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio might remain modest in the upcoming period. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Currently, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

22,AIV,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) – better known as Aimco – announced the acquisition of Bent Tree apartment community in Fairfax County, VA. In the first 12 months of ownership, this $160-million deal is likely to benefit the company's adjusted funds from operations per share by about a cent.Situated in suburban Fairfax County, the Bent Tree apartment community consists of 748-apartment homes. It is located beside two other communities owned by Aimco, having 1000-apartment homes. Bent Tree is a B-quality community with the average rent of approximately $1500 per unit. The acquisition is a strategic fit for the company, as with some capital investments, the units have the capability to generate higher than market rate revenue growth.The transaction is in line with Aimco’s strategy of revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.As this community is located a few minutes away from the Dulles International Airport and within traveling distance from downtown D.C., the residents are provided with opportune access to employment. In fact, onsite amenities and comfortable homes will likely hold significance for educated and high-income customers.Aimco plans to put up for sale the same value of communities that have the probability of lower rental growth and lower expected free cash flow internal rates of return (FCF IRR), in sync with its paired trade discipline. The company expects Bent Tree’s FCF IRR to surpass the FCF IRR of the properties that will be vended to support the acquisition by minimum 300 basis points.This acquisition was financed with bank borrowings awaiting the anticipated third-quarter sales to complete the paired trade funding.Shares of Aimco have lost 16.5% in the past six months, compared with the decline of 15.5% recorded by the industry it belongs to.  Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

23,AIV,"After reporting record prices in 2017, U.S. homebuilding has started 2018 on a high. U.S. homebuilding paced to a 15-month high in January, primarily due to a sharp rise in construction of apartments according to government data released last Friday. In fact, the rise was driven by a 19.7% surge in apartment construction.On the other hand, single-family homes started increased a meager 3.7% from December. The surge in homebuilding is being credited to strong economic fundamentals supported by impressive job data and higher wages. This in turn is also likely to quicken the pace of rate hikes, which could boost the rate spread for REITs from the sector.Shift Toward Multifamily Dwellings Historically, Americans have shown an inclination toward single-family homes. However, the scenario has witnessed a sea change post recession, with people opting for multifamily apartments in the absence of sufficient funds.The changing trend triggered a rise in construction of multifamily apartments, peaking on stepped up activity in the New York metropolitan area between 2010 and 2015, when the recovery was in its early stages. The increase continued in 2016, as other major metropolitan areas too witnessed a surge in activity.  Recovery Prompts Growth in Single Family HomesHowever, with the economy recovering, multifamily apartments started witnessing a decline. The downtrend was palpable in 2017, when multifamily apartment starts were lesser than 2016, per Dodge Data & Analytics.According to Robert A. Murray, chief economist for Dodge Data & Analytics, the scenario changed in 2017, as markets such as Los Angeles, Dallas-Ft. Worth, TX and Washington DC retreated from the levels posted during 2016. Going by national volumes, multifamily and commercial starts were worth $194.7 billion, down 7% from 2016. However, it was still 8% above the amount reported for 2015.Does this mean that demand for single-family homes has increased? Going just by prices, per National Association of Realtors (NAR), average cost of an existing single-family home in the fourth quarter was $247,800, up 5.3% from the prior-year quarter of $235,400. Moreover, November 2017 witnessed a 17.5% rise in sale of newly constructed single-family homes, the highest pace since July 2007.That said, demand for multifamily apartments may not have really gone down. According to National Multifamily Housing Council’s latest research report, demand for apartments in the United States is rising and country will witness an additional demand for 4.6 million apartments by 2030. If that is the scenario, U.S. homebuilders are well on track. Multifamily apartment starts may have witnessed a decline in 2017 from 2016, but it necessarily may not be because of a shift toward single-family homes.According to data released by the Commerce Department last Friday, total housing starts surged 9.7% in January to an annual rate of 1.3 million units. This is the highest level recorded since October 2016 and the largest increase in 13 months.It has been observed that multifamily housing is attracting real estate investors primarily because of demographic changes. An increasing number of both young and older Americans are going for rented apartments than buying homes. Moreover, monthly rental prices are not increasing much. Per real estate research firm Yardi Matrix, national average rent was $1361 in January 2018, 2.8% higher year over year but flat month over month. However, this is nothing compared with the 5.1% increase in monthly rent prices witnessed in 2014. This is perhaps because of an overall increase in apartment construction.Can Multifamiy REITs Recover in 2018?Of course, the fate of REITs related to the sector has been quite different. Long-term quantitative easing had compressed the rate spread, which this sector depends on to generate income. As a result, stocks such as Camden Property Trust (CPT  -  Free Report), Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. (AHH  -  Free Report), Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) are down 10.4%, 10%, -10.1% and 15% over the last three months. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The situation is likely to change radically in 2018. Three rate hikes are already scheduled for the current year. Further, the recent jump in yearly wage increases is likely to provide the much-needed thrust to sluggish inflation levels. This in turn could lead to a quickening in the pace of rate hikes, which could boost the rate spread of REITs. Given this backdrop, it is likely that they have a much better year ahead.Further, a booming economy is likely to boost rents and demand for apartments. This will also increase fund from operation levels that will offset higher interest costs and boost REIT prices.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

24,AIV,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, reported fourth-quarter 2017 pro forma funds from operations (FFO) of 63 cents per share in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure indicates a 5% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 60 cents.For full-year 2017, pro forma FFO per share came in at $2.45 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The bottom-line figure for full-year 2016 was $2.32 per share.Results display growth in property net operating income (NOI) supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.For the reported quarter, total revenues of $255.2 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $249.8 million. In addition, the reported figure came in 2.3% higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $249.5 million.For full-year 2017, total revenues came in at $1.01 billion, exceeding the prior-year figure by about 1%.  It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $988.6 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues increased 2.8% year over year to $148.4 million, while expenses increased 2.1% from the prior-year quarter to $40.4 million. Consequently, same-store net operating income (NOI) climbed 3.1% to $108 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 20 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.3%. Rental rates on new leases were down 0.8% whereas rental rates on renewal leases were up 4.5% from the expiring lease rates.As of Dec 31, 2017, Aimco held cash and restricted cash on hand of $95 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities came in at around $1.8 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $67 million and available capacity was $521 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $51 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenue per apartment home by 7% to $2,123. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home came in at 53%, 32% and 15% in fourth-quarter 2017 compared with 51%, 36% and 13%, respectively, recorded in the year-ago quarter. GuidanceFor full-year 2018, the company expects its pro forma FFO per share guidance in the range of $2.42-$2.52. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2.54. Notably, management has excluded legal costs relating to the case filed against Airbnb from this guidance because of the unpredictable nature of the costs.For first-quarter 2018, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance in the band of 57- 61 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 62 cents.The company projects same-store NOI growth to be in the range of 1.70-3.10% and revenue growth to be in the range of 2.10-3.10%. Further, management expects average daily occupancy to rise 10 bps from the figure of 96.3% recorded in 2017.DividendOn Jan 31, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the fourth quarter. This marks a 6% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on Feb 28 to stockholders of record as of Feb 16, 2018.Bottom LineAimco’s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions will likely drive long-term growth. In addition to this, the company has a solid portfolio diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to help meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently.However, stiff competition from new supply in various markets is expected to dampen Aimco’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. Additionally, interest rate hike and dilutive effect of sale of assets remain concerns.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteAimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Upcoming ReleasesWe now look forward to the fourth-quarter earnings releases of some other companies like EPR Properties (EPR  -  Free Report), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR  -  Free Report) and Outfront Media Inc.

25,AIV,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 83 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The figure also came in higher than 79 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Results mirror enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Moreover, total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $630.7 million, indicating 4.2% growth from the prior-year period. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $623.7 million.Per management, solid and steady rental demand across the company’s markets was supported by favorable demographics, low unemployment level and rising wages. However, 2018 is anticipated to witness high levels of new supply, leading to decreased pricing power as well as decelerating revenue growth.For full-year 2017, normalized FFO per share came in at $3.13, ahead of the prior-year tally of $3.09. This was backed by 1.9% year-over-year growth in total revenues to nearly $2.5 billion.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (includes 72,529 apartment units) were up 2.2% year over year to $590.4 million, while expenses climbed 2.5% year over year to $169.6 million. As a result, same-store NOI advanced 2.1% year over year to $420.7 million.The company experienced 2.0% growth in average rental rate to $2,709. Physical occupancy remained flat year over year at 96.0% for same-store portfolio.The company exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of around $50.6 million, up from $46.6 million recorded at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Equity Residential did not purchase any consolidated apartment properties. On the other hand, the company sold one consolidated apartment property in southern New Jersey (170 apartment units) for around $35.3 million. Further, the company completed Cascade — a 477-unit apartment development project — in Seattle for a total cost of about $176.4 million.OutlookFor first-quarter 2018, Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share in the range of 74-78 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 79 cents.For full-year 2018, the company projects normalized FFO per share in the $3.17-$3.27 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.25 lies within this range. The company’s full-year outlook is backed by same-store portfolio revenue growth of 1.0-2.25%, physical occupancy of 96.0% and NOI change of 0.0-1.5%. Also, expense is projected to flare up 3.5-4.5%.Dividend UpdateCurrently, Equity Residential expects to declare first quarter common share dividend of 54 cents per share. This reflects an annualized hike of 7.2% from the amount paid in 2017.Our ViewpointEquity Residential’s better-than-expected performance in the fourth quarter is impressive. The company is anticipated to benefit from its efforts to reposition the portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in the six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. However, elevated supply in a number of its markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates and result in high concessions. Furthermore, rate hike add to its woes.Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

26,AIV,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) — commonly known as Aimco — is slated to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 2, after the market closes. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, FFO of this residential real estate investment trust (REIT) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results displayed growth in property net operating income (NOI) supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. The company also benefited from reduced overhead costs. However, this positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.Nevertheless, Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate on two occasions and reported in-line numbers in the other two quarters. Overall, the stock witnessed an average positive surprise of 0.82%. This is depicted in the chart below:Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteShares of Aimco have underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have lost 9%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 8.7% over the last six months.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsPer a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. Admittedly, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of the fourth quarter, remaining stable year over year.Furthermore, Aimco has a diversified portfolio both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to aid the company to meet the increase in demand for apartment properties from echo boomers — children of the baby-boomer generation — in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, Aimco has been making concerted efforts to revamp its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact is likely to drag the company’s quarterly results.Further, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at 63 cents, over the past month. Nevertheless, this indicates a 5% increase year over year. For the fourth quarter, management projects pro forma FFO per share in the band of 60-64 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $249.8 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 0.12%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $988.7 million. The consensus estimate for FFO per is $2.45, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.6%. Further, management expects FFO per share in the range of $2.42-$2.46.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aimco will likely beat estimates this season.

27,AIV,"The lawsuit of Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — against Airbnb, which alleged that the short-term rental website has allowed tenants to violate their lease agreements through unauthorized subleases, has been dismissed by a California judge, according to a report from Bloomberg.This dismissal comes due to the Communications Decency Act which protects online-service providers from the responsibility for the content users post. In fact, per the ruling, ""Airbnb hosts, not Airbnb, are responsible for providing the actual listing information.""Notably, Aimco had alleged that its high-end apartment communities’ tenants in Los Angeles have complained about noisy Airbnb tourists and therefore more security staff had to be employed for property monitoring, trace and expel unlawful Airbnb guests. However, following the dismissal of the lawsuit, Aimco plans to consider all of its legal options in California, as it has disagreed with the reasoning and Communication Decency Act’s use.Nevertheless, Aimco has been making diligent efforts to revamp its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth. This is anticipated to drive long-term growth. Moreover, the company has a solid portfolio, which is diversified both in terms of geography and price point.However, stiff competition from new supply in various markets is expected to hinder Aimco’s rent growth and new lease-pricing ability. Also, interest-rate hikes and dilutive effects of sale of assets remain concerns.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

28,AIV,"Residential REIT Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — has been making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions. However, intense competition from new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability.Aimco reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter 2017, reflecting growth in property net operating income (NOI) supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. The company also benefited from reduced overhead costs. However, this positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.Notably, Aimco has a solid portfolio diversified in terms of geography and price point. Moreover, the rise in demand for apartment properties driven by ‘echo boomers’ — children of the baby boomer generation — keeps us positive on the stock. This age cohort, which mainly consists of people less than 35 years of age, prefers to stay on its own. Added to this, due to changing lifestyle, people, on an average, are settling later in life and thereby buying homes late, leading to a rising tendency of living in a rented home.Further, as renting is the only viable option for customers who cannot avail mortgage loans or are unwilling to buy a house at present, demand for Aimco’s premium properties will likely continue to shoot up in the coming quarters.Importantly, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth. Through these efforts, the company increased its revenue per apartment home by 6% to $2,075 in the third quarter. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio.Also, Aimco has been well on track to enhance its balance sheet and liquidity position, and bring down leverage. The company is aimed at boosting its financial flexibility by increasing the pool of unencumbered apartment assets.Nevertheless, even though apartment supply has not yet reached its peak level, the delivery numbers remained elevated in the recently-reported quarter. Particularly, new supply is competing with some of the company’s higher rent properties. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is a concern because it curtails landlords’ ability to command more rent and result in lesser absorption.In addition to the above, although Aimco’s effort to sell non-core assets and buy property in higher-growth infill areas is a strategic fit for the long term, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be avoided.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This authorization is valid through Sep 28, 2019.Following the quarter end, Liberty Property’s existing $800-million unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to mature in March 2018 was amended and restated with a new $900-million unsecured facility. The new facility matures in October 2021 and the company enjoys rights for an additional year of extension.OutlookLiberty Property raised its guidance and now projects full-year 2017 FFO per share in the range of $2.54-$2.57, against $2.49-$2.55 guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.52.Further, the company revised its 2017 industrial same-store NOI guidance range to 3-3.5% from the prior range of 2-3%.Our TakeThe better-than-expected performance of Liberty Property in third quarter is encouraging. The company’s premium quality industrial properties, situated in key locations, are likely to help it leverage on the increasing demand amid an e-commerce boom and supply-chain strategy transformations. It is poised for growth as fundamentals of the industrial real estate market remain robust, resulting in solid rent growth, enhanced occupancy and development opportunities. Liberty Property plans to fund investments in industrial assets through proceeds from dispositions of office properties. Nevertheless, adverse near-term impact on earnings from dispositions and rise in interest rates remain concerns.Currently, Liberty Property carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

33,AIV,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) — commonly known as Aimco — is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the market closes. While its funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to grow year over year, revenues might witness a decline.Last quarter, FFO of this residential real estate investment trust (REIT) surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results display growth in same-store property NOI and increased contribution from development, redevelopment and acquisition communities. Lesser general and administrative costs, lower interest expense and other expenses also contributed to higher funds from operations. However, this positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016, reduced earnings from exiting the Asset Management business and lower tax benefits.Nevertheless, Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion, reported in-line numbers in two and missed the mark in another. Overall, Aimco witnessed an average negative surprise of 0.03%. This is depicted in the chart below:Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteIn addition, year to date, shares of Aimco have underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares fell 3%, the industry recorded 3.4% growth during this time frame.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsPer a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. Nonetheless, the levels of rent growth moderated from the earlier years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy for the third quarter came in at 95.5% across the nation’s top 100 metros.Aimco has a solid portfolio — diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This will likely help the company meet the rise in demand for apartment properties from echo boomers — children of the baby-boomer generation — in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, Aimco has been making concerted efforts to revamp its portfolio through property sales, and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Though the assets sale might enable the company penetrate higher-growth in-fill areas over the long term, the earnings dilution impact from such a move cannot be bypassed in the short run. This is expected to affect the company’s earnings in the quarter to be reported.Further, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter.For third-quarter 2017, Aimco projects pro forma FFO per share in the band of 60-64 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 62 cents. This estimate remained unchanged over the past two months, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aimco will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Aimco is -1.41%.Zacks Rank: Aimco’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. (AHH  -  Free Report), slated to release third-quarter results on Oct 31, has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Independence Realty Trust, Inc. (IRT  -  Free Report), scheduled to report earnings on Oct 31, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +7.04%.Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (SRC  -  Free Report), set to report quarterly numbers on Nov 2, has an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and a Zacks Rank #3.Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

34,AIV,"The Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which clearly signal a December rate hike, might keep investors in the REIT space worried. The Fed’s anticipation that the factors leading to a slowdown in inflation will eventually subside further enhances the chances of a rate hike.However, it won’t be prudent to brood too much on a rate hike. Rather, the focus should be on the expected Q3 financial results of REITs based on the fundamentals of asset categories to which they cater to. Here, we will tell you why:Forget Fed MovesNo doubt, for REITs, which depend on debt for their business and pay high and consistent dividend, a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows. Therefore, asset valuation, including bond coupons and stock dividends, experiences a decline. But a rise in rates also lugs along scope for increasing future cash flows.In fact, any decision by the Fed to increase rate mirrors growth in the domestic economy and the central bank’s confidence in the recovery. When economic growth picks up and inflation rises, prices of real estate generally increase. Consequently, rent and occupancy of properties go up. As such, REIT’s earnings, cash flow and dividend get a boost.Focus on Underlying Asset StrengthsIn fact, with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery, a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017. Take for example the industrial asset category that has grabbed attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Also, the U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the country’s top 100 metros.Pick Stocks Poised to Beat in Q3However, not all REITs from these asset categories are poised to excel. Therefore, in addition to focusing on REITs that have healthy underlying asset category fundamentals, investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can be far more rewarding because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors’ confidence in a stock.Nevertheless, choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method. To make the task simple, we rely on the Zacks methodology, which takes into account a favorable rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP.Our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP, denotes the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that for stocks with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70%.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five REITs that have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat when they release third-quarter results:Prologis Inc.

36,AIV,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — reported second-quarter 2017 pro forma funds from operations (“FFO”) of 61 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure also represents a 3.4% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 59 cents.Results display growth in same-store property net operating income (NOI) and increased contribution from development, redevelopment and acquisition communities. Lesser general and administrative costs, lower interest expense and other expenses also contributed to higher funds from operations. However, the positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016, reduced earnings from exiting the Asset Management business and lower tax benefits.Total revenue of $249.1 million outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $241.37 million. In addition, the reported figure came in higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $251.2 million.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues increased 3.4% year over year to $145.9 million, while expenses edged down 0.3% year over year to $41.7 million.

Rental rates on renewals contracted 50 basis points (bps) from the expiring lease rates compared to the previous quarter.

Furthermore, the company has been revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and greater-than-expected growth.  Its efforts to reduce costs resulted in significant growth in Same Store NOI.Other than improvement in Same Store NOI, Aimco’s new construction and redevelopment activities also contributed to its bottom line.However, of late, Aimco has been witnessing sluggish rent growth in certain locations due to competition from new supply. The company’s elaborate construction project plans, along with planned capital replacement spending, remain key concerns. Moreover, even if the divestitures and its exit from the Asset Management business pay off in the long run, the company’s near-term adverse effects on earnings cannot be bypassed.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Portfolio occupancy of 98.5% as of Jun 30, 2017 expanded 20 basis points (bps) sequentially and 50 bps year over year.Further, the company had 76 properties available for lease, out of a total of 5,028 properties in the portfolio as of Jun 30, 2017, compared with 83 properties as of Mar 31, 2017. Moreover, during the reported quarter, the company re-leased 53 properties to existing and new tenants, recapturing 113.2% of the expiring rent.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Realty Income invested $321.2 million in 73 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 27 states. The assets are fully leased, with a weighted average lease term of around 13 years and an initial average cash lease yield of 6.6%.

The figure was higher than 76 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Results reflected enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI.

41,AIV,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) – commonly known as Aimco – is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, after the market closes. While its funds from operations (“FFO”) per share are expected to grow year over year, revenues might see a decline.Last quarter, this residential real estate investment trust (“REIT”) delivered an in-line performance. Results reflected conventional same-store property net operating (NOI) growth, higher contribution from development, redevelopment and acquisition activities, along with higher renewals rate from expiring lease rates. However, the positive was partially offset by the loss of income from apartment sales in 2016.However, Aimco has a mixed earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion, reported in-line numbers in two and missed the mark in another. Overall, Aimco delivered an average positive surprise of 0.43%. This is depicted in the chart below:Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise Apartment Investment and Management Company Price and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteIn addition, year to date, shares of Aimco have underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares fell 2.7%, the industry gained 5.1% over this period.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsAimco has a solid portfolio diversified both in terms of geography and high priced units. The company has been revamping its portfolio through property sales and re-investing the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth. This is likely to enhance the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio in the quarter to be reported.Also, the company is well on track to strengthen its balance sheet and liquidity position, as well as improve its leverage. Aimco is aimed at boosting its financial flexibility by increasing the pool of unencumbered apartment assets.However, there is a slowdown in rent growth of Aimco in certain locations due to competition from new supply. In fact, in many markets new lease rent increases have either slowed or turned negative. As such, in the second quarter, this new supply is expected to put pressure on new lease pricing, particularly at the high price point units.Moreover, even though it is a strategic fit on part of the company to sell non-core assets and buy property in higher-growth in-fill areas, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed.For second-quarter 2017, Aimco projects pro forma FFO per share in the band of 56–60 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 60 cents. This estimate remained unchanged over the past 60 days, reflecting lack of any solid catalyst.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aimco will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of 59 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 60 cents, is -1.67%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: Aimco’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report), expected to release earnings on Jul 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #2.Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report), likely to release second-quarter results on Aug 3, has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #2.

42,AIV,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) — better known as Aimco — is well positioned to benefit from its portfolio repositioning and diversification. However, weak rent growth and lower lease pricing ability due to stiff competition might curb its profitability.A mixed trend in estimate revisions for this year and the next have resulted a in Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.Looking at its price performance, the stock has lost 4% since the beginning of the year versus the Zacks categorized REIT and Equity Trust - Residential industry’s 4% gain.       Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Recently, the company shelled out $451.5 million for the complete ownership of three Palazzo communities. This transaction is anticipated to improve the average age of portfolio holdings, internal rate of return and average monthly revenues per apartment home.The company’s balance sheet and liquidity position should keep supporting this move.Moreover, Aimco has a solid portfolio — diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This should help the company meet the rise in demand for apartment properties from ‘echo boomers’ — children of the baby boomer generation.Further, as renting is the only viable option for customers who cannot afford mortgage loans due to high mortgage rates or are unwilling to buy a house at present, demand for Aimco’s premium properties are expected to rise in the coming quarters.This diversification cushions the company’s performance despite new supply in various markets.However, stiff competition from new supply in various markets — particularly in Los Angeles and Denver — will keep dampening Aimco’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. In addition, rising interest rates and dilution of earnings due to asset disposal remain major concerns for the company.Aimco is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, after the market closes. The company projects pro forma funds from operation (“FFO”) per share in the band of 56–60 cents for the to-be-reported quarter.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Residential REIT space are Select Income REIT, (SIR  -  Free Report), Equity LifeStyle Properties, Inc.
