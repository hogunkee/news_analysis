0,WU,"Western Union (WU) disputed news reports that it was in the early stages of merger talks with fellow money-transfer company MoneyGram International (MGI), reports that had sent shares soaring.Citing sources, Bloomberg first reported the story late Tuesday, stating that the talks were in their early stages and could stumble on regulators' approval. The news sent MoneyGram shares skyward, but Western Union later threw cold water on the rumors.""Although our policy is not to comment on market rumors or speculation, and that continues to be our policy on a going forward basis, in view of the high level of market activity in our stock today, Western Union states that current news reports indicating that our company is in discussions to acquire MoneyGram International, Inc. are not accurate,"" the company said in a statement.MoneyGram stock jumped 24% to 9.65 on the stock market today, trading above its 50-day moving average, but later dropped to a 14% gain.

""We're at risk, and the situation is getting worse."" He was testifying before the House Armed Services Committee at a hearing on the subject of defense and technological change.The Chinese were paying attention to U.S. military dominance in the early 1990s after we won the arms race and the Cold War, he said. And they watched and analyzed our ability to project overwhelming power in Desert Storm after Iraq invaded Kuwait. ""No one observed more carefully the dominance we demonstrated in 1991 than the Chinese,"" Kendall observed.China quickly went to work on its own power projection capabilities and what is called asymmetrical warfare, the ability to disrupt an enemy's war plans without necessarily matching them tank for tank or ship for ship. Kendall says he became ""alarmed as soon as I started seeing technical intelligence reports on China's modernization programs.""What I'm seeing,"" he went on, ""is foreign modernization, again particularly China's, in a suite of capabilities that are intended, clearly to me at least, to defeat the American way of doing power projection, (the) American way of warfare when we fight in an expeditionary manner far from the United States.""Among China's advanced weapons systems are: Anti-satellite weapons: China has two ground-based anti-satellite weapon systems, advanced ground-based anti-satellite laser systems ""and is developing dual-use co-orbital satellites that can monitor or attack U.S. satellites,"" says Rick Fisher, a China military affairs expert at the International Assessment and Strategy Center. Anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM): The first cruise missile is the YJ-12, which travels at three times the speed of sound and is designed to be launched from Chinese aircraft at ranges up to 300 kilometers. The second is a subsonic ASCM called the YJ-100 with a range of 800 kilometers.""Such capabilities imply that, at least for the near future, U.S. forces may be 'outgunned' by China's emerging ASCM inventory,"" says Lyle J. Goldstein, an associate professor of Chinese maritime studies at the U.S. Naval War College. Hypersonic glide vehicles: China has been testing a hypersonic glide vehicle known as the WU-14. It was designed to evade our missile and other defense systems, such as the Aegis sea-based missile defense guarding our Pacific fleet and carrier battle groups.""The beauty of the HGV (hypersonic-glide vehicle) is that it can perform hypersonic precision strikes while maintaining a relatively low altitude and flat trajectory, making it far less vulnerable to missile defenses,"" says Fisher. Carrier-killer ballistic missiles: The DF-21D, a road-mobile anti-ship ballistic missile, is designed to target and track aircraft carrier groups with the help of satellites, unmanned aircraft and over-the-horizon radar. Launched into space, the DF-21D re-enters the atmosphere and maneuvers at 10 times the speed of sound toward its target. Stealth fighters: China is currently developing two stealth fighters. The first is the J-20, described in a report from the Jamestown Foundation as ""a high-performance stealth aircraft, arguably capable of competing . . . with the U.S. F-22A Raptor and superior in most, if not all, cardinal performance parameters against the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.""The second is the JF-31, which Chinese officials boast can ""take down"" the F-35 and may have been developed with stolen F-35 plans.China is once again embarked on a ""Long March,"" this time a military one, and with a determination that this century will not be an American one.

73,WU,"Military Superiority: China's new Shenyang J-31 stealth fighter could be the equal of our F-22s and F-35s, U.S. pilots say, and is just one of the weapons that may thwart America's ""pivot"" to the Pacific.The J-31, a fifth-generation stealth fighter, will make its official debut at the Zhuhai International Air Show Nov. 11-16 in southern China's Guangdong province. As one U.S. pilot with F-35 experience told USNI News of the J-31 and other new Chinese fighters: ""I think they'll eventually be on par with our fifth-gen jets — as they should be, because industrial espionage is alive and well.""According to the USNI report, it's believed the J-31 was developed using the Pentagon's nearly $400 billion Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.In June 2011, Chinese hackers staged a cyberassault on Lockheed and other defense contractors, one of an ongoing series of attacks seeking to steal U.S. defense technology.The J-31 is about the same size as the F-35 but appears to have sacrificed some payload capability in favor of improved fuel efficiency and speed.Like the F-35, the J-31 is designed to fly off the decks of carriers, making these two planes the world's only carrier-based stealth fighters.The J-31 will join the J-20 stealth fighter in the Chinese air force inventory, another plane based on stolen U.S. technology. In 1999 an American stealth F-117 Nighthawk bomber was shot down in Serbia, and the wreckage reportedly was passed along to the Chinese. A decade later, the J-20 fighter, a spitting image of our F-22 Raptor, took to the air, threatening to alter the balance of power in the western Pacific.The J-20 took its first test flights in 2011 and is now in its fourth round of prototypes. A report issued by the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said that based on available information, the Chinese stealth fighter will be ""a high-performance stealth aircraft, arguably capable of competing . . . with the U.S. F-22A Raptor and superior in most, if not all, cardinal performance parameters against the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.""As Bill Gertz reports in the Washington Free Beacon: ""The F-35 data theft was confirmed after recent photographs were published on Chinese websites showing a newer version of the J-20. The new version of the radar-evading aircraft had incorporated several design upgrades since the first demonstrator aircraft was unveiled in 2011.""Into the mix enters the new flagship of the Chinese navy, the newly named aircraft carrier Liaoning.Refitted from a ship bought from Ukraine, the ex-Soviet Varyag will have a limited role, mostly for training and testing ahead of the possible launch of China's first domestically built carriers, the floating air bases for the J-31, after 2015.China's burgeoning blue-water Navy includes six nuclear attack submarines to go along with 53 diesel powered subs. Last December, a Chinese attack sub sailed through the Strait of Malacca, then disappeared, resurfacing near Sri Lanka and in the Persian Gulf.Another of China's new weapons is the Dong Feng-21D missile, intended to give China ""the capability to attack large ships, particularly aircraft carriers, in the western Pacific,"" the Pentagon's 2012 China report said.The Chinese have also been testing a hypersonic glide vehicle, the WU-14, designed to evade U.S. missile and other defense systems, such as the Aegis sea-based missile shield guarding our Pacific fleet and carrier battle groups.All of which is why Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, chief of U.S. Pacific Command, said at the annual Surface Navy Association conference in Virginia in January: ""Our historic dominance that most of us in this room have enjoyed is diminishing, no question.""We'd better put a rush on that ""pivot,"" Mr. President.

75,WU,"Competitiveness: Wasn't it just two weeks ago we heard that China had raced ahead of the U.S. as the world's No. 1 economy? Don't look now, but the most recent data show the Chinese economy is slowing down — fast.China's government reported that its economy grew at a 7.3% annual rate in the third quarter, its slowest pace in five years.Growth of 7.3% might seem strong, but remember: Because of China's massive investments in infrastructure, housing and factories, growth of 5% or so is considered recession-level.China's official growth target this year is 7.5%, after expanding at 7.7% in 2012 and 2013, 9.3% in 2011 and 10.5% in 2010. If China fails to reach its growth target in 2014, it would be the slowest growth since 1991 — the troubled year after the Tiananmen Square massacre.Moreover, the current slowdown is far more profound than most people believe.The Conference Board, a business think tank known for level-headed analysis, this week forecast that China's growth rate could decelerate even more — from nearly 11% four years ago to 4% starting in 2020.And economist Harry Wu, in a separate Conference Board report, has estimated that China's economy is as much as 36% smaller than its government maintains.The reasons why aren't complex. China has overinvested in infrastructure and property, and now, according to Standard & Poor's, has a massively unserviceable $14.2 trillion in corporate debt.The country has modern ""ghost towns"" with no inhabitants and debt-heavy ""zombie corporations"" that produce nothing. In short, it's a bubble economy.Meanwhile, recent World Bank and U.S. projections show that, after 35 years of Deng Xiaoping's one-child policy, China's population will peak at 1.394 billion people in 2026, then start to fall. Economies with shrinking populations typically don't grow much.Then there's the widely reported matter of China passing the U.S. in economic size.Not only has China not passed the U.S. economically, as recently claimed, it might never do so. Official data show real dollar-based GDP in the U.S. at $15.9 trillion vs. China's $7.5 trillion.More worrisome from China's standpoint: U.S. per capita GDP of $50,249 per year is more than nine times bigger than China's per-capita income of $5,567.So why was it reported that China had passed the U.S.? Using global data adjusted for ""purchasing power parity"" — basically, cost of living — China looks bigger.But those figures depend on highly questionable data for inflation and exports, not to mention the assumption that you can buy in China what you can in the U.S. The data are not remotely comparable, as anyone who has ever traveled to the interior of China will tell you.In short, China's boom is over, and the U.S. has a far bigger economy, despite reports. Truth is, China is on the verge of an epic economic slowdown that will be the greatest test of the nation's people and its Communist rulers since the Cultural Revolution.

Western also trails Navient (NAVI) (4.9%), Yintech Investment (YIN) (4.8%) and H&R Block (HRB) (4.2%).So why does Western Union earn a spot within IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, which on Friday featured 16 stocks?Share price is a key factor. The better-performing stocks tend to trade at least 10 a share. For that reason, Liberty Tax and Yintech don't make the cut. Navient trades just 13.14 a share; Western Union trades near 20.33 a share and trades just 11% below a multiyear peak of 22.84.Earnings stability is another key factor. Here, Western Union is superior.The Englewood, Colo., firm shows a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 2 on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (highly volatile). Stable earnings support ongoing dividend payments. On March 30 and June 29 this year, Western Union paid a dividend of 19 cents a share. That's up 19% from the 16 cents it paid each quarter in 2016.H&R Block gets a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 26 from William O'Neil + Co.

80,WU,"GDP Fraud: Countries ruled by an authoritarian regime often cheat on their official GDP data, a new study shows. No surprise, really. But how do we know this? Well, it's all about the light.What do we mean? A new working paper by Luis R. Martinez of the University of Chicago with the amusing title ""How Much Should We Trust the Dictator's GDP Estimates?"" explores the unusual, but direct, link between the amount of light produced by an economy — as captured and measured through nighttime satellite photographs — and its GDP.The surprising result: Martinez concludes that economies in authoritarian countries such as China and Russia are not as large as official estimates show. In fact, they're way below what they report.""Based on the autocracy gradient,"" Martinez writes, ""I estimate that yearly GDP growth rates are inflated by a factor of between 1.15 and 1.3 in the most authoritarian regimes. Correcting for manipulation substantially changes our understanding of comparative economic performance at the turn of the 21st century.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTake China, as the most outstanding example.For years, it officially reported 10%-plus GDP growth each year, with that number declining only in recent years to just above 6%. That growth rate was enough, according to various reports, to make it the world's No. 1 economy when figured on a purchasing power of parity basis (PPP) — that is, what a dollar buys in China vs. what a dollar buys in the U.S.And, several forecasts say it will challenge the U.S. for the No. 1 spot in the official, non-PPP GDP data, perhaps as soon as the next decade.But is China really that big?If Martinez is right, no. China's average GDP growth has been roughly 30% less than reported, based on the measures of its changes in national lighting. This would be an enormous shift in how we view China's economy.(The same, by the way, is true for Russia. Its economy, similarly, is much smaller than official estimates show. But its economy also has been struggling for nearly 20 years, so the idea that it may be even worse than it seems comes as no great shock.)This year, World Bank and U.S. government estimates put U.S. GDP at roughly $17.7 trillion (in 2010$). By the same measure, China's GDP this year will be about $10.8 trillion.That's far short of the U.S. level, but taken at face value, it's still an amazing number given that as recently as 1980, China's GDP for its entire economy was just $340 billion. That's about a 3,200% gain.But Martinez cuts China's GDP to roughly $7.5 trillion currently. That's not even half the U.S. level.As for real GDP per person, which many economists consider the best indicator of a nation's productivity and economic well-being, in the U.S. it will average a record $53,839 this year, based on current estimates.China's citizens, based on Martinez' revised numbers, will produce about $5,440 each in economic output. That's a huge gain from 1980, when annual output was around $349 per person. But again, even today, it's barely at 10% of U.S. output.So, sorry, those who think China's economy is now as big as the U.S.' are mistaken.That's not just based on Martinez' study. A host of others have made similar findings.Washington Post blogger Christopher Ingraham, who first brought the Martinez study to our attention, notes that ""research published in 2012 by economists from Brown University and the National Bureau of Economic Research showed how changes in nighttime lighting closely tracked with economic activity.And, as we noted in earlier, China's total debt, now exceeding 250% of GDP, dwarfs the U.S. debt at about 100% of our GDP. Any downturn in growth could precipitate a debt crisis. So the country has every incentive to lie, just as operators of a Ponzi scheme do.Former IMF deputy director and current fellow at the American Enterprise Institute Desmond Lachman last year called China's growing debt ""a credit bubble of epic proportions.That's not all. As we noted on these pages back in 2016, economist Harry Wu, working for the Conference Board and using a different technique than Martinez, comes up with China's economy as much as 36% smaller than its official data show. So it's consistent.According to U.S. Census estimates, China's population is set to begin shrinking as soon as 2026, dragging economic growth rates down. So maybe the 21st century won't be dubbed the ""China Century"" after all.But dwelling on China is perhaps unfair, since Martinez' study isn't just about China. It's about authoritarian regimes in general, and how they misreport their economic data in order to appear more successful and stable than they really are.Indeed, he measures a large number of countries ranked by Freedom House for economic and political freedom.His findings were consistent: Autocratic regimes cheated more on their economic growth data than freer regimes.""I find that a 10% increase in nighttime lights is associated with a 2.4% increase in GDP in the most democratic countries and with a 3.4% increase in GDP in the most authoritarian ones,"" Martinez wrote.That means, all other things being equal, authoritarian countries are grossly overestimating their economic growth, largely to silence potential critics and to maintain their hold on power.Martinez found that the distortions in economic growth estimates become particularly pronounced during election cycles, even in nations where the elections are rigged.Once again a study shows why socialist, communist and other authoritarian and totalitarian economies don't thrive, and can't. Modern, efficient economies depend on actionable information to function. If you have to lie even to your own citizens, your economy can never be as good as you say it is.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:China Grew 6.7% Three Quarters In A Row?

81,WU,"When Forbes recently reprinted its first list of the richest Americans, for its 100th Anniversary Issue, Jacob Schiff's name stood out as one that seems to be forgotten.That list for 1918, headed by John D. Rockefeller, consisted of well-known captains of industry or their heirs. Schiff was tied for 23rd with a net worth of $50 million (equivalent to $875 million today), alongside tobacco tycoon James Duke, photography pioneer George Eastman, Sears & Roebuck founder Julius Rosenwald, and Pierre S. Du Pont, who created the chemicals empire.Schiff was one of Wall Street's leading investment bankers from 1880 to 1920, with his Kuhn, Loeb & Co. enabling railroads to reach every corner of the continent, helping insurance companies grow, and lending Japan the money it needed to defeat Russia in their 1904-05 war (his revenge for the czar's pogroms against the Jews).""Many Jews were forced to flee Russia, and Schiff, an immigrant from Germany, helped encourage these and other immigrants to be proud of their heritage and fight bigotry and hatred,"" Jeffrey Podoshen, associate professor of marketing at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., told IBD. ""He was instrumental in instilling the beliefs that they had to depend on themselves and their own hard work to achieve success in the face of perpetual propaganda from racists and anti-Semites. Schiff was confident, bold, unapologetic, and very successful.""Schiff (1847-1920) was born in Frankfurt into a distinguished family that traced its lineage in the city back five centuries. His father was a broker for the Rothschilds and at 14 Schiff began working as an apprentice at a mercantile house and then a bank.At the end of the American Civil War in 1865, Schiff, 18, decided the United States would provide greater opportunity and boarded a ship for New York City. After a few months of unemployment, he was hired as a clerk at a brokerage and within two years formed a partnership, Budge, Schiff & Co. In 1874, Abraham Kuhn of Kuhn, Loeb invited him to join the investment bank and Schiff contributed his valuable European connections. The following year, he married Theresa Loeb, daughter of co-founder Solomon, and they would have a son and daughter.""The partners had prospered in wholesale clothing in Cincinnati and during the Civil War because of the Union's demand for army blankets,"" wrote Naomi Cohen in ""Jacob H. Schiff: A Study in American Jewish Leadership."" ""In 1867, they established Kuhn, Loeb & Co. in New York, a banking firm that dealt primarily in government bonds. Jewish investment bankers ... created opportunities for Jews who, because of their Jewishness, were barred from gentile firms, collectively providing a base for cooperation in new investments. … Their kinship network that spanned two continents played a pivotal role in their achievements.""By 1875, the other partners were following Schiff's lead in aggressively pursuing new business, in contrast to the prior attitude that the respectable thing to do was to wait for proposals. Well before Schiff was made head of the firm in 1885, he was seen as the strategist and spokesman for Kuhn, Loeb and would remain so for over four decades.""The older members of the firm recognized his financial genius ... and Kuhn, Loeb became one of the two most influential private international banking houses in the Western Hemisphere,"" wrote Cyrus Adler in ""Jacob Henry Schiff: A Biographical Sketch."" ""It was characteristic of him as a banker that his activities were all creative, looking to the development of the resources and the extension of the commerce of the United States, particularly concerned in the financing of railway enterprises. … He was swift to recognize the genius of Edward H. Harriman, and the Harriman-Schiff railway combination became the most powerful, the most aggressive, and the most successful that America had ever known.""Kuhn, Loeb financed many railways, including providing the Pennsylvania Railroad with $500 million over a quarter century. By the mid-1880s, Schiff had a strong relationship with railroad baron James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad, giving Schiff a seat on the board, while Hill sent his son to be trained by the banker. But the economic panic of 1893 exposed corruption and inefficiencies in many railroads, and Schiff pressured Hill to consolidate Great Northern with his troubled client, Northern Pacific. Hill refused and turned to J.P. Morgan to fund his ambitions.""Schiff formed a reorganization committee for another client in debt, Union Pacific (UNP), that included the National City Bank and Rockefeller money, but he assumed the all-consuming task of hands-on manager,"" wrote Cohen. ""A partner observed, 'He could conceive financial transactions of gigantic lines, but at the same time no business detail escaped his attention.' ""But a year later, Schiff heard that Harriman was trying to block the reorganization in order to add the Union Pacific to his own railroad empire. They struck an agreement that would give Harriman a position on the executive board and Kuhn, Loeb would have access to his credit reserves. In 1897, Schiff convinced the U.S. government to provide $87 million to allow his investment group to take full possession of the line, which prospered.In 1900, Schiff tried to acquire the Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Railroad for Union Pacific and went up against Hill and Morgan, who wanted to add it to Northern Pacific, which they now owned. Northern Pacific won the bid, but Schiff and Harriman began buying its stock, and on May 9, 1901, the price of a share shot up to $1,000 before the two sides brokered a truce and the price fell back to $150. The agreement gave board seats to the non-owners and promised to minimize competition between the lines, but this later had to be modified under the new antitrust laws.Kuhn, Loeb was now in control of 22,000 miles of railway and held stock worth $321 million (equal to $9.3 billion now), while Schiff was regarded as second only to Morgan in the investment banking world.Kuhn, Loeb financed many other companies in a variety of industries, including Equitable Life Assurance Society, Western Union (WU), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Westinghouse Electric Co.But Schiff's most high-profile loans were to Japan, starting in 1904, when it faced a much stronger Russia and needed to purchase munitions. Eventually, Kuhn, Loeb floated $200 million (worth $5.6 billion today), half its entire war needs. Schiff had also done everything he could over the decades to hinder Russia's ability to get the backing of Wall Street, because of that nation's persecution of Jews. During World War I, Schiff arranged funding for the Allies, as long as none of the money went to Russia.Schiff was as well-known for his philanthropy as for his business success, giving to every kind of Jewish charity and school, but also to benefit the general public, ranging from the Boy Scouts to the National Geographic Society and Red Cross.Newspapers around the world reported his death in 1920 and he was declared ""the greatest Jewish leader of the age.""Kuhn, Loeb was merged with Lehman Bros. in 1977 and the combined firm was acquired in 1984 by American Express (AXP), forming Shearson Lehman/American Express. Kuhn Loeb was spun off in 1994 as Lehman Bros. Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008 (an event that may have helped trigger that year's global financial crisis).""I began studying the history of Wall Street when I worked there and came across Jacob Schiff's story,"" said Michael Driskoll, clinical professor at the Willumstad School of Business at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y. ""Going up against some of the white-shoe firms, he had to be bare-knuckled at times to succeed in a world where racism was rampant, conspiracy theories were rife that Jews ruled the world, and foreigners were under suspicion. Schiff was able to gain respect beyond his own group by advocating assimilation for immigrants, socializing with a wide variety of people, sharing risks with anyone who had the same values and vision, and giving to causes that benefited society at large. There are lessons for those who have to climb the professional ladder without certain advantages.""Leading Jewish banker and philanthropist on Wall Street in the late 19th and early 20th century.Overcame: Anti-Semitism on Wall Street.Lesson: Produce results no one can deny by focusing on getting the details right.""We are only the temporary custodians of our fortunes, and let us be careful that no just complaint can be made against our stewardship.""

82,WU,"""Blockchain, blockchain, blockchain. Blockchain? Blockchain, blokchain, blokchin bokchn, bkcn, bk-bk, ch."" — That was conversation, basically, in parts of the world in 2017, when an iced-tea company rebranded as a blockchain company, grandparents talked up Bitcoin, and CryptoKitties pollinated the digital landscape.X Since the new year began, Eastman Kodak (KODK), Moviepass parent Helios and Matheson (HMNY) and Chanticleer Holdings (BURG), which operates Hooters and burger restaurants, have joined or may join Long Blockchain (LBCC) and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) on the bandwagon. Autonomous Research thinks we'll see at least 100 ""blockchain pretenders"" this year. While the current frenzy might obscure blockchain's actual potential, most people agree that the record-keeping technology behind Bitcoin that allows anyone involved in a transaction to see it and agree on it before clearing it is sound enough to outlast today's crypto-hellride. But if 2017 was a year of talk about blockchain, 2018 might be a year of more action, with a possible focus on trading, payments and architecture. ""I think in 2018 you're going to see a lot of these new projects that have been promoting themselves and raising money (in 2017), many of them are going to see their first real releases of software, official releases of their platform, happening in 2018,"" said Matthew Spoke, CEO of blockchain startup Nuco Networks.On Tuesday, IBM and the world's largest container shipping company, A.P. Moller-Maersk, said they are forming a joint venture up to provide a new platform for conducting global trade using blockchain technology.Analysts have long said blockchain has the ability to make trading in stocks and other securities quicker, cheaper and more transparent, and 2018 will offer more of a look into whether investors actually want to trade on a distributed-ledger platform.  Online retailer Overstock (OSTK), which is rapidly morphing into a blockchain company, has opened up a blockchain-based trading system it majority-owns, tZero, to more investors. TZero, along with Siebert Financial (SIEB) and Overstock, have said they intended to partner to ""offer deeply discounted online trading"" in the first quarter of 2018 — charging $2.99 per trade and, eventually, $1.99 for members of a new, ""elite"" segment of its Club O rewards program. The company also hopes to make it a bigger alternative trading system for tokens and initial coin offerings. And the tZero platform can settle trades on the same day, potentially offering brokers a way to shorten the time between when an investor's order is executed and when money and securities are actually exchanged. While investors will still be able to make trades in milliseconds, brokers could lower their risk of seeing a trading counterparty defaulting. Today, the SEC requires that trades must be settled within two days.For now, the platform is largely being used as an outlet for short-selling. In particular, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne hopes the platform's blockchain technology will address what he has long considered abusive short-selling practices by prime brokerages — particularly surrounding rules for locating shares that short-sellers borrow to make trades. Byrne, a vocal Bitcoin and blockchain evangelist, said in November that he intended to use tZero to go after a huge chunk of Goldman Sachs' (GS) revenue. ""Arguably,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said, ""they're disrupting or working to disrupt three things — one being short-selling, two being settlement, three being issuance, if you think about what they're doing with their initial coin offering.""  In November, Byrne said the platform had $80 billion to $120 billion worth of lendable securities.Meanwhile, Nuco is working with the TMX Group, the parent of the Toronto Stock Exchange, to build a blockchain platform for the NGX natural gas exchange, which is owned by TMX, said Nuco's Spoke.IBD'S TAKE: It is crucial for investors to understand the difference between cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, and the blockchain software programs that enable them. It is also important to get a feel for just how speculative digital monies like Bitcoin are right now before investing directly in the currencies or through related exchange traded funds or stocks.James Wester, research director for worldwide payment strategies at IDC, said he'll continue to keep his eye on blockchain's potential to make remittances — or money people living outside their home country send back to it — less expensive and more efficient this year.More than $400 billion in remittances were transferred around the world in 2016, with transaction fees hovering around 7%. An array of blockchain remittance startups — such as Abra, TransferWise and Circle, a company backed by Goldman Sachs — are working to cut the cost of transaction fees — and render wire transfers and Western Union (WU) irrelevant.""It also looks like a use case that could be on the point of really taking off in ways that I don't think other use cases are,"" Wester said.The incumbents in the space have taken notice. On Thursday, MoneyGram (MGI) said it will test the crytocurrency Ripple to transfer funds.To be sure, crypto transactions carry their own fees, and scaling up can be an issue. But some cross-border remittance fees are high, and companies can also use the underlying blockchain technology for transfers rather than a certain digital coin.But Wester also notes much of the technology that exists, at least within payments, already works pretty well.""Not to poke fun at anybody, but when the biggest news of 2017 is CryptoKitties trading on top of Ethereum,"" Spoke said, referring to a game where people breed digital cats, ""we have a long way to go before this really starts to change the fundamental infrastructure of the world.""Other things to watch for next year? Actually getting all the world's private blockchain networks to operate with some degree of coherence.A project by Toronto-based Nuco, called Aion, aims to develop a platform that enables the scores of blockchain networks with different protocols — public, private, region- or industry specific — to connect to one another.""Let's say I write a transaction on blockchain A, but I want that transaction's logic to be triggered autonomously as the result of a transaction on blockchain B. You can't do that autonomously today,"" Spoke said. ""You need somebody to kind of sit in the middle of that process.""The coming year may be a white-knuckle ride for blockchain believers as more comparisons are drawn to the dotcom bubble 20 years ago.But here's some perspective: the valuation of the dotcoms reached into the trillions before imploding, while the value of the entire crypto space, for now, is still about three to five times smaller, said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research.He added that 84% of dotcom IPOs vanished after 10 years. But the ones that survived, like Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), ended up dominating entire industries, he said.""So most projects here will fail, but that is the required creative destruction to get to the next stage of the economy,"" Sokolin said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWarren Buffett Is Bearish On Cryptocurrencies But Stops Short Of ThisMore Than Bitcoin: Blockchain's Links Reach JPMorgan, IBM, Walmart

83,WU,"China's government has unveiled a five-year plan for building up a domestic optical components industry, a move that could spell trouble for U.S. suppliers such as Oclaro (OCLR), Acacia Communications (ACIA), Lumentum Holding (LITE), Finisar (FNSR), and NeoPhotonics (NPTN).X China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology unveiled the five-year optical technology roadmap. China has optical component makers, but they have generally produce lower-speed devices that lag U.S. companies by a product generation.China's efforts to develop a domestic optical industry aims to support network gear makers such as Huawei and ZTE, Jefferies analyst Rex Wu said in a note to clients.""The government aims to have two to three Chinese optics companies in global top 10 in 2020, and one company in global top 3 in 2022,"" Wu said in the report. ""The market share of Chinese optics companies will reach over 30% worldwide in 2022,"" according to the government's plan, he added.Investors reacted negatively at first but recanted later. Acacia inched up 0.1% to close at 38.59 on the stock market today. Lumentum gained 1.5% to close at 51.75. Finisar climbed 1.3% to 21.79. Oclaro ticked up 2 cents to 7.23. NeoPhotonics traded up 1.7% to 7.01.China has been building up its semiconductor industry under similar five-year plans. While China makes wireless and memory chips, it still lags in high-end processors.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.NeoPhotonics, Oclaro, Acacia, Lumentum, and Finisar sell the most optical components to China, says a UBS report. Shares in optical parts makers took a hit in 2017 as demand weakened from China's telecom service providers. Analysts have been expecting a rebound in 2018 spurred by spending on fiber-optic networks, 5G wireless and data centers designed for cloud computing services.China's domestic optical parts makers include O-Net, Accelink and Innolight.RELATED:Apple Buyback Scenario May Soothe Worries Over iPhone X DemandIn AI Technology Race, U.S. Chips May Be Ace-In-The-Hole Vs.

84,WU,"We have yet another study that debunks the widespread notion that robots — and other forms of automation, including ""artificial intelligence"" — will destroy our jobs and lead to a future of permanently high unemployment. According to the study, that would completely rewrite history, which has shown job creation to be an enduring strength of the U.S. economy.The study (""False Alarmism: Technological Disruption and the U.S. Labor Market, 1850-2015"") comes from the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank focusing on technology. The study's greatest virtue is to remind us that past changes have wiped out entire job categories without spawning a high-unemployment society.This doesn't mean that unemployment isn't a problem. Obviously, it is, especially during recessions or for workers whose jobs have been lost to new technologies, products or competitors. But we need to remember that the U.S. economy has enormous recuperative powers. Indeed, the study argues that technology's disruptive effects on today's job market are much less than in the past.I have written about this before, but the subject is worth revisiting because it's encrusted in misleading myths. Using a data base of occupations (examples: farmers, nurses, engineers) developed at the University of Minnesota, the study's authors, Robert Atkinson and John Wu, examined how technology affected occupations in each decade since 1850. The more changes — either more or fewer jobs — the more disruptive technology's impact.There is often a cycle. A new technology creates or eliminates jobs. The effect continues or accelerates for some years or decades. Then the market matures or other technological changes intrude. Jobs stabilize or decline.Take elevator operators. In 1860, there were none, because builders hadn't learned to construct tall structures with steel. Once this was mastered, the demand for elevator operators soared. By 1950, they totaled 114,473. But in the 1920s, Otis Elevators had developed self-service elevators, which spread after World War II. By 1990, the number of elevator operators was ""essentially zero,"" Atkinson and Wu report.Or consider motion-picture projectionists. Their number rose in the early 20th century, reaching a peak of 31,000 in 1940. But in the 1950s more ""Americans chose to stay home and watch TV,"" while in the 1970s and 1980s, more movie theaters became ""multiplexes (where) ... one projectionist could now manage more than one projector."" Both developments reduced the need for projectionists. In 2015, there were slightly fewer than 5,000.Technological change — both gaining and losing jobs — was disruptive but, in the long run, not destructive. The economy's employment base adjusted. Technological changes created consumer demand for new goods and services, which sustained employment growth and offset job losses.The great fear today, Atkinson said in an interview, is that this will change. Technology will eliminate jobs and not replace them. People worry that their ""occupational capital (their job skills and knowledge) will be destroyed."" Machines will permanently substitute for people. ""That's what the debate about robots and artificial intelligence is all about,"" he said.But there is little precedent for this outcome. The reality, said Atkinson, is that new technologies have always jolted job markets. Individual industries and markets ebb and flow — often hurting workers and communities — but the larger process continues. Job losses in one sector are offset by job gains in another.Consider the 1970s. During that decade, according to Atkinson, the number of farmers dropped 12%, and the number of telephone operators and typists both declined by 41%. But the overall job market expanded by roughly a quarter, or about 20 million jobs.The lesson of history seems to be this: The robots won't steal all our jobs, because their efficiencies will create more purchasing power for other spending or new products that require human involvement and oversight. For proof, consider smartphones. In 2012, they had created nearly 500,000 jobs for ""mobile apps,"" up from zero in 2007.Automation is not a new phenomenon. Understandably, it inspires fear. But so far in the United States, it doesn't kill job growth.

145,WU,"Russia's OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) and China National Petroleum signed a 30-year deal Wednesday to supply Russian natural gas to China.
"
146,WU,"An additional agreement, a memorandum of understanding, was signed by Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Wu Xinxiong, the head of China's National Energy Administration. The relation between the two contracts was unclear.
"
147,WU,"Multiple sources reported that disagreement over the precise price of the gas had held up the deal for nearly a decade. Wednesday's accord put the total value of the contract at $400 billion, for a supply of 38 billion cubic meters of gas per year. Russian news agency Interfax broke that price down to an estimated $9.94 per million British thermal units.
"
148,WU,"Gazprom will develop production sources for the gas in eastern Siberia. Transportation will fall to China National Petroleum Co.
"
149,WU,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said that development related to the deal would cost around $55 billion, Interfax reported, and that China would contribute at least $20 billion of that amount.
"
150,WU,"The agreement apparently leaves room for an increase in shipments to as much as 60 billion cubic meters per year. Even at that level, the supply would be only about a third of what Russia supplies to Europe.
"
151,WU,"Global leaders have watched the negotiations closely, wary of any tightening bonds between Russia and China. The deal takes place amid U.S. and European efforts to isolate Russia due to its involvement in Ukraine's political upheaval. A large piece of the West's sanctions efforts have focused on Russia's oil and gas sector. Such exports reportedly generate more than half of the country's federal budget.
"
152,WU,"The first deliveries under the new deal aren't expected until 2018. Interfax quoted experts saying the agreement could simply be an MOU for supply via the Eastern route, which would not be a new development. But if it represented a sales and purchases agreement, it would be a momentous development for both countries.

MoneyGram shares gapped up 11.5% to 13.25 in early trading, then settled back for a gain of 9.6% in recent action.MoneyGram lets consumers and businesses send cash to one another, generating revenue from transaction fees and spreads on foreign-exchange rates. MoneyGram and larger rival Western Union (WU), the dominant players in the global remittance industry, have been battling increased competition from cheaper digital alternatives such as PayPal's (PYPL) Xoom, WorldRemit and TransferWise.Ant Financial, whose Alipay handles the majority of transactions on Alibaba's online shopping sites, last year appointed a new chief executive officer to steer its next phase of growth and possibly oversee a public market debut in 2017.Formally known as Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, the Chinese company has begun making investments abroad, notably in India and Southeast Asia, to take its model of online finance and local services to emerging markets. Last year, executives of Ant Financial visited Silicon Valley to size up potential investments and lay the groundwork for an IPO.Ant started out as a unit of Alibaba before Ma spun it out in 2010, inviting objections from shareholders like Yahoo (YHOO).

204,WU,"Alibaba Group (BABA) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings before the market open Tuesday, sending the shares up in premarket action as China's e-commerce leader raised its guidance.Alibaba reported revenue of $7.67 billion, up 54% year over year in local currency and above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $7.33 billion. It reported earnings per share minus items of $1.30, beating the consensus of $1.13, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.Alibaba stock finished 3.1% higher at 101.43 in the stock market today and touched a more than two-month high.IBD'S TAKE: Investors have been anxiously awaiting a sign that Alibaba stock is ready to turn around after consolidating for the past four months, a correction that saw the stock fall more than 20% from its peak reached back in September.""With three quarters of the year coming in ahead of expectations, we are adjusting up our 2017 fiscal year revenue guidance from 48% to 53% year-over-year growth,"" said Maggie Wu, Alibaba CFO, in the earnings release.Results included revenue from Alibaba Nov. 11 ""Global Shopping Festival,"" also known as Singles Day. For that day alone, Alibaba said it processed $17.4 billion in transactions, of which 82% was generated through mobile devices.Among its various businesses, revenue from its cloud computing unit rose 115% to $254 million. Paying customers for cloud computing grew to 765,000, an increase of about 114,000 from last quarter. Revenue from digital media and entertainment rose 273% to $585 million.Alibaba ended December with 493 million monthly mobile active users, up from 450 million in the September quarter.""We are driving the age of 'New Retail,' which leverages big data and innovation to provide a seamless online and offline experience for nearly half a billion mobile monthly active users,"" said Alibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang in the earnings release.Alibaba has been pursuing international markets and expects 40% of revenue will come from outside China in the next 10 years. But it hopes for making headway in the U.S. hit a hurdle last month when the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative placed Alibaba on its ""Notorious Markets"" list for counterfeit and pirated items.RELATED:Alibaba Founder Ma Describes Trump Meeting As Very ProductiveAlibaba CEO Fights Back Against Claims Of Counterfeit GoodsChina's Alibaba Group Beefs Up In D.C.

205,WU,"Just what we all need to ring in the Christmas season: Un-merry millionaire Michelle Obama belly-aching about the burdens and sacrifices of public life with billionaire Oprah Winfrey.""There's nowhere in the world I can go and sit and have a cup of coffee,"" Obama lamented. It's a frequent grievance. In September, she told InStyle magazine: ""My hopes are to recapture some of the everydayness, some anonymity. ... (I)t will be nice to open up the paper, look at the front page, and know that you're not responsible for every headline.""And back in June, again with Oprah, the first lady griped that living in the spotlight was like ""living in a cave.""Complain, complain, complain. What a way to make the most of your last six months in the grand and glorious White House.For the past eight years, Obama has traveled to every corner of the planet on the taxpayers' dime. She has splurged in Spain, traversed the Great Wall of China, tangoed in Buenos Aires, skied in Aspen, lolled in Martha's Vineyard and feasted in Marrakesh. Thanks to her public position and celebrity, she has been bestowed ""fashion icon"" status — donning a $12,000 custom-made Atelier Versace gown at her final State Dinner last month after enjoying two terms clad in Givenchy, Gucci, Jason Wu, Vera Wang, Caroline Herrera and other haute couture stars whose designs are unattainable to ordinary women in America.Count your blessings much, Mrs. Grinch? Nope. All Barack Obama's bitter half really wants to do, she told Winfrey, is ""drop into Target. I want to go to Target again.""Funny that. The last time Obama shopped at Target, she turned the outing into a fake news narrative to stoke racial division in America. It is worth reminding the public about the noxious lie one last time before the grumbling FLOTUS leaves office because I consider her exploitation of the incident a perfect metaphor for the Obama years — faux populism bolstered by elitist Hollywood enablers, and then cynically transformed into a phony social justice crusade for crass political gain.Back in 2012, you may remember, Obama sat down with David Letterman in one of her endless, popularity-enhancing pop culture appearances. She bragged about her ability to shop incognito at Target (does she get a secret commission every time she mentions the store?) and told a warm and fuzzy story about helping a fellow customer who didn't recognize her. The shopper innocently asked Obama to retrieve laundry detergent from a high shelf.""I reached up, 'cause she was short, and I reached up, pulled it down,"" the first lady recounted, and the shopper joked, ""Well, you didn't have to make it look so easy."" Obama beamed as she told Letterman: ""I felt so good"" doing an everyday good deed. Letterman's audience cheered at the ""first ladies, they're just like us!"" theater.Just a few years later, however, the encounter morphed into a tall tale of rampant racism, which she cunningly reshaped for People Magazine in 2014 during the aftermath of the Ferguson, Missouri riots and Black Lives Matter protests.""Even as the first lady,"" she moaned, ""not highly disguised, the only person who came up to me"" at a Target store ""was a woman who asked me to help her take something off a shelf."" The headline of the article? ""The Obamas: How We Deal With Our Own Racist Experiences."" ABC News added that Michelle Obama claimed such ""incidents are 'the regular course of life' for African Americans and a 'challenge' for the country to overcome.""Last year, Obama persisted in plying and fine-tuning her false narrative at Tuskegee University's commencement ceremony — decrying the ""sting"" of ""daily slights"" she blamed on racism, including unnamed ""clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores.""Now, as she walks away with sky-high poll ratings, a glittering Rolodex, and government benefits for life, this incredibly blessed and privileged woman has the audacity to claim that ""we"" are ""feeling what not having hope feels like,"" as she whined to her well-heeled gal pal, Oprah Winfrey.So put upon. So downtrodden. So oppressed. To borrow one of Mrs. Woe-Is-Me's own favorite phrases:Bye, Felicia!You and your manufactured miseries won't be missed.

207,WU,"China on Tuesday reported its economy grew 6.7% during the third quarter. Nothing suspicious about that, except it's the third quarter in a row that it grew at exactly 6.7%. As Fortune.com wondered, what are the odds?The answer to that last question is: pretty low. Given the natural volatility in economic data, getting exactly the same number three quarters in a row is highly unlikely -- though not impossible. But it underscores what analysts, economists and even some high-level Chinese officials have said for years -- China's economic data are cooked and can't be trusted.Of course, China each year produces a ""forecast"" for the coming year. But calling it that is not quite right. It's more a piece of political wish fulfillment. If you're a midlevel Chinese official, your future in the Communist Party and as a bureaucrat depends on producing the numbers needed to achieve the ""forecast.""In March of this year, China's economic bureaucrats ""forecast"" that GDP would grow ""not less than 6.5% and not more than 7%"" in 2016. Knowing this, you can pretty much count on them announcing in January of 2017 that their economy met the target. Thus we get the three-quarter growth spurt of 6.7%.IBD has noted before the strange fascination the world has for China's outsize GDP growth, which was once reputed to be 10% a year, an unprecedented figure. What the world doesn't ask is: Is it real?The answer, in a word, is no. China's ""growth"" is largely a result of a debt-fueled building binge that took place over decades of frenetic economic activity. Yes, it has some very fine cities, and much decent new infrastructure. But the fact is, the nation is now filled with ""ghost cities"" -- Google that term if you're interested -- while the central government has piled up massive amounts of debt to create the boom.Today, total debt in China has soared past 250% of GDP -- a level virtually all economists agree is unsustainable. Meanwhile, one of its leading indicators of future growth -- exports -- has cratered, falling 10% from a year earlier in September on a dollar basis. The idea that China's GDP is growing at anything close to a 6.7% rate is a farce.Yes, consumer spending has been strong -- close to 10% on a yearly basis. But that too is driven by the government's frantic creation of cheap credit to push up the economy. It's not real. A recent report in Britain's Telegraph notes that China's private sector now has $28 trillion in loans -- more than Japan and the U.S. combined. ""The scale is enough to threaten a worldwide shock if China ever loses control,"" wrote Ambrose Evans-Pritchard about the Chinese debt bomb.The truth is, China's underlying economy is flagging, weighed down by excessive investment, too much debt and a fast-aging population that soon will not provide enough productive workers to fuel future growth. And that trend has been happening for some time.In 2014, The Conference Board, not known for favoring outlandish forecasts, predicted that China's economy would slow to 4% growth by 2020. It may already be there.And even in the past, during its boom time from 1979 to 2008, China's numbers were not what they seemed. As we said, the politicization of Chinese GDP was well-known. And China now admits it -- sort of.In a diplomatic cable more than a decade ago, current Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called China's GDP numbers ""man-made"" and ""unreliable."" Basically, he admitted, he ignores those numbers -- focusing instead on more tangibly measured things such as bank loans, rail freight and electricity output.Economist Harry Wu, a Tokyo-based expert on China's economy, in a 2014 peer-reviewed report published with the Conference Board, estimated that China's economy is as much as 36% smaller than official data show. As for the crowing that you've heard in recent years that China has ""passed"" the U.S. in terms of its economy, that's utterly false. Last year, per-capita GDP in dollars was $55,836.79 in the U.S., according to World Bank data. It was $7,924.65 in China -- 86% less.The fact is, China isn't likely to ever catch the U.S. in standard of living. Its economy is now past its growth prime, and it will slowly fall to rates of growth closer to those of the mature industrial economies in Asia -- think South Korea and Japan. It's no longer really even a tiger economy.Of course, anyone following China's volatile and at times scary stock market already knows this. The Shanghai Composite Stock Market Index hit an all-time high of 6092.06 in October 2007. One of the ""miracles"" of China's growth, we've been told, is that it was remarkably unscathed by the financial crisis. Well, as of Wednesday, the Shanghai Index stood at 3081.9 -- down 49%.The point is, talking about China's GDP can be a fruitless exercise if you put too much faith in Chinese data. And, no, this isn't China-bashing. China's move under Deng Xiaoping in 1979 toward a market-based system for much of its economy was responsible for China becoming what it is today. But a little skepticism of the never-ending Chinese growth miracle will go a long way, especially if you're a businessperson or an investor.RELATED:As China's Boom Goes Bust, It's Growth Is QuestionedChina Enters Era Of Slow Economic, Population GrowthChina As No. 1?

213,WU,"If economic commentators (including me) seem to agree on one thing, it is this: Jobs in America have become less secure. If you've got an OK job, don't let go, because you may not be able to find another. The conventional wisdom is widely shared -- but it may be wrong.We now have an intriguing report from a small Washington think tank, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, arguing that ""the U.S. labor market is far more stable than people think.""I'm not entirely convinced, but the study is thought-provoking and reopens basic questions about the economy.The study -- written by the think tank's head, Robert Atkinson, and analyst J. John Wu -- accepts that many Americans think the labor market has become more treacherous. By one poll in 1987, 59% of workers thought their jobs were secure; in 2014, only 47% felt that way. Employment fears stem mainly from obvious sources: memories of the Great Recession (8.7 million jobs lost) and the job-killing potential of the internet and globalization.The question is whether these heightened fears are matched by greater chances of being laid off. No, say Atkinson and Wu. They compared layoffs in 1995 and 2015. In 1995, about 7.3% of workers lost their jobs in any quarter; by 2015, the layoff rate had dropped to 5.7%. Job security had actually improved. While fears had gone up, layoffs (as a share of all employment) had gone down.Moreover, the effect was widespread. Atkinson and Wu examined 10 major business sectors -- from retail trade to construction -- and found the same pattern in all of them. Layoffs as a proportion of jobs in each had declined between 1995 and 2015.Atkinson and Wu also doubt that the rise of the ""gig economy"" (Uber and other internet-based contractors) has created much insecurity. The sector, comprised mostly of the self-employed, is too small to affect the broader workforce. Indeed, the share of the self-employed of total employment dropped from 9% to 7% between 1995 and 2015, they report.It's an impressive case, but I have reservations. For starters, people's perceptions of the labor market don't depend only on fears of being laid off. They also reflect the possibility of getting a new job. If you can find one quickly, at your old salary or more, you're less worried about being laid off. You may actually quit to seek a better opportunity.By these measures, job insecurity looks more threatening. Even Atkinson and Wu concede that job creation has been spotty and often inadequate, and that new jobs are frequently inferior to their predecessors. Only 60% to 70% of displaced workers find new jobs after three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. About half earn less than at their last job.I have a theory. It's well-known that, as workers get older, they tend to settle into jobs that last longer. As baby-boomer workers age -- and given today's added job insecurity -- they are even more inclined to stick with the job they've got.This may help explain why wage growth has been so slow; employers don't have to pay more to keep good workers, who aren't looking for a big raise from a competitor.In practice, fear has subsidized employers through muted wage growth. The possible side effects fit the facts. Labor's share of total income has eroded in favor of capital's share (business profits, interest and rent).Incumbent companies have an advantage over startups, because they have more experienced workers. Unsurprisingly, business startups have declined, despite some successful high-tech exceptions.As I said, it's just a theory. It could be wrong. Atkinson and Wu could be right. Either way, we need to know. Perceptions are often reality. People act on their beliefs, even if they're misguided.Atkinson fears that if Congress harbors unduly pessimistic views of the economy's stability, it may embrace perverse policies that, in the name of improving security, cripple flexibility and stifle innovation.

215,WU,"Wake UP!!! China goes OFF the edge overnight, plunging to a 13 month low as investors have become so unnerved that they now expect ‘capital outflow’ ($1 tril worth in 2015 vs. $140 bil in 2014) to only accelerate as their economy continues to go thru ‘the change’. The Shanghai index fell 6.4% even as the PBoC pumped 440 bil Yuan ($67 bil) into their economy overnight as policy makers are at a loss……[Capital Outflow – is the movement of assets (in this case Yuan’s) out of the country when investors fear instability – political or economic. Investors SELL their assets and then take the money and invest it somewhere else.]This is not good for China or the Chinese mkt. Fear over a bigger slowdown than what is expected and fear over what the FED may say or do, fear over weaker oil prices all caused mkts to implode – not a single sector was spared, investors afraid of a liquidity freeze – calls for the index to fall another 15% are now common (look when it gets this bad – there is no stopping it until there is capitulation and real panic, so hold on).Wu Kan - a fund manager in Shanghai put it this way: “It’s an issue about confidence and there’s no confidence in the market now, the depreciating yuan and slowing economic growth have been haunting the market for a while.”BINGO! It’s all about confidence (and that is true in ALL mkts). Confidence in the mkt, confidence in legislators, confidence in the gov’t, confidence in the economy, confidence in leadership… That mkt has lost more than 45% since June as the economy slows and investor lose ‘confidence’. (The last time investors lost confidence was during the GFC (Great Financial Crisis) and the Chinese mkt lost 67%.Dai Ming of Hengsheng Asset Management who has been selling stocks added that:

As you can imagine – all eyes and ears will be on Janet Yellen tomorrow – traders and investors will place their bets today as the chatter consumes the mkts. How will she acknowledge that the US (and global) economics have changed without sounding the alarm bells?Remember – they raised rates by 0.25% in December and Stanley Fischer – Vice Chair – reminded us that 4 more hikes “were in the ballpark for 2016” …but since the FED raised rates US stocks have taken a beating (let’s just put the others aside for now) …. the S&P fell over 11%, the Dow fell over 13% and the Nasdaq lost 8%, Oil is down by more than 16% and global mkts are in crisis – with many of them in clear BEAR mkt territory.

232,WU,"Single women in or nearing retirement can have it tough. Consider the lot of Sari Simmons: To make ends meet, this personal care provider works 40 hours a week and collects Social Security.But with no ""surplus"" money for savings, and high health care costs, this 63-year-old won't soon be retiring. ""Being single,"" explains Simmons, of New Jersey, ""you can't rely on anyone else to share (in covering) your expenses.""Her story is hardly unique. Even as hordes of baby boomers push into retirement years, some with slim savings, data show unmarried women are particularly at risk.""Single women tend to have earned less and saved less. Their lower earnings lead to smaller Social Security benefits,"" noted financial planner David Rae of Los Angeles. ""Add the fact that women tend to outlive men, and you have a recipe for financial disaster.""Consider: Fully 26.9% of divorced women 62 or older, who divorced after age 50, are poor, according to a new study by Susan Brown and I-Fen Lin of Bowling Green State University. Among ""gray"" (62 or older) women who never married, 25.3% are poor, while 13.7% of late widows are impoverished. By comparison, 11.4% of older men who divorced after age 50 are poor, as well as 13.6% of never-married men.Of course, many single women aren't hurting financially. And for those who are struggling, help is available — from careful budgeting and spending, to working in ""retirement"" years, to maximizing one's Social Security benefit. As author and financial advisor Kimberly Foss holds, ""It's never too late"" to take action.Among the steps to consider:• Emergency fund. "" The very first thing that's needed is an emergency fund,"" said Foss, of Roseville, Calif. Initially, this would cover a minimum of three months' living expenses, moving up to a six months' minimum. ""Without that fund, people would end up dipping into investable assets,"" Foss said. One way to get started, she suggests: Acorns provides a smartphone app that takes spare change from everyday purchases and automatically puts it into a diversified portfolio.• Understand Social Security. The website ssa.gov fully details Social Security's benefits, including provisions specific to widows and divorcees, and the Medicare program, notes financial advisor Carmen Wu.• Make a budget. Define necessary ""fixed"" costs and ""variable"" lifestyle expenses, such as vacations and dining out, says Wu, of Vienna, Va. Determine how to afford the desired retirement. If fixed expenses won't be affordable, consider options such as a smaller home, a reverse mortgage or continuing to work.• Tap assets strategically. A method suggested by financial advisor Pamela Sams: ""Start with your guaranteed retirement income, such as a pension, annuities and Social Security. (But if possible, wait until age 70 to claim Social Security.) Fifty percent of your retirement income should come from those consistent, fixed resources,"" said Sams, of Herndon, Va. Perhaps ""several years later, look to assets whose value changes with the markets, including your brokerage accounts, 401(k) and IRAs. If possible, delay tapping into your (standard) IRA until you must start doing so at age 70-1/2.""And for those who don't feel financially savvy, help is available. Experts point out that retirement income calculators are widely available on the Internet, on such sites as bankrate.com and aarp.org.And, of course, people can turn to a financial advisor. But those who can't afford one can seek help from the Financial Planning Association (FPA). Through its chapters, it provides free financial advice to those who cannot otherwise afford it, says advisor Wu.

233,WU,"As he drove across Nebraska in the bitter winter of 1962, Bob Devaney tried not to panic. Only months before, he had been lured from Wyoming to rebuild the University of Nebraska's crumbling football team.
"
234,WU,"Now, on his first swing through the state, he questioned his move.
"
235,WU,"""I thought I'd made a mistake,"" he said years later.
"
236,WU,"The Cornhuskers had lost 125 games in the previous 20 years — second most in the country.
"
237,WU,"They hadn't won a conference championship in 21 years and had appeared in just two bowl games in their long history — both losses.
"
238,WU,"Money was an even bigger problem. The university car that Devaney drove that day was like an ice box, and funds were so low, he and assistant coach Cletus Fischer had to share a motel room.
"
239,WU,"""I was wondering why I left Wyoming,"" Devaney said. ""At least there I had a car with heat and a radio in it. And Clete snored.""
"
240,WU,"Overcoming his doubts, Devaney quickly got down to the business of building a football dynasty.
"
241,WU,"In 11 remarkable seasons, his teams went 101-20-2, won eight Big Eight titles, six bowl games and two national championships.
"
242,WU,"In the process, he turned the state into a legendary football hotbed.
"
243,WU,"Packing 'Em In
"
244,WU,"Before Devaney, Memorial Stadium in Lincoln seated 38,000 and was rarely sold out.
"
245,WU,"When he stepped aside in 1972 for his hand-picked successor, Tom Osborne, the stadium held 72,000; it now seats 87,000.
"
246,WU,"""You hate to say college football defines a state. Some people would chafe at that,"" Mike Babcock, a longtime Nebraska sportswriter and author or editor of 11 books on the Huskers, told IBD. ""But Bob Devaney had a lot to do with how this state got its identity.""
"
247,WU,"Devaney didn't slip into the shadows after being replaced by Osborne. As athletic director, he used his charm and influence to modernize the athletic department, creating a model plant on campus.
"
248,WU,"""The buildings were terrible,"" Devaney said in the 1990s. ""Now we've got some of the best facilities ... in the country.
"
249,WU,"""We've got a sports center because I got the legislature to pass a three-quarters of a cent tax on cigarettes. I used to lobby those guys. I used to play cards with them and drink with them. I got the legislature to pass it over a veto.""
"
250,WU,"Born in Saginaw, Mich., Devaney (1915-97) worked three years in a foundry to earn tuition to nearby Alma College, where he captained the football team in the late 1930s.
"
251,WU,"For 14 seasons, he coached football at four Michigan high schools. At 37, unable to land a college job, he gave serious thought to quitting.
"
252,WU,"""I had made up my mind that if a break didn't come before I was 40, I was going to go back and get my master's degree and take a boring administrative job somewhere,"" he said in his 1981 book, ""Devaney.""
"
253,WU,"Then Michigan State saved the day. It hired him as an assistant coach, and Devaney helped guide the Spartans from 1953 to 1956.
"
254,WU,"From there it was on to Wyoming, where as head coach from 1957 to 1961, he steered the Cowboys to a 35-10-5 record while dominating the Skyline Conference.
"
255,WU,"Meanwhile, losses and fan indifference were mounting in Nebraska, where even the coach had a grim view of the future.
"
256,WU,"""I've been watching things closely,"" Bill Jennings told an Omaha business crowd in 1960, ""and I don't think this state can ever be great in anything — there are so few people.""
"
257,WU,"Devaney quickly dashed that theory when he took the helm in 1962. An upset triumph at Big Ten power Michigan in Week 2 put Nebraska in national play.
"
258,WU,"""He knew that game could give Nebraska instant credibility — beating a Big Ten team at their place,"" Babcock said. ""He and his coaches focused on that game. They knew Michigan wasn't a very good team that year.""
"
259,WU,"A few weeks later, Nebraska sold out a home game with Missouri. The Cornhuskers lost that one, but it kicked off a sellout streak that continues today.
"
260,WU,"With a 36-34 victory over Miami in the Gotham Bowl, Devaney finished his first season 9-2, Nebraska's best record since 1905.
"
261,WU,"The Huskers then pieced together four Big Eight titles, meeting Alabama for a national championship after the 1965 season. A 39-28 loss to the Crimson Tide did little to dent Devaney's rising national reputation — or celebrated charisma.
"
262,WU,"""He was an extremely engaging person with a great sense of humor,"" Babcock said. ""He was a great speaker, very comfortable in public and a tremendous ambassador for the program.
"
263,WU,"""Bob was just a down-home guy. He lived in the same house from the time he got here to the time he went into a care facility. It wasn't an ostentatious house, nothing like it. You could walk up to the front door and ring the doorbell.""
"
264,WU,"Between Devaney's steamroller teams and live-wire personality, Memorial Stadium became the place to be on Saturday afternoons, forcing the university to expand one end zone in 1964, the other one in 1965, and finally to enclose the entire stadium two years later.
"
265,WU,"Fiery Fandom
"
266,WU,"""At one point, there was talk of building a stadium between Lincoln and Omaha that would seat 100,000,"" Babcock said. ""It was never more than theoretical talk. Bob said the demand for tickets should never exceed the supply.""
"
267,WU,"Big Red Fever engulfed the state. Husker fans loaded up on Nebraska jerseys, Nebraska bumper stickers, Nebraska flags and a wide variety of other paraphernalia.
"
268,WU,"Some true believers have even ordered Husker helmet logos for their tombstones.
"
269,WU,"Before the 17-12 Sugar Bowl win over LSU on Jan. 1, 1971, which clinched Nebraska's first national championship, the Huskers received the longest telegram ever delivered by Western Union (WU), containing the signatures of 46,000 Bid Red fans. Unrolled, it was 1,400 feet long.
"
270,WU,"""The Nebraska people came through the Depression,"" former Chancellor Clifford Hardin, the man responsible for hiring Devaney, said in the late 1990s. ""They came through the drought years. I felt the state needed something to rally around. If we could pull this off, it could be the difference. I think in retrospect, it probably helped us get more money to build the university.""
"
271,WU,"Yet when Devaney's teams lost four games in both 1967 and '68, angry fans turned on him.
"
272,WU,"""There was a petition to get rid of Bob,"" Babcock said. ""Later, he joked about it, saying, 'My secretary read my mail so I didn't know anything about it. But if I'd known, I would've signed it myself.'
"
273,WU,"""He always had a quip that would sort of defuse situations.""
"
274,WU,"The Turnaround
"
275,WU,"Winning was the best antidote.
"
276,WU,"Nebraska won nine games in 1969 and crowned the season with a 45-6 rout of Georgia in the Sun Bowl.
"
277,WU,"By 1970, Devaney's Huskers were ready to stand atop all of college football. They went 11-0-1, and — after top-ranked Texas fell to Notre Dame on New Year's Day — finished atop the AP poll.
"
278,WU,"Nebraska opened the 1971 season ranked No. 2, climbed to No. 1 after swamping Oregon in the opener, and edged No. 2 Oklahoma 35-31 in what many called the Game of the Century, starring Johnny Rodgers with a 72-yard punt return for a touchdown.
"
279,WU,"Then came another showdown between No. 1 and No. 2.
"
280,WU,"This time the Huskers faced Alabama in the Orange Bowl and blew out the Tide 38-6.
"
281,WU,"Devaney and Nebraska had their second straight national title, with a 13-0 record.
"
282,WU,"Alabama coach Bear Bryant would tell Devaney that the Cornhuskers that night might have been the best team he ever saw.
"
283,WU,"""Coming from Coach Bryant, that meant a lot to me,"" Devaney said.
"
284,WU,"The Nebraska boss stood alone at the top. His team was the very best, with a 23-game winning streak.
"
285,WU,"After the 1972 season, he handed over the reins to Osborne, his protege, who went on to win three national championships in the 1990s.
"
286,WU,"In 2013 a Devaney statue was unveiled at Memorial Stadium, feting to the coach who launched Nebraska into gridiron greatness.
"
287,WU,"""Duffy Daugherty (the former Michigan State coach) used to call my dad the Pied Piper, and I think that's what he was,"" Mike Devaney — one of two children Bob and Phyllis had — said at the unveiling.

291,WU,"Mike Brown uses a baseball analogy when talking about Euronet Worldwide, the provider of electronic payment services where he serves as chief executive.
"
292,WU,"Specifically, Brown compares Euronet (EEFT) to the newly crowned World Series champion Kansas City Royals, who reside just down the road from the company's Leawood, Kan., headquarters.
"
293,WU,"Kansas City beat the New York Mets in the series by playing ""small ball"" — baseball jargon for scoring runs with singles and smart base-running rather than power hitting. The Royals hit only two home runs during the series — New York had six — but Kansas City ran away with the championship, four games to one.
"
294,WU,"Euronet is like that, Brown says. The company isn't that big or heavily traded.
"
295,WU,"But it racks up consistent financial growth and has rewarded investors with an upwardly mobile stock price.
"
296,WU,"""We are not a flash in the pan,"" Brown said in an email interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""Our colleagues are hardworking, modest and creative. We're just like the K.C. Royals — not many home runs, but lots and lots of singles; moving runners around the bases for the win.""
"
297,WU,"He points to Euronet's recent per-share earnings growth — 30% in 2013, 27% last year and an expected 28% this year.
"
298,WU,"Thriving In Rough Times
"
299,WU,"Brown sounds particularly proud of the company's ability to grow even during rough patches in the economy.
"
300,WU,"""During the recession, we never went backwards,"" Brown said.
"
301,WU,"Euronet management doesn't even worry much about the macro headwinds that keep other executives up at night. ""We have such huge opportunities, our worries are more about execution,"" he said.
"
302,WU,"Those opportunities stretch across all three of Euronet's business segments: electronic funds transfer — or EFT — processing, e-pay and money transfer.
"
303,WU,"The EFT processing segment provides electronic payment services, from ATM withdrawals to point-of-sale, or POS, products.
"
304,WU,"The e-pay segment offers electronic distribution and processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment products, as well as gift card distribution and processing services. This segment operates a network of around 681,000 POS terminals.
"
305,WU,"The money transfer segment provides a host of products and services, including consumer-to-consumer and account-to-account money transfers, prepaid cards, customer bill payment services, check-cashing services and foreign-currency exchange services.
"
306,WU,"Walmart-2-Walmart
"
307,WU,"One of the money transfer segment's biggest wins came last year, when Wal-Mart (WMT) selected Euronet subsidiary Ria Financial Services to operate its store-to-store money transfer service. The service is called, fittingly enough, ""Walmart-2-Walmart.""
"
308,WU,"It lets shoppers transfer money to and from thousands of Wal-Mart stores nationwide at a big discount compared to competing money transfer services.
"
309,WU,"""Walmart-2-Walmart has set a new price point and superior service level that totally disrupted the domestic money transfer model and accrued profits to us while pumping hundreds of millions of dollars back into consumers' pockets,"" Brown said.
"
310,WU,"In the third quarter, Euronet's EFT, e-pay and money transfer segments had constant-currency operating profit growth of 39%, 38% and 110%, respectively, he said.
"
311,WU,"Foreign Resources
"
312,WU,"Nearly three-quarters of the company's revenue comes from outside the U.S., though the U.S. is its biggest single market, followed by Germany. Euronet is rapidly expanding its footprint both here and overseas.
"
313,WU,"""We continue to expand geographically in all three of our segments,"" Brown said. ""Just in the last year, we added four to five new countries for EFT, tens of thousands of locations for money transfer, and hundreds of new products across new countries in e-pay.""
"
314,WU,"Financially, Euronet has been on a nice roll, with 11 straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth.
"
315,WU,"The company logged third-quarter earnings of $1.04 a share, up 30% from the prior year, beating consensus views.
"
316,WU,"Sales grew 6% to $481.4 million.
"
317,WU,"It was the second straight quarter of single-digit revenue growth following four quarters of double-digit gains.
"
318,WU,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect double-digit growth to return in the fourth quarter, with revenue rising 10% to $506.1 million. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to climb 26% to 93 cents.
"
319,WU,"ATM Expansion
"
320,WU,"In a research report, William Blair analyst Christopher Shutler called the third-quarter results ""excellent,"" driven by the ETF and money transfer segments, as well as a rapid expansion of Euronet's ATM network.
"
321,WU,"""Euronet has added almost 1,700 ATMs in the first nine months of the year,"" Shutler noted. ""Pacing of ATM additions is ahead of management's goal of adding 2,000 ATMs this year.""
"
322,WU,"Roughly two-thirds of the ATMs are expected to be added in Europe.
"
323,WU,"""Looking ahead, key EFT growth drivers should include the continued addition of more ATMs and value-added services, as well as growing contributions from prepaid debit cards and point-of-sale DCC (dynamic currency conversion) transactions,"" Shutler predicted.
"
324,WU,"DCC transactions let card holders convert transaction costs to their home currencies.
"
325,WU,"Euronet's third-quarter results came after the close on Oct. 21. The next day, its stock price popped 7.9% — its biggest single-session gain since February.

Royals — not many home runs, but lots and lots of singles; moving runners around the bases for the win.""He points to Euronet's recent per-share earnings growth — 30% in 2013, 27% last year and an expected 28% this year.Thriving In Rough TimesBrown sounds particularly proud of the company's ability to grow even during rough patches in the economy.""During the recession, we never went backwards,"" Brown said.Euronet management doesn't even worry much about the macro headwinds that keep other executives up at night. ""We have such huge opportunities, our worries are more about execution,"" he said.Those opportunities stretch across all three of Euronet's business segments: electronic funds transfer — or EFT — processing, e-pay and money transfer.The EFT processing segment provides electronic payment services, from ATM withdrawals to point-of-sale, or POS, products.The e-pay segment offers electronic distribution and processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other electronic payment products, as well as gift card distribution and processing services. This segment operates a network of around 681,000 POS terminals.The money transfer segment provides a host of products and services, including consumer-to-consumer and account-to-account money transfers, prepaid cards, customer bill payment services, check-cashing services and foreign-currency exchange services.Walmart-2-WalmartOne of the money transfer segment's biggest wins came last year, when Wal-Mart (WMT) selected Euronet subsidiary Ria Financial Services to operate its store-to-store money transfer service. The service is called, fittingly enough, ""Walmart-2-Walmart.""It lets shoppers transfer money to and from thousands of Wal-Mart stores nationwide at a big discount compared to competing money transfer services.""Walmart-2-Walmart has set a new price point and superior service level that totally disrupted the domestic money transfer model and accrued profits to us while pumping hundreds of millions of dollars back into consumers' pockets,"" Brown said.In the third quarter, Euronet's EFT, e-pay and money transfer segments had constant-currency operating profit growth of 39%, 38% and 110%, respectively, he said.Foreign ResourcesNearly three-quarters of the company's revenue comes from outside the U.S., though the U.S. is its biggest single market, followed by Germany. Euronet is rapidly expanding its footprint both here and overseas.""We continue to expand geographically in all three of our segments,"" Brown said. ""Just in the last year, we added four to five new countries for EFT, tens of thousands of locations for money transfer, and hundreds of new products across new countries in e-pay.""Financially, Euronet has been on a nice roll, with 11 straight quarters of double-digit EPS growth.The company logged third-quarter earnings of $1.04 a share, up 30% from the prior year, beating consensus views.Sales grew 6% to $481.4 million.It was the second straight quarter of single-digit revenue growth following four quarters of double-digit gains.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect double-digit growth to return in the fourth quarter, with revenue rising 10% to $506.1 million. Fourth-quarter earnings are expected to climb 26% to 93 cents.ATM ExpansionIn a research report, William Blair analyst Christopher Shutler called the third-quarter results ""excellent,"" driven by the ETF and money transfer segments, as well as a rapid expansion of Euronet's ATM network.""Euronet has added almost 1,700 ATMs in the first nine months of the year,"" Shutler noted. ""Pacing of ATM additions is ahead of management's goal of adding 2,000 ATMs this year.""Roughly two-thirds of the ATMs are expected to be added in Europe.""Looking ahead, key EFT growth drivers should include the continued addition of more ATMs and value-added services, as well as growing contributions from prepaid debit cards and point-of-sale DCC (dynamic currency conversion) transactions,"" Shutler predicted.DCC transactions let card holders convert transaction costs to their home currencies.Euronet's third-quarter results came after the close on Oct. 21. The next day, its stock price popped 7.9% — its biggest single-session gain since February.Shares hit a high of 82.14 Nov. 6.Euronet's rivals include Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram International (MGI), as well as privately held Pulse Network.While Western Union and MoneyGram have struggled to establish consistent financial growth in the last several quarters, Euronet has been a stellar performer.It boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 97, putting it near the top of IBD's Finance-Credit Card group.Other group leaders include Visa (V), Alliance Data Systems (ADS), MasterCard (MA) and Total System Services (TSS).

357,WU,"Chinagate: The FBI has arrested one of the top Beijing-tied bagmen who funneled funny money to the Clinton administration. He was busted in New York with a suitcase full of cash. Some Chinese money-laundering for Hillary? Stay tuned.The defendant is a major Clinton fundraiser named Ng Lap Seng, aka ""Mr. Wu."" He and Clinton pal Charlie Trie visited the White House several times in the 1990s, snapping photos with both Bill and Hillary.Federal investigators are charging him with lying to agents about why he brought more than $4.5 million into the U.S. over the last two years, including a suitcase full of $400,000 in cash to New York.Hillary's campaign office is claiming ignorance. But isn't it funny how suddenly the Clintons' old Chinese bagmen are popping up again, lugging around bags full of cash, just as the Clintons make another run at the White House?Recall that in her 2008 bid for the White House, Hillary had to return hundreds of thousands of dollars raised by another Chinese bagman, Norman Hsu, who happened to be a criminal fugitive. Hsu bundled $1 million for the Clinton campaign through straw donors. He was busted for laundering foreign cash.The pattern of corruption may be repeating with the re-emergence of Ng.In 1998, Ng was ID'd in a Senate report as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally funneled through Little Rock restaurant owner Trie. A top Clinton donor, Trie would later face charges in the Chinagate fundraising scandal for violating campaign finance laws.Ng has close ties to the Chinese communist government and is listed as a member of a senior advisory group, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.Through Trie, Ng bought access to the White House ostensibly on behalf of Beijing, which the FBI said at the time was running an influence operation against the Clinton administration.At the time, Chinese missiles couldn't hit the side of a barn. But thanks to Clinton missile-technology transfers, Beijing can now hit any city in the U.S. And thanks to his opening up the nuclear weapons labs to Chinese scientists, Beijing ""stole"" the designs to every nuke in the U.S. arsenal.The Chicoms also sought a beachhead in our hemisphere and got it, when Clinton in 1997 allowed Chinese front companies to take over the Panama Canal, a strategic waterway linking the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean. Beijing now effectively controls key naval shipping lanes in our backyard.Asked by a reporter around the time of the transfer, ""You're not worried about the Chinese controlling the canal?"" Mr. Clinton replied: ""I think the Chinese will, in fact, be bending over backwards to make sure that they run it in a competent and able and fair manner. I would be very surprised if any adverse consequences flowed from the Chinese running the canal.""Beijing got a hell of a lot for their money under the treasonous Clinton administration. Now it seems they're back trying to get even more in a hoped-for second regime.Too bad the corrupt Clintons aren't joining the mysterious Mr. Wu behind bars.

The deal is expected to close in Q4 and will be ""slightly dilutive"" to PayPal's non-GAAP earnings per share for 2016, the company said in a press release .EBay stock was up more than 1.5% in early trading in the stock market today.PayPal, the No. 1 online transactions service, will trade under ticker PYPL starting Monday, July 20. Each common equity holder of eBay as of July 8 will receive one PayPal share on July 17.There's been M&A; speculation involving both eBay and PayPal following the spinoff, which eBay announced Sept. 30, 2014.San Francisco-based Xoom's digital payment service lets customers send money to friends and family using mobile phones, tablets or computers. In the 12 months ended March 31, Xoom's more than 1.3 million active customers transferred $7 billion using Xoom, the company says.As part of the 2013 acquisition of Braintree, a mobile payment service, PayPal also obtained Venmo, a hybrid mobile payment app and social network for millennials. Young adults use the app to send each other money peer to peer.Facebook (FB) in March announced a new tool for its Messenger app that lets friends exchange funds, much as Venmo does.

370,WU,"For a tech company, 16 years is practically middle-aged. And with revenue expected to top $6 billion this fiscal year, some might question how much growth is left for cloud and customer relationship management pioneer Salesforce.com (CRM).Top executives steering the San Francisco-based company known for automating all manner of sales functions insist there is still plenty.CEO Marc Benioff and President Keith Block believe that Salesforce will reach the $10 billion revenue mark in record time for an enterprise software company, though no time frame was given.""We also believe we will go from the sixth largest software company to the third largest, surpassing SAP (SAP),"" Block said in an interview with IBD.That would put it third behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL).And it's not just its core business in sales-force automation and customer relationship management, he says.""I think we will be the most relevant technology company in the world in the next few years,"" Block said. ""We will be influencing and advising companies and gaining their trust on how they can change their business model and disrupt the market.""Six Key ServicesSalesforce introduced its first customer relationship management, or CRM, solution in 2000, a year after Benioff co-founded the firm.In addition to its sales-cloud franchise, it now sells five other core services, including recently introduced analytics, community and marketing clouds.The Salesforce1 Platform provides the technology to power its products and lets customers and partners build their own apps.CRM apps allow sales and marketing staffs to record, organize, automate and strategize on customer interactions, using data as a key tool.The company's Marketing Cloud was born out of its $2.25 billion acquisition in 2013 of ExactTarget. It's the fastest growing top-five marketing vendor, Block says, citing research from Gartner.Analytics IntroducedSalesforce is also taking market share while other top-five vendors are losing share, he says.Analytics Cloud was launched in November at the company's annual ""Dreamforce"" conference, which drew 125,000 attendees — ""the largest technology conference in the world,"" Block says.Within two weeks of the Analytics Cloud launch, Salesforce was closing on $1 million-plus deals with several Fortune 500 companies, he says. However, the company has not yet reported sales results.Analytics Cloud lets customers run analytical reports on all digital platforms, including mobile phones and tablets.""In the old world, you go to the IT department to run reports and get the information in three to six weeks,"" Block said. ""They don't provide insights. Ours is all about ... analysis. We put it in the hands of everybody"" to quickly turn ""insights into action.""Though the firm's cloud services are sold to customers of all sizes, Salesforce is transitioning to an ""enterprise-class company,"" Block says.He says it has closed nearly 550 transactions for fiscal 2015 in the ""seven-and-eight-figures,"" about 100 more than last year.""No other cloud computing (company) is closing transactions at this size, scale and volume,"" he said.Driving UberCar service Uber uses Salesforce's integrated platform, which includes analytics, service and marketing clouds to ""power their business,"" Block says.New or expanded client wins in the first quarter, as called out by Benioff in a conference call, included Bouygues Telecom in France, Tyco International (TYC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Expedia (EXPE), Medtronic (MDT) and Western Union (WU), among many others.Salesforce signed a ""major new deal"" with a transportation company — ""one of the world's greatest brands in their category,"" Block said in the call.The unnamed company was using ""on-premise legacy technology from Oracle,"" he said, adding that it plans to put Salesforce1 on mobile devices and ""into the hands of more than 10,000 field employees around the world.""Salesforce's chief rivals in CRM are Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. Management pegs its market share in CRM at 41%, making it the No. 1 player.""We created a bow wave, a movement and a market. Others are tying to surf in our wake,"" Block said, adding that the transition for players with legacy technology is like ""turning a battleship in stormy seas.""Salesforce's addressable market for all its cloud offerings stands at around $62 billion, and it's expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 11%, according to Rob Breza, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities.Helping to fuel that growth will be new wins in international markets — especially Europe and Asia, analysts say.Only 26% of Salesforce's revenue in Q1 was generated outside the U.S., a lower percentage than at Oracle and Microsoft. The largest share was in Europe, where revenue grew 28% from a year earlier, in constant currency.Total revenue in the quarter ended in April rose 23% to $1.51 billion. That put it on track to surpass a $6 billion annual revenue run rate ""faster than any other enterprise software company,"" Benioff said in the Q1 report.Operating cash flow jumped 54% to $731 million. Earnings per share rose 45% to 16 cents.Based on robust Q1 results, Salesforce raised its full-year revenue forecast to $6.55 billion, at the high end of its previous range.Management also upped EPS guidance for 2015 by two cents, to 71 cents per share, for a 37% year-over-year gain.In recently initiating coverage on Salesforce with a ""buy"" rating, analyst Breza of Wunderlich Securities noted that billed and unbilled backlog of over $9.1 billion ""should reassure investors"" that the company can sustain long-term growth.Investors drove up Salesforce stock 12% on April 29 after Bloomberg reported that it was fielding buyout offers. Executives at the company have declined to comment on ""market rumors and speculation.""Government Business Ahead?Analysts expect new wins in U.S. government contracts to provide solid growth opportunities in the future.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy noted that the U.S. General Services Administration is in the early stages of assembling a sizable purchase agreement with Salesforce for CRM products.Salesforce's ""dream"" of achieving $10 billion in revenue is a ""tangible target,"" Murphy wrote in a research note on June 25.The ""customer company,"" he said, has ""blossomed into a true multi-product success story as it now rides atop multiple product pillars of substantial scale and trajectory.""

"
429,WU,"In 2013, you can get your cash in a matter of minutes, using the services of firms that specialize in online, person-to-person money transfers.
"
430,WU,"One of those outfits, Xoom (XOOM), allows customers to make online money transfers from the U.S to foreign countries. It was founded in 2001 and went public in February, making it a mere pup compared to much larger, more established rivals such as Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram International (MGI).
"
431,WU,"Still, Xoom has built a growing business providing person-to-person online money transfer services through its own xoom.com site as well as another website, walmart.xoom.com, that was established through a 2011 partnership between Xoom and discount retail giant Walmart (WMT).
"
432,WU,"Making Money On Money
"
433,WU,"Xoom charges fees to send money and also earns a foreign exchange spread on the amount sent.
"
434,WU,"At midyear, the company boasted more than 915,000 active customers and provided services in 30 countries on six continents. Its sales through the first two quarters of 2013 were up more than 50% from the prior year, and it is expected to post its first annual profit this year.
"
435,WU,"Customers can make transfers using their bank accounts, credit cards or debit cards. Unlike some rivals, Xoom doesn't let customers transfer money between states or from foreign countries to the U.S.
"
436,WU,"Though Xoom only allows transfers that start in the U.S., CEO John Kunze told IBD in an interview earlier this year that there is still plenty of business. (The company currently is in a quiet period prior to its Q3 earnings announcement scheduled for the week of Oct. 21-25.)
"

"
439,WU,"In a report, Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson said that more than 70% of Xoom's revenue comes from three countries: the Philippines, which accounts for about 35%; India, at about 25%; and Mexico, at about 14%.
"
440,WU,"One of Xoom's advantages over rivals is its ""expedient remittance times,"" Johnson said. Customers can send money directly to a recipient's bank account within a few minutes of the initial transaction.

441,WU,"Competition will likely increase in coming quarters as more companies try to grab a piece of the market for online global money transfers, analysts say.
"
442,WU,"Future Of Funding
"
443,WU,"In addition to legacy players such as Western Union and MoneyGram, competition might come from banks, regional players and payment companies such as eBay's (EBAY) PayPal.
"
444,WU,"The fact that Xoom is already entrenched in the market should give it a competitive boost, analysts say.
"
445,WU,"""While we see risk for increased competition, we believe Xoom has established a strong brand in the online market, and the barriers to entry are high,"" Mayank Tandon, analyst at Needham, wrote in a note after Xoom's Q2 earnings report.
"
446,WU,"Legacy players face ""many challenges"" as they try to grow their online business without disrupting their core cash-to-cash offline businesses, Tandon added. He points out that Western Union and MoneyGram get only 4% and 5% of their revenue, respectively, from the online channel.
"
447,WU,"At the same time, both of those companies have a lot more financial might behind them than Xoom. Western Union had nearly $5.7 billion in revenue last year, while MoneyGram posted $1.3 billion.
"

453,WU,"Xoom's stock price debuted at $16 on Feb. 15. Shares peaked at 36.46 on July 29. They tailed off some after that, partly because of market concerns over a secondary offering of 4.4 billion shares in early September. The stock fell as low as 26.34 on Aug. 30, but has since rebounded and currently trades near 32.Let's say you're thousands of miles from home, in a country that doesn't speak your language and doesn't much care that you blew all your cash and credit at the casino and can't pay your hotel bill.In the old days, you might be stuck scrubbing the hotel's bathrooms for a week or more until you could get money wired from back home.In 2013, you can get your cash in a matter of minutes, using the services of firms that specialize in online, person-to-person money transfers.One of those outfits, Xoom (XOOM), allows customers to make online money transfers from the U.S to foreign countries. It was founded in 2001 and went public in February, making it a mere pup compared to much larger, more established rivals such as Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram International (MGI).Still, Xoom has built a growing business providing person-to-person online money transfer services through its own xoom.com site as well as another website, walmart.xoom.com, that was established through a 2011 partnership between Xoom and discount retail giant Walmart (WMT).Making Money On MoneyXoom charges fees to send money and also earns a foreign exchange spread on the amount sent.At midyear, the company boasted more than 915,000 active customers and provided services in 30 countries on six continents. Its sales through the first two quarters of 2013 were up more than 50% from the prior year, and it is expected to post its first annual profit this year.Customers can make transfers using their bank accounts, credit cards or debit cards. Unlike some rivals, Xoom doesn't let customers transfer money between states or from foreign countries to the U.S.Though Xoom only allows transfers that start in the U.S., CEO John Kunze told IBD in an interview earlier this year that there is still plenty of business. (The company currently is in a quiet period prior to its Q3 earnings announcement scheduled for the week of Oct. 21-25.)""The market we're operating in includes about an $82 billion opportunity,"" Kunze said. ""Last year, we processed $3.2 billion, so we have only 4% market share — and a long way to go to build a very big company.""Much of Xoom's business comes from U.S. immigrants who want to send money to family back home.In a report, Raymond James analyst Wayne Johnson said that more than 70% of Xoom's revenue comes from three countries: the Philippines, which accounts for about 35%; India, at about 25%; and Mexico, at about 14%.One of Xoom's advantages over rivals is its ""expedient remittance times,"" Johnson said. Customers can send money directly to a recipient's bank account within a few minutes of the initial transaction.Competition will likely increase in coming quarters as more companies try to grab a piece of the market for online global money transfers, analysts say.Future Of FundingIn addition to legacy players such as Western Union and MoneyGram, competition might come from banks, regional players and payment companies such as eBay's (EBAY) PayPal.The fact that Xoom is already entrenched in the market should give it a competitive boost, analysts say.""While we see risk for increased competition, we believe Xoom has established a strong brand in the online market, and the barriers to entry are high,"" Mayank Tandon, analyst at Needham, wrote in a note after Xoom's Q2 earnings report.Legacy players face ""many challenges"" as they try to grow their online business without disrupting their core cash-to-cash offline businesses, Tandon added. He points out that Western Union and MoneyGram get only 4% and 5% of their revenue, respectively, from the online channel.At the same time, both of those companies have a lot more financial might behind them than Xoom. Western Union had nearly $5.7 billion in revenue last year, while MoneyGram posted $1.3 billion.In contrast, Xoom generated $80 million in 2012 revenue.

"
482,WU,"The WU-14 was launched as part of a missile from the Jiuquan satellite launch facility in China's western Gobi desert and released at the edge of space. It re-enters the atmosphere somewhat like our now retired space shuttle but at a speed of 10 times the speed of sound as it maneuvers toward its intended target.
"
483,WU,"The WU-14 is capable of pulling up after it re-enters the atmosphere and then gliding as it approaches its target. Because it re-enters the atmosphere before a traditional ballistic missile would and can maneuver once it does, it's harder to detect and hit.

484,WU,"Such weapons ""are extremely difficult to defend against because just the time is so compressed between initial detection, being able to get a track, being able to get a fire control solution, and then just being able to have a weapon, that can intercept them in some way just because of the speed at which they're moving,"" Lee Fuell, technical director for force modernization and employment at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, told Congress.

"
502,WU,"On From Ohio
"
503,WU,"Vail was born in Carroll County, Ohio, and grew up in Morristown, N.J. A dreamy boy and voracious reader, he studied and still found time to work as a drugstore clerk.
"
504,WU,"At 19, he moved to New York City and became an apprentice clerk with Western Union (WU). Two years later he moved to Waterloo, Iowa, to join a telegraph operation. He seemed to be wandering.
"
505,WU,"""His father more than once declared that he expected to have to support him,"" Albert Paine wrote in his 1921 biography of Vail, ""In One Man's Life.""
"
506,WU,"Finally, as a 24-year-old clerk with the U.S. railway mail service on the Union Pacific (UNP), he discovered his genius for organization and management.
"
507,WU,"At the time, a man embarking on a train trip reached his destination weeks, even months, before a letter that started the same trip.
"
508,WU,"Vail came up with the idea of sorting mail on board the train, cutting the delay by weeks.
"
509,WU,"His talent caught the eye of the government in Washington, D.C., where managers made him general superintendent of railway services in 1876, when he was 31. The federal post proved a solid training ground for running AT&T.
"
510,WU,"""He developed an understanding of a large-scale system and how to run it,"" Galambos said. ""Everything connected with the railway had to be organized in a fashion that was a little bit different than most businesses. It had to be coordinated over the span of the country. You have to control workers who are far away.""
"
511,WU,"Just two years later, Vail was hired away by the fledgling Bell Telephone Co., controlled by a small group of Boston investors.
"
512,WU,"As general manager, he immediately began building the company, inspired by a vision of a phone system that would link cities, states, even nations. In 1885, Vail resigned his job as general manager of American Bell to become the first president of AT&T, then the long-distance line subsidiary. But the company's Boston investors were more interested in fast profit than Vail's long-term ideas, so he quit in 1887.
"
513,WU,"""The early Bell System was operated just the way Econ 101 will tell you a monopoly will behave,"" Galambos said. ""I distinguish between two kinds of monopolists — smart and dumb, and they were dumb monopolists. They took their money early and took as much as they could get. Their own lawyer called them 'the most hated monopoly in America.'
"
514,WU,"""In 1894 and 1895, when the patents ran out, there was a rush of competitors. They were skimming the cream — taking the city markets, ignoring city markets that weren't fruitful enough and ignoring the countryside. They lost half their market by 1907.''
"
515,WU,"After resigning from AT&T, Vail moved to Argentina and made money in mining, waterpower plants and railway stations.
"
516,WU,"Meanwhile, AT&T was sinking fast, beset by competitors and despised by its customers. Then came the Panic of 1907, and the company again turned to Vail.
"
517,WU,"This time he was 62, his wife and son had died and he was ready for a challenge.
"
518,WU,"He got one. It was an era when bigness was synonymous with nefariousness. AT&T reflected both traits in the eyes of government trustbusters aiming to break up railroad, gas, oil and electric firms.
"
519,WU,"Vail had a plan. Amid the threat of government ownership, he welcomed public regulation of private enterprise as an effective alternative to nationalization.
"
520,WU,"One For All
"
521,WU,"After quickly raising $21 million to shore up AT&T's finances, he turned his attention to the other problems at the phone company. He put an end to his company's harassing of independent phone firms, which now found it attractive to link up with the AT&T system.
"
522,WU,"He announced AT&T's cooperation with government regulations, plus improved wages and benefits for his employees. He promised quality service, long-distance telephoning that carried coast to coast and technological innovation.
"
523,WU,"He also produced the motto: ""One policy, one system and universal service.''
"
524,WU,"Said Galambos: ""That was his mantra. That was what he believed. He had a strategy in mind for what he was going to do with Bell Systems and with AT&T. Part of that involved its relationship with the public and its relationship to the national government and state government. He was not a person to say 'the public be damned.'
"
525,WU,"""He was the kind of person who was aware of external relationships, more so than other tycoons of that era who took a beating by progressive reformers.
"
526,WU,"""He was a smart monopolist. He recognized very clearly the price to be paid was that the monopoly had to behave; it had to behave in regard to the government, it had to behave in regard to public, and it had to behave in terms of being effective and innovative. The key was efficiency and innovation.""
"
527,WU,"Across The Country
"
528,WU,"Early in his second tenure, Vail established Bell Labs, the scientific research arm of AT&T, to make coast-to-coast telephoning happen.
"
529,WU,"By 1913 he was sending teams of workers to string telephone wire across America. Working through blizzards, lightning and thousands of miles of rugged terrain, his men finally joined lines on June 17, 1914, in Wendover, Utah.
"
530,WU,"The longest link stretched 3,505 miles. Seven months later, everything was in place for the first transcontinental phone call.
"
531,WU,"To add pizazz to the historic moment, Bell and Watson were asked to re-enact their first telephone conversation of March 10, 1876, when Bell yelled the famous words, ""Come here, Mr. Watson, I want to see you.""
"
532,WU,"But Bell and Watson drifted off script. At one point during the call, someone reminded Bell to repeat his initial words.
"
533,WU,"After he obliged, Watson replied, ""It would take me a week now.""
"

""Everything connected with the railway had to be organized in a fashion that was a little bit different than most businesses. It had to be coordinated over the span of the country. You have to control workers who are far away.""Just two years later, Vail was hired away by the fledgling Bell Telephone Co., controlled by a small group of Boston investors.As general manager, he immediately began building the company, inspired by a vision of a phone system that would link cities, states, even nations. In 1885, Vail resigned his job as general manager of American Bell to become the first president of AT&T, then the long-distance line subsidiary. But the company's Boston investors were more interested in fast profit than Vail's long-term ideas, so he quit in 1887.""The early Bell System was operated just the way Econ 101 will tell you a monopoly will behave,"" Galambos said. ""I distinguish between two kinds of monopolists — smart and dumb, and they were dumb monopolists. They took their money early and took as much as they could get. Their own lawyer called them 'the most hated monopoly in America.'""In 1894 and 1895, when the patents ran out, there was a rush of competitors. They were skimming the cream — taking the city markets, ignoring city markets that weren't fruitful enough and ignoring the countryside. They lost half their market by 1907.''After resigning from AT&T, Vail moved to Argentina and made money in mining, waterpower plants and railway stations.Meanwhile, AT&T was sinking fast, beset by competitors and despised by its customers. Then came the Panic of 1907, and the company again turned to Vail.This time he was 62, his wife and son had died and he was ready for a challenge.He got one. It was an era when bigness was synonymous with nefariousness. AT&T reflected both traits in the eyes of government trustbusters aiming to break up railroad, gas, oil and electric firms.Vail had a plan. Amid the threat of government ownership, he welcomed public regulation of private enterprise as an effective alternative to nationalization.One For AllAfter quickly raising $21 million to shore up AT&T's finances, he turned his attention to the other problems at the phone company. He put an end to his company's harassing of independent phone firms, which now found it attractive to link up with the AT&T system.He announced AT&T's cooperation with government regulations, plus improved wages and benefits for his employees. He promised quality service, long-distance telephoning that carried coast to coast and technological innovation.He also produced the motto: ""One policy, one system and universal service.''Said Galambos: ""That was his mantra. That was what he believed. He had a strategy in mind for what he was going to do with Bell Systems and with AT&T. Part of that involved its relationship with the public and its relationship to the national government and state government. He was not a person to say 'the public be damned.'""He was the kind of person who was aware of external relationships, more so than other tycoons of that era who took a beating by progressive reformers.""He was a smart monopolist. He recognized very clearly the price to be paid was that the monopoly had to behave; it had to behave in regard to the government, it had to behave in regard to public, and it had to behave in terms of being effective and innovative. The key was efficiency and innovation.""Across The CountryEarly in his second tenure, Vail established Bell Labs, the scientific research arm of AT&T, to make coast-to-coast telephoning happen.By 1913 he was sending teams of workers to string telephone wire across America. Working through blizzards, lightning and thousands of miles of rugged terrain, his men finally joined lines on June 17, 1914, in Wendover, Utah.The longest link stretched 3,505 miles. Seven months later, everything was in place for the first transcontinental phone call.To add pizazz to the historic moment, Bell and Watson were asked to re-enact their first telephone conversation of March 10, 1876, when Bell yelled the famous words, ""Come here, Mr. Watson, I want to see you.""But Bell and Watson drifted off script. At one point during the call, someone reminded Bell to repeat his initial words.After he obliged, Watson replied, ""It would take me a week now.""""This was early high tech,"" Galambos said. ""Vail was a predecessor to what came after World War II. He wanted innovation of all kinds, not just long distance. In many ways he saw over the horizon.""

600,WU,"Apple (AAPL) stuck to its business model in pricing its new iPad Mini starting at $329, a premium to slightly smaller tablets starting at $199, analysts say.
"
601,WU,"Consumers and tech journalists grumbled about the price being too high on Wednesday, a day after Apple announced it at a media event in San Jose, Calif. Apple chose that price because it believes consumers will pay more for a product from the market leader, which has a reputation for quality and an unbeatable selection of software apps, analysts say.
"
602,WU,"Apple ""has a strong track record (of) pricing better than most and the lower price of $329 vs. $399 (for the full-size, earlier-model iPad 2) will drive incremental volume,"" Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said in a research note Wednesday. ""This isn't the first time many have questioned (Apple's) premium pricing strategy. We have seen it with the iPhone, iPod, Macs, and even iPad.

606,WU,"Apple made a good case for charging more for its iPad Mini, Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey said in a research report Tuesday. The iPad Mini has a 35% larger display than 7-inch Google Android tablets and it offers 49% or 67% more viewing area when surfing the Web in portrait and landscape modes, respectively. Plus, the new iPad has access to 275,000 iPad-specific apps, while Android is mostly reusing smartphone apps, Jeffrey says.

668,WU,"A shortage of a new display technology used in Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 5 is likely a big reason why the company shipped a lower-than-expected number of handsets in its debut weekend.
"
669,WU,"The 4-inch in-cell touch-screen display also is the most expensive component of Apple's new smartphone, according to a tear-down estimate Tuesday by IHS iSuppli. It's estimated to cost $44 each, up from $37 for the 3.5-inch display used in last year's model, the iPhone 4S.
"
670,WU,"Japan Display, LG Display (LPL) and Sharp are making the displays for Apple, but they have experienced production problems, analysts say. The new displays pack the touch sensors and liquid crystals into the same layer, allowing for thinner LCD screens and a thinner phone. At 7.6 millimeters thick, the iPhone 5 is 18% thinner than its predecessor.
"
671,WU,"Predictions 'Unrealistic'
"
672,WU,"Apple announced Monday that it had sold more than 5 million iPhone 5 handsets in the first three days of availability. Many analysts expected more, with estimates as high as 10 million units. Those predictions were ""unrealistic,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu, who forecast 4 million to 5 million units in the first weekend.
"
673,WU,"""Every time there's a new technology there's a bit of a learning curve before you can ramp production,"" Wu said. ""There's a bunch of new components here.""
"
674,WU,"Besides the in-cell touch-screen, there's a new baseband chip for 4G LTE wireless from Qualcomm (QCOM) and a new case for the device, Wu said. ""It's a combination of these new components that's causing the supply constraints.""
"
675,WU,"At $34, the Qualcomm wireless chip is the second most expensive component in the iPhone 5, IHS says. The previous Qualcomm chipset cost $23.50.
"
676,WU,"Still, 5 million iPhone 5 units sold in three days is a big number, Wu says. ""In the big picture, it doesn't really matter how many they sell in a few days,"" Wu said. ""It matters what they sell over the next two quarters."" The iPhone 5 could have a product life cycle of 12 to 18 months, he says.
"
677,WU,"But Apple investors couldn't contain their disappointment. Shares fell 2.5% to 673.54 on Tuesday, after falling 1.3% on Monday.
"
678,WU,"IHS broke apart an iPhone 5 to determine its manufacturing cost and the suppliers. The lowest-priced model, one with 16 gigabytes of flash memory, costs $207 to build and sells for $649 without a wireless contract, IHS says. That implies a profit margin of 68%. Higher priced models, those with more data storage capacity, carry higher margins of up to 72%. Profit margins for the previous model, the iPhone 4S, were estimated at 70% and 71%, depending on the amount of flash storage, IHS says.
"
679,WU,"The analysis revealed that SanDisk (SNDK), Elpida and Sony (SNE) have scored component wins in the new smartphone.
"
680,WU,"SanDisk is supplying NAND flash memory chips for the iPhone for the first time with the new handset, IHS says. Other likely flash memory suppliers for the device include Hynix, Samsung and Toshiba.
"
681,WU,"Elpida earned a spot in the iPhone 5 as a supplier of the SDRAM, taking business away from longtime provider Samsung. But Samsung and Hynix could be supplying the memory part to Apple too, IHS says. Micron Technology (MU) is bidding to buy Elpida, which is in bankruptcy.
"
682,WU,"Sony Provides Battery
"
683,WU,"Sony is supplying the battery in the iPhone 5, taking over from Amperex Technology, which built the battery for the iPhone 4S.
"
684,WU,"While IHS saw many of the same component suppliers in the iPhone 5 as in earlier models, ""one name that is conspicuously absent is Samsung,"" IHS analyst Kevin Keller told IBD. ""We have found no evidence that Apple is further relying on Samsung for key components that were once solidly in Samsung's domain — memory, displays, batteries.""

685,WU,"Samsung still produces Apple's application processor, the A6, but Apple reportedly is looking to dual-source production of that chip.

686,WU,"Samsung has emerged as Apple's biggest rival in the smartphone business. Its products use Google's (GOOG) Android operating system.
"
687,WU,"Other component suppliers making a return engagement with the iPhone 5 include Texas Instruments (TXN) (touch-screen controller), STMicroelectronics (STM) (gyroscope and accelerometer), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) (audio chips), Avago Technologies (AVGO) (communications chip), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) (communications chips) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (interface chip for display).A shortage of a new display technology used in Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 5 is likely a big reason why the company shipped a lower-than-expected number of handsets in its debut weekend.The 4-inch in-cell touch-screen display also is the most expensive component of Apple's new smartphone, according to a tear-down estimate Tuesday by IHS iSuppli. It's estimated to cost $44 each, up from $37 for the 3.5-inch display used in last year's model, the iPhone 4S.Japan Display, LG Display (LPL) and Sharp are making the displays for Apple, but they have experienced production problems, analysts say. The new displays pack the touch sensors and liquid crystals into the same layer, allowing for thinner LCD screens and a thinner phone. At 7.6 millimeters thick, the iPhone 5 is 18% thinner than its predecessor.Predictions 'Unrealistic'Apple announced Monday that it had sold more than 5 million iPhone 5 handsets in the first three days of availability. Many analysts expected more, with estimates as high as 10 million units. Those predictions were ""unrealistic,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu, who forecast 4 million to 5 million units in the first weekend.""Every time there's a new technology there's a bit of a learning curve before you can ramp production,"" Wu said. ""There's a bunch of new components here.""Besides the in-cell touch-screen, there's a new baseband chip for 4G LTE wireless from Qualcomm (QCOM) and a new case for the device, Wu said. ""It's a combination of these new components that's causing the supply constraints.""At $34, the Qualcomm wireless chip is the second most expensive component in the iPhone 5, IHS says. The previous Qualcomm chipset cost $23.50.Still, 5 million iPhone 5 units sold in three days is a big number, Wu says. ""In the big picture, it doesn't really matter how many they sell in a few days,"" Wu said. ""It matters what they sell over the next two quarters."" The iPhone 5 could have a product life cycle of 12 to 18 months, he says.But Apple investors couldn't contain their disappointment. Shares fell 2.5% to 673.54 on Tuesday, after falling 1.3% on Monday.IHS broke apart an iPhone 5 to determine its manufacturing cost and the suppliers. The lowest-priced model, one with 16 gigabytes of flash memory, costs $207 to build and sells for $649 without a wireless contract, IHS says. That implies a profit margin of 68%. Higher priced models, those with more data storage capacity, carry higher margins of up to 72%. Profit margins for the previous model, the iPhone 4S, were estimated at 70% and 71%, depending on the amount of flash storage, IHS says.The analysis revealed that SanDisk (SNDK), Elpida and Sony (SNE) have scored component wins in the new smartphone.SanDisk is supplying NAND flash memory chips for the iPhone for the first time with the new handset, IHS says. Other likely flash memory suppliers for the device include Hynix, Samsung and Toshiba.Elpida earned a spot in the iPhone 5 as a supplier of the SDRAM, taking business away from longtime provider Samsung. But Samsung and Hynix could be supplying the memory part to Apple too, IHS says. Micron Technology (MU) is bidding to buy Elpida, which is in bankruptcy.Sony Provides BatterySony is supplying the battery in the iPhone 5, taking over from Amperex Technology, which built the battery for the iPhone 4S.While IHS saw many of the same component suppliers in the iPhone 5 as in earlier models, ""one name that is conspicuously absent is Samsung,"" IHS analyst Kevin Keller told IBD. ""We have found no evidence that Apple is further relying on Samsung for key components that were once solidly in Samsung's domain — memory, displays, batteries.""Samsung still produces Apple's application processor, the A6, but Apple reportedly is looking to dual-source production of that chip.Samsung has emerged as Apple's biggest rival in the smartphone business.

It features more than 20,000 products, ranging from high-priced so-called prestige brands sold in department and specialty stores to lower-priced labels sold via the mass channel, including drugstores and discounters. It also offers a full-service hair salon in its stores.
"
762,WU,"""The key to Ulta's success is providing customers with convenience as a one-stop shop for beauty across all price segments and categories as well as an exciting shopping environment with a continual flow of new products and brands,"" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Wu. ""Most recently we've seen a solid comp acceleration driven primarily by a higher ticket as the prestige skin care and color cosmetics continue to outperform all other categories.""
"
763,WU,"Ulta has seen a nice run-up in its stock, which has traded at several fresh highs since the earnings report. Wu attributes the stock lift to the fact that Ulta saw an improving comp trend in the second quarter.
"
764,WU,"""It also saw a better-than-expected operating margin improvement,"" he added. ""And the company continues to take significant market share in the U.S. beauty market from department stores, which continue to lose share.""
"
765,WU,"Ulta's expansion of prestige brand boutiques for major flagship lines such as Clinique and Lancome, says Wu, has ""strongly resonated"" with customers and helped drive a higher ticket during the quarter.
"
766,WU,"Ulta added 39 Clinique boutiques in the second quarter; so it now has 90 stores featuring this Estee Lauder (EL)-owned brand. It expects to add 10 more Clinique boutiques during 2013. Five Lancome boutiques were added, bringing the total stores offering Lancome products to 85, with 20 additional Lancome boutiques underway.
"
767,WU,"Wu says the prestige segment continues to outperform all other segments in the beauty industry, a lot of which has been driven by strong innovation and solid demand, particularly in skin care.
"
768,WU,"From September 2012 to August 2013, the prestige beauty market grew 6% from a year earlier to $10.7 billion in sales, tallies Karen Grant, vice president and global industry analyst at the NPD Group.
"
769,WU,"Skin care sales grew 8% over that time, and makeup sales 7%.
"
770,WU,"Grant says while the growth in prestige beauty sales is still ""steady and positive,"" it's not quite as accelerated as it had been last year or the prior year, as the industry faces tough comparisons.
"
771,WU,"Ulta has been cashing in on the segment's growth.
"
772,WU,"""Part of what's going on with stores like Ulta is we continue to see the specialty-store channel as the top channel for the prestige shopper,"" Grant told IBD. ""One of the things consumers tell us is they love the format, which offers the freedom to choose from multiple brands. They also love the low pressure of the sales associates.""

"
783,WU,"Ulta ended the second quarter with 609 stores in 46 states. It expects to have 675 stores by year-end. The company's long-term guidance is to grow its square footage by 15% to 20% a year.
"
784,WU,"Chen says that long-term goal translates to ""extremely attractive"" square footage growth. He says the sector average in the companies he follows is between 3% and 5%.
"
785,WU,"Wu expects Ulta's sales to rise at around a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years as it benefits from mid-single-digit comp growth and ""robust"" store expansion. He says it has the ability to double its store base to about 1,200 locations over time.
"
786,WU,"Chen expects Ulta to keep its momentum as it benefits from strong traffic and pricing growth and new product innovations. It has the opportunity to keep gaining share from department stores, he adds.

Earnings climbed 30% to 70 cents a share, 3 cents ahead of forecasts.Revenue popped 25% to $601 million, ahead of analyst views for $588.37 million.Sales for stores open at least 14 months grew 8.4% vs. a year earlier, including the impact of e-commerce. That's a faster pace than the 6.7% gain it saw in the first quarter. E-commerce sales grew 72%, representing 130 basis points of the total company same-store sales increase.Ulta has seen its profits grow by double digit percentages or better for the past 17 quarters. And if Wall Street is on target, that trend will continue. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see full-year 2013 earnings rising 25% to $3.34 a share. They expect a 26% rise in 2014 and a 25% gain in 2015.The impressive report was the first financial showing announced by CEO Mary Dillon, who took the helm July 1.

788,WU,"Bank of America's (BAC) mobile user gains come amid an industry shift that is reducing the need for branches and ATMs and lifting mobile payment firms like Xoom Corp. (XOOM) and Western Union (WU).BofA saw its mobile users jump 28% to 13.2 million from the second quarter of 2012 to Q2 2013, according to a presentation Wednesday. Mobile transactions are up 4%.Meantime, the lender has reduced its banking centers by 5% to 5,328 nationwide, and direct-contact transactions have fallen 12%.Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and Google's (GOOG) Android smartphones are about more than making calls and surfing the Web.Smartphone users at major banks can now check their balance, switch money from their savings to their checking account, and schedule bill payments.Citigroup (C) allows customers to directly send money to other members via its Popmoney app. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) has a similar service.Depositing a check at an ATM used to be an amazing technological feat, but now most banking apps allow customers to take a picture of a check and deposit it via a smartphone app. BofA said that during Q2 4% of all checks to the bank were deposited using a smartphone.BofA shares dipped 0.4% to 14.60 in the stock market today. Citi and JPMorgan were down as well.The growth of smartphones and mobile payments has also boosted money transfer firms. Most of Xoom's customers are immigrants sending money back home to their families. The company's shares have risen 25% since its Feb. 15 debut.With the rise of Xoom, Western Union expanded its online and mobile offerings. After a massive sell-off last year, shares have climbed 38% since the start of this year.The shift to mobile banking comes as banks are trying to cut overhead expenses too. The cost of making a mobile deposit is 13.6 times lower than at a branch office, according to BofA's report.

"
791,WU,"The new Georgia women's watch collection featuring oversized faces and thin straps — at prices from about $75 to $115 — was a big draw, as were the new Olive bracelet watches priced at $95 to $115.
"
792,WU,"Maritza Bringas was first in the line at checkout buying a Georgia watch with a white face and stainless steel strap. Bringas is a big fan of Fossil. It was the fifth Fossil watch she's bought in the past 10 years.
"
793,WU,"""For day to day, I really like the cost and benefits of Fossil watches,"" said Bringas, a visitor from Mexico.
"
794,WU,"Judging from its growth prospects, Fossil Group (FOSL) has plenty of loyal customers like Bringas. The fashion watch and accessories designer and retailer has seen its profits grow by double digits since 2010.
"
795,WU,"And if Wall Street is on target, that trend will continue. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see full-year 2013 earnings rising 16% to $6.30 a share. They expect a 14% rise in 2014 and the same in 2015.

797,WU,"Fossil, an achievable luxury brand known for simplicity and quality construction, makes watches sold under its namesake label and has licensing agreements with hot brands such as Michael Kors (KORS), Burberry and Armani. 
"
798,WU,"Fossil is in the very attractive moderately priced watch sector and has the best brands in the market, says Citi Research analyst Oliver Chen.
"
799,WU,"""It's the best-in-class player in the mid-tier watch category, thanks to their strong brand portfolio and their focus on compelling product design,"" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Wu. ""They really helped create and establish demand for entry-level fashion watches through their product innovation and eye-catching designs.""
"
800,WU,"That message came across clearly in the second quarter. Earnings leapt 24% from a year earlier to $1.15 a share vs. the Street's view for 93 cents. Fossil has logged double-digit profit gains in all but one of the past seven quarters. Revenue popped 11% to $706 million, over forecasts for $691.2 million.
"
801,WU,"The results really turned heads on Wall Street. Fossil's stock shot up 18% on Aug. 6, the day the company reported results, making it one of the big stock movers of the day.
"
802,WU,"""People were afraid they would not meet expectations and they ended up beating them on strong sales and margins. That's unique,"" Chen said.
"
803,WU,"Shares have settled back since, though they are up 22% for the year to date, through early Tuesday afternoon.
"
804,WU,"Chen adds that there's continued investor interest in owning accessories companies over apparel companies because it's a much higher-margin branded business with more global exposure.
"
805,WU,"Fossil's Own Brand Shines
"
806,WU,"Fossil's uptick in sales was driven by a 15% gain in its global watch portfolio vs. a year earlier. It saw double-digit increases from many brands, with double-digit gains in its own Fossil and Skagen brands and its licensed portfolio. Overall jewelry sales jumped 25%.
"
807,WU,"Fossil acquired watchmaker Skagen Designs in 2012. The brand saw a strong mid-teen increase in sales in the second quarter.
"
808,WU,"In addition to watches, Fossil's products include handbags, small leather goods and jewelry.
"
809,WU,"""The brand was up solidly, led by a 14% increase in watches. Jewelry was also up double digits in all geographies due to our new global assortment and easier comparisons from last year. Our leathers business was down for the quarter, mostly due to handbags,"" Fossil CEO Kosta Kartsotis said on the company's Q2 conference call with analysts. ""We believe that the fall assortments that are being delivered to the stores now will reverse this trend.""
"
810,WU,"Fossil sells and distributes its products in more than 450 company-owned-and-operated retail stores and through international e-commerce websites and its U.S. website. They are also sold to department stores, specialty retail stores, and specialty watch and jewelry stores in the U.S. and about 130 countries.
"
811,WU,"Fossil got a strong reception in Europe, where second-quarter wholesale sales popped 16% to $171 million. The growth was fueled by strength in Germany and the United Kingdom.
"
812,WU,"Asia-Pacific wholesale sales were also strong at a 14% gain to $96 million. The region benefited from strong watch sales in China, Japan and India, Wu says.
"
813,WU,"Wholesale sales in North America rose 4%. Results were negatively impacted by this year's earlier Easter, which Fossil estimates shifted $15 million in sales from the second quarter into the first quarter.
"
814,WU,"The company also saw its second-quarter gross margin rise an impressive 190 basis points to 57.9%. Fossil is benefiting from favorable consumer trends in the fashion watch category, where there's not a lot of strong competition, says Chen.
"
815,WU,"People see watches as an important part of their wardrobes, he says, and they often buy multiple watches for different occasions.
"
816,WU,"""Watches are important on the fashion runway,"" adds Chen. ""There's a multi-year trend in watches. And they have strong global appeal because there are minimal size issues and watch fashion trends are more global vs. apparel.""
"
817,WU,"Fossil has made sure to keep coming up with new offerings to wow consumers.
"
818,WU,"In February, it announced a licensing pact with designer brand Tory Burch to develop watches for the sportswear company. It plans to launch them ahead of the 2014 Christmas holiday.
"
819,WU,"""Fossil continues to introduce strong new brands whether it's Skagen or most recently Tory Burch, which will debut in late 2014,"" Wu said. ""Through its scale, Fossil has the ability to quickly identify emerging trends and adapt its new products accordingly.""
"
820,WU,"Making The Goods
"
821,WU,"Fossil benefits from owning most of its supply chain, which lets the company design faster and manage its inventories better, adds Chen.
"
822,WU,"More than 61% of Fossil's non-Swiss-made watch production was assembled through wholly owned or majority-owned factories in 2012. This ""vertical integration"" allows for better flow of communication, consistent quality, product design protection and improved supply chain speed, according to a company filing with the SEC. But it still lets Fossil use non-owned production facilities for their unique capabilities and to cover production needs beyond internal capacities.
"
823,WU,"Watchers expect Fossil to keep up its momentum. And sales should stay strong, Wu says.
"
824,WU,"""Fossil has the ability to sustain a double-digit annual sales pace over the next five years, thanks to the outperformance of Asia-Pacific,"" he said. ""Fossil should benefit from the burgeoning middle-class population in China, which remains a highly underpenetrated market.""
"
825,WU,"Chen sees China as a ""huge growth opportunity"" for Fossil, given the power of the brand and its strong business in Japan and Korea. And he sees more growth coming from India in the future.
"
826,WU,"Wu expects Fossil's business in Europe to also maintain a low-double-digit annual sales pace over the next five years.

844,WU,"The iPad 2 launched on March 11, 2011. Apple later said it sold 4.7 million iPads in the quarter ended March 26, 2011, but that it could have sold more except for supply constraints. That might again be the case.
"
845,WU,"Lower-priced iPad 2 tablets will help boost sales near term, Wu point outs. ""The iPad 2 is actually selling pretty well,"" he said.
"
846,WU,"Apple's older iPad 2 tablets are available for $100 less than before, starting at $399.
"
847,WU,"Meanwhile, the new iPad is priced starting at $499 for a Wi-Fi only model with 16 gigabytes of storage.
"
848,WU,"Apple still largely has the tablet market to itself, says ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. ""From a competitive perspective, it's pretty smooth sailing for Apple,"" he said.
"
849,WU,"In full-featured tablets, Apple's biggest competitor is Samsung's Galaxy Tab, which runs Google's (GOOG) Android operating system. Amazon.com (AMZN) also competes with the iPad, but its offering — the Kindle Fire — is a stripped-down, small-screen Android tablet. The Kindle Fire has a 7-inch display and sells for $199.
"
850,WU,"Marshall predicts that iPads will account for 60 million of the 90 million tablets sold this year.
"
851,WU,"Yet the newness of the iPad seems to have worn off. Hudson Square analyst Daniel Ernst reported Friday that lines for the new tablet were more than 75% shorter than the crowds that gathered for the launch of the iPad 2 a year ago. His observation was based on lines outside five retail locations in Connecticut and New York.
"
852,WU,"""All but three of the people we spoke with already owned an iPad,"" Ernst wrote in a research note. ""During our iPad 2 survey last year we found 69% of our 80 respondents did not already have the iPad 1.""
"
853,WU,"The new iPad features an ultrahigh-resolution Retina display for razor-sharp text and crisp photos and video. The 9.7-inch display delivers four times the number of pixels as the current iPad 2.
"
854,WU,"The third-generation iPad also has a faster processor with better graphics, improved camera, high-definition video recording, and voice dictation, with the same battery life as the current iPad 2.
"
855,WU,"Battery life is one area competitors will have a tough time matching, Wu says. Apple was able to keep battery life the same because it uses its own chips, software and battery chemistry, he says.
"
856,WU,"And 4G wireless is a notorious battery hog, he says.

857,WU,"Apple had sold 55.3 million iPads as of Dec. 31. It sold 15.4 million iPads Q4 alone. The original iPad debuted in April 2010.

The stock rose a fraction Friday to 585.57.Apple (AAPL) fans lined up outside retail stores Friday to get their hands on the company's third-generation iPad tablet computer.By at least one analyst's count, lines were far shorter this time.And many shoppers were upgrading to the new device from Apple's original iPad, having skipped the intermediate iPad 2 release last year.""I'm upgrading,"" said Tanja Brandt of Potomac Falls, Va. ""I sold my first iPad so I could get this one.""Brandt was one of about 200 people lined up outside the Apple store in Reston, Va., early Friday.She was getting the pricier model iPad with high-speed 4G LTE wireless connectivity so she can connect to the Internet anywhere.""My iPad will go wherever I go,"" she said. ""I have all my addresses, contacts, calendar, email, games, books, music and movies on it.""Her son Connor, 18, also was getting a new iPad on Friday. For him, it was a choice between getting a used car or a shiny, new iPad.Fordham University student Robby Abiera, 23, drove about five hours from New York City to Reston with some friends and waited in line four hours to get the new iPad. That was preferable to waiting a couple of days in line at an Apple store in New York, he said.Abiera had the original iPad, which was for personal use and schoolwork.Supplies of the new iPad, which many are calling the iPad 3, are expected to be tight for several weeks. Apple's website says orders for the new iPad will ship in two to three weeks.""It's not much of a surprise that you're seeing all these lines globally,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu.

"
874,WU,"Banga, who became CEO in April 2010, has a game plan to ramp up revenue at MasterCard (MA) by getting consumers to replace the use of cash and checks with payments made through the company's global electronic network. Analysts say the recent deal better positions the company to carry out this strategy.
"
875,WU,"""MasterCard is going well beyond being a network,"" said Philip Philliou, managing partner of Philliou Partners, a New York City-based payments consulting firm. ""They're making it much easier for consumers to participate in electronic commerce.""
"
876,WU,"MasterCard on Dec. 1 announced a pact and strategic investment in mFoundry, a provider of mobile banking services for financial institutions and retailers. The move lets consumers pay for goods or services with their mobile phones by using MasterCard's PayPass technology and mFoundry's mobile financial services platform.

The expanded partnership makes MasterCard the preferred brand for Western Union-backed prepaid card programs and makes Western Union the preferred money transfer service for MasterCard.
"
880,WU,"And on Nov. 14, MasterCard said it was joining with chipmaker Intel (INTC) in payments technology. The collaboration is designed to provide more options for secure and easy processing for retailers and consumers using Ultrabook notebooks and future generations of Intel-based PCs.

904,WU,"Adolph Zukor was willing to wait an eternity if he had to.
"
905,WU,"It was 1912.
"
906,WU,"Zukor, a fur trader-turned arcade tycoon, had paid $40,000 for the rights to show the French film ""Queen Elizabeth"" in America.
"
907,WU,"At 40 minutes and four reels, it was twice as long as the longest movie shown stateside.
"
908,WU,"Zukor swore this show — which he called a feature film — would feel more like a classical play than the quick, slapstick movies that cut film's teeth. He bet this would be a turning point for the industry.
"
909,WU,"He was right. More businessman that artist, Zukor who brought the feature film to America.
"
910,WU,"He also came up with an efficient business model that made movies a profitable enterprise.
"
911,WU,"As president and chairman of Paramount Pictures, Zukor built the studio that would make such top-grossing films as 1952's ""The Greatest Show on Earth,"" 1956's ""The Ten Commandments,"" 1972's ""The Godfather"" and 1997's ""Titanic.""
"
912,WU,"Colorful Shift
"
913,WU,"Zukor (1873-1976) had a bright inner vision, turning into Technicolor. Selling others on that dazzling view helped move motion pictures from the Nickelodeon to the silver screen and Cineplex.
"
914,WU,"To present that first feature, Zukor needed an OK from Jeremiah Kennedy, head of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Co., known as the Edison Trust. It controlled how every American movie was made, shown and marketed.
"
915,WU,"Kennedy was running late for this 1912 meeting that would make history. So Zukor sat.
"
916,WU,"""Patience has always seemed to me more than a copybook virtue,"" he later wrote in his autobiography, ""The Public Is Never Wrong.""
"
917,WU,"After three hours, Kennedy called Zukor into his office.
"
918,WU,"""He sat behind his big desk, looking every inch the captain of industry, listening with some impatience while I recited my arguments,"" Zukor recalled.
"
919,WU,"Kennedy's verdict: ""The time is not ripe for feature pictures.""
"
920,WU,"Zukor had a choice: Lose his investment. Or play outlaw and show ""Queen Elizabeth"" without the trust's blessing.
"
921,WU,"""I determined to go ahead, with faith that success of feature pictures would force the trust to license my products,"" he later said.
"
922,WU,"Lesson? Sometimes it pays to be a maverick.
"
923,WU,"""He was delicate, almost diffident, but possessed of a will of iron,"" Grant McCracken, an expert in American culture and business who has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge, told IBD.
"
924,WU,"Zukor's gambit worked.
"
925,WU,"""Queen Elizabeth,"" became the first of many box-office hits for him. It earned $200,000 — worth $4.8 million today — and drew the much-coveted higher-class customer base that had written off films as an oddball waste of time.
"
926,WU,"That was just the beginning of Zukor' smashing career in movies.
"
927,WU,"""He was an astute financial operator,"" said Christopher Sharrett, professor of film studies at Seton Hall University. ""Zukor made Paramount one of the most respected Hollywood studios.""
"
928,WU,"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer founder Samuel Goldfish (later Goldwyn) considered Zukor a huge rival — and the standard. He modeled his company after Zukor's.
"
929,WU,"""Where Zukor was, Goldfish was never far behind,"" said Scott Berg, author of ""Goldwyn: A Biography.""
"
930,WU,"Long-Distance Moves
"
931,WU,"Born in Ricse, Hungary, Zukor lost both parents by the time he was 8. He went to live with his uncle and apprenticed as a shopkeeper. Under Hungarian restrictions, sweeping floors and waiting on customers were about as good as it got for a village orphan.
"
932,WU,"""You might have far better qualifications as a tailor or a carpenter, but to switch from one trade to another was impossible,"" Zukor later recalled. ""I could see nothing but darkness.""
"
933,WU,"At 14, Zukor crafted a compelling letter to Hungary's orphan bureau, pleading to go to America. Two years later, he was on a steamship bound for New York Harbor.
"
934,WU,"Lesson? See what could be, in passionate detail — and share your vision to move up.
"
935,WU,"Zukor soon got a job sweeping floors for $2 — worth $50 today — a week. His hard work landed him a gig as a fur shop apprentice, at three times that salary. Eventually he opened his own fur shop and made a fortune.
"
936,WU,"In his spare time, Zukor got into the sport of boxing. He was shy and stood 5 feet, 5 inches. In the ring, though, he learned how to brace, feisty, against larger opponents.
"
937,WU,"Now For Film
"
938,WU,"By 1903, the first time he stood — on tiptoe — to peep at a ""movie machine,"" 30-year-old Zukor was enthralled. He visited a cash-strapped penny arcade and decided to back it.
"
939,WU,"Show business replaced fur.
"
940,WU,"By 1907, though, arcades started to bleed. ""The public began to lose interest in films,"" Zukor said. ""The novelty had worn off and the picture makers remained in a rut.""
"
941,WU,"Zukor kept trying new things, but nothing stuck. Then Zukor went a-ha! He wondered:
"
942,WU,"Why couldn't the movies be like classical plays?
"
943,WU,"Why couldn't films last longer than 10 minutes?
"
944,WU,"Why not put stars' names in lights?
"
945,WU,"Why not show films in lavish theaters, where patrons could lose themselves in some big story?
"
946,WU,"Lesson? Start innovating by asking big questions.
"
947,WU,"Inspired, Zukor wrote a slogan: ""Famous players in famous plays.""
"
948,WU,"Famous Players Film Co. was born.
"
949,WU,"Zukor dreamed of producing his own movies, but he needed a quick hit to get going.
"
950,WU,"French-made ""Queen Elizabeth,"" which debuted in July 1912, starring stage actress Sarah Bernhardt, ""fulfilled Zukor's hopes, and it anchored a whole new business model premised on 'famous players,' or what we call bankable stars,"" said Tim Wu, telecommunications law professor at Columbia University and author of ""The Master Switch.""
"
951,WU,"The Edison Trust went ballistic, launching shots against all independent filmmakers.
"
952,WU,"It filed hundreds of lawsuits, then brought in the thugs. ""Though an injunction will not stop a man from making films, a broken camera will,"" wrote Maurice Bardeche and Robert Brasillach in ""The History of Motion Pictures.""
"
953,WU,"Eventually the U.S. government stepped in with antitrust charges against Edison.
"
954,WU,"To dodge those shots from the Edison Trust, rogue filmmakers, with Zukor at the helm, moved production to Hollywood, Calif.
"
955,WU,"His Famous Players Fiction Studios opened its doors in 1915.
"
956,WU,"""Hollywood was still like a swampy area,"" Sharrett said. ""There wasn't much going on out there yet.""
"
957,WU,"There sure was after Zukor. He became a star spotter, sensing magical qualities in actors long before anyone else. Mary Pickford, Rudolph Valentino, Gary Cooper, Bing Crosby, Marlene Dietrich and Mae West all went to work for him.
"
958,WU,"Zukor proved a master at managing supernova-sized egos. He once achieved peace between two bickering divas by basing one in New York, the other in Hollywood.
"
959,WU,"""He had a fine touch with stars,"" said McCracken.
"
960,WU,"In 1913, Famous Players produced its first original feature film, ""The Prisoner of Zenda."" Eleven feature films followed that year.
"
961,WU,"Longer films cost more, so Famous Players needed to pack movie houses coast to coast.
"
962,WU,"Zukor targeted small towns. He merged with rival studios and consolidated distribution firms.
"
963,WU,"He bought theaters until he could manage and streamline the whole moviemaking, distribution and exhibition process.
"
964,WU,"Fifty years later, another shopkeeper named Sam Walton worked the same vein to hatch Wal-Mart (WMT). Lesson? Get lean to grow.
"
965,WU,"One of the firms Zukor consolidated was a distribution firm called Paramount. Zukor eventually put that name in place of Famous Players.
"
966,WU,"To maximize efficiency, Zukor sold films to theaters in bulk. Known as block booking, this wholesale approach rankled other production and distribution firms.
"
967,WU,"""Zukor could force theaters to rent an entire slate of mediocre films, just to get their hands on one Mary Pickford feature,"" Berg said.
"
968,WU,"Competing studios punched back, forming alliances with independent theater owners, who boycotted Paramount.

969,WU,"""In self-defense, our company began to buy theaters, including strings of them,"" Zukor said. ""The battle commenced to wax hot.""
"
970,WU,"Award-Winning Experience
"
971,WU,"Caught up in the firefight, Zukor overspent. Then the Great Depression hit. Paramount went bankrupt in 1933. Lesson? Compete, but keep your cool.
"
972,WU,"In 1935, when Paramount reorganized, Zukor stepped down as president and became chairman. He stayed with the company in a steering capacity until his death four decades later at age 103.
"
973,WU,"In 1948, Zukor won an Academy Award for his contributions to the film industry. Many call him the father of feature films.
"
974,WU,"He never stopped dreaming.
"
975,WU,"""The film industry is still in swaddling clothes,"" he said toward the end of his life. ""The great days lie in the future.""Adolph Zukor was willing to wait an eternity if he had to.It was 1912.Zukor, a fur trader-turned arcade tycoon, had paid $40,000 for the rights to show the French film ""Queen Elizabeth"" in America.At 40 minutes and four reels, it was twice as long as the longest movie shown stateside.Zukor swore this show — which he called a feature film — would feel more like a classical play than the quick, slapstick movies that cut film's teeth. He bet this would be a turning point for the industry.He was right. More businessman that artist, Zukor who brought the feature film to America.He also came up with an efficient business model that made movies a profitable enterprise.As president and chairman of Paramount Pictures, Zukor built the studio that would make such top-grossing films as 1952's ""The Greatest Show on Earth,"" 1956's ""The Ten Commandments,"" 1972's ""The Godfather"" and 1997's ""Titanic.""Colorful ShiftZukor (1873-1976) had a bright inner vision, turning into Technicolor. Selling others on that dazzling view helped move motion pictures from the Nickelodeon to the silver screen and Cineplex.To present that first feature, Zukor needed an OK from Jeremiah Kennedy, head of Thomas Edison's Motion Picture Patents Co., known as the Edison Trust. It controlled how every American movie was made, shown and marketed.Kennedy was running late for this 1912 meeting that would make history. So Zukor sat.""Patience has always seemed to me more than a copybook virtue,"" he later wrote in his autobiography, ""The Public Is Never Wrong.""After three hours, Kennedy called Zukor into his office.""He sat behind his big desk, looking every inch the captain of industry, listening with some impatience while I recited my arguments,"" Zukor recalled.Kennedy's verdict: ""The time is not ripe for feature pictures.""Zukor had a choice: Lose his investment. Or play outlaw and show ""Queen Elizabeth"" without the trust's blessing.""I determined to go ahead, with faith that success of feature pictures would force the trust to license my products,"" he later said.Lesson? Sometimes it pays to be a maverick.""He was delicate, almost diffident, but possessed of a will of iron,"" Grant McCracken, an expert in American culture and business who has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge, told IBD.Zukor's gambit worked.""Queen Elizabeth,"" became the first of many box-office hits for him. It earned $200,000 — worth $4.8 million today — and drew the much-coveted higher-class customer base that had written off films as an oddball waste of time.That was just the beginning of Zukor' smashing career in movies.""He was an astute financial operator,"" said Christopher Sharrett, professor of film studies at Seton Hall University. ""Zukor made Paramount one of the most respected Hollywood studios.""Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer founder Samuel Goldfish (later Goldwyn) considered Zukor a huge rival — and the standard. He modeled his company after Zukor's.""Where Zukor was, Goldfish was never far behind,"" said Scott Berg, author of ""Goldwyn: A Biography.""Long-Distance MovesBorn in Ricse, Hungary, Zukor lost both parents by the time he was 8. He went to live with his uncle and apprenticed as a shopkeeper. Under Hungarian restrictions, sweeping floors and waiting on customers were about as good as it got for a village orphan.""You might have far better qualifications as a tailor or a carpenter, but to switch from one trade to another was impossible,"" Zukor later recalled. ""I could see nothing but darkness.""At 14, Zukor crafted a compelling letter to Hungary's orphan bureau, pleading to go to America. Two years later, he was on a steamship bound for New York Harbor.Lesson? See what could be, in passionate detail — and share your vision to move up.Zukor soon got a job sweeping floors for $2 — worth $50 today — a week. His hard work landed him a gig as a fur shop apprentice, at three times that salary. Eventually he opened his own fur shop and made a fortune.In his spare time, Zukor got into the sport of boxing. He was shy and stood 5 feet, 5 inches. In the ring, though, he learned how to brace, feisty, against larger opponents.Now For FilmBy 1903, the first time he stood — on tiptoe — to peep at a ""movie machine,"" 30-year-old Zukor was enthralled. He visited a cash-strapped penny arcade and decided to back it.Show business replaced fur.By 1907, though, arcades started to bleed. ""The public began to lose interest in films,"" Zukor said. ""The novelty had worn off and the picture makers remained in a rut.""Zukor kept trying new things, but nothing stuck. Then Zukor went a-ha! He wondered:Why couldn't the movies be like classical plays?Why couldn't films last longer than 10 minutes?Why not put stars' names in lights?Why not show films in lavish theaters, where patrons could lose themselves in some big story?Lesson? Start innovating by asking big questions.Inspired, Zukor wrote a slogan: ""Famous players in famous plays.""Famous Players Film Co. was born.Zukor dreamed of producing his own movies, but he needed a quick hit to get going.French-made ""Queen Elizabeth,"" which debuted in July 1912, starring stage actress Sarah Bernhardt, ""fulfilled Zukor's hopes, and it anchored a whole new business model premised on 'famous players,' or what we call bankable stars,"" said Tim Wu, telecommunications law professor at Columbia University and author of ""The Master Switch.""The Edison Trust went ballistic, launching shots against all independent filmmakers.It filed hundreds of lawsuits, then brought in the thugs.

"
977,WU,"Investors generally liked what they saw. Apple's stock rose a fraction on the news Wednesday and rose another 2.1% on Thursday, near its all-time high.

"
986,WU,"Some competitors, namely Amazon (AMZN) and Barnes & Noble (BKS), offer stripped-down tablets with smaller screens for $199.

1006,WU,"Apple (AAPL) delivered another blowout quarter late Tuesday, posting fiscal Q3 results that trounced expectations on better-than-expected sales of iPhones and iPads.
"
1007,WU,"Apple earned $7.79 a share, up 122% from the year-ago quarter, on sales of $28.57 billion, up 82%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $5.85 a share on sales of $25 billion for the quarter ended June 25.

1008,WU,"It marked the second straight quarter of accelerating EPS growth for Apple.

1009,WU,"The results were ""unbelievably strong,"" said Shaw Wu, an analyst with Sterne Agee. ""For them to produce such a strong quarter outside of the holidays is just remarkable. (Apple) continues to be one of the great growth stories in America.""

1010,WU,"For the current quarter, the company offered its usual very conservative guidance. It expects to earn about $5.50 a share on sales of about $25 billion. Even before the Q3 results, Wall Street had targeted $6.45, up 39%, on sales of $27.72 billion, up 36%.

1023,WU,"Apple's (AAPL) iPad sales likely will come in below estimates for the holiday quarter, largely due to supply constraints on the iPad Mini, Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu said in a research note Wednesday.The iPad Mini also is cannibalizing potential sales of fourth-generation iPads, leading to lower build orders, he said.On the plus side, iPhone sales and gross profit margin likely will surprise on the upside, Wu said, based on his supplier checks. Apple has improved its supply of the new iPhone 5 in recent weeks, he says.Apple shares probably will continue to be volatile through year-end, as investors take profits and stay on the sidelines because of fears of higher tax rates next year, Wu said.Wu raised his iPhone sales forecast to 47.5 million units, up from 47.3 million and the consensus estimate of 45 million to 46 million for the December quarter. He cut his iPad sales forecast to 23.5 million units, from his previous 25 million and the consensus of 23 million to 24 million. He kept his forecast for Mac computer sales at 5 million units, below the consensus of 5.2 million to 5.3 million units.Wu lowered his December-quarter revenue estimate for Apple to $54.4 billion, from $54.6 billion, but kept his earnings-per-share target at $13.70.

Those two product areas still provide most of its revenue, but the company has been scrambling to build revenue in newer areas such as collaboration services and wireless communications. The company has also jumped on new trends such as software defined networking, which is expected to help companies manage their data networks more efficiently at less cost.For the quarter ended in January, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cisco to report earnings per share minus items of 48 cents, a penny better than in the year-earlier quarter. That would end four quarters of double-digit EPS gains.Revenue is expected to rise 4.6% to $12 billion.Demand in categories including routers, services, wireless, security and data centers will likely be key revenue drivers in the quarter, Wu says.For the current quarter, analysts expect Cisco to deliver EPS ex items of 49 cents, 1 cent better than the year-ago quarter.Analysts expect revenue of $12.2 billion, up 5.3%.The sluggish IT market in Europe continues, but increasing demand for mobile networks could limit the damage, Wu says.""We are concerned with continued weak trends in Europe, but this appears to be more than offset by strength in service providers due to the build-out of 4G LTE wireless infrastructure,"" he wrote.Cisco shares, up more than 25% in the past three months since beating views on its prior earnings report, hit a 2-year high intraday on Monday.

In a research note Monday, Wu estimated HTC's per-phone licensing fee to Apple based on conversations with industry sources.

Cook said Apple has sold 84 million iPads since its launch in early 2010, and joshed that other tablets ""must be at the bottom of someone's bottom drawer.""The focus on business users with new tablets will be marked by ""strong security, manageability and durability,"" Marlene Somsak, an HP spokeswoman, said via email.HP's tablet history is spotty.In July 2011, it released TouchPad tablets and other devices that featured the WebOS operating system it picked up as part of its acquisition of Palm, a mobile device maker, for $1.2 billion in 2010. Palm and WebOS already were declining then, however, and HP halted its TouchPad sales after just 49 days.The company said at the time that its WebOS products ""have not met internal milestones and financial targets.""The product simply failed to catch on, says Mawston.""The products launched with WebOS were not particularly exciting for consumers and enterprises,"" he said. ""There wasn't much demand.""HP has offered tablets with Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system since 2010, but they've garnered scant attention. IDC says HP is the world's No. 36 seller of tablets, a field dominated by Apple and No. 2 Samsung.HP's track record in tablets doesn't inspire confidence, says Shaw Wu, an analyst for Sterne Agee & Leach.""It remains to be seen if HP will ever have success"" with tablets, he said.IDC analyst Tom Mainelli says one feature of Windows 8 that might be a problem for HP is its use of touch-screen technology. While touch-screens have quickly become a favorite feature among consumer users of iPads and other tablets, business users could be another story, Mainelli says.""There is going to be a fair amount of confusion and frustration from (enterprise) end users, particularly those that are using nontouch-based devices,"" he said.Mawston, though, says using Windows has advantages.""Microsoft has a huge installed base of enterprises and HP can try to leverage some of that goodwill,"" he said.Business adoption of tablets is still in the early stages. A Forrester Research poll late last year found that only 28% of employers paid for tablets that employees used to do their jobs.HP is trying to target companies, says Mawston, as opposed to selling a device consumers might also want to use at work.""It's been a back-door enterprise market so far and HP wants to target more of the front-door enterprise market,"" he said.As with consumers, enterprise use of tablets is expected to rise fast. Global sales of tablets are expected to jump more than 50% this year to $57.7 billion, says a report this month by JPMorgan. Previously, the investment bank had expected 40.5% growth.PC Sales SlumpingHP is trying to find new growth areas as its core PC and printer businesses decline. Global PC sales will fall 2.3% this year and printers will fall 10.5%, says JPMorgan.HP's ailing PC unit still accounts for about 30% of company revenue, says Sterne Agee's Wu.""I don't think they really want to (release a new tablet) but they have to because the PC business is getting eaten,"" Wu said. ""They have to try to defend"" their PC business.HP can't afford to miss out in tablets, says Mawston.""All of the companies that were in the old laptop computer game need to be in the new tablet game,"" he said.

1176,WU,"Under Chief Executive Tim Cook, Apple has continued to be successful, while becoming more open and compassionate to social causes. At the same time, the company's once-cool image has turned dorky.

1177,WU,"Cook took over as CEO one year ago Friday when Apple's (AAPL) iconic co-founder, Steve Jobs, stepped down due to his failing health. Cook, formerly chief operating officer, had experience running the company during Jobs' three medical leaves. Jobs died from pancreatic cancer on Oct. 5, 2011, at age 56.

"
1181,WU,"Cook's Ads Half-Baked
"
1182,WU,"One has to wonder whether Apple's recent ad campaigns involving Siri and retail store ""Genius Bar"" employees would have been approved by Jobs.
"
1183,WU,"Those ads received heavy criticism in the press and made the company appear more dorky than cool. The ""Genius"" commercials ran for a brief time during the summer Olympics and were quickly pulled.
"
1184,WU,"""Those Olympic ads were horrible,"" said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. ""If Steve were still around, those Olympic ads probably would never have seen the light of day.""
"
1185,WU,"The commercials showed a blue-shirted Apple retail employee helping people in everyday situations. The ads insulted Apple's customers, portraying them as clueless, critics said.
"
1186,WU,"""That campaign made the users look stupid,"" said Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle. ""You want to convey the impression that smart people buy Apple products. People like to identify with smart people.""
"
1187,WU,"The Siri ads show celebrities like Zooey Deschanel, Samuel Jackson and John Malkovich interacting with the voice-recognition software on the iPhone 4S. Unfortunately those ads made the actors look foolish and not entirely sane, Enderle says.
"
1188,WU,"While the ads were produced by an outside advertising agency, Cook should have used his veto power to spike them, he says.
"
1189,WU,"Another potential problem at Apple is product delays. The next-generation iPhone, expected to be released in September, should have been on the market by now, Enderle says. Apple's iPhone line needed to be refreshed sooner to compete with more advanced handsets from rival Samsung.
"
1190,WU,"Jobs had the ability to set aggressive deadlines and push products through with his fiery, charismat ic personality. Cook likely will need to micromanage more and roll heads if goals aren't met, Enderle says.
"
1191,WU,"Most analysts give Cook high marks overall for managing Apple so far.

1205,WU,"Related Article: Apple's Cook Getting High Marks, Red Flag.Under Chief Executive Tim Cook, Apple has continued to be successful, while becoming more open and compassionate to social causes. At the same time, the company's once-cool image has turned dorky.Cook took over as CEO one year ago Friday when Apple's (AAPL) iconic co-founder, Steve Jobs, stepped down due to his failing health. Cook, formerly chief operating officer, had experience running the company during Jobs' three medical leaves. Jobs died from pancreatic cancer on Oct. 5, 2011, at age 56.Cook always has gotten high marks for his operational skills. He's a tough negotiator with suppliers, keeps a lean inventory and manages cash and expenses well.But Jobs was known for his artistic taste and attention to detail when it came to products, marketing and advertising. And that's where Apple is showing worrying signs of losing its way.In the authorized biography ""Steve Jobs,"" Walter Isaacson details how Jobs was intimately involved in the company's advertising campaigns.Cook's Ads Half-BakedOne has to wonder whether Apple's recent ad campaigns involving Siri and retail store ""Genius Bar"" employees would have been approved by Jobs.Those ads received heavy criticism in the press and made the company appear more dorky than cool. The ""Genius"" commercials ran for a brief time during the summer Olympics and were quickly pulled.""Those Olympic ads were horrible,"" said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. ""If Steve were still around, those Olympic ads probably would never have seen the light of day.""The commercials showed a blue-shirted Apple retail employee helping people in everyday situations. The ads insulted Apple's customers, portraying them as clueless, critics said.""That campaign made the users look stupid,"" said Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle. ""You want to convey the impression that smart people buy Apple products. People like to identify with smart people.""The Siri ads show celebrities like Zooey Deschanel, Samuel Jackson and John Malkovich interacting with the voice-recognition software on the iPhone 4S. Unfortunately those ads made the actors look foolish and not entirely sane, Enderle says.While the ads were produced by an outside advertising agency, Cook should have used his veto power to spike them, he says.Another potential problem at Apple is product delays. The next-generation iPhone, expected to be released in September, should have been on the market by now, Enderle says. Apple's iPhone line needed to be refreshed sooner to compete with more advanced handsets from rival Samsung.Jobs had the ability to set aggressive deadlines and push products through with his fiery, charismat ic personality. Cook likely will need to micromanage more and roll heads if goals aren't met, Enderle says.Most analysts give Cook high marks overall for managing Apple so far.""He's done an outstanding job,"" said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu. ""He was handpicked by Steve to succeed him and he's proven to be the right choice. The company continues to execute well.""Apple's stock price is near record highs, showing investors have confidence in the company's performance and road map, says Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin.""From an operations standpoint, Tim didn't skip a beat,"" Bajarin said.In his first year as CEO, Cook has shown himself to be differ ent from Jobs in a couple of ways.First, he's been more open and transparent about Apple's operations than his predecessor, Marshall says.

1264,WU,"The prospect of software minimizing the need for hardware has networking leaders Cisco and VMware scrambling to latch onto an emerging technology called software defined networks.
"
1265,WU,"With at least one notable exception, analysts say SDN is no hardware killer. But SDN increasingly looks like a technology that will be widely used to augment computer networks — and that's why Cisco Systems (CSCO) and VMware (VMW) aren't taking any chances.
"
1266,WU,"They so far are the biggest companies jockeying in the SDN market, providing a software architecture that helps companies build and configure networks that can deliver more automation, utilization and programmability.
"
1267,WU,"VMware entered the market last month, saying it would buy SDN vendor Nicira for $1.2 billion. VMware is the No. 1 maker of virtualization software, which lets companies run multiple software programs on one server and which analysts say likely will work in conjunction with SDN.

"
1271,WU,"But don't expect SDN to reduce a company's spending on computer network gear, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for research firm IDC.
"
1272,WU,"""Think of SDN as an abstraction layer above the physical infrastructure,"" he said. ""For anyone to say companies will need less network and ports and that Cisco is in trouble is jumping the gun.""

"
1274,WU,"""It makes sense to hedge your bets,"" he said.
"
1275,WU,"Many companies perceive SDN as another step toward adopting virtualization and cloud computing, says Andre Kindness, an analyst for Forrester Research. Cloud computing lets companies store and access their data in data centers with servers that run virtualization software, which send that data to customers via the Internet.
"
1276,WU,"Virtualization alone isn't able to fully accomplish this goal, Kindness said, ""and that's the reason SDN is so hot.""
"
1277,WU,"SDN is sort of a glue bringing more cohesion between a company's hardware and software in data center networks, says Mehra. ""SDN will bring to the table a high level of programmability and flexibility,"" he said.
"
1278,WU,"But at least one analyst calls SDN much more disruptive.
"
1279,WU,"VMware buying Nicira is ""a game-changing moment that will speed customer adoption of SDN architectures,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in a report last month. He says efficiencies from SDN will allow companies to reduce spending on network gear.
"
1280,WU,"""Incumbent (gear) vendors such as Cisco and Juniper (Juniper Networks (JNPR) have the most to lose from SDN technology,"" Ader wrote. ""The question in our mind is not if SDN will eat into Cisco's core business, but when.""

"
1282,WU,"""You're not going to get any real cost savings on hardware by adopting SDN, though that's what some are saying,"" said Forrester's Kindness. ""The reality is there would have to be a lot of investment in hardware to get SDN"" to work.
"
1283,WU,"Cisco, set to report earnings late Wednesday, is betting that SDN and virtualization will increase the importance of computer networks, Padmasree Warrior, Cisco's chief technology and strategy officer, wrote in a company blog post this month.

1290,WU,"""SDN is going to be much bigger than (OpenFlow) but we don't really know what the other pieces are so we can't really size it,"" he said. ""This is more like a three- to five-year story.""The prospect of software minimizing the need for hardware has networking leaders Cisco and VMware scrambling to latch onto an emerging technology called software defined networks.With at least one notable exception, analysts say SDN is no hardware killer. But SDN increasingly looks like a technology that will be widely used to augment computer networks — and that's why Cisco Systems (CSCO) and VMware (VMW) aren't taking any chances.They so far are the biggest companies jockeying in the SDN market, providing a software architecture that helps companies build and configure networks that can deliver more automation, utilization and programmability.VMware entered the market last month, saying it would buy SDN vendor Nicira for $1.2 billion. VMware is the No. 1 maker of virtualization software, which lets companies run multiple software programs on one server and which analysts say likely will work in conjunction with SDN.Cisco's June RolloutCisco, the No. 1 maker of networking gear, rolled out its first SDN offering in June.SDN, a software platform for computer networks, can help companies move and store their data more efficiently, for less cost.But don't expect SDN to reduce a company's spending on computer network gear, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for research firm IDC.""Think of SDN as an abstraction layer above the physical infrastructure,"" he said. ""For anyone to say companies will need less network and ports and that Cisco is in trouble is jumping the gun.""Yet, the fact that Cisco launched its own SDN effort underscores its potential, says Shaw Wu, an analyst for Sterne Agee.""It makes sense to hedge your bets,"" he said.Many companies perceive SDN as another step toward adopting virtualization and cloud computing, says Andre Kindness, an analyst for Forrester Research. Cloud computing lets companies store and access their data in data centers with servers that run virtualization software, which send that data to customers via the Internet.Virtualization alone isn't able to fully accomplish this goal, Kindness said, ""and that's the reason SDN is so hot.""SDN is sort of a glue bringing more cohesion between a company's hardware and software in data center networks, says Mehra. ""SDN will bring to the table a high level of programmability and flexibility,"" he said.But at least one analyst calls SDN much more disruptive.VMware buying Nicira is ""a game-changing moment that will speed customer adoption of SDN architectures,"" William Blair analyst Jason Ader wrote in a report last month. He says efficiencies from SDN will allow companies to reduce spending on network gear.""Incumbent (gear) vendors such as Cisco and Juniper (Juniper Networks (JNPR) have the most to lose from SDN technology,"" Ader wrote. ""The question in our mind is not if SDN will eat into Cisco's core business, but when.""Many observers disagree.""You're not going to get any real cost savings on hardware by adopting SDN, though that's what some are saying,"" said Forrester's Kindness. ""The reality is there would have to be a lot of investment in hardware to get SDN"" to work.Cisco, set to report earnings late Wednesday, is betting that SDN and virtualization will increase the importance of computer networks, Padmasree Warrior, Cisco's chief technology and strategy officer, wrote in a company blog post this month. She wrote that SDN and virtualization ""place more demands on the core infrastructure. ... SDN no more minimizes the underlying infrastructure than a new steering wheel undermines the importance of a new car engine.""Won't Be Left OutCisco clearly doesn't want to be on the sidelines if SDN takes off, says Mehra.""They want to play a role in the software defined network of tomorrow,"" he said.

1291,WU,"Investors are giving an early thumbs up to Microsoft 's (MSFT) Surface tablet, which features a keyboard and trackpad built into its thin protective cover.Microsoft shares were up nearly 4%, near 31, in midday trading Tuesday, after the company late Monday announced a product to compete with Apple's (AAPL) popular iPad.Microsoft's Surface tablet also will compete against thin and light notebook computers, or ultrabooks, built by its hardware partners, including Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and  Dell (DELL). The device looks like a paper-thin notebook when the screen is propped up using the cover's ""kick stand.""The Surface tablet will come in two models: a cheaper version running Windows RT on a low-power ARM (ARMH)-based processor and a Windows 8 Pro model with a speedier Intel (INTC) chip. The products will be out this fall with the launch of Windows 8.Microsoft did not announce pricing, but said the tablets would be ""competitive with a comparable ARM tablet or Intel Ultrabook-class PC.""Microsoft unveiled the Surface tablet at an event in Hollywood Monday evening.Surface tablets will have a 10.6-inch widescreen display, vs. 9.7 inches for the iPad. The integrated keyboard is built into a 5-millimeter thick cover. The Microsoft tablets will be able to run Office productivity software.Microsoft's Surface tablets likely will cannibalize sales that would have gone to its Windows hardware partners, such HP, Dell, Lenovo and Acer, says Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu.Surface tablets will need to be priced aggressively to give it a fair chance in the marketplace, Wu said in a note Tuesday.  Amazon.com's (AMZN) Kindle Fire tablet sells for $199 and Apple's iPad starts at $399.The merger of tablet and notebook functionality creates a ""mishmash (that) may leave consumers and business users confused,"" Ovum analysts Richard Edwards and Jan Dawson. Worse still, Microsoft's decision to build its own tablet, using contract manufacturers, is a ""vote of no confidence"" in its hardware partners, they said in a note Tuesday.""On the hardware front, bringing out its own device ahead of the Windows 8 launch could imply that Microsoft is not happy with devices being built by its (hardware) partners or that it's not satisfied with only taking a license fee from selling Windows-based tablets,"" they wrote.To appease its hardware partners, Microsoft initially will sell the Surface computers online and through its own retail stores, says Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund. It will leave retail outlets like Best Buy (BBY) to its partners, at least early on, he wrote in a note Tuesday.Dell shares were down 1% midday, while HP was flat.Microsoft's Surface tablets have a good shot at cracking the enterprise market, where tablets currently are seen as consumption rather than productivity devices, Informa analyst David McQueen said in a note Monday.

1366,WU,"Apple (AAPL) executives see continued momentum behind the company's iPhone and iPad devices, after those two key products delivered blowout second-quarter results for the consumer electronics giant.
"
1367,WU,"On a conference call with analysts late Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer detailed the opportunities for the iPhone and iPad and shot down potential challenges they might face.
"
1368,WU,"Apple shares rose 9% to 610.62 Wednesday, ending a five-day skid. Investors were thrilled with Apple's fiscal Q2 results, which saw the company's sales rise 59% and earnings per share soar 92% from the year-earlier quarter.
"
1369,WU,"Responding to speculation that wireless carriers might push back on iPhone pricing and subsidies, Cook expressed confidence that service providers would continue to pay up. The average subsidy on each iPhone sold is about $400, a cost that carriers recoup in service fees over a two-year contract.
"
1370,WU,"BTIG Research analyst Walter Piecyk stirred up controversy April 9 when he speculated that wireless phone services soon would try to cut back on how much they pay for and subsidize iPhones.
"
1371,WU,"Three Responses From CEO
"
1372,WU,"Cook, though, listed the ways carriers benefit from the iPhone.
"
1373,WU,"First, wireless subscriber churn is lowest with the iPhone, he said.
"
1374,WU,"Second, the iPhone is more efficient with data than other smartphones, easing network loads.
"
1375,WU,"And third, the iPhone is ""the best smartphone on the planet to entice a customer who is currently using a traditional mobile phone to upgrade to a smartphone,"" he said.
"
1376,WU,"Wireless carriers want to offer phones that consumers are craving, Cook said.
"
1377,WU,"""From a carrier's perspective, it's important to remember that the subsidy is not large relative to the sum of the monthly payments across a 24-month contract period,"" Cook said.
"
1378,WU,"Apple likely will be able to keep iPhone pricing and subsidies stable for at least two years, says ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall. It will get a boost from the expected release this fall of the iPhone 5, which likely will have 4G LTE connectivity, he says.
"
1379,WU,"Carriers like AT&T (T) and Verizon Wireless (VZ) like iPhone subscribers because they tend to sign up for more expensive wireless plans, Marshall says.
"
1380,WU,"Carriers don't have to sell iPhones, says Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu. But they risk losing wireless subscribers. Wireless customers are voting with their pocketbooks for the iPhone, he says.

"
1383,WU,"Companies like Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN), Bayer and Daiichi Sankyo are deploying thousands of iPads as mobile sales tools. Firms like Bechtel are using iPads in the field for project management. The U.S. Air Force Mobility Command bought thousands of iPads to serve as electronic flight bags, storing technical publications and operations information for flight crew members and trainers, Oppenhei-mer said.

"
1385,WU,"About 94% of Fortune 500 companies are testing or deploying the iPad, Cook says. ""These numbers are off the charts for a product that's only 24 months old,"" he said.
"
1386,WU,"With the lowering of the entry level iPad price to $399, education customers are showing more interest in classroom use, Cook said.
"
1387,WU,"In the March quarter, Apple sold more than two iPads for every Mac computer sold to its U.S. K-12 customers. The San Diego School District bought 10,000 iPads last quarter and plans to buy 15,000-plus more this quarter for middle school and high school programs, Oppenheimer said.
"
1388,WU,"""IPad continues to open doors to new customers with whom Apple previously had no relationship,"" he said. ""As we enter the K-12 institution buying season, we're hopeful that iPad will be a popular choice.""
"
1389,WU,"Apple is benefiting from its large ecosystem of application developers, Wu says. Google (GOOG) Android-based tablets haven't taken off in large part because the apps for those devices stink, he says.
"
1390,WU,"Apple's new iCloud service also is part of that ecosystem, Wu says.
"
1391,WU,"Launched in October, the service has more than 125 million users.
"
1392,WU,"ICloud After 'Delight'
"
1393,WU,"The goal with iCloud is to ""increase the customer delight"" around the entire ecosystem of Apple devices, Oppenheimer said. With iCloud, music and photos are automatically synched among devices. Users also can store documents and media files in the Internet cloud for access anywhere. Many iCloud services are free, but Apple offers paid services, such as additional storage and online backup from all the music you own.
"
1394,WU,"Apple's Cook dismissed plans by Microsoft (MSFT) to merge tablet and PC functionality with its Windows 8 operating system, due out later this year. It will add touch-screen functionality to notebook PCs.

""But the problem is that products are about trade-offs, and you begin to make trade-offs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn't please anyone. You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user.""
"
1396,WU,"That sounded like something Apple's late co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs would have said, says Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher. ""That's the type of quote that would make Steve Jobs proud,"" Kreher said.

1500,WU,"Recently, American Express Co. (AXP  -  Free Report) disclosed having incurred $95 million in claims to settle cardholders’ discrimination.This inconsistency surfaced during the company’s internal review process (which began in 2012) of its card product offerings in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Pacific Territories.The findings point to the fact that the terms and conditions and other frills and facilities provided on cards issued to customers in these regions were less generous and attractive compared to the ones issued in the Continental U.S.The company clarified that cards issued in any region are accordingly customized to make sure that its services and benefits are locally relevant to provide superior value to its card members.Management also said that the cards issued in the U.S. were highly competitive and offered to the public in general without any reservation pertaining to caste or creed. The company, however, confessed the relative inferiority in cards issued in the Pacific and Atlantic territories and that this should not have been so.American Express voluntary reported this to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and accepted its shortcoming by a compensation of $95 million from 2013-2013 to more than 200,000 affected customers.The regulators acknowledged this remedial measure taken by the company that saved it from civil penalties. Regulators have, however, asked the company to make an additional payment of $1 million.The bureau also accused American Express of discriminating between its customers on the basis of race and ethnic background, which has been rebuffed by the latter.Year to date, the company’s shares have returned 31%, outpacing the 22% gain by the industry it belongs to.We believe this settlement by American Express is aimed at shielding its customer base. It should help in customer retention and stabilizing market share.The payments space is intensely competitive which makes it a hard task to tap new customers and retain old ones, something which is imperative for long-term growth for the players in this industry.American Express has in the recent past sustained weak results from parting ways with one of its major clients Costco Wholesale Corp. (last year). In order to make up for the loss from this foregone business, the company took up massive marketing expenditure and won some clients and deals though not as big as Costco.The company is thus not in a position to face any unfavorable development which may further hurt its already fragile business.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAmerican Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the same space are Green Dot Corp. (GDOT  -  Free Report), Vantiv, Inc.  and Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report).

1501,WU,"Fiserv Inc. (FISV  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Instant Issue Advantage, a tablet solution that enhances in-branch issuance and activation of payment cards within a short span of time. As customers can immediately start using these cards, engagement and satisfaction levels are anticipated to improve.This is significant for banks as delay in card issuance as well as activation can result in customer loss. Customer retention has become a major concern for banks amid intense competition from fintechs and traditional retailers offering disruptive financial services.We believe that instant issuance and activations of cards can act as a differentiator in this regard. The instant service will help in establishing banks as the primary financial institutions as compared with the aforesaid organizations, whose offerings are primarily online based. They are also not well-equipped to issue instantly activated cards due to the regulatory and certification process and PCI compliance procedures.Moreover, per Fiserv, the Consumer Preferences research highlights the gap between people receiving their cards and activating them. Only 63% of consumers activated their debit card the day it arrived in the mail. This habit significantly hurts interchange revenues, which can be improved through in-branch issuance and activation.Additionally, Fiserv’s expertise in effectively addressing challenges – primarily fraud – which banks and financial institutions face in case of instantly issued cards is a game changer. The adoption of company’s solution will mitigate risks related to issuance and activation of instant cards.Expanding Product Portfolio: Key CatalystFiserv remains focused on expanding its product portfolio. The company recently launched Integrator Advance that offers multiple tools, including research-based segmentation, cross-sell intelligence, campaign management and reporting in a single platform. Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus  Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus | Broadcom Limited QuoteMoreover, the company commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. In the second quarter of 2017, the company added six DNA clients, four among which have over $1 billion in assets and expects to add at least 10 more in 2017.Fiserv’s digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the banks and credit unions. Recently, DNA solution was selected by SEFCU, which is among the top 50 credit unions in the United States, with approximately $3.5 billion in assets and more than 350K members in communities across New York.Further, investment in digital-oriented technologies is likely to improve the company’s competitive position in the long haul.Zacks Rank & Key PicksFiserv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (hold).

1502,WU,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put The Western Union Company (WU  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Western Union has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10.78, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.95. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Western Union’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 27.37. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Western Union has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.77, so it is fair to say that a value-oriented path may be ahead for Western Union stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Western Union has a P/S ratio of about 1.65. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.13 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Western Union currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Western Union a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.  For example, the PEG ratio for Western Union is just 1.08, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1.74. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, WU is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall? Though Western Union might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name.

1504,WU,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) is riding high on inorganic growth. The leading provider of merchant acquiring and payment technology services has successfully closed a number of acquisitions along with several alliances and joint ventures, in the past many years. These have led to a revenue CAGR of 12.5% between 2006 and 2016.   The company’s most-recently reported results also benefited from the accretion from its purchase of Heartland Payments completed last year. Moreover, there is ever-increasing demand for electronic payment transactions, which provide the company abundant scope for growth.Recently, the company upped its outlook for 2017 to account for the progress on the Heartland integration and strong first-half earnings. The company expects adjusted net revenues between $3.40 billion and $3.48 billion, reflecting an increase of 20% to 22% from 2016.Other acquisitions which include assets of FIS Gaming Business, Pay and Shop Limited, Ezidebit, PayPros and eWay have added to the company’s overall business. Recently, the company announced that it will acquire the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, providing cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software solutions to event organizers. We believe the company’s active acquisition strategy will help it to achieve long-term growth.Year to date, the company’s shares have returned 38%, significantly outpacing the 25% gain by the industry it belongs to. The outperformance reflects the company’s strong growth, efforts to deleverage its balance sheet and value accretion from the acquisitions.Though these buyouts have expedited growth for Global Payments, the company shoulders significant debt to fund the Heartland acquisition. An increase in debt consequently led to a spike in interest expenses that put pressure on margins.Global Payments also remains exposed to currency volatility, since it derives nearly 30% of its revenues from international operations, which include Europe and the Asia Pacific. In the first half of 2017, currency exchange movements reduced revenues by 1.1%. The company’s earnings will continue to be affected by currency volatility, which is expected to prevail in the coming quarters.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderGlobal Payments carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the same segment are Green Dot Corp. (GDOT  -  Free Report), Vantiv, Inc.  and Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report).

1506,WU,"The NBA Finals begin Thursday night, with two of the league’s biggest stars, LeBron James and Steph Curry, set to face off for the NBA title. But while many will look at how the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors played up to this point, it’s also a great time to check out how some of the NBA’s biggest sponsors performed during the season.Sports Apparel The common thought among many investors is that Curry’s star power hasn’t helped Under Armour UAA stock much over the last year, as it tries to adjust to life as a much bigger company. Curry’s direct impact is debatable, but the company’s stock price has performed rather well since the start of the 2017-18 NBA season in mid-October.Let’s take a look at how it has stacked up against the NBA’s official jersey sponsor and basketball shoe juggernaut, Nike NKE, as well as Adidas ADDYY. Investors will see that despite some of the recent love thrown Adidas’ way, both Nike and Under Armour stock have greatly outperformed the German sports apparel powerhouse since the start of the NBA season. Clearly, there are many other factors impacting these stocks aside from the exposure that the NBA provides, but it is a fun exercise nonetheless.Jersey Sponsors  Nike, which became the official jersey sponsor of the NBA this season, greatly outpaced its two closest rivals. With that said, this season also marked the first time the NBA allowed jersey sponsorship patches. In total, 21 out of the 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with companies paying an average of $6.5 million per year to place their logo on a team’s jersey—worn by both the players and fans.The inaugural jersey patch season saw some major publicly traded companies join in on the NBA’s growing business. This list includes General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report), Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union WU, Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Lending Tree (TREE  -  Free Report), Sun Life (SLF  -  Free Report), Ultimate Software (ULTI  -  Free Report), and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report).Clearly, some of the bigger names on the list have all gone through a massively disappointing stretch during their first year as official team jersey sponsors. It’s also worth noting that three out of the four conference finals teams that had a sponsor this year—the Warriors and Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY; the Cavaliers and Goodyear; and the Boston Celtics and GE—all saw their stocks prices fall over 25% since the start of the season.But don’t be surprised if underperforming companies continue their sponsorships as these investments offer a ton of exposure for a relatively small amount of marketing dollars. This becomes even more likely when looking at the NBA’s television ratings, which saw an 8% surge across the league’s four TV-network partners, Disney’s ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV.TV Partners Investors might remember that the NBA is currently benefiting hugely from its nine-year, $24 billion rights deal with ESPN and Turner that runs through the '24-25 season. This is significant money even for these entertainment giants, which means it’s worth taking a look at how ESPN parent Disney and Turner owner Time Warner have performed throughout this season.Biggest Corporate Sponsors Lastly, it is worth taking a look at some of the NBA’s overall corporate partners, which not only advertise heavily but also sponsor the league. Three of the league’s biggest corporate partners are American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) via Frito-Lay, Mountain Dew, and Gatorade.Obviously, all of the companies touched on throughout this article have much larger priorities beyond their affiliation with the NBA. Therefore, none of this stock price movement is a direct reflection on the NBA’s growing business, which saw its overall sponsor revenue surge 31% to $1.12 billion—placing it not too far behind the NFL.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1509,WU,"Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings, to be reported on May 1, 2018, should see an upside from higher contribution in its consumer-to-consumer segment, which represents 80% of the company’s revenues, driven by growing worldwide immigration which induces demand for money remittance. We expect further improvement in margins as technology investment and other cost-reduction initiatives pay off. Improvement in cross-border remittance and strong growth in digital platform will lead to higher demand for money transfer services and will accrue to the segment’s top line.Region wise, revenue growth in the C2C segment should be seen from the Middle East Africa and South Asia region, benefiting from improved results at oil producing countries including Saudi Arabia. The Latin America and Caribbean region continue to deliver strong revenue growth, driven by Argentina and several other South American markets. In the Europe and CIS region, revenue growth was led by France.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the C2C segment is $1.05 billion, up 2.9% year over year.Results should be to some extent offset by a subdued performance from the Business Solutions segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues from this segment is $94 million, flat year over year.Other revenues, which consist primarily of the company’s bill payments businesses, should have increased in the first quarter, led by Speedpay, electronic bill payments in the United States, and the Pago Facil walk-in business in Argentina.The bottom line might suffer from elevated compliance spending. Share repurchases made by the company, from its strong cash flow generation, will aid earnings.Earnings SurpriseThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.05%.

1510,WU,"The Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report) seems poised for long-term growth on the back of its steady investment in digital platform, which has been yielding strong returns. Numerous alliances, pacts and deal renewals have also broadened the company’s network in the United States as well as across the globe.The company’s fourth-quarter earnings were driven by its revenue growth in digital business. On this front, westernunion.com money transfer revenues  increased 22% in the quarter, representing 10% of overall consumer-to-consumer revenues. The segment should further witness growth through westernunion.com’s expansion in the core countries, enhanced mobile services and digital partnerships plus thriving products and services. Additionally, stable pricing and moderating foreign exchange headwinds should contribute to this upside.As one of the world’s leading money remittance companies, Western Union has been making business transformation under its initiative of WU Way.  It successfully rolled out this initiative and achieved $25 million of savings in 2017.The company generates solid free cash flow and boasts a stable track record of returning capital to shareholders via share buybacks and dividend payments. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 9% with the current yield being 3.6%, way higher than its industry’s 0.6%.The company’s return on equity (ROE) of 206.8% remains ahead of the industry’s 35.6%, reflecting is tactical efficiency in using its shareholders’ funds. Moreover, the company’s ROE has grown steadily since 2014.Nevertheless, Western Union expects weakness in its US domestic manufacturing business, accounting for 7% of the company’s total revenues in 2017. The business has been experiencing a drag in its transaction trends since the second half of last year and is likely to have been affected by free peer-to-peer services in the market to an extent. The company expects a subdued performance from this part of the business.Western Union is also facing severe competitive pressure from the recent acquisition of Xoom by PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report). Notably, the companies enjoy a significant presence in the digital money transfer market with the acquirer fast catching up via intensive investments. Also, there are high chances of a merger between MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (EEFT  -  Free Report) (after a failed merger attempt by MoneyGram with Ant Financial). Western Union has always commanded premium pricing in the market by virtue of its brand name, reliability and near monopoly in the market. But industry consolidation might pose some stiff competitive challenges to the company.Share Price PerformanceIn the last six months, shares of the company have returned 7.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 19.5%. Despite this underperformance, we believe the stock has enough room to grow, given its favorable 2018 guidance and strong fundamentals. The stock’s lower-than-market positioning (currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11, which compares with a five-year trading range of 9.6-13.9 and is lower than the industry P/E ratio of 24.3) further makes it an attractive buy.

Earlier, the world’s leading money transfer company accrued $49 million toward resolution of this matterThis payment will be made by Western Union to New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to resolve violations of the state’s law arising out of the facts set forth in the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ).The DoJ stated that during 2004-2012, Western Union violated U.S. laws as it processed hundreds of thousands of transactions for agents and others engaged in an international consumer fraudulent scheme.As part of this scheme, fraudsters made contact with victims in the U.S. posing as family members in need or promised prizes or job prospects. The fraudsters compelled the victims to send money through Western Union to help their relative or claim a prize.However, he NYDFS acknowledged that since 2012, the company made a concerted efforts toward enhancing compliance strategy. To this end, it has made significant investments in compliance spending. The company has also successfully navigated the Southwest Border Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program, which indicates its inclination toward checking illegal money laundering.The enhanced compliance program is being undertaken by the company to protect its well-established brand name.Providing secure and legal transactions is one of the main purviews of a money transfer company and Western Union is trying its best to deliver on this.This is also evident from a more than 200% increase in overall compliance funding by the company over the past six years. Western Union spends approximately $200 million per year on compliance and has more than one-fifth of its workforce dedicated to these functions.Apart from investing in compliance, the company is also spending on technology to keep pace with the rapid shift in the space from physical to electronic money transfer. High compliance and investment costs are expected to pressurize the company's bottom line. The company has also seen a weak top line growth since past many quarters due to soft volumes from oil producing countries, forex volatility, stiff competition and weak economy in some parts of the world.These factors have cumulatively weighed on the company’s share price which are down 8.7% against its industry’s rally of 37.7%.Western Union carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1512,WU,"The beginning of 2018 has been eventful for the remittance industry, which saw the termination of the mega merger between MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Ant Financial Services Group, formerly known as Alipay, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA  -  Free Report)The deal met a dead end after it was shown a red flag by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), which was concerned about the security of the personal data of U.S citizens, who are using MoneyGram’s services. Otherwise, it would have lead to expansion in the size and scale of the company, thereby enabling MoneyGram to provide a stiff competition to Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report).These two are pureplay money remittance companies. A number of other players PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report), Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (EEFT  -  Free Report) having money transfer being as one  among their other businesses have also entered the industry.Notably, this market concentration has been continuing for many years due to increased consolidation. One of the significant deal was the acquisition of Xoom by PayPal, which signaled players entering the industry to reap large untapped opportunities. PayPal, primarily operating via its digital platform also brought new challenges for the traditional brick and mortar players to invest in technology.Some other deals were also inked to enlarge the players business, in an effort to diversify from money transfer business to provide a bouquet of money management services.Competition May Lead to Mergers & AcquisitionsWe expect to see more consolidations as players diversify business to counter the increased competition. In fact, the companies in this remittance space are aiming to reach out faster to customers and cater to new markets, which are expected to fuel mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Generally, players respond to competition by making price modifications and introductions of products and services or by expanding geographically. But acquiring a best company is another most sought-after method to gain a foothold in the industry amid competition.After the failure of the merger between Moneygram and Ant Financial, the industry participants are very closely anticipating the former’s tie-up with Euronet. Earlier, Euronet had failed to woo MoneyGram as Ant Financial’s bid was comparatively more attractive.If the Moneygram-Euronet merger takes place it would make the market further concentrated by wiping out a major player.Techological Innovation to Trigger ConsolidationsProliferation of technology in everyday lives has also influenced the way money is being transferred around the world. Currently, customers demand for safe secure, flexible, fast, easy ways of transferring money to their relatives around the world can be met only by digital transfers.This changing need has compelled even traditional players like Western Union, MoneyGram to invest millions of dollars for building up technical platform to offer electronic money transfer services to keep their customer in loop. Another faster way of catching up on the digital revolution is to tap a player essentially proficient in electronic money transfer.Share Price PerformanceThe industry has rallied 34% in a year’s time, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 gain of 20%.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other. He believes in its short-term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019. Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report.Download it free >>

1513,WU,"The merger of MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) with Ant Financial Services Group has met a dead end after the deal was shown a red flag by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).Ant Financial, controlled by Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) co-founder Jack Ma, was slated to acquire MoneyGram for $18.00 per share, which amounted to nearly $1.2 billion but ended up paying a termination fee of $30 million.Despite concerted efforts by both the companies to satisfy the CFIUS, the security concerns were a real bother. Ant Financial made not one but many proposals for the deal to the regulator and also cited its plans to keep MoneyGram’s headquarters, management team and employees in Dallas. It also agreed to keep the company’s servers and data in the United States. The deal was feared to have left the data of U.S citizens and military personnel who used MoneyGram services vulnerable.From the very beginning, there was an uncertainty about the deal, given the change in the geopolitical environment and Donald Trump’s “America First” platform, which calls for tougher measures to keep overseas buyers away from domestic business.What’s in the Offing?Though the merger has been blocked, MoneyGram and Ant Financial have announced a partnership in an effort to work out new strategic initiatives in the remittance and digital payments markets. The companies aim to provide enhanced services and grab greater share of the market.Will Euronet Make Another Attempt?Besides Ant Financial, Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (EEFT  -  Free Report) also tried its bit to woo MoneyGram but failed to impress the latter. Now, we will not be surprised to see Euronet once again making a bid to acquire MoneyGram. If it happens, the deal  will have higher chances getting an approval as we don’t see any hang ups from CFIUS or closing conditions related to securing change of control consents covering money transmitter licenses in MoneyGram’s jurisdictions.Moreover, the business of Euronet and MoneyGram complement each other. While Euronet’s main focus is smaller, independent agents, MoneyGram partners with several large chains. Both companies have an impressive share in the money transfer market next only to industry leader, Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report). Together they can pose stiff competition to Western Union, which commands a premium pricing in many corridors due to its established and globally recognized brand name.  Moreover, the money remittance market remains significantly underpenetrated. The combined company will be able to garner a much bigger pie of the booming remittance industry. Also, they will be able to significantly expand their digital platform.Share Price PerformanceShares of MoneyGram have lost 14% last year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 17.9%. The company has been suffering from factors like stiff competition, troubled global economy, forex headwinds and increased compliance regulations.MoneyGram carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Notably, Discover Financial has received non-objection from the Fed for its proposed capital actions.However, the company’s bottom-line growth has been limited by increasing costs. Discover Financial incurs substantial expenses owing to marketing and business development. These apart, anti-money laundering program enhancements, infrastructure investments and high legal, regulatory and compliance costs have contributed to the escalating expenses.In addition, the company’s over dependence on debt has resulted in a continuous increase in the level of leverage. The rise in level of debt has also led to increase in interest expenses since 2012.

(WU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Nov 2, after market close.The company’s Consumer-to-Consumer segment is expected to witness an increase in transactions which will be driven by strong growth in westernunion.com. We expect strong transaction growth from North America and Latin American countries partly offset by declines from Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia regions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $1.1 billion, which translates into year-over-year growth of 0.3%.Revenues from another segment Business Solutions, which facilitates payment and foreign exchange solutions, primarily cross-border, crosscurrency transactions, for small and medium size enterprises and other  organizations and individuals, is exposed to fluctuation in exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies.

Part of this cost will therefore will reflected in the quarter’s results.    Also, the bottom line might suffer from elevated compliance spending.Western Union Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Western Union Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Western Union Company (The) QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Western Union has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.Zacks ESP:  Earnings ESP which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +1.51%.

1523,WU,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell.We expect results of this payments network company to reflect increased purchase volume and processed transaction. The impact of acquisitions should improve its business volume in the quarter led by higher spending by members on an improved economy.Here are some of the broad factors likely to affect third-quarter earnings:Increase in Gross Dollar Volume: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gross Dollar volume which measures all Mastercard Credit Charge and Debit programs and includes purchase volume plus cash volume, one of the main revenue drivers, is expected to be $1.32 trillion, up almost 8% year over year.Growth in Different Areas, Product Launch, Deals and Partnerships:  Third-quarter results would manifest the company’s targeted growth from its card offerings in different verticals — consumer credit, debit and commercial prepaid. Its continued investments in physical-digital convergence will keep it ahead in an industry witnessing rapid technology usage and accrue to its top line. Also, several new deals, extension of partnerships and agreements, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard's top line.Expanding Service Business: The company's efforts in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, are its differentiators in the market. Higher utilization of the company's service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected in the quarter to be reported.Other FactorsMasterCard’s top line in the third quarter would gain traction from its massive international business.The company's disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to the impact of new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company's bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international markets (accounting for more than 60% of the company’s revenues) than in the prior year.MasterCard’s use of capital in buying back shares will provide an extra cushion to its bottom line.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteHere is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mastercard is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Mastercard has an Earning ESP of -0.07%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though Mastercard carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), its negative ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

1528,WU,"The NBA Finals tip off Thursday night, pitting LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors for the fourth straight season. The speculation and predictions have already begun, but let’s leave the guessing to the NBA experts and look instead at the NBA’s rapidly growing business.James, who is set to play for his eighth straight NBA title, Curry, and Kevin Durant are all global superstars. All three are some of the biggest names for some of the biggest sports apparel companies in the world, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) for James and Durant, and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) for Curry.The three biggest names in the NBA Finals are also successful pitchmen as well as investors, making millions on and off the court. On top of the success of these superstars, the NBA has become one of the most successful sports leagues in the world and its business has never been bigger.TV RatingsThe NBA saw its overall national TV ratings climb 8% from last season to hit 1.28 million, according to Nielsen. This uptick comes across the league’s four television-network partners: Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV. The 2017/18 season also marked the NBA’s best overall ratings average since the 2013/14 season and stands in stark contrast to the NFL’s ratings decline.The league has also performed well on television throughout the playoffs. The struggling ESPN’s overall NBA playoff ratings were up 31% from 2017, with Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals drawing 13.305 million viewers—which marked the second-largest total for an NBA game in ESPN history. Meanwhile, TNT’s coverage of the Western Conference finals climbed roughly 33%.These ratings will be fun to pay attention to throughout the NBA Finals as the league’s performance on television might have major implications for sponsorship partners and help determine the NBA’s negotiating power going forward.  Sponsors The NBA introduced for the first time this season jersey sponsorship patches, which allowed teams to negotiate their own deals with companies for the rights to a 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch patch on players’ left sleeves. In total, 21 out of the league’s 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with notable teams from big markets, including the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, taking the court without patches.With that said, the rest of the teams made some big money from deals. The average patch deal brought in roughly $6.5 million per year, and accounted for roughly $137 million of total sponsorship revenue, according to IEG/ESP.The recent influx of new revenue helped the NBA pull in $1.12 billion in total sponsorship money this season, which marked a 31% surge from the $861 million last season. It is also worth noting that the NBA rested just behind the NFL’s $1.25 billion.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney, Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union (WU  -  Free Report), eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report)-owned StubHub, and Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) were just some of the notable jersey sponsors in the inaugural season. The two teams that face off in the NBA finals stand to help provide even more exposure for their corporate sponsors: Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY for the defending champion Warriors, and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report) for its hometown Cavaliers.The 2018 NBA Finals mark another first for the NBA when it comes to boosting its top line, with Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV acting as the first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals. The YouTube TV logo will appear all over the place, including the official NBA Finals logo. Meanwhile, select markets are also expected to be able to watch ABC’s NBA Finals coverage on YouTube TV.Looking AheadFrom the NBA’s partnership with Take-Two Interactive and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch on its new esports league to its active expansion in China and other growth markets, the NBA’s business looks poised to keep on booming.Going forward, these deals should help the NBA become even more popular and relevant as it fights to stay on the cutting-edge of content distribution and outside the box business ventures.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

This will be driven by higher sales growth from, product enhancements that are focused on simple and transparent pricing, improved customer service and strong retention. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for income from operation for the segment is $34.75 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of 8.6%.Other Developments in Q3  Increased Top Line From Life Insurance Unit: Lincoln National’s life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a broad product portfolio and an industry-leading distribution network. The company has changed in its sales mix to fight the low interest rate environment. Its strategic focus is to decrease the portion of sales from products with long-term guarantees and increase the share of earnings coming from the mortality and morbidity business lines.Increased Sales in Group Protection Unit: The company’s Group Protection segment which was challenged in the recent past is now recovering. Sales in 2016 were up nearly 18% and 11% in the first half of 2017. This strong sales growth indicates the resilience of its distribution channel. The company’s pricing remains disciplined and its outlook for sales growth is aligned with its long-term target of mid single-digit increases. We expect sales growth and improving persistency to contribute to third-quarter results.Annuity Sales to Rise: We also expect to see an increase in total annuity sales driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. New product launches and upgrades to existing ones will further aid annuity sales.Increased Expenses: In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company announced its digital initiative targeted at improving customer experience. These efforts will result in significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements, but will cause the company to incur digitization expense of roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017.Balance Sheet Strength and Capital Management: Its disciplined capital management by way of share buyback will drive the bottom line.

1535,WU,"Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb 13, after market close.The company’s Consumer-to-Consumer segment is expected to witness an increase in transactions, which will be driven by strong growth in westernunion.com. We expect strong transaction growth from North America and Latin American countries, partly offset by declines from Europe, Middle East, Africa and South Asia regions.The company’s pricing actions should have also contributed to revenue growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $1.1 billion, which translates into the year-over-year growth of 1%.Revenues from another segment, Business Solutions, should improve, led by a growth in business from Argentina, Pago Facil and the U.S. Speedpay bill payments businesses. The strengthening of key foreign exchange rates should also impact earnings in the segment.Additionally, the termination of a partner contract, effective during the fourth quarter of 2016, should impact the revenue negatively.Cost of services should have shown an increase due to higher bank fees, primarily in the company’s growing United States electronic bill payments services, and severance and related employee benefits and other expenses related to a business transformation initiative referred to as the WU Way. The company has committed to spending approximately $1 million on WU Way (its new business transformation program) in 2017 and these costs, related primarily to the implementation, consulting and severance, will be noted during each quarter. Part of this cost will, therefore, reflect in the quarter’s results.Also, the bottom line might suffer from elevated compliance spending.Share repurchases made by the company, from its strong cash flow generation, will aid bottom line earnings.Company’s Full Year 2017 GuidanceThe company expects a low single-digit GAAP revenue growth for the full year 2017, reflecting slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat-to-low single-digit increase and GAAP earnings per share, in a range of $1.50 to $1.60. Given the favorable profitability trends, the company also increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, from $1.70 to $1.80 previously.Earnings Surprise HistoryWestern Union boasts an attractive earnings surprise history.

1536,WU,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Western Union Company (WU  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Western Union is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for WU in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 45 cents per share for WU, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for WU, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.51% heading into earnings season.Western Union Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Western Union Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Western Union Company (The) QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

1537,WU,"MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after market close.Last quarter, MetLife surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6% and soared 57% year over year. Earnings benefited from volume growth, continued expense discipline and higher fees from improved equity markets.The company has an impressive surprise history. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 7.39%. This is depicted in the graph below:MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise MetLife, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | MetLife, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q3 FlashbackMetLife’s third-quarter earnings should highlight the favorable impacts of equity markets and solid underwriting in the United States as well as continued focus on expense management.We expect the company’s U.S. business segment to showcase a strong quarter of earnings and sales from Group Benefits, which is one of its largest growth engines. MetLife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of 25% among the large employers. It is experiencing strong growth in the mid-market segment in this business.The company witnessed continued strength in sales across all market segments, as well as in core and voluntary products in the first half of 2017. We also expect continued investments in this segment to bear fruit.We expect the company’s Property and Casualty (P&C) segment to benefit from improvements in the auto insurance business. The company has been making targeted rate increases in auto insurance over the last past one year which continues this year too. These price increases, along with other management actions, will drive profitability in this line of business.Overall, P&C sales may also benefit from price increases and management actions to drive value. Weather-related destruction in the months of August and September might also dent earnings from this segment, in the form of catastrophe loss.  MetLife has been generating enough free cash flow which it uses for investment purposes and buying back shares. Repurchases made by the company in the third quarter will aid its bottom line.We also expect to see an increase in variable investment income driven by favorable hedge fund performance and strong private equity. The company’s bottom line will be aided by its expense management initiatives.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that MetLife is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: MetLife has an Earning ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 90 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MetLife carries a Zacks Rank #3 but its 0.00% ESP makes our surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.

1538,WU,"MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) is expanding its digital platform to France and Spain. This service which enables customers to remit money via just a few clicks provides enough flexibility, through the utilization of handheld devices such as mobile or a tablet.The company is aggressively making investments in ramping up its digital channel for money transfer, given the growing acceptance of digital forms of remittance. It has also achieved quite a success in this direction. Its third quarter results disclosed MoneyGram.com growing 23% year over year, led by greater number of customers using its digital services. Revenues from its digital channel have been increasing from past many years.MoneyGram.com enables customers to send money for cash pickup as well as to 2.4 billion banks, mobile and virtual accounts in 48 countries worldwide. Various components of its digital business MoneyGram.com, mobile account deposit and virtual agents are all showing solid growth.The European region seems very attractive for the company’s digital growth, given a high population of Internet users (more than 50%).

1539,WU,"Stocks in the Business Services sector have been strong performers of late, reflecting the group’s favorable fundamentals, which we have listed below. This should give readers a good sense of the factors, expected to help these stocks over the near- to medium-term.Labor Intensive: The sector, which offers intangible products, has immense employment opportunities as it requires both skilled and unskilled labor for its smooth functioning.Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in December was 4.1% with non-farm payroll employment increasing nearly 0.1 million in the month. Unemployment was 4.1% for three straight months. Jobs were added in health care, construction and manufacturing sectors. Unemployment decreased 60 basis points since December 2016. The professional and business service industry added 0.02 million jobs in December.In 2017 payroll employment grew 2.1 million versus growth of 2.2 million a year ago.Ushering in more good news for the sector, President Trump has hinted at creating more domestic employment. Trump had shown his discontent about moving jobs outside the United States during the election campaign. He said, ""I just want to let all of the other companies know that we're going to do great things for business. There's no reason for them to leave anymore.”Per the Federal Reserve, unemployment is expected to be 3.9% in 2018 and 2019.Business reports indicate that the two most populated countries, China and India, are together expected to create 300 million placements in the global job market by 2030.Asset-Light Business Model: By virtue of the nature of its operations, these companies provide services instead of products to others. This, in turn, frees them from producing goods that would otherwise need manufacturing facilities. As a result, business services do not have inventory or stock and thus, do not have to bear costs for such items.Moreover, services can be tailor-made for any situation. This is not possible or feasible for something tangible.Global Reach: Companies can reach consumers or prospective buyers across the world when Advertising & Market Services and Direct Marketers act on behalf of such firms in informing consumers about new products or added features in existing products. Thus, these service providers help in widening a company’s customer base and maintaining a better retention ratio alongside opening the door to international trade.A key development in this regard has been noticed in the banking space. Online banking for transfer and collection of money from anywhere in the world, mobile money transfer and ATMs are fast gaining traction. The Western Union Company (WU  -  Free Report) and MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) are among those that continuously offer cutting-edge services via electronic channels to ensure smooth fund transfers. Fund transferors are also forming alliances with banks and mobile operators to launch their services.Mobile payment is gaining popularity owing to its convenience and round-the-clock accessibility. We expect this channel will see a faster adoption rate than any other electronic channel. Western Union’s Vigo and OrlandiValuta branded services are available through a network of more than 550,000 agent locations in 200 countries and territories and over 100,000 ATMs.Importantly, 90% of those locations are outside the United States. The company plans to add retail locations and more account-based options. MoneyGram has 350,000 agent locations across 200 countries and territories.The companies are continuously pursuing online money transfer growth initiatives. While MoneyGram launched MoneyGram MobilePass and MoneyGram Kameleon in 2016, a new digital money transfer service, Western Union, introduced WU Connect, which allows it to offer cross-border money transfer services on third-party platforms.A large portion of the world market remains underpenetrated. With the strategic introduction of money transfer in these markets, service providers should enjoy ample business opportunities.In addition, a continued shift toward electronic forms of payment from paper-based forms has created a dependence on plastic money or debit and credit cards. This has encouraged card processors to ramp up their growth profile. Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and MasterCard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are among the companies, well placed to benefit from the tailwinds, riding on their respective fundamental strengths.Cost Effective: All business operators prefer to minimize cost of operation and maximize margins. This sector offers cost effectiveness to companies that opt for services that would otherwise be far more expensive.With specialized services, these providers reduce operational cost and in turn, lower the overall cost of companies. Notably, a higher number of companies opting for such specialized services would increase volumes for service providers. This would eventually lead to services at lower costs and a further reduction in costs for companies, thereby fueling margin expansion.Our data shows that Business Services margins have consistently grown in the past few quarters, and will likely retain the momentum in the next few quarters too. Importantly, Business Services margin expansion is better than that of the S&P 500 Index.Gaining from Stronger Currencies: Companies in countries with stronger currencies can gain if their jobs or services are done by companies from countries that have comparatively weaker currencies. This is because these companies would get to spend less and thus gain from currency translation. In turn, this would lower the cost of goods or services and favor margin expansion.Specialized Service: The industry offers specialized services based on the latest technologies. This is crucial for security and consulting services. To safeguard data, companies are compelled to engage security service providers, which need the latest and most efficient technologies to persuade clients and win business contracts.Also, increasing mergers and acquisitions across the globe have been improving the prospects of legal service providers. Consulting is another wing of this industry that is rapidly gaining traction.Business complexities are on the rise and companies are opting for expert advice before entering into any new venture rather than risking losses by trial and error. Thus, this service sector looks promising due to its indispensability to companies that are struggling to survive in a competitive market.Bottom LineThe U.S. economy is now improving and population continues to increase in the nation. This sector, being labor intensive, involves lower capital investments and confidently addresses the issue. While emerging nations are becoming important destinations for business services, these economies pose challenges to employment growth in developed economies.Given the inherent strengths, the business service sector has enough steam left to drive the engine toward growth.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1540,WU,"The financial transaction service providers have reported a decent performance in the first nine months of 2017 backed by a thriving U.S. economy, lower unemployment, reduced inflation, healthy consumer confidence, which resulted in improved business volumes. Increased investment in information technology and growing demand for online payments significantly spurred transaction volume growth.Moreover, the recent tax reform policy that lowered corporate tax to 21% from 35%, although might result in one-time charge for some companies, is expected to benefit the players in the long term.The new European rules on online payments and banking, allowing retailers and consumers to bypass banks by authorizing payments directly from personal accounts, might result in reduced costs and enhanced scope of offering for the payment processors.  Factors Affecting Q4 ResultsEconomic growth in the United States has resulted in higher disposable income, leading to greater customer spending. This is expected to propel the companies’ transaction sales volume in the fourth quarter.The payment processors have also gained from alternative payment modes like e-wallets, electronic payments as well as cryptocurrencies that provide customers with greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touch-points and speed, all at a lower cost. Huge investments in technology to meet the changing demand of customers have resulted in the development of new and emerging cutting-edge technologies.Another major attribute of the industry is inorganic growth.The payment processors have been consolidating through mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances and partnerships to expand their operations globally.  However, international operations have exposed the players to foreign exchange volatility. The recent tax cut is also likely to result in one-time tax on the companies’ unrepatriated overseas earnings.Increased investment in technology, marketing and promotional activities as well as consolidation-related expenses have led to a continuous rise in operating costs. This is likely to put pressure on the bottom line in the fourth quarter.Industry Rank and Price PerformanceThe industry is booming, which is evident from its rally of 38.4% in a year compared with 21.4% gain registered by the S&P 500.

1547,WU,"Cash is king. But when it comes to the payments’ ecosystem, cash is taking a back seat, given the twists in in the way money moves around the world.  Payments via plastic cards — credit, debit, charge and other cards have rapidly overtaken cash payments.Ease of carrying, safety against theft, payment flexibility, attractive rewards and a number of other features make plastic cards highly coveted. This is evident from the number of cards in circulation and the rapid growth in the amount transacted via these in last five years. Also, growing penchant among consumers for online shopping is giving a boost to the use of plastic.The dynamic payments’ space is transforming from plastic to electronic methods, thanks to emerging technologies. Widespread use of technology has filtered down to the financial services industry and has redefined the payments’ method from analogue to digital. Internet is now a way of life and electronic payment is preferred for money transfer.Alternative payment modes such as e-wallets, mobile and digital currencies have evolved and are gaining fast acceptance. Digital transactions are more attractive owing to cutting edge technology that provides greater transaction security, flexibility, accessibility, touchpoints, and speed, all at a lower cost. As a result, companies in this space are making huge investments to support the development of new and emerging technologies.Companies such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal are constantly investing in upgrading technology to provide state-of-the-art services in an intensely competitive environment.Industry insiders also believe new markets will continue to be developed in areas that have been previously dominated by paper-based transactions. Continued development of new services and the emergence of new vertical markets will help in the growth of the payments’ industry.Also, the industry continues to grow worldwide and as a result, a number of large payment technology companies have expanded their operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures.However, one major impediment to the growth of digital payments is the growing threat of cyber-attacks and data leakage. To address the hitch that these might lead to among consumers, organizations are regularly updating their software and fraud detection systems. At the same time, they educating their consumers on basic security features.Going forward, the up-and-coming tech-savvy generations, will fuel demand for innovative, technology-driven and easily integrated transaction methods.

1548,WU,"VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 36 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but down 13.2% from the year-ago quarter. The figure was also in line with the high end of management’s guidance range of 35-36 cents.The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower non-GAAP revenues, which decreased 4.3% to $466.9 million, slightly better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The decline can be attributed to anticipated sluggishness in the Asia Pacific, particularly India, and weakness in North America. This was partially offset by strong revenue growth in Latin America and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).VeriFone is now in the process of divesting the taxi business. In June, the company completed the restructuring of operations in China. The company now has a minority stake in the newly created local company.

However, EMEA and Latin America revenues surged 29.4% and 1.8% to $193.5 million and $71.3 million, respectively.Management stated North America SMB vertical grew year over year for the first time in five quarters. The retail vertical benefited from several large QSR deployments, robust demand for E series mPOS devices as well as higher number of device refresh with Tier-1 retailers who were the earliest adopters of EMV.Moreover, Latin America revenues benefited from strong year-on-year growth in Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Good momentum in France and Germany particularly due to robust demand for Engage platform drove top-line growth at EMEA.Notably, in the first half of 2017 VeriFone sold Engage in four countries.

Services margins were 40.7%, up significantly on a year-over-year basis due to the divestiture of low margin Petro Media business.Operating expense decreased 8.1% to $142.3 million. As percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined 130 bps to 30.5%. The company incurred operating expenses of approximately $66 million primarily attributable to the announced divestitures of non-core businesses.Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 80 bps on a year-over-year basis to 12.5%.Balance SheetAs of Jul 31 2017, VeriFone had approximately $159 million in cash & cash equivalents compared with $134.5 million as of Apr 31 2017.

1549,WU,"Global Payments Inc. (GPN  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of the communities and sports divisions of ACTIVE Network, which provides cloud-based, mission-critical enterprise software solutions to event organizers.The deal was funded in cash-and-stock. The company used its revolving credit facility to fund the cash consideration of $600 million.This acquisition will be highly complementary to Global Payments’ gaming business and will expand its existing suite of innovative products and solutions. For the third quarter of 2017, the company expects ACTIVE Network to contribute revenues in the range of nearly $13 million to $14 million but have no impact on earnings.Global Payments is riding high on inorganic growth. The leading provider of merchant acquiring and payment technology services has successfully closed a number of acquisitions along with several alliances and joint ventures in the past. These led to a revenue CAGR of 12.5% between 2006 and 2016.   One of its major acquisitions was that of Heartland Payment Systems, valued at $3.9 billion (closed last year), in its North America segment. The deal accelerated growth by broadening Global Payments’ direct distribution channels in the United States and enhancing its vertical markets exposure.Its other recent successful acquisitions include the assets of FIS Gaming Business, Pay and Shop Limited, Ezidebit, PayPros and eWay.Year to date, the company’s shares have returned 36%, significantly outpacing the 24% gain by the industry it belongs to. The outperformance reflects the company’s strong growth, efforts to deleverage its balance sheet and value accretion.These buyouts have of course expedited growth for Global Payments. However, these have increased its debt burden, causing a spike in interest expenses that put pressure on margins.The payments industry continues to grow worldwide, presenting unique opportunities for the company to expand operations globally by pursuing acquisitions and creating alliances and joint ventures. The company actively seeks profitable deals and we therefore expect to hear more on these lines from the company in the near future.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderGlobal Payments carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1551,WU,"Synchrony Financial’s (SYF  -  Free Report) solid organic and inorganic strategies backed by strong financial health, position it well for long-term growth.  The company’s top line has displayed solid growth over the past three years driven by its rapidly growing interest income as well as inorganic growth strategies.The company’s substantial inorganic growth since 2013 is worth a mention. Its CareCredit unit acquired the Citi Health Card portfolio to further expand its healthcare acceptance network in the United States.

1552,WU,"Markets have enjoyed a strong and enduring rally for nearly all of 2017. Benchmarks have broken several milestones on multiple occasions and are on course to create new annual records. Year to date, the S&P 500 is up more than 20% and is on course to registering its highest gains in four years. Successively strong earnings numbers and robust economic growth have been the primary factors powering these gains.However, this extended market rally was not without its occasional losses. Lingering fears about inflated valuations have dogged stocks for some time now. Geopolitical concerns, particularly those related to North Korea also threatened to spoil the party on more than one occasion. Also, there was much hand wringing over the likelihood of tax cuts receiving legislative approval before they were finally signed into law last week.However, it is increasingly likely that the actions of the new administration will boost stocks further in the days ahead. In such a scenario, S&P 500 stocks which have failed to chalk up gains this year should also stand a chance. This is particularly true for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank, which are well placed to ride the continuing market rally in 2018.Factors which Acted as a Drag on 2017’s RallyEven though benchmarks are now close to notching up annual records, a variety of factors have threatened to end their long running rally. Concerns about inflated valuations, particularly relating to tech stocks, have had investors worried on more than one occasion. Even though such fears have yet to come true, they continue to persist to this day. Further, geopolitical concerns have also clouded market sentiment at times. Such worries were especially heightened during North Korea’s recent nuclear tests. Both South Korea and the U.S. government warned of a strong response during these events, leading to losses for stocks.Coming to specific sectors, energy stocks remained depressed over the year with the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) down 3.6% year to date. During the year, the OPEC and other major oil producers successfully adhered to an output control agreement which lent some support to oil prices. However, a step up in production by U.S. shale producers has led to the persistence of oversupply conditions.Further, traditional safe haven sectors have been largely ignored during the year, with the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) up only 7.4% year to date. Instead, investors have favored high growth sectors such as technology in the quest for superlative gains. Industrywide changes have also acted as drags for specific stocks. For instance, the tendency to shop online has caused numerous store closures and created a near brick and mortar apocalypse.Can Tax Cuts, Infrastructure Spending Boost Gains in 2018?On last Friday, President Trump finally signed the much anticipated tax Bill into law.  The exact earnings impact of the tax legislation is yet to become clear, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.8%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation. (Read: What Will the Q4 Earnings Season Bring?)And now that President Trump has scored his first major legislative victory, it is likely that he will press forward with another major issue on his agenda, infrastructure reforms. It is now widely expected that the Trump administration will announce a new infrastructure package in 2018.During his presidential campaign, Trump had promised to implement a $1 trillion infrastructure package. This plan was intended to improve the state of roads, airports and bridges as well as other public works across the country.Recently Trump has commented that his attempt to improve the country’s infrastructure will easily garner bipartisan support. The major obstacle to be overcome is related to funding and if that does happen, markets could receive yet another boost in the year ahead.5 Losers Set to Gain in 2018Even though stocks have notched up strong gains this year, some factors have acted as impediments to gains on several occasions. However, the projected impact of tax cuts and heightened prospects of a new infrastructure package are likely to sustain markets’ rally well into next year.This is why it makes good sense to bet on those S&P 500 stocks which have taken a beating this year but stand a good chance of notching up gains in 2018. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark. This led the stock to take a huge leap and outpace the industry in a month. Clearly, third-quarter results have given a fresh breath of life to the stock, which in the recent past had struggled on account of dismal performance in the preceding two quarters.Foot Locker has lost 33.3% year to date.

Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 5.2% over the last 60 days.Halliburton Company (HAL  -  Free Report) reported strong third quarter profit thanks to improved utilization and pricing gains in North America.

However, it has a Zacks Rank #2. Moreover, expected earnings growth for the current year is more than 100%. PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) is poised to gain from its capital investment plan, which primarily focuses on infrastructure construction projects for generation, transmission and distribution. It has reestablished its hedge levels to shield itself from any near-term decline in the GBP.PPL Corp has lost 8.6% year to date. However, it has a Zacks Rank #2.

The company’s bottom line suffered from the tax impact of changes in the internal ownership structure of some of its international subsidiaries.The company exceeded estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 0.45%. This is depicted in the graph below:Western Union Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Western Union Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Western Union Company (The) QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackResults will witness overall growth from opportunities that have come along with the company’s expansion into new geographies, increased touch points, and improved functionality.Western Union’s digital strategy is gathering steam with continued investments in this platform. The company which was non-existent in this space a few years ago has been making massive investments in its digital platform as consumers are increasingly adopting technology, in their everyday lives. Transaction and revenue growth has been consistent from its electronic business and we expect the trend to continue in the to-be reported quarter given a number of digital partnerships and deals forged, which will contribute to transaction volume growth.On the flip side, continued drag from oil-producing countries in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region, the impact of demonetization in India, which reduced inbound transfers to the country, and loss of revenue from XE.com. will weigh on the company’s results.Also, the bottom line might suffer from elevated compliance spending. Western Union paid 3.6% of revenues in 2016 as compliance charges and 3.7% in the first quarter. Continued investments in developing its digital strategy will also dent margins to some extent.As the company derives a big portion of its business from across the globe, the impact of forex volatility will likely be felt in the to-be-reported quarter.  The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, impacted first-quarter 2017 revenues by approximately $30 million.The company has committed to spend approximately $1 million on WU Way (its new business transformation program) in 2017, and these costs, related primarily to the implementation, consulting and severance, will be noted each quarter. Part of this cost will therefore will reflected in the quarter’s results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Western Union is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

1559,WU,"Despite having its hands full of positives, the Business Services sector is nevertheless faced with a number of headwinds that tend to partially offset the positive impact of the catalysts mentioned in “Business Services Well Poised to Create Employment."" The recent slowdown in the U.S. jobs market and heightened uncertainty about the U.K. and European economies following the Brexit surprise are some of the other clouds on the horizon for this sector.Discussed below are some inherent challenges faced by the business service sector:Continuous Spending on Research and Development: Importantly, consulting service providers need to stay abreast of the latest technologies through continuous spending on research and development. The performance of these providers can be hampered if they do not acclimatize to or adopt new services to cope with the latest developments.Maintaining Skilled Workforce Involves High Costs: Since skilled workers are always in demand, there is a possibility of a high turnover rate in the sector. The training of unskilled workers or taking in new skilled workers increases operational costs, and thus affects margins. This space needs to have a more skilled workforce to take advantage of technology that develops at a rapid pace.Competition: Maintaining or increasing market share remains challenging for business service providers. As discussed earlier, the main business of one company can be a business service for another. So target customers for both may at times be the same.Therefore, a business service provider is always required to be adequately equipped to win over customer demand. While larger providers bank on the broad variety of service offerings and can effectively take up difficult ventures, the relatively smaller players compete in an industry backed by specialized services.Regulatory Hurdles: By virtue of having operations across the globe, service providers face regulatory hurdles and compliance-related issues. Western Union (WU  -  Free Report) incurred compliance expense of about 3.6% of revenues in 2015 and expects the same to be about 3.5% to 4% in 2016.Moneygram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) is being probed by a federal grand jury in relation to its consumer anti-fraud and anti-money laundering program matters for the period during 2003 to early 2009, among many other government investigations and litigations. Any reverse results from the investigation indicate a potential liability against damages, which could put pressure on margins and cash flows.Based on unfavorable Zacks Rank and negative earnings trend over the last four quarters, we prefer to avoid SouFun Holdings Ltd (SFUN  -  Free Report) and Everi Holdings Inc. (EVRI  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has four quarters of average negative surprise. Also, these stocks witnessed negative estimate revisions over the last few weeks.To ConcludeThe dearth of skilled labor in the business services sector can affect its prospects. Non-availability of quality workforce at a reasonable rate might increase overall operational costs.In addition, due to the highly fragmented nature of the industry, it is difficult to set a distinct trend or predict a concrete future for it.
