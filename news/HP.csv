7,HP,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

8,HP,"The Food and Drug Administration approved the world smallest heart valve on Tuesday — several years after a Seattle surgeon used the dime-sized device from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) to save a tiny baby named Sadie with a leaky heart valve.X Sadie Rutenberg was the first patient in Abbott's Halo trial, which began in 2014. At two months of age, Sadie struggled to breathe, stopped gaining weight and wasn't eating well due to a congenital heart defect.Although Sadie needed surgery right away, the smallest replacement valves at that time were still too big for her 7-pound body. So her parents, Lee'or and Wendy Rutenberg, enrolled Sadie in Abbott's trial and she was the first to receive the 15-millimeter device at five months of age in 2015.""When the doctor came out of surgery and told us the surgery was a success, as a parent, it's a moment I'll never forget,"" Lee'or Rutenberg said in a written statement provided by Abbott. ""The valve saved Sadie's life.""On Tuesday, the FDA approved Abbott's Masters HP, a rotatable mechanical heart valve that can be implanted in babies and toddlers born with congenital heart defects. About one in 40,000 babies born in the U.S. each year has a congenital heart defect.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

The trial enrolled patients age five or younger who had diseased, damaged or malfunctioning heart valves.Sadie received her new valve at Seattle Children's Hospital Heart Center. Today, she is a thriving 3 year old who loves the color red and thinks giraffes are funny creatures. Wendy Rutenberg outlined her gratitude in a 2015 statement.""This place and Dr. (Jonathan) Chen saved Sadie's life,"" she said. ""There was the very real possibility that she could have died or needed a heart transplant. To come here and have such a positive outcome, it's just amazing.""On the stock market today, Abbott rose 0.8% to close at 60.88.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityLong-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

Hot recent IPO Roku (ROKU) tumbled on its revenue outlook. Home Depot (HD) beat and gave bullish guidance. Fed policymakers seemed slightly hawkish. Rite Aid (RAD) agreed to an Albertsons buyout.X The major averages suffered modest losses through Thursday, closing near session lows several times, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages.

But they see stronger growth prospects in 2018 than they did in December, in part due to the Trump tax cuts. Fed officials see inflation rising to 2% over time.

Broadcom has asked Qualcomm investors to vote for its slate of six nominees to Qualcomm's board at the company's March 6 shareholder meeting.Grocery giant Albertsons, under private ownership for over a decade, announced it would merge with Rite Aid (RAD).

But in 2018 and 2019, the Street expects earnings to accelerate, rising 6% to $7.05 a share this year and up 11% the next.United has risen 8% since rallying out of a five-month cup with handle at 123.38 in mid-December. At one point, before the intermediate-level correction flattened the market, United was up as much as 12.8%.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportReturning to GE, one of the positive developments for the former market leader is the fact that Wall Street is encouraged by major reform plans by the new CEO John Flannery. Proof? The 2019 consensus earnings estimate has been revised higher, now seen at $1.06 a share, up 10% vs. an expected profit of 96 cents this year.This means GE is trading less than 14 times expected 2018 earnings; the Boston-based company recently slashed is quarterly cash dividend by half.  So with a 12-cent dividend per share, the annualized yield comes out to 3.3%, which hardly puts a dent into capital losses caused by the stock's 16.6% slide year to date.The S&P 500 trades roughly 20 times trailing 12-month earnings and shows an annualized dividend yield of 1.8%. (You can track the yield of the S&P 500 at the top of the General Market Indicators page, a PDF link at the bottom of the daily IBD Big Picture column.)The challenge, however, for GE, will be to find new avenues to boost the top line. Healthy sales, delivered by innovative new products and new markets, are the mother of strong earnings.GE is certainly in danger of falling out of the Dow due to its sharply hammered stock price. The stock is more than 52% below its 52-week high and trading well below the 50- and 200-day moving averages, a clear sign of weakness.Former Dow Jones industrial stocks such as Alcoa (AA), which has been split into two public companies including Arconic (ARNC), suffered such a fate in late 2013.At the time, the aluminum giant traded well below 10 a share. Computer and printer titan HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard, and Bank of America (BAC) also departed the blue-chip Dow due to miserable stock performance.On IBD Stock Checkup,Elsewhere, the Dow Jones utility average rebounded 0.9%. But at 671, the interest rate-sensitive index is still down 7.3% since Jan. 1.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond eased to 2.92%, signifying some bargain-hunting among fund managers, even as the U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the yen. West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices rallied 1.6% to $62.66 a barrel.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on breakouts, top stocks, major indexes and financial markets.)RELATED:Where Is The Stock Market Headed?

28,HP,"There are only a handful of marijuana stocks with direct exposure to the industry, but several household names have have gotten involved, however peripherally, or are expected to benefit from more permissive marijuana laws, including Jack in the Box (JACK), Microsoft (MSFT), HP Inc. (HPQ), and Cree (CREE).Lawn- and garden-care company Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) also does business in hydroponics, or the practice of soil-less plant growing often used to grow marijuana. Scotts Miracle-Gro said Tuesday said it would buy Sunlight Supply, a large U.S. hydroponic distributor, for $450 million.But given the fragile, often patchwork state of marijuana regulations, the pot industry is still very volatile and drama-prone. Scotts Miracle-Gro stock collapsed in January after management said the ""slower-than-expected pace of regulatory changes in California"" was harming its hydroponics business.The LED company's products appear on lists of preferred indoor lighting options for growers with hydroponic set-ups. While LEDs carry higher up-front costs than other lights, they produce less heat and use up less electricity.Sure. Microsoft offers software that tracks cannabis sales for states that allow them via a partnership.HP will work with Flowhub, a developer of pot industry compliance software, to roll out cash-register terminals that have Flowhub's software.Marijuana-focused ETFs, like the ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ) and AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), are among the exchange traded funds that track the cannabis industry.Alternative Harvest's holdings include stocks like GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH), a company that makes seizure-fighting drugs containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a part of the cannabis plant that doesn't get you high but that typically has a relaxing effect. The fund also follows some of Canada's biggest publicly traded marijuana producers, like Aurora Cannabis and Cronos Group (CRON), which in February became the first pure-play pot stock to join the Nasdaq.AdvisorShares Vice ETF largely follows the booze and tobacco industry, but holdings with a marijuana stock aroma include Scotts Miracle-Gro and companies like Abbvie (ABBV), whose drug Marinol is made partly from synthetic cannabinoids.After years of indirectly targeting the appetites of pot enthusiasts, burger-and-taco chain Jack in the Box in December directly advertised to them.The company at that time partnered with Merry Jane, the cannabis website co-founded by Snoop Dogg, to launch a promotional munchie meal ""that commemorates the legalization of recreational cannabis in California,"" the website said.The meal, which cost $4.20, was available in select parts of the state. The chain said the partnership was ""one more way for us to connect"" with late-night customers.Cowen & Co. also said that pot legalization is good for the Jack in the Box, with the research firm singling it out as a top marijuana stock play in fast food.""Within quick-service, we note Jack in the Box has the greatest exposure to recreational marijuana use becoming more widely accepted in states that have already legalized use (10% of the store base), as well as 5 states with an upcoming legalized recreational use proposal on state ballots for the November election (52% of the store base),"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said in a report in September of 2016.""The latter is driven by 42% of the Jack store base that is located in California,"" he added.Cowen analysts in 2016 saw an opportunity for Ulta Beauty (ULTA) to expand its hemp-product offerings as customers gained a ""wider understanding"" of cannabis. Lotions infused with non-psychoactive cannabidiol are already available at dispensaries. There are also cannabis bath soaks. Ulta said it was ""not able"" to make someone available for an interview.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Will Marijuana Industry Overtake Beer As Legalization Spurs Innovation?Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?Can Cannabis Treat Seizures?

Others contend it could be a more attractive takeover target down the road. Its results have been lackluster of late, though the company's outlook indicates a growth path ahead.Complicating matters is activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a piece of Conduent. The big question is what will happen if its turnaround starts clicking.""We think Conduent is an unlikely (merger) target,"" Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, said in a recent report. ""We don't think any of the established BPO leaders, such as Accenture (ACN), IBM (IBM) or Genpact (G), have any interest in acquiring Conduent, given its focus on the low end of the market.""But others say a sell-off could come piecemeal.""(Chief Executive Ashok) Vemuri may choose to divest/sell portions of the business that are either 'noncore' or less profitable,"" said Frank Atkins, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, in a recent note to clients.

In our view, this could be in low-margin, more commoditized work, or in certain geographies which may not be of adequate scale.""In investor meetings, Vemuri has outlined plans to increase its sales force, invest in digital technologies such as data analytics, and focus on North America and Europe as core markets.What the company also wants to do is exit low-margin contracts and pursue new deals with better pricing. It aims to migrate toward higher-value-added work rather than being a soup-to-nuts services provider.""The core philosophy now is to drive a more repeatable, scalable and predictable business,"" Vemuri said on Conduent's fourth-quarter earnings call in February.  ""We are not in the business of trying to capture a headline by doing a big deal that we do not even understand how to start working on.""Regardless of what awaits the company, the split/merger strategy isn't unfamiliar. Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard in 2015 split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus on services and products for businesses, and HP Inc. (HPQ) to focus on PCs and printers.HPE in early April took a step further, spinning off its enterprise services businesses. But that entity merged with IT consulting firm Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC), now a rival of Conduent.Whether Conduent pursues a strategic direction similar to HP's remains to be seen. Xerox stock gapped up on Jan. 3, the day the spinoff was completed, and is up about 8% this year. Xerox is set to launch a slew of new products, aiming to spur revenue growth in the back half of 2017, analysts say.The move to split from Xerox was endorsed by Icahn, who built up a stake in the copy machine maker.Icahn now holds a nearly 10% stake in Conduent and picked three members of its board of directors. So he figures in whatever strategic options Conduent is looking at, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Conduent hasn't been a publicly traded company for long, but it's already is forming a cup-with-handle base that could lead to higher stock gains. Read here for more information on stocks forming cup bases.As its own entity, Florham Park, N.J.-based Conduent handles such services for businesses as state Medicaid payments, tollbooth collections, and other transactions.Along with Accenture, IBM and Genpact, a number of other business process providers compete with Conduent. They include Convergys (CVG), ExlService (EXLS) and WNS Holdings (WNS), as well as large multinational tech service providers including Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Cap Gemini (CGEMY), and the new DXC Technology.The worldwide BPO market is growing about 5% annually, says Citigroup. In 2018, it's expected to reach $197 billion, from $188 billion in 2017.As it grows, CEO Vemuri aims to provide multiple services to customers rather than spread out too thinly.""The thing we have to work on is to take various service capabilities, find the common thread between them, and sell (services) as a bundled solution,"" he said on Conduent's earnings call.Prior to joining Conduent last year, Vemuri was chief executive of iGate, an information services firm. France-based Cap Gemini acquired iGate for roughly $4 billion in 2015. Vemuri earlier worked at Infosys (INFY), an India-based consulting and tech services firm.Current results may not bode well for a takeover, though. Conduent's 2016 revenue fell 4% to $6.4 billion. Adjusted revenue in the December quarter fell 6.5% to $1.6 billion, below estimates.Conduent posted a fourth-quarter loss of $4.69 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 3 cents. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge and restructuring-related costs, Conduent said it earned an unadjusted profit of 29 cents per share vs. analysts' estimate of 23 cents. Analysts estimate that Conduent profit will rebound to 95 cents in 2018 from 75 cents this year. But it notched $1.06 in unadjusted profit last year.With a market valuation of some $3.2 billion, Conduent does not plan to repurchase shares or issue a dividend in the near term. Conduent has told analysts that if cost-cutting generates more free cash flow it could start making small acquisitions in 2018 to expand into new areas.Conduent has moved quickly to reduce its worldwide workforce to 91,000 as of Feb. 15, down from 96,000 at the end of 2016.While shares in Conduent are up about 7% since its spinoff from Xerox, Citigroup says one drag on Conduent stock has been that the company was not added to either the S&P 500 or midcap S&P 400 index post-spinoff, limiting its exposure to index investors.RELATED:Analysts Shoot Down Oracle-Accenture Deal; 'Why Buy The Cow?'

53,HP,"Like the rest of the oil industry, Helmerich & Payne (HP) saw its profits hurt after crude prices went into a bear market starting in 2014. But a turnaround is brewing for H&P.X The company posted losses in fiscal 2016 and 2017, but is expected to be back to profitability in the fiscal year that ends in September. It won't be a huge profit, only 3 cents a share according to the consensus estimate gathered by Thomson Reuters. But it's a big leap from the $1.27-a-share loss in the latest fiscal year.The consensus EPS estimate for fiscal 2019 is 80 cents a share. On the revenue side, analysts expect $2.32 billion for fiscal 2018, which would be an increase of 29%.The stock also is turning itself around. Shares have been consolidating since December 2016 and are in a recovery phase since bottoming in August.There's been resistance at the rising 50-day moving average for a few weeks, even though the stock has been trending higher. With no clear entry on the chart, investors should wait until a clearer pattern emerges. A move past the January high at 75.02 might provide such an entry.But income investors have little to be concerned about H&P's dividend. The company pays a quarterly dividend of 70 cents a share, good for an annualized yield of more than 4%. IBD calculates a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 34%.Tulsa, Okla.-based Helmerich & Payne has the largest land-drilling market share in the U.S., with more than 200 land rigs in operation.In a presentation to investors in February, H&P made no bones that higher oil prices are contributing to the company's rebound. Customer interest in additional rigs increased from a month earlier, and management boosted capital spending plans to up to $400 million from an earlier target of about $350 million.H&P says its electronically controlled FlexRigs can be upgraded to fit specific requirements for customers' needs.No doubt, the outlook for oil prices will determine how far H&P's recovery goes.

59,HP,"DepoMed (DEPO) stock tumbled to a low Wednesday not seen since a year ago, after the company pre-released negative first-quarter guidance and saw its chief executive resign amid a management shake-up and a U.S. senator's probe into opioid marketing.At the closing bell on the stock market today, DepoMed shares fell 3.1% to 13.79, after earlier falling as much as 5%. Shares hit an intraday 12-month high in late September but are down nearly 50% since then.Late Tuesday, DepoMed guided to $95 million to $100 million in first-quarter sales, lagging analysts' broader views by $15 million. That guidance will be revised May 8, during the Q4 conference call.The company also announced a management shift that saw Arthur Higgins replace former CEO James Schoeneck. Gavin Molinelli and William McKee were also added to the board.Higgins, Molinelli and McKee are aligned with activist investor Starboard, which is known for its big stake in HP Enterprise (HPE). Following the shake-up, only three of the nine board members are legacy members, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler noted in a report.DepoMed's board changes also followed reports earlier in the day that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is seeking marketing information, sales records and studies from manufacturers of top-selling opioids in the U.S.McCaskill says sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999. DepoMed was named the fifth top seller of opioids in a CNBC report. Other leaders listed include Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Mylan (MYL).IBD'S TAKE: DepoMed isn't the only company facing activist investors.

"
69,HP,"President Trump has visions of a massive Apple (AAPL) factory opening in the U.S. to churn out the latest iPhone. The idea is not completely far-fetched, but one thing seems clear: If it happens, most of the new jobs will go to robots.Even in lower-cost China, Foxconn, which assembles the iPhone there, reportedly replaced 60,000 workers with robots at one facility. That's more than half the facility's workforce. Foxconn says it is adding 10,000 ""Foxbots"" per year.China has seen its cost advantage wither away due to wage gains. It's investing more than $3 billion a year in robots — up from next to nothing before 2009 — to keep from losing its manufacturing base to lower-cost developing nations, Bernstein analysts Michael Parker and Alberto Moel wrote in a December report.Trump has vowed to rewrite or walk away from trade deals and cut corporate tax rates to level the playing field for U.S. companies. He told Congress on Feb. 28 that he'll ""bring back millions of jobs.""Although economists concur that North American Free Trade Agreement and China's admission to the World Trade Organization have taken a toll on U.S. manufacturing jobs, Trump's battle plan seems geared to fight the last war.If China must shrink its costs with a massive deployment of robots, U.S.-based manufacturers that pay much higher wages and benefits will face the same pressures.A 2015 study by Boston Consulting Group found that an automotive industry welder earned about $25 an hour, including benefits, while a robot could do the job for $8 an hour, including installation, maintenance and operating costs. The gap is expected to widen sharply as technology improves.""It is still possible to force the relocation of production"" by restricting trade via tariffs or applying political pressure, wrote Bernstein's Parker and Moel. ""However, if the point of the exercise is to restore well-paying, middle-class jobs in manufacturing in the process, the result is going to disappoint. Mandating a physical task be carried out in a high-cost labor market in 2017 is simply going to increase the chances the task is automated.""Trump relentlessly bashed air conditioning company Carrier during the campaign for its plan to close an Indiana factory and move the work to Mexico. He intervened in December, saving about 800 jobs — for now. But Carrier's parent, United Technologies (UTX), which is getting $7 million in tax incentives from Indiana to stay, said it would invest $16 million to automate the factory ""to drive the cost down.""Like Apple, United Technologies is a member of Dow Jones industrial average.United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told CNBC that while moving to Mexico would have been cheaper, the company will ""make that plant competitive just because we'll make the capital investments there, but what that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs.""Mondelez (MDLZ), the maker of Oreos, was another regular Trump campaign target for its decision to cut 600 jobs from a Chicago factory and move the work to Mexico. The company said it considered installing new production lines at its Chicago Nabisco plant but chose to do the work in Salinas, Mexico, because of a $46 million cost differential. Mondelez noted that even if the project had gone forward in Chicago, half the jobs would have been eliminated because of new labor-saving technology.IBD'S TAKE: Since taking office, President Trump has talked less about the sticks he'll use against U.S. trading partners and more about the carrots he'll offer to manufacture in the U.S. via tax reform. But, for now, Trump's economic agenda and his tax cuts for business are stuck in line behind the ObamaCare repeal effort.The food and beverage industry is expected to be among the bigger adopters of industrial robots in coming years, says Boston Consulting Group, with automakers and electronics firms continuing to lead the way. Metals and machinery, rubber and plastics, and pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are also seen ramping up robot use. A 2016 McKinsey & Co. study concluded that 59% of manufacturing activities could be automated.Foxconn said in January that it's mulling a $7 billion highly automated factory for making displays, including flat-panel TVs and monitors, in the U.S. in partnership with Apple. Transportation costs for ever-larger displays, which aren't shipped by plane like the iPhone, are a driving force behind the plan. Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou said March 1 that such plans are on hold as the company waits to see what bills are passed and what incentives are offered.Pegatron, another Apple contract manufacturer that does assembly for Dell and HP Inc. (HPQ) out of plants in California and Indiana, reportedly said after Trump's election that it could expand its U.S. capacity fourfold, relying on automation and with a minimal increase in labor. The tech industry began formulating its response last year in the event that Trump was elected and turned out to be serious about imposing 35% tariffs on imports from China.Trump hasn't threatened such hefty tariffs in recent weeks. The focus has shifted to House Republicans' plan to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% and make export revenues tax-free. The 20% rate would apply to the full value of imports, raising $1 trillion over a decade that would effectively pay for the corporate tax cut. Still, economists who back the idea say that the dollar would rise 25%, offsetting any trade advantage. Major importers like Wal-Mart (WMT) hate the idea and trade experts warn that the WTO would likely find the import tax to be illegal.Some companies haven't needed new tax deals or threats to open factories in the U.S., but automation is key to their strategies.Adidas is a prime example. The maker of athletic shoes, which has long done its labor-intensive manufacturing out of China, Indonesia and Vietnam, last year piloted what it's calling a Speedfactory in Germany, making shoes almost entirely by robots. This year, the second Adidas Speedfactory is slated to open in Atlanta, where it's expected to employ 160 people facilitating the production of a half-million shoes.The high-tech operation, Adidas says, won't just eliminate the drudgery in manufacturing (along with a lot of the workers). It also will enable the company ""to make product for the consumer, with the consumer, where the consumer lives in real time, unleashing unparalleled creativity and endless opportunities for customization.""Meanwhile, Nike (NKE), another Dow industrials component, and Under Armour (UAA) are both developing strategies for manufacturing in the U.S., close to their customers. It's a safe bet that robots will be doing most of the work.The implications for workers are clear, says Boston Consulting Group. ""As U.S. factories adopt advanced manufacturing technologies, demand will surge for higher-skilled, white-collar workers who can quickly adapt to new technologies and processes, and demand will lessen for blue-collar workers who are trained in specific skills.""Despite his vow to bring back millions of jobs, Trump isn't oblivious to the job threat posed by robots. In a postelection interview, the New York Times asked Trump whether he was worried that companies will keep their factories in the U.S. but automate their workers out of jobs.""They will, and we'll make the robots too,"" Trump said. He added: ""Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything. But we're going to. I mean, look, robotics is becoming very big and we're going to do that.""Trump is more right than wrong about the U.S. ceding an opportunity, writes Frank Tobe, publisher of the Robot Report. ""Two-thirds of the robotics industry and 100% of industrial robots are manufactured outside of the U.S. by non-U.S. companies.""China's leadership has fully embraced the adoption of robots as part of its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. The plan reflects not only wage pressures but demographics, as its working-age population shrinks. Whether the U.S. will avoid committing to robots for fear of displacing workers is a real question with serious competitive implications.Academics and industry leaders made the case in ""A Roadmap for U.S. Robotics"" last fall that robots have been a plus for manufacturing jobs. ""Over the last 5-6 years we have seen introduction of 600,000 new jobs in manufacturing. During the same period, we have seen significant growth in adoption of robot systems in industry,"" they wrote.Yet their upbeat predictions come with some uncertainty. The auto industry has been the biggest adopter of robotics, but that's happened as sales rebounded from just 10.4 million in 2009 to a record high 17.5 million in 2016. But if demand has peaked, as industry players suspect, then increasing automation may not be quite so positive for employment in auto manufacturing in the future.RELATED:U.S. Manufacturing Gears Up As 'America First' Trump Takes OfficeThe Top 10 Jobs Robots Could Steal From Humans By 2025Forget The Doomsday Clock, There's Now A Robot Fear IndexThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

Stifel kept its hold rating on GoPro, but dropped its price target to 9 from 10.GoPro said its first-quarter revenue would be at the upper end of its previously announced range of $190 million to $210 million.

""Management reiterating double-digit growth in 2017 makes it hard to argue for further near-term downside, but we need better visibility into demand before changing our more neutral stance on the shares.""GoPro management cited the company's new Karma flying-camera drone for the first-quarter revenue upside.GoPro ranks No. 7 out of nine stocks in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group.

97,HP,"3D printer maker 3D Systems (DDD) will report fourth-quarter earnings before the market open Tuesday, and it's expected to show continued struggles as the company undergoes a turnaround and faces increased competition.Wall Street expects Q4 revenue of $176.76 million, down 3.5% from Q4 2015 but up 13% from Q3. Earnings per share minus items are expected to fall to 17 cents from 19 cents in Q4 2015.Rock Hill, S.C.-based 3D Systems is under growing pressure from General Electric (GE), HP Inc. (HPQ), Siemens (SIEGY) and other companies that are pumping up their strength in 3D printers. The 3D print trade faces an array of challenges, ranging from the type and price of potential materials, to rethinking entire supply chains for portions of the industrial landscape.3D printer maker Stratasys (SSYS) reports its Q4 results before the market open March 9.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics.

Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc.The 3D printer market stirred an investor and media frenzy in the three years through 2014.

The drop resulted in a failed near-breakout. Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock had formed a cup base with a buy point of 24.89, and shares came within a penny of that price on Wednesday. But Friday's fall of more than 8% below the buy point triggers a sell signal, in any case.The technology company — half of the former Hewlett-Packard that was split into HPE and PC/printer company HP Inc.

Antonio Neri, who was named president in June, will replace Whitman. October quarter earnings and revenue topped lowered expectations.

But for the January quarter, Salesforce.com forecast adjusted earnings of 32-33 cents a share vs. estimates of 34 cents a share.

106,HP,"Extreme Networks (EXTR), the one-time highflier from the dot-com era that crashed and disappeared from radar screens for more than a decade, is now one of the top stocks in one of the market's strongest-performing industry groups.X After a second attempt at reinventing itself in 2015, Extreme is now ranked No. 2 by IBD Stock Checkup — based on earnings, sales, margins and stock performance trends — in the Computer-Networking group, which is ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups.Extreme's resurgence began after it installed board member Ed Meyercord as chief executive. Meyercord pared down the company, narrowing its focus and stabilizing its finances, before beginning to build it up piece by piece.""They decided the acquisition strategy was the right strategy,"" said D.A. Davidson Co. analyst Mark Kelleher, even after high hopes for its $180 million acquisition of Enterasys Networks in 2013 were largely dashed.Now, Extreme has shown that it has the right team in place to execute on its vision. It's pushing past the $1 billion annual revenue threshold and is throwing off enough cash to make key technology acquisitions that have broadened out its product set.Extreme bills itself as the only pure play end-to-end enterprise networking company with software-driven solutions that go from the wireless edge to the data center. It's the clear No. 3 in the enterprise network market, behind the dominant leader Cisco Systems (CSCO), and No. 2 Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and growing faster than the mature market in which it competes.That position doesn't just reflect its third-place revenue share, still only about 4% of the market, but also its ranking by Gartner, which puts Extreme a close third behind Cisco and HP — and well ahead of the rest — both in its ability to execute and the completeness of its product vision.Gartner's September report also highlighted Extreme's ""strong customer service through a 100% insourced service and support team.""Meyercord said on a Nov. 7 fiscal first-quarter earnings call that Extreme is leveraging its recognition from Gartner, which he called ""one of the most relied-upon resources for enterprise customers"" and ""the best marketing we have,"" according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Extreme is ""taking share from our larger competitors,"" Chief Financial Officer Drew Davies told a Needham networking and security conference on Nov. 14. He highlighted business wins in the past couple of weeks, including the Wynn Boston Harbor resort and a competitive bidding win at Raytheon.In its latest acquisition, which closed in October, Extreme bought Brocade's data center switching, routing and analytics assets for $55 million in cash. The deal is on track to add $230 million in revenue for Extreme in the first year.Broadcom (AVGO), which acquired the rest of Brocade, was willing to part with that portion of its business so as not to compete against the networking vendors such as Extreme that use Broadcom chipsets to power their switches, D.A. Davidson's Kelleher told Investor's Business Daily.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Extreme Networks were whipsawed in a volatile week for technology stocks. The upshot from a technical perspective is that the stock will have to work on a new base with a 14.44 buy point, the point at which an investor has the best opportunity for significant near-term gains. A leading stock in a leading industry group can be a recipe for a winning stock if bought at the right time.Kelleher said Extreme's strategy to build a complete enterprise networking offering by putting together pieces such as Brocade's data center business makes a lot of sense.Because of various mergers — and, in the case of Avaya, a bankruptcy — Extreme has been able to pick up ""all of these embedded assets that weren't being optimized,"" Kelleher said.Kelleher expects there will be more such acquisition opportunities ahead, though he expects Extreme to take about six months to digest its latest purchase.In July, Extreme strengthened its competitive position when it closed on its purchase of Avaya's networking assets, which it won with a $100-million bid. Extreme said the deal would add to earnings and produce $200 million in annual revenue.In October 2016, Extreme finalized its purchase of the wireless local area network business of Zebra Technologies (ZBRA), which is expected to generate more than $115 million in fiscal 2018 revenue.Those three acquisitions have essentially doubled the total addressable market opportunity for Extreme from $8 billion to $16 billion.""(Extreme's) strong (first) quarter was driven by the better than expected results of the Zebra and Avaya transactions,"" wrote Needham analyst Alex Henderson. ""The new employees are delivering better-than-expected productivity.""Henderson said Extreme's staff is now unencumbered by the constraints of their prior company structures. In Henderson's view, the new Extreme is proving through the ""exceptionally smooth integration of the Zebra acquisition"" that the company can execute on its acquisition strategy.On the fiscal first-quarter earnings call, Meyercord called the Brocade deal an ""important piece of the puzzle that helps us complete our enterprise networking solutions portfolio,"" enabling it to meet the large-scale data-center needs of Fortune 500 customers.Extreme now has 30,000 customers, after a picking up a large base of blue-chip clients via acquisitions, and one of its keys to growth will be cross-selling opportunities. Gartner says government and education have been Extreme's main vertical markets, but that customers in retail, hospitality, manufacturing and healthcare also ""should consider Extreme.""Henderson noted that Extreme more than doubled the number of $1 million-plus deals in its past two quarters.Outside of acquisitions, Extreme has been generating positive organic revenue growth in the low-single digits in recent quarters, an improvement after the retrenchment in 2015, and analysts see some potential for further improvement. Yet, Extreme's target market is only expected to grow an annualized 2% in coming years, so acquisitions and market-share gains will have to be growth drivers.For the December quarter, Extreme offered revenue guidance of $236 million to $246 million, well above the $224 million consensus. The guidance for EPS of 10 cents-14 cents was below the 18-cent estimate, but analysts have downplayed that as a function of timing of the Brocade deal.The quarterly results won't include October, always a relatively big month for the Brocade data-center business. That means Extreme will get more of a cost bump than a revenue bump for this one quarter.Shares of Extreme were down Friday by 0.9% to 12.74.RELATED:Extreme Networks In Buy Range, With NFL Wi-Fi Season In Full-SwingWhy This Networking Firm's Shares Jumped To A Two-Month HighEarnings Beat, Buying Spree Are Driving This 'Extreme' BreakoutStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

113,HP,"President Trump plans to shut down America's refugee program for four months to give officials time to implement stricter vetting procedures. When the program restarts, it will take in no more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal 2017 — fewer than half the number admitted in 2016.Though designed to safeguard Americans from terrorist attacks launched by refugees — such as the recent stabbing spree at Ohio State University and the truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin — the hiatus will boost citizens' economic security too. In recent years, federal officials have abused the refugee program, turning it into yet another avenue for employers to bring in lower-cost foreign workers who displace American employees.Such behavior is shameful. It's possible to help those fleeing war and oppression without kicking American workers to the curb.The Obama administration announced at the end of June that it was launching a ""Call to Action"" in partnership with major corporations to place refugees with employers in the United States.The administration then announced that all Syrian illegal aliens living in the country would receive Temporary Protected Status, a type of amnesty that awards work permits to the recipients and almost always ends up becoming a permanent situation.Numerous companies are poised to hire these foreign workers. Some of the firms have even laid off Americans, only to turn around and add refugees to their employment rolls.Over a dozen major companies — including Microsoft, Accenture, Google and Chobani — answered the past administration's call. The firms claim they're getting involved because of humanitarian motives.But their bottom lines are a key motive, too.Refugees are a source of cheap labor. The median income for refugee households is $8,000 less than the median for native-born American households. Forty-four percent of refugees qualify as ""low income,"" compared with just one-third of U.S.-born residents.Chobani, the Greek-yogurt giant,  opened a Twin Falls, Idaho, plant in 2012. The company has hired nearly 200 refugees — at a plant that now employs more than 1,000 people.With 300 refugees arriving in Twin Falls each year, there is a good chance they will displace more Americans. The company previously laid off over 40 employees in the midst of its refugee hiring binge. And the CEO has admitted that employing refugees helps to ""fuel business's bottom line.""Despite a slowly improving economy, 7.5 million Americans can't find jobs. Nearly two million of them have been searching without success for over six months.Admittedly, some refugees are in desperate need of help. There are nearly 7 million displaced people in Syria alone. An additional 5 million have fled the country. Many of them, especially those languishing in refugee camps, lack adequate food, medical services and access to education.Companies don't have to hurt Americans to help these people. For the cost of resettling one refugee in America, government agencies and private corporations could care for 12 refugees on-site in the Middle East, leaving them well-situated to return home when conditions there stabilize.Some firms are already providing aid in the region. HP has donated laptops to Syrian children living in refugee camps. UPS has delivered health kits and winter clothing. If they want to help solve the crisis, other companies could join them, instead of selfishly using the refugee program to boost their own profits.The Trump administration can keep its promise to protect Americans by restricting the resettlement program. Doing so will not only reduce the risk of terror attacks, but also prevent employers from using refugees as cheap labor.Editors' note: An earlier version of this story asserted Chobani, the Greek yogurt company, hired refugees instead of American workers due to a wage discrepancy. However, the author's contention could not be confirmed, and it has therefore been removed from the piece.

Economists had projected a 0.4% rise in the price of imports, a 0.1% rise in exports.The Philly Fed Index showed mid-Atlantic-region manufacturing  growth slowed sharply in November, sending the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey to an 18.9 reading for the month.

122,HP,"It's hard to think of LogMeIn (LOGM) as an underdog anymore.This scrappy tech firm took on the likes of Cisco (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Citrix (CTXS) and pioneered remote access to desktop and handheld devices via cloud computing. Now it's turning its guns on targets like Salesforce.com (CRM), Oracle (ORCL) and Zendesk (ZEN).XEarly this year, it tripled in size overnight to become one of the world's top 10 Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, companies based on revenue, thanks to its $1.8 billion merger with Citrix's GoTo business.""The company is well on its way to its three-year, post-acquisition targets, and we believe the cash flow opportunity still justifies a much higher stock price,"" JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty wrote in a recent note to clients, after LogMeIn disclosed financial results for the third quarter. JPMorgan is a market maker in LogMeIn shares.Based in Boston, LogMeIn offers software tools for cloud connectivity and collaboration, secure device access, and remote customer support. For an increasingly mobile and global workforce, it offers products such as Join.me, for online meetings; GoToWebinar, for online seminars; GoToAssist, for online assistance; and LastPass, for online password management.Now LogMeIn is at that point where it's an established tech player, yet small enough with around $1 billion in annual sales to generate powerful growth.Thanks in part to a 23% annual pretax profit margin and 26% annual return on equity, LogMeIn ranks No. 1 out of 56 companies in IBD's enterprise software group. ServiceNow (NOW), Paycom Software (PAYC), Blackbaud (BLKB) and Salesforce round out the top five.Within its core markets, LogMeIn is growing fastest in what is known as the identity business. LastPass, a product that offers simple and secure access to apps, devices and data, is doing especially well.In an email interview with Investor's Business Daily, LogMeIn Chief Executive Bill Wagner described his company as a leader in serving small and medium businesses. LogMeIn also counts millions of individuals among its customers, as well as the largest technology providers such as Dell Technologies (DVMT) and HP Inc. (HPQ); the world's biggest telcos like Verizon (VZ) and Australia's Telstra; and familiar Silicon Valley growth names like Evernote and Dropbox.A key market where LogMeIn sees long-term growth opportunity is a realm known as Unified Communications and Collaboration. It's one that has emerged as traditional enterprise collaboration vendors such as Microsoft and IBM (IBM), as well as traditional enterprise communication vendors like Cisco, have made inroads into each other's turfs.""Prior to the (GoTo) merger, our popular Join.me product was a high growth disrupter in the collaboration market,"" Wagner said. ""Now we have products like GoMeeting, GoToWebinar, OpenVoice and Grasshopper, which essentially bolstered our annual (communications and collaboration) sales by an order of magnitude.""JPMorgan's Auty says LogMeIn built a successful franchise in remote access, then added several related high-growth businesses around that core, such as web conferencing. Yet he sees room for even more. Auty noted that LogMeIn hit a targeted $100 million in cost synergies a year ahead of plan, and revenue synergies are already starting to kick in. For example, LogMeIn consolidated 50% of data centers and is successfully cross-selling LastPass subscriptions to GoTo customers.Beyond software applications, Auty sees a ""larger opportunity"" in providing a cloud platform for companies tied to the Internet of Things.A LogMeIn spokesperson told IBD that the company's fledgling IoT efforts are centered on customer engagement and support. That could pit it directly against Salesforce's Service Cloud as well as Oracle and Zendesk.It's all showing up in the quarterly results. During the third quarter, LogMeIn logged triple-digit earnings and revenue gains, while cash flow from operations surged to $90.5 million, a hefty 33% of revenue. The company also raised guidance for profits and free-cash-flow margins for 2017 as a whole.Shares briefly shot to an all-time high of 129.52 but now sit 7% below that peak, undercutting a 121.35 entry they cleared in October. Still, they are up about 24% year to date, while the S&P 500 has risen 16% over the same period.Auty rates LogMeIn stock as overweight and upped his price target from 140 to 145.In February, CEO Wagner hinted at ""big ambitions"" while alluding to a next generation of cloud technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Software stocks and cloud players have a strong presence in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks, where you can find new ideas for your investing watchlist.Just a handful of months later, the company acquired the Israeli firm Nanorep. An artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning expert, Nanorep already makes chatbots and virtual agents ""more human"" for hundreds of companies across the world, including Intuit (INTU), FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (VOD), according to LogMeIn.The acquisition accelerates LogMeIn's efforts in the rapidly growing market for digital customer service — one that it expects to balloon from 3% of all customer service interactions in 2017 to 30% by 2022.Wagner told IBD that the $45 million Nanorep deal builds on his company's history of disruptive innovation.""We were an early innovator in the 'freemium' business model, a structure we relied upon for our organic growth in the early days of the company and one that has been copied by many other successful technology companies,"" Wagner said.That model, of converting free users to paid or premium subscribers, was successfully deployed by Join.me. It offered single-click, frictionless sharing of screens, showing up older rivals like Cisco's WebEx and Citrix's GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is now part of LogMeIn's portfolio.Launched in October 2010, Join.me was recognized as the fastest-growing web-conferencing product less than five years later.LogMeIn is now looking to harness Nanorep's AI expertise across its entire, newly expanded suite of product offerings. With GoTo under its belt, the company says it supports 25 million users and 900 million conferencing minutes every month, as well as roughly 200 million customer engagements and 5 billion voice minutes every year.But as LogMeIn targets new markets, challenges await. Patent litigation could resurface and roil the stock, experts caution. Plus, upstarts like Splashtop and TeamViewer are moving into remote access, support and monitoring.Competition in this increasingly crowded space is expected to drive down prices, with only the strongest players likely to survive.Still, analyst expectations for future growth have marched up, notwithstanding LogMeIn's formidable annual 45% earnings growth rate and 46% sales growth rate over the past three years.Consensus estimates call for annual earnings of $3.28 per share in 2017, up from $2.03 in 2016 and from $1.66 in 2015. Earnings are seen climbing to $4.10 a share in 2018, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue is forecast at $1.02 billion in 2017, ballooning from $336 million in 2016 and from $272 million in 2015. It is seen rising to $1.17 billion in 2018.LogMeIn's free cash flow, a key valuation metric, has especially impressed industry analysts. Its free-cash-flow margin is now expected to be 30% for the year and to expand to more than 33% in 2019, said Matthew Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.Investors and analysts await the strategic road map that Wagner is set to discuss at an event on Dec. 19.""We think the event could be a catalyst as management updates longer-term targets,"" Hedberg wrote on Oct. 26, calling LogMeIn a ""favorite idea"" for the rest of this year. He rates LogMeIn stock an outperform and hiked his price target from 140 to 143.RELATED:Could This IBD 50 Software Stock Be The Next Cloud-Transition Star After Adobe?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

The rest, including Apple (AAPL), declined significantly, research firm IDC said late Wednesday.Lenovo continued its reign as the No. 1 PC vendor worldwide in Q4, with 22.4% market share by unit shipments. The Chinese company shipped 15.7 million PCs in the fourth quarter, up 1.7% from Q4 2015, IDC said.HP was a close second with 21.7% market share in Q4. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm shipped 15.3 million PCs last quarter, up 6.6%.Dell was third with 15.7% market share, but posted the fastest growth among the top players in Q4. It shipped 11 million units, up 8.2%.Apple claimed fourth place with 7.5% market share in Q4, but its PC shipments fell 0.9%. Taiwan-based Asus was No. 5 with 7.4% market share, but its shipments tumbled 11.3%.Outside of the top five, the remaining PC vendors in aggregate saw their shipments fall 11.9%, IDC said.The total PC industry saw shipments fall 1.5% in Q4 to 70.2 million units.For the full year, PC shipments declined 5.7% to 260 million units, IDC said. PC sales were constrained earlier in the year by high inventories and free Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 10 upgrades.""The fourth quarter results reinforce our expectations for market stabilization, and even some recovery,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement. ""The contraction in traditional PC shipments experienced over the past five years finally appears to be giving way as users move to update systems. We have a good opportunity for traditional PC growth in commercial markets, while the consumer segment should also improve as it feels less pressure from slowing phone and tablet markets.""The top three PC vendors — Lenovo, HP and Dell — accounted for 59.8% of total PC shipments in Q4, compared with 56% in Q4 2015.Also Wednesday, research firm Gartner estimated that global PC shipments fell 3.7% in Q4 to 72.6 million units. It measures the market in a slightly different way than IDC.RELATED:Strong Notebook PC Sales Give HP A Lift, But EPS Guide Misses

125,HP,"Frances Hesselbein was an unlikely candidate to lead a revolution at the Girl Scouts.Her only child was a boy of 8 when a church-based troop in Johnstown, Pa., asked her to fill in as the leader for six weeks while they found a replacement for the woman who had left on a mission to India. Finding the work with girls exciting, she stayed on for eight years and in 1970 was recruited to be the executive director of the Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania.She began implementing the principles of the father of modern business management, Peter Drucker, and the results caught the attention of the national board, which invited her to be interviewed as a candidate to lead the Girl Scouts of the USA in 1976.""I knew that since its founding in 1912, they'd always brought in some distinguished leader from the outside, but my husband insisted I apply,"" Hesselbein told IBD. ""Figuring I had no chance, I bluntly told them they needed to go through a radical transformation to be relevant. I was shocked when two days later they offered me the job, and for the next 13 years I never had a bad day!""By the time she stepped down, the makeover had turned the Girl Scouts into a growing and vibrant organization. Today, at the start of her own second century, she heads the prestigious Frances Hesselbein Leadership Institute.Born Frances Richards on Nov. 1, 1915, in Johnstown, she had just started at the University of Pittsburgh, hoping to become a playwright, when her father died of malaria contracted while serving the Army overseas. She dropped out to help provide an income for the family. Four years later, at 22, she married John Hesselbein and they worked hard to build a small photography and advertising company.When Hesselbein was asked to lead the troop of 30 10-year-olds, she taught them not only how earn money, but to save and invest it, and took them on field trips to expand their horizons ""during those eight glorious years,"" she said.In 1970, three business leaders she worked with on United Way fundraising urged her to take the job of executive director for the regional Girl Scout council, which was having serious financial difficulties. She agreed to do it only for six months to straighten things out. On her first day, she brought in six copies of Drucker's ""The Effective Executive"" for the staff to read.""There was a magic about Peter's writing,"" she wrote in ""My Life in Leadership."" ""He spoke to us in elegant, spare language that connected and inspired us, and moved us into the future. The vision he held before us embraced us; we made it our own. His philosophy gave us the courage to launch a quiet revolution. … Gone was the cold, austere command-and-control style of the old hierarchy. Alive and passionate were mission, values, people, accountability, and performance.""Four years later, she was asked to helm the much larger regional office in York in Eastern Pennsylvania, and her husband began working for the state council for the arts in nearby Harrisburg.When Hesselbein was made CEO of the national organization, membership had been in decline for eight years and was below 2 million, with 650,000 adult volunteers and staff. She instituted Drucker's ""circular management"" of widely distributed responsibility. The results included:""We focused on our mission, which was to help every girl reach her potential,"" Hesselbein said.By the time she stepped down, membership had climbed to 2.25 million, led by 788,000 adults.Hesselbein had attended a Drucker seminar in 1981 and often turned to him for advice. He told everyone that she was the best leader he had ever met (""she could run any company""). When she stepped down from the Girl Scouts in 1990, he recruited her to head his new Foundation for Nonprofit Management in New York City, which now bears her name.So what is the difference between leadership and management?""Leadership flows from inner character and integrity of ambition, which inspires others to lend themselves to your organization's mission,"" she said. ""Management is the set of skills that can help get things done. Unfortunately, its practice is too often a bag of manipulative tricks to advance someone's own interests, which creates cynicism.""Business can learn from the social sector how to define a mission that mobilizes talents and aspirations, Hesselbein said. Overall, corporations have been improving their leadership in the past decade as they have seen the results — in better morale and connection with communities — when employees volunteer their time. She cites MetLife (MET) and Mutual of America as two outstanding examples. She has done coaching for numerous Fortune 500 clients, including Wal-Mart (WMT), HP (HPQ), Boeing (BA) and IBM (IBM).Hesselbein said women should see themselves as leaders with special experiences who can help a company achieve its goals and play a vital role in society. They could prepare to assume the responsibilities of corporate governance by sharing their talents on the boards of nonprofit organizations.She has donated her archives to the University of Pittsburgh, which now has the Hesselbein Global Academy for Student Leadership & Civic Engagement. Kevin Kearns, a professor of public and nonprofit management at the graduate school of public and international affairs, said, ""Frances shares her key principles and invaluable insights about purpose, values, and ethics with a group of select students in our 18-month leadership development program. She holds an honorary doctorate not only from our university, but 20 others which have recognized her outstanding contribution and regard her as a national treasure.""Hesselbein's ancestors on both sides served in the armed forces and she has been a frequent speaker at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and other military institutions.In 1998 she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, as ""a pioneer for women, volunteerism, diversity and opportunity."" President George H.W. Bush also appointed Hesselbein to two commissions on national and community service.Hesselbein has spread the gospel of good leadership by editing ""Leader to Leader,"" the Institute's free, award-winning quarterly journal, and traveling to 68 countries. She is now also using interactive online dialogues, Skype, YouTube, and Twitter.Asked how she thought the institute might be different in five years, Hesselbein responded, ""There's a hunger for becoming better leaders all over the world, which is very exciting. We will be expanding our collaboration with powerful partners across the globe in all sectors, including free webinars for leaders at every level in poor countries.""Unmentioned by the Energizer Bunny of leadership: any plan to retire.Revitalized the Girl Scouts of America and now heads a prestigious leadership training institute.Overcame: No training or experience in running a national organization.Lesson: Great leaders get their troops excited by inspiring them to contribute to decision-making.""Pursuing a mission without achieving results is dispiriting; achieving results without a mission is meaningless.""""Good leaders make people's strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.""""Communication is not saying something; communication is being heard.""""You should be a living example of what you are preaching.""""Dispirited, unmotivated, unappreciated workers cannot compete in a highly competitive world.""""The leader for today and the future will be focused on how to be — how to develop quality, character, mindset, values and courage.""MORE ABOUT SUCCESSFUL LEADERS:Nina Tassler Used Her Outsider's Insight To Succeed At CBS It's Been All Business For Packers Great, Entrepreneur Willie Davis Leaders Build Credibility On A Foundation of Integrity And Trust

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company earned 36 cents a share excluding items, up 20% year over year, on sales of $12.51 billion, up 2%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected HP to generate sales of $11.9 billion, down 2%, in Q4.It was HP's first quarter of sales growth since it split from Hewlett-Packard a year ago. That transaction also spawned Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which edged expectations with its earnings report late Tuesday.But HP's current-quarter EPS guidance disappointed investors.

Sales in its printer and supplies unit fell 8% to $4.56 billion. Notebook PC sales rose 6% to $4.64 billion and accounted for 58% of revenue in the company's personal computer unit last quarter. Desktop and workstation PC sales also grew in Q4. Consumer PC revenue rose 7% for HP last quarter while commercial PC revenue increased 3%.HP management credited its strong PC performance to its focus on targeted segments of the market like premium consumer and gaming PCs.HP's sales of premium consumer PC likely benefited from Apple's (AAPL) delayed notebook refresh, Long said in a research note. And HP's gaming PCs got a boost from a recent graphics card refresh, he said.""We are impressed with the performance, but remain concerned that the broader (PC) market continues to decline and share gains will become increasingly harder to attain,"" Long said.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his sector perform rating on HP and price target of 16.Investor concerns with HP include its struggling printer supplies unit, the potential for PC component shortages and general macro uncertainty, Daryanani said.RELATED:HP Gains On Lenovo In PCs; Apple Mac Sales TumbleApple MacBook Pro Refresh Unlikely To Boost Top Line Much

136,HP,"Apple (AAPL) needs to dramatically increase its cash dividends if it wants to entice investors to buy its stock, Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said Wednesday.The Cupertino, Calif.-based consumer electronics giant has posted three straight quarters of declining sales and earnings on a year-over-year basis. For the current quarter, Apple's fiscal Q1, Wall Street is modeling a 2% increase in sales and a 2% decrease in earnings per share.Investors are looking to the Fall 2017 release of the iPhone 8 as the next major catalyst for the stock. But White says the company could create interest in the stock before then by increasing its dividend yield to that of its peers. Apple traditionally updates its capital return program in April, when it releases fiscal Q2 results.""Given the roller coaster ride that Apple investors continue to find themselves on each year, we believe Apple should materially hike its dividend yield to a range of 3.5% to 4.0% (vs. 2.1% now) to attract more value investors that can act as a steadying force during rough patches,"" White said in a research report. ""The excuse that Apple's stock is so cheap, the company can buy back more shares (vs. a material dividend hike), is wearing thin.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, since Nov. 1. More attractive stocks for investors to consider can be found on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.Apple should significantly increase its dividend even without a repatriation of foreign profits, he said. President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a corporate tax holiday on foreign profits.""Repatriation or no repatriation, we believe Apple should meaningfully hike its dividend,"" White said. ""Already, Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are sporting a dividend yield of approximately 3.5%. When will Apple join the party?""White reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 185.Apple rose 1% to 111.03 on the stock market today, working on a flat base with a possible buy point of 118.79. But shares are still trading below their 50-day line.RELATED:Are Apple, FANG Stocks Ready To Join The Trump Rally?Trump Targets Drug Prices, Apple, Seeks '5 Minutes' With Offshoring FirmsSquare Stock Gains On Apple Pay Mobile Partnership

145,HP,"The new Nissan (NSANY) Leaf debuted to mixed reviews from auto sites and blogs late Tuesday, with most noting that what the 2018 model of the popular mass-market electric vehicle lacks in design and range, vs. rivals from General Motors (GM) and Tesla (TSLA), it makes up in price.XThe Japanese automaker touts the refreshed model as having longer range at a lower price, better performance, improved design and cutting-edge technologies.Notably, the 2018 Nissan Leaf has a range of 150 miles on a single battery charge, up 40% from last year's model, according to Inside EVs. Its base price drops to just under $30,000 before tax incentives vs. nearly $31,000 in the 2017 model. Battery capacity climbs to 40 kWh from 30 kWh, and horsepower to 147 hp from 107.The new Leaf goes on sale in the U.S. early next year. Nissan is looking to revive its EV sales with the redesigned Leaf. The ""aged"" 2017 model has dropped to fourth place behind the Tesla Model S, Tesla Model X and Chevy Bolt among best-sellers in the EV segment this year, according to Edmunds.Here is a roundup of the reviews:Over at Jalopnik, writer Justin Westbrook was less than wowed by the design aesthetic but found it a ""pretty sweet deal"" nonetheless.""The new Leaf is a neat little car that seems perfect for a daily commute that isn't punishingly long,"" he wrote. ""While its performance figures put it at a disadvantage against a Chevy Bolt or a Tesla Model 3, its $29,990 starting price before incentives puts it at a big cost advantage. That is attractively cheap for a reliable and easily-serviceable electric vehicle.""The advanced technology impressed the Jalopnik writer, ""including some semi-autonomous functionalities with its ProPilot system, where the car can manage single-lane highway driving. That's paired with a self-parking feature, as well as a single-pedal operation mode called e-Pedal, where you can control acceleration and deceleration with just a single pedal.""""The all-new model improves on just about everything from the outgoing Leaf,"" in Westbrook's view — but it's no Tesla Model 3.Fred Lambert at Electrek called the 2018 Leaf's new design ""arguably the biggest change"" in the new-gen model, but gave it thin praise.""The Leaf's profile remains roughly the same — though they claimed that it has been refined,"" Lambert wrote. ""What has been completely refreshed is the front fascia, which had been the main point of criticism for the design of the previous version of the car.""He also called out ""a few things that Nissan didn't update and could be disappointing to some,"" such as capacities and times for regular and quick charging.Inside EVs offered perhaps the most detailed dive into design changes at the heart of the new Nissan Leaf, finding its looks ""far angrier than its easygoing predecessor.""""The new 2018 Nissan Leaf seeks to be more competitive with a slew of driver assistant technologies, an increased range, and a sportier and tech-forward design,"" the website staff added.Kim Reynolds of Motor Trends took the new Leaf on the test track and had praise for the new advanced technologies.He wrote: ""ProPilot Assist is sort of a Tesla Autopilot light (at a fraction of the price). Relying on just a single forward-facing radar and a monocular video camera, ProPilot Assist provides single-lane, feet-off-the-pedals driving (what's called adaptive cruise control). Alone, this is nothing unusual. Its dexterity in responding to slinking traffic (including right down to 0 mph) is, though.

The Nasdaq retreated 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose was flat. Volume in the stock market today was lower on both major exchanges compared with the same time Thursday.The negative reversal could be tied to Yellen's speech, which broke no new ground but could be seen as openly defying President Trump. Yellen's term as Fed chair will expire Feb. 3. Trump has not signaled whether or not Yellen will be reappointed, but the Jackson Hole speech may have made reappointment less likely.Yellen defended the increased regulations imposed after the financial crisis of 2008. Some market watchers say her stance is a sign that she believes she has no chance to be reappointed.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, lowly rated stock groups such as oil, transportation and apparel retailers were delivering the day's best gains. Tulsa, Okla.-based contract driller Helmerich & Payne (HP) rose about 2% but remains 47% off its high.

Shares initially fell, but closed strong to finish up 2.9%, at 23.54, in the stock market today. That's just shy of a 23.63 buy point from a cup base. HPE topped that entry point a few times in the past two weeks, hitting an all-time intraday high of 23.85 on Friday, but hasn't closed in buy range.Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).""HPE's Q4 results reflect challenges similar to those at Cisco: mixed regional execution but overall stable demand in the United States and some weakness in the United Kingdom,"" said Alex Kurtz, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report. ""A key catalyst is the potential treatment of its foreign cash under the new U.S. administration and how this could affect buybacks and/or M&A next year.""IBD'S TAKE:  Of the three large cap stocks in IBD's Computer-Tech Services group, HPE has the highest Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing. HPE's CR is 80 out of a possible 99, while Accenture's is 73 and IBM follows at 52. CACI International has a CR of 90, but it trades in low volume.Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, had a similar view after Cisco reported fiscal Q1 earnings on Nov. 17. ""Cisco has one of the largest overseas cash hoards at roughly $60 billion and has been a poster child for repatriation and corporate tax reform. At the very least, we expect Cisco could use repatriated cash to buy back stock and/or increase the dividend, which could boost shares,"" he wrote last week.Cisco guided to January-quarter earnings per share of 56 cents vs. consensus estimate of 59 cents.HPE said non-GAAP earnings rose 17% to 61 cents in the three months ended Oct. 31, while revenue, adjusted for divestitures and currency, fell 7% to $12.5 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected 60 cents and $12.8 billion.In the current quarter, HPE forecast profit of 44 cents at the midpoint of its guidance vs. consensus estimates of 46 cents.On  its earnings call, HPE told analysts that server revenue fell 6% and networking sales were flat, but solid-state flash storage was a bright spot, up 100% year over and now at an annual run-rate of $750 million.HPE might have lost share in the server market to Cisco, said a Jefferies report.HPE in May said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp.

157,HP,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) late Tuesday reported fiscal Q4 earnings that edged Wall Street estimates, but revenue and its current-quarter EPS guidance came in light.HPE said non-GAAP earnings rose 17% to 61 cents in the three months ended Oct. 31, while revenue, adjusted for divestitures and currency, fell 7% to $12.5 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected 60 cents and $12.8 billion.In the current quarter, HPE forecast profit of 44 cents at the midpoint of its guidance vs. consensus estimates of 46 cents.HPE stock was down 1.4% in after-hours trading, after the earnings release. Shares fell 1.1% to 22.85 in Tuesday's regular session, after hitting an all-time high of 23.85 on Friday. HPE stock hit a buy point of 23.63 on Nov. 10, so it remains within buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Of the three large cap stocks in IBD's Computer-Tech Services group, HPE has the highest Composite Rating, a metric in CANSLIM investing. HPE's CR is 80 out of a possible 99, while Accenture's is 73 and IBM follows at 52. CACI International has a CR of 90, but it trades in low volume.Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies in November 2015. It formed HPE to focus on products and services for large businesses and printer/PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ). HPE's rivals include Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT).""During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to introduce groundbreaking innovation, and began to transform the company through strategic changes designed to enable even better financial performance,"" HPE CEO Meg Whitman said in the earnings release.HPE in May said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC). Then in September, HPE said it would spin off its software business and merge it with U.K.-based Micro Focus International. When those deals close in 2017, HPE could take one-time charges in financial results, analysts say.Some observers speculate HPE, with its remaining server, data storage, and computer networking businesses, could be taken private. Another scenario has Whitman making acquisitions to build up HPE's remaining businesses.Editor's Note: Corrected to show revenue and EPS guidance came in short of estimates.RELATED:Could HPE Go Shopping For Cisco Rival Arista Networks?HPE To Spin Off Software Unit, Slims Down As Dell Bulks UpWill Broadcom Chip Boost Arista Networks Vs.

159,HP,"Will it be a blue Christmas for consumer electronics vendors?Recent downbeat guidance from Fitbit (FIT) and GoPro (GPRO) points to a crummy holiday season for those gadget makers. The big question is whether other consumer electronics vendors will end up with coal in their stockings this quarter.Consumer electronics is a top sales category for the holidays. And it could be that Fitbit wearable activity trackers and GoPro action cameras have simply fallen out of favor with shoppers.As retailers and device makers prepare for the traditional kickoff of the holiday selling season on Black Friday, analysts are placing their bets on what the big gadgets will be this Christmas.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) likely will provide some commentary on what it sees as big sellers in the December quarter, when it releases fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday before the market open.IBD'S TAKE: Institutional money was rotating into new sectors after a wacky few days for stock markets following Donald Trump's surprise presidential win, but one thing remained constant: Facebook continued to be an IBD Leaderboard stock. This is the place to go to find leading stocks, which includes the social network leader even though a 5.6% drop on Nov. 3 triggered a sell signal for some investors. But it's more complex than that, as Leaderboard can explain.This past Thursday, Best Buy revealed its Thanksgiving weekend door-buster specials designed to entice consumers to come to its stores. It's offering steep discounts on 4K ultrahigh-definition televisions from the likes of LG, Samsung and Sony (SNE); ultraportable notebook PCs from Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ) and others; and video game consoles bundled with software.The Consumer Technology Association predicts that U.S. holiday spending — covering all of November and December — on tech products will rise 3.1% this year to $36.05 billion, after rising just 1.4% last year.CTA Chief Economist Shawn DuBravac told IBD that retailers and consumer electronics makers waited until after the presidential election to begin advertising for the holiday season.The most popular tech item on holiday shopping lists this year is headphones, driven by the shift to wireless audio devices, DuBravac said. Other desired tech gifts include laptops, TVs, smartphones, tablets and video game consoles.Some 40% of shoppers plan to buy headphones as gifts this holiday season, according to a CTA survey.Apple (AAPL) has helped fuel the move to wireless headsets with its bold decision not to include an analog audio port on its iPhone 7 smartphones. It is selling Beats brand wireless headphones and will soon debut its AirPods wireless earbuds.Several vendors are looking to take on Bose this holiday in the subcategory of noise-canceling wireless headphones, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News, told IBD.Bose released its QuietComfort 35 headphones for $349 in June. Sony followed in September with its MDR 1000X headphones for $399. And Plantronics (PLT) released its BackBeat Pro 2 headphones for $199 in October.""Those are not inexpensive gifts, but they're really good gifts to give anyone who travels,"" Costello said. Headphones are a no-brainer gift ""because everyone has ears,"" she said.Emerging product categories likely to see a boost in sales this year are drones, virtual reality headsets and smart home devices, DuBravac said.The CTA predicts about 1.2 million drones will be sold this holiday season, up 112% over 2015. That's despite the fact that GoPro issued a product recall and stopped sales of its just-released Karma drone. Market leader DJI is likely to benefit from consumer demand for flying-camera drones, such as its Mavic Pro quadcopter.The trade group forecasts sales of 700,000 VR headsets this holiday season. Those include premium VR headsets from Sony and Facebook's (FB) Oculus unit, as well as lower-cost smartphone-based headsets from Samsung and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google.But NPD analyst Stephen Baker expects VR headset sales will be ""lukewarm"" this holiday season. ""VR will elicit a tepid response from consumers,"" he said in a report.The CTA also is looking for higher sales of smart-home devices this season, including voice-activated digital assistants such as Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo and Google Home.Voice-enabled smart speakers that can play music on command, answer spoken questions and perform other tasks will be in high demand this holiday, NPD's Baker said.Ultra HD, or 4K, televisions will dominate Black Friday and Thanksgiving weekend sales, Baker said. Such TVs, led by sales of sets with screen sizes of 55 inches and larger, will account for 60% of TV dollars spent this holiday, he said.Holiday shipments of 4K TVs in the U.S. are expected to reach 4.5 million units, the CTA said. The trade group predicts full-year sales of 4K TVs will rise 40% over 2015 to hit 10 million units.PC sales, meanwhile, will be the best in at least four years this holiday as consumers upgrade to sleek new models, Baker said.Among product categories likely to disappoint this holiday is wearables, Baker said.""While prices for wearables may begin to decrease (especially in the fitness segment where competition is growing), expect a slight slowdown in sales as consumer interest fades,"" Baker said. That would be bad news for market leader Fitbit, which provided weak Q4 guidance.Another category facing a slowdown is action cameras, a market dominated by GoPro with its Hero cameras. The market for wearable sports cameras has matured and sales overall are poised to decline, DuBravac said.Other new products hoping to make a splash this holiday season are Snapchat's Spectacles, $130 sunglasses with a built-in camera; Apple's second-generation Apple Watch with new fitness features; and upgraded versions of existing game consoles, including Microsoft's Xbox One S and Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim.RELATED:Google Home To Overtake Amazon's Smart Echo By 2020: IHSSony PlayStation VR Aims To Make Virtual Reality MainstreamTeens Stoked About iPhone 7, But GoPro Is So Yesterday

161,HP,"The major market indexes turned lower, as an early market rally sputtered Thursday. All three major indexes — the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — declined about 0.1% apiece.X Among the Dow industrials, Merck (MRK) looked to continue its rebound from last week's declines, rising 0.4%. The stock is stuck under its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) moved down 0.2%, potentially snapping a two-day win streak. Despite the market's volatility, the stock has done a great job of holding near its highs and lodging tight weekly closes as the market sputtered this month. Shares are about 2% above a 156.75 flat-base buy point.FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) received some good news from the FTC late Wednesday, when it approved the e-commerce giant's takeover of Whole Foods (WFM). The stock's response was rather muted, falling 0.9%. Shares have taken an extended break below their 50-day line as they form a potential new base.Fellow FANG member Netflix (NFLX) gave back early gains to fall 0.2% as it looks to stabilize above its 50-day line, where it has been trading over the last week.Among companies reporting earnings, HP (HPQ) exceeded the Street's estimates, while providing in-line guidance for its current-quarter earnings. The stock advanced over 1%, and is approaching a cup with handle's 19.68 buy point. Shares are testing their 50-day line.Meanwhile, after the close, two leading stocks will be reporting their own quarterly earnings numbers — medical software developer Veeva Systems and Apple-supplier Broadcom (AVGO). Veeva Systems — an IBD 50 member — is trading just under a 66.19 cup-with-handle entry. Shares moved down 0.8% early Thursday.Meanwhile, Broadcom briefly notched a new high in the stock market today before falling 0.5%. A breakout above a 256.88 flat-base entry briefly triggered the 7%-8% sell rule.Among other leading stocks, Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) looked to snap its eight-day winning streak, declining 0.3% after reaching a new high earlier this morning.Also within the IBD 50, Planet Fitness (PLNT) trimmed an early 1% advance to 0.5%, as it attempts to regain its 24.68 flat-base entry. The stock has had trouble since an earnings-related breakout on Aug. 10.On the downside, chip-equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) fell over 1%, and is in the early stage of forming a new base. An earlier breakout above a 167.15 cup-shaped base failed.RELATED:FTC Will Allow Whole Foods Acquisition By AmazonDow Jones industrial average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisApple, Amazon Loom Over Investing Action PlanFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google
"
162,HP,"La-Z-Boy (LZB) might be taking its plush chairs to Amazon (AMZN), while upscale home goods retail chain Williams-Sonoma (WSM) beat quarterly forecasts after the close and gave strong guidance.In Q2, Williams-Sonoma's EPS grew 5.2% to 61 cents, beating views by 2 cents, as revenue rose 3.7% to $1.2 billion, topping estimates for $1.19 billion. E-commerce revenue rose 5.2% to $631 million, and retail revenue rose 2.1% to $571 million. Comparable brand revenue climbed 2.8%.The company sees Q3 EPS of 80-87 cents, with the midpoint above consensus views for 82 cents, on revenue of $1.27 billion-$1.31 billion, the midpoint topping the $1.28 billion consensus.Shares jumped 6.5% late after closing up 1.3% at 43.40 on the stock market today. La-Z-Boy shares plunged 20% after the furniture seller fell short of both earnings and sales estimates. The stock had already undercut its 50-day line last week but Wednesday's action has taken it to a nine-month low.La-Z-Boy selling on Amazon wouldn't be entirely new territory: La-Z-Boy already sells its recliners, sectionals and other furniture on Wayfair (W).""There are opportunities to increase revenue with the La-Z-Boy brand with other online players with significant traffic and who provide a great experience for our potential customers such as Wayfair,"" said CEO Kurt Darrow on the La-Z-Boy earnings call Wednesday morning.""We are also exploring potential opportunities with Amazon marketplace that would complement and support our existing distribution,"" he said.MarketWatch, which first pointed out the development, noted that talks are in the early stages. Darrow said La-Z-Boy is in discussions with Amazon and Amazon marketplace, but that a final proposal isn't ready yet.Such a move would align with the strategy Darrow laid out on the call, which includes growing La-Z-Boy's online direct-to-consumer sales, using its supply chain to support other e-commerce brands, and investing in new online companies.Currently, La-Z-Boy products can be found on Amazon, but the retailer does not have an official brand page in the way that Under Armour (UAA) does or Nike (NKE) is planning on testing out.RELATED:From Blimps To Video, Here Are Ways Wal-Mart Is Battling AmazonHP, Lowe's, Williams-Sonoma Top Wednesday's Investing Action Plan

163,HP,"The Nasdaq composite gapped up and rose 1.4% Tuesday, reclaiming the 50-day moving average along the way. It was a good day for the bulls as growth stocks continued their recent string of outperformance.News flow was generally light, but positive sentiment was fueled by growing speculation that the Trump administration is making progress on tax reform. Action could heat up later in the week when Fed Chair Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi speak in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday.XThe S&P 500 picked up 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.9%. Preliminary data showed volume on the Nasdaq and NYSE coming in slightly higher than Monday's levels in the stock market today.Leaderboard name 58.com (WUBA) followed through, rising 1.6%, after soaring 20% Monday on blowout earnings. Continued tight trading near highs could present an alternate entry.But the news wasn't all good in China as two names got taken to the woodshed. Momo (MOMO) gapped below its 50-day moving average, crashing 20% to 36.02. Headed into earnings, it was struggling to clear a 46.05 buy point. Growth prospects are still bright at Momo, which operates a mobile-based social networking platform in China. Investors might've been spooked by a 189% surge in cost and expenses to $246 million.Meanwhile, Baozun (BZUN), which had been showing relative strength ahead of earnings, plunged 24% to 26.23. Its 50-day moving average just over 28 is a key support level to watch. Baozun closed below that line Tuesday.Elsewhere, quarterly results from homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) were strong, but full-year sales guidance was a bit soft, causing shares to tumble nearly 3% to 37.28. Toll Bros. had been working on a flat base, but the stock lost support at the 50-day line ahead of earnings.In the metal ores group, Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) flirted with a breakout but came up short. Early Tuesday the stock cleared a 15.27 buy point of a cup-with-handle base but then slipped back under the buy point. Shares added 2% to 15.07.Inside the IBD 50, Veeva Systems (VEEV) turned in a solid showing, rising nearly 4% to 65.58 ahead of its earnings report Thursday after the close. Its chart looks pretty good as it sits just below a 66.19 cup-with-handle buy point.Also in the IBD 50, Paycom Software (PAYC) rose past the 73.71 buy point of a flat base.

165,HP,"The market for 3D printers got a vote of confidence Thursday after 3D Systems (DDD) reported third-quarter earnings that sent the stock higher.Shares of 3D printer rival Stratasys (SSYS) also rose. Stratasys is set to report Q3 earnings before the market open Nov. 15. Estimates on earnings and revenue also indicate a turnaround after a long struggle.3D Systems reported revenue of $156.4 million, up 3% year over year. That was below the consensus estimate of $160 million but it reversed four quarters in a row of revenue declines. 3D Systems attributed the revenue increase to higher sales of 3D printers and materials into production applications as well as strong demand for its software and health care solutions.3D Systems reported earnings per share of 14 cents, vs. 1 cent year over year. That was 5-cents above the consensus estimate, aided by cost cutting and tax benefits. It did not issue forward-looking guidance.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics. IBD's Stock Spotlight currently lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.The consensus for Stratasys is revenue of $174.5 million, up 4% year over year and reversing four quarters in a row of declines. The consensus on earnings per share minus items is 5 cents, vs. a 1-cent profit and reversing seven quarters in a row of declines.3D Systems climbed 3.1% to 13.48 in the stock market today. Stratasys stock was up 1% to 18.74.The 3D printer market stirred an investor and media frenzy in the three years through 2014. At that time, 3D printers were just taking hold in consumer markets and developing critical mass in some commercial and industrial settings. Big names, including General Electric (GE) and Boeing (BA), had begun to embrace the tools.But 3D Systems and Stratasys, the two largest 3D printer makers by revenue, ran into operational challenges as the real-world demand failed to live up to the initial hype of a 3D print revolution.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen, in a research note said he expects 3D Systems to benefit from the historically large system sales in Q4, but he says the company will still be challenged to sell printers due to industry headwinds, as well as internal challenges.""While we remain encouraged by the company's improved profitability, we believe the company's underlying fundamentals remain weak and continue to see material downside in shares,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen in a research note. He reiterated a rating of underweight and price target of 10.50.Last month, Jensen issued a report that indicated a challenging market that was ""extremely discouraging"" for Stratasys and 3D Systems.In addition to sustained weakness in 3D printer sales, 3D Systems and Stratasys face the entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) (IBD). HP made its long-awaited entry into the 3D printer market six months ago, with plans to begin shipping product later this year.

167,HP,"HP Inc. (HPQ) stock sank on Friday, a day after the PC and printer maker announced plans to cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years and guided to below-consensus earnings and free cash flow for fiscal 2017, which starts Nov. 1.HP stock plunged 4.4% to close at 14.48 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 52. It ranks No. 3 out of 16 companies in IBD's Computer-Hardware & Peripherals industry group. To see which company leads the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.At the company's annual analyst meeting on Thursday, HP executives presented their near- and longer-term goals from the company.Based on the midpoint of its guidance, HP expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 in fiscal 2017, vs. Wall Street's consensus of $1.61. HP is forecasting free cash flow next year of $2.5 billion, below the Street's target of $2.6 billion.HP raised its dividend by 7% and authorized a $3 billion incremental share-repurchase plan, bringing the total authorized amount to about $4 billion.The planned job cuts will start in fiscal 2017 and run through fiscal 2019. HP expects annual savings of $200 million to $300 million from the restructuring plan starting in fiscal 2020.When HP split from the former Hewlett-Packard nearly a year ago, it had almost 50,000 employees worldwide. But it expected to cut 3,000 jobs in fiscal 2016, which ends Oct. 31.HP CEO Dion Weisler described HP as a ""pillar of stability"" compared with its competition, according to Jefferies analyst James Kisner.""Weisler noted that its competitors are particularly distracted right now; Dell (DVMT) and EMC are merging, Lexmark (LXK) is being sold, Xerox (XRX) may be separating, and Lenovo is distracted with fixing its mobile and server segments,"" Kisner said in a research report. This environment should help HP gain market share, he said.Wall Street gave the HP news generally positive notices. At least four analysts raised their price targets on HP after the event.Kisner maintained his buy rating and 16.75 price target on HP stock.""HP sees fiscal 2017 as a transition year with a focus on stabilizing (its printing supplies business, and) fiscal 2018 is the year to accelerate growth with its key initiatives such as A3 copier and 3D (printing),"" Kisner said. ""We believe HP shares will appreciate as investors gain confidence in an improvement of the trajectory of PCs and printing businesses.""Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha reiterated his outperform rating and price target of 19 on HP stock.""HP management laid out a decent case for why the company could return to growth in revenue and EPS long term,"" Garcha said in a report. ""These include a change in business mix within (its PC unit to more premium computers), a model to optimize the supplies for (its) printing installed base, Samsung printer deal, and the optionality of 3D printing. While secular challenges in its end markets remain, we believe the valuation remains compelling.""In the PC market, HP is looking to sell more higher-margin machines, such as detachable tablet-notebooks and gaming PCs, as the overall market remains in the doldrums.In the printer market, HP is trying to find ways to improve ink sales and expand into new markets like commercial copiers and printers.CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino kept his buy rating on HP, but raised his price target to 17 from 15.""We expect printer supplies to remain a headwind in fiscal 2017, but note long-term growth initiatives (copier A3 penetration, commercial mobility and 3D printing),"" he said in a report.While several analysts were upbeat following HP's analyst day, others were from Missouri (the Show Me State) and took a wait-and-see stance.Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba maintained his neutral rating on HP, but upped his price target to 14 from 12.""We walked away (from HP's analyst meeting) acknowledging management's efforts to stabilize the PC and printing businesses,"" Lamba said in a report. ""However, we continue to see macro and secular challenges in these markets and believe HP's go-to-market and selling initiatives are unlikely to yield results in the near term.""Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um stuck with his market perform rating on HP, yet raised his valuation range on the stock to $14-$15 from $13-$14.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said he had ""generally neutral takeaways"" from the analyst day presentations. He reiterated his market perform rating and price target of 13 on HP stock.""Management is executing well on cost reduction and stabilizing the two businesses, but we believe headwinds will continue to dominate the story before the longer-term growth drivers start to contribute,"" Long said in a report.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich maintained his neutral rating on HP, but raised his price target to 15 from 14.""HP manages its business tightly, driving out cost, carefully pursuing profitable share gains in declining markets, and investing in adjacent markets,"" Milunovich said. ""Opportunities in A3 and 3D printing are promising, but will take time.""RELATED:HP Gains On Lenovo In PCs; Apple Mac Sales TumbleHP Stock Gets Price-Target Hike Ahead Of Analyst Day

Lenovo saw its PC shipments decline by 3.2% to 14.5 million units. Lenovo held on to the No. 1 position with 21.3% market share, followed by HP with 21.2%, IDC said.

Apple Mac shipments declined 13% year over year to 5 million units.

An improving PC market would bode well for PC software leader Microsoft (MSFT) and chipmaker Intel (INTC).""We are very pleased to see some improvement in the market,"" Loverde said. ""Industry efforts to update products to leverage new processors and operating systems, to deliver a better computing experience encompassing more mobile, secure, and faster systems, and to accelerate PC replacements have been critical.""These improvements are accumulating, and set the stage for a stronger market going forward.""RELATED:HP Stock Gets Price-Target Hike Ahead Of Analyst DayIntel Stock Earns Price-Target Hikes On Apple, PC Developments

176,HP,"Just as critics were sounding the death knell for Best Buy (BBY), Hubert Joly embraced the opportunity to breathe new life into the consumer electronics retail giant.Joly, who joined Best Buy as CEO in September 2012, knew he would have a lot on his plate when he was recruited for the job by search firm Spencer Stuart.""When I was approached in the spring of 2012, Best Buy was facing an all-you-can-eat menu of challenges,"" Joly told IBD. ""It was facing the threat of online competition.""In addition, it had leadership challenges. Joly's predecessor, Brian J. Dunn, was ousted. And the company's founder and top shareholder, Richard Schulze, was considering taking the company private.But Joly, who has a reputation as a turnaround and transformation expert, was drawn to Best Buy's tough times: ""I love challenges,"" said Joly.A major challenge was competing with the wrath of the mighty Amazon.com (AMZN).""From the outside looking in, there was the existential threat of Best Buy being killed by Amazon and being transformed into a showroom,"" Joly said. ""People would visit Best Buy stores, check out products and prices, and then buy them online. People thought we were dying.""Drawing on leadership principles shaped by his work as a consultant at McKinsey & Co. and by philosophical and spiritual work he did with monks at the Congregation of St. John, Joly has proved the naysayers wrong.Thanks to a transformation strategy called ""Renew Blue,"" Joly introduced in November 2012, Best Buy, the No. 1 consumer electronics retailer, has witnessed a strong financial revival. Joly declared Renew Blue over at the end of fiscal 2017. The company is moving into a new phase titled, ""Best Buy 2020: Building the New Blue.""""As a result of the turnaround we've implemented, we're thriving,"" said Joly, who added the title chairman to his post in 2015. ""If anyone asks who killed 'showrooming' in the U.S., that's us.""During the Renew Blue time period, same-store sales have been stabilized and Best Buy has grown earnings per share each year at an average rate of 9% per year, and it's topped Wall Street expectations for earnings per share in each of the past 17 quarters.""When I joined, we had only two problems — declining revenue and margins,"" said Joly. ""In the last four years, we've improved the top line in the U.S. incrementally and we've improved our profit margin by about 100 basis points. We've improved our return on invested capital by about 900 basis points from roughly 10% to 19%. And we've been one of the best performing shares in the market over the last five years, going from a low of 11 to mid-50s now, really five times since then.""Joly and his team have not only resuscitated Best Buy on the financial front, they've transformed it into a mighty competitor in its space.""Best Buy is the revenue market share leader for consumer electronics, and they are likely to remain in that position for many years to come,"" said Stephen Baker, vice president, industry analysis, at the NPD Group.Joly, 57 (he turns 58 on Aug. 11), grew up in France. He holds degrees from the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris and the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris.He began his career at McKinsey, where he was a partner. He worked there from 1983 to 1996. He left McKinsey to become president of one of his clients — the French business of Electronic Data Systems (now part of HP Inc. (HPQ)). There, he staged his first turnaround as a corporate executive, boosting flagging revenue and increasing the profit margin.Joly has a track record of improving struggling companies. That also includes hospitality and travel company Carlson, where he was president and CEO from 2008 to 2012.He says he learned a lot about leadership while he worked as a consultant at McKinsey — also learned a lot from clients.Joly also spent quite a bit of time with a couple of friends who were monks in the Congregation of St. John. He worked together with them and published a couple of articles roughly 20 years ago. One article was in a theology journal and the other was in a philosophy journal about the purpose of work and the purpose of corporate organizations.""I also did the spiritual exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, the Jesuit, to find my purpose in life,"" said Joly. ""There's a deep philosophical and spiritual underpinning to all this.""Such experiences led to what Joly calls the five ""Be's"" of leadership.Here are excerpts on the five Be's from a 2016 speech Joly gave at the French-American Chamber of Commerce Foundation gala:Joly says his philosophy of leadership is ""rooted in the metaphysics"" of work: Why do we work? What is the purpose of a corporation?""The best companies excel simultaneously on the three dimensions of people, business and finance,"" said Joly. ""But from a philosophical standpoint, the purpose is not financial, it's about contributing to the common good and contributing (to) the development of the individuals who work at the company and are touched by the company. And it's about developing positive relationships. It's a human purpose.""Joly takes a disciplined approach to improving companies, drawing on a type of ""manual"" he's developed on principles that underlie a turnaround.""In the context of  turnaround leadership, my leadership philosophy was about working together with management to turn around and transform Best Buy,"" said Joly. ""We worked together to develop a diagnosis of the situation and develop a framework of how to turn around Best Buy.""The purpose of the diagnosis is to uncover the main issues and performance drivers.""The most important thing is to build the right team and to do it very quickly,"" he added. ""Typically in a turnaround you have to change a significant part of the team. And you start at the top.""At Best Buy, Joly removed three leaders, promoted a few from within, and recruited from the outside.In his manual there are four drivers to a turnaround:Joly drew on his principles and philosophy to turn around Best Buy.Thirty days into the job, Joly and his team made a key decision: ""We decided we were going to be price competitive and we implemented a price-matching policy online,"" said Joly. ""People were coming to our stores looking for help (from sales associates). By being price competitive and matching prices and then leveraging our unit assets, there was no reason to leave the store without buying. This was a bold move.""So far, Best Buy has taken out $1.4 billion in costs. Joly says that's allowed Best Buy to make the investments in price competitiveness and improving the customer experience.To enhance the in-store experience, Best Buy has invested in adding many shop-in-shops developed in partnership with some of the world's foremost tech companies. These shops help vendors showcase the use of their technology and innovations.Best Buy has added shop-in-shops for such companies as Samsung, Microsoft (MSFT), Sony (SNE), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Best Buy has also invested in improving the customer shopping experience online. The result: Its online business has grown more than 20% a year, says Joly.Among other things, the team also improved the supply chain by leveraging Best Buy's store base to offer ship-from-store. Joly says Best Buy is shipping as fast as Amazon.Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says Best Buy is winning share in the e-commerce space vs. Amazon.""If you look at the value proposition, it's equal and more likely even better to buy from Best Buy vs. Amazon,"" said Keith. ""You get the same prices and shipping terms — you can pick up (online orders) in stores and return items to stores. And you also get after market support. Their value proposition is arguably better than Amazon's for shopping for consumer electronics, which is allowing Best Buy to take back share.""Joly moved quickly to set Best Buy on the turnaround path and has continued to build momentum as it's taken shape.""If you try to ride a bike while standing still, you fall,"" said Joly. ""But if the bike is moving and not going in the right direction, you can adjust the course. In a turnaround, what's critical is to get things moving and build the momentum, and not worry about being too precise.""Helped turn around Best Buy, the revenue market share leader for consumer electronics.Overcame: The wrath of Amazon and positioned Best Buy to win share in the e-commerce space.Lesson: Follow spiritual and philosophical leadership principles.""There's a deep philosophical and spiritual underpinning to all this.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:For Bill Marriott, The Key Is Making Room For Innovation'Shark' Daymond John Wrapped His Brand In Hip-Hop MystiquePhil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising ChampionSupermodel Kathy Ireland Became A Role Model For Moguls

Prior to Monday's share-price drop, Stratasys stock was up 67% this year.Other risks to Stratasys, Nowak wrote, is the view that industry pricing for 3D printers needs to be ""meaningfully lower in order to drive adoption and hit break-even relative to traditional manufacturing."" A 2016 Gartner survey said price remains the most important factor holding back 3D printing adoption.Stratasys and 3D Systems (DDD) are the two largest 3D printer makers but are under rising competitive pressure. The biggest threats come from the entry of General Electric (GE) and HP Inc. (HPQ) into the market. HP entered the market last November while GE did so in September, through two big acquisitions of European companies.IBD'S TAKE: In today's stock action, Stratasys fell below its 50-day moving average, a negative sign, though it holds an IBD Composite of 80 out of a possible 99. Stock Spotlight lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.GE said it's working on a massive 3D printer for jet engine parts. And Pacific Crest Securities, in a research note last week, said HP is rapidly ramping up its 3D printer business and threatens 3D Systems and Stratasys.Nowak also said Stratasys lacks exposure to higher-growth technologies, such as 3D printers that use metal-based technology.""We see risks to Stratasys' longer-term positioning within the industry without a metal lineup,"" Nowak wrote.Stratasys reported first-quarter earnings in mid-May that met Wall Street estimates as revenue fell 3% to $163.2 million from the year-ago quarter.RELATED:3D Printing Taps 4th Industrial Revolution; HP Discusses Big AmbitionsGE Rival Siemens, In 'Breakthrough,' Tests 3D-Printed Turbine Blades

184,HP,"Is Meg Whitman, chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), planning an exit strategy by year end?That's quite possible, says a Citigroup report, in light of HPE promoting company veteran Antonio Neri to the president's title last week.""We do expect Neri could eventually lead HPE (perhaps a few quarters away) and we note he has 20-plus years within Enterprise Group,"" Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in the note to clients. ""That said, we do not expect Meg to exit HPE before the software spinoff is completed (scheduled for Sept 1).""HPE is selling off its software business to U.K.-based Micro Focus. HPE has already spun off its enterprise services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC). Whitman's plans could be clarified at an analysts meeting expected in the fall. She oversaw the split of Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard into two publicly traded companies in November 2015, with its printer and PC business becoming HP Inc. (HPQ). Whitman assumed control of HPE after the split.Before that, Whitman made an unsuccessful bid for governor of California as a Republican in 2010, though in 2016 she supported Democrat Hillary Clinton over eventual winner Republican Donald Trump in the presidential race. Still, she's been a big Republican fundraiser.Neri has been executive VP and general manager of HPE's Enterprise Group, which includes servers, storage, networking, and cloud solutions. HPE is competing with two other IT industry giants, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT), in providing next-generation data center technology. Cisco hosts a company tech conference this week.IBD'S TAKE: HPE's stock is down 4% in 2017 as the company restructures and is trading at a nine-month low. HP Inc. has gained 20% but the stock has weakened and is trading below its 50-day moving average.

Shares of the company ticked down 5 cents to 16.80 on the stock market today.Neri will be in charge of ""HPE Next,"" a new initiative focusing on growth areas but that is also expected to include more cost-cutting, says a UBS report. HPE is also expected to continue making acquisitions as growth slows.RELATED:HP's Rapid Growth In 3D Printers Threatens Stratasys, 3D SystemsHPE Snaps Up Nimble, Lifting Shares In Sector; Cisco Lurking?

185,HP,"XGeneral Electric (GE) scored more than $31 billion in orders at the 2017 Paris Air Show, but some of its other interesting moves this week were in 3D printing.The industrial conglomerate inked 3D printing collaborations Wednesday with Swiss industrial heavyweight Oerlikon and French aeronautical company Lauak.GE said Tuesday it is working on a massive 3D printer for jet engine parts, describing it as the world's largest ""laser-powder additive machine,"" capable of producing parts that are one meter in diameter.""The machine will also be applicable for manufacturers in the automotive, power, and oil and gas industries,"" said Mohammad Ehteshami, vice president of GE Additive, in a statement.The announcements follow GE's acquisitions last year of leading European metal 3D printer manufacturers Concept Laser, Arcam and SLM Solutions as well as its creation of a stand-alone GE Additive unit, sharpening its challenge to 3D printer makers 3D Systems (DDD), Stratasys (SSYS) and HP Inc. (HPQ).GE has a self-described ""aggressive"" target of $1 billion in annual revenues by 2020 for its burgeoning Additive division; customers include Cessna-maker Textron (TXT).GE's 3D printer business has both near- and long-term implications for the company, said Jeff Sprague, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, an independent equity research firm.""We see GE's additive strategy bearing fruit foremost in speed of prototyping and cost reductions on certain complex components,"" Sprague said in an email to IBD Friday. ""This, in turn, could accelerate GE's speed to market with new products or innovative solutions for its installed base, which should augment growth and profitability.""Using 3D printers can streamline designs, while enabling lighter and stronger systems than traditionally cast and forged parts. For example, GE has slashed the number of parts in its LEAP 3D-printed fuel nozzle to just one from 18.A more aggressive push in 3D printing could lift GE's top line at a key moment, as the company undergoes a leadership change after struggles to grow sales and profits have weighed on the stock, which is trading at roughly the same level it did three years ago.Meanwhile, companies like 3D Systems and Stratasys have grown more upbeat on demand for 3D printers in the industrial sector, as the technology moves beyond prototyping to more factory floors.GE shares rose 2 cents to 27.57 on the stock market today, but still fell 4.9% for the week.Despite the latest 3D printing announcements, shares of GE are poised for a weekly loss of nearly 5%. By comparison, 3D Systems climbed 4.3% for the week, Stratasys 4.9% and HP 2.6%.RELATED:HP's Rapid Growth In 3D Printers Threatens Stratasys, 3D Systems This 'Fantastic' GE Business Is Getting Ready To ExpandThis 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEOGE Buys European 3D Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, StratasysGE Signals New CEO Will Continue Software Push Started By Immelt

Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks also had their say, with Apple up 0.6% and Amazon.com (AMZN) rising 0.7%.Preliminary data showed volume mixed, higher on the NYSE, lower on the Nasdaq, than end-of-day trade on Tuesday.In a day of whirling global news and events, oil took center stage as a Platt's survey outlined a surprise production increase of more than a quarter-million barrels per day by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, followed by a weekly inventories report from the Energy Information Administration that showed a 3.3 million-barrel increase in U.S. supplies. That number was almost 8 million barrels above the American Petroleum Institute's estimate released Tuesday, which showed a 4.6 million decrease during the same week. That estimate had helped send oil prices up nearly 2% on Tuesday.Oil was already being closely watched early Wednesday, as tensions rose in the Persian Gulf where Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain had effectively blockaded Qatar, and after reports of multiple armed attacks on official buildings in Tehran, Iran, that reportedly left at least 12 dead. News reports said the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks.As a result, U.S.-based oil benchmarks led the declines, with West Texas Intermediate crude ending down nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel, its lowest mark since early May.On the stock market, oil-related groups took six of the session's 10 worst losses among industries.

Also among those tumbles was beer-maker Molson Brewing (TAP), which tanked 6.5%.Near the top of the list, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) swung up more than 3% in moderate trade. The move was enough to clear a 62.08 flat-base buy point, but volume was only 20% above average – not enough to qualify as a breakout. Volume can sometimes kick in a day or two after a stock passes a buy point, confirming a breakout after the fact.Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) were among the Dow industrials to rise 1% or more.

211,HP,"Sentiment around HP Inc. (HPQ) is improving as the outlook for PCs and printers is looking up, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Sunday.Daryanani raised his price target on HP stock to 16 from 14, but kept his sector perform rating on the stock.HP shares have been rising ahead of the company's analyst day Thursday. HP stock rose a small fraction to 15.59 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has an above-average IBD Composite Rating of 60, but there are more attractive stocks near buy zones. Read the article, ""Stocks Near Buy Zone: Which Names May Set Sail On Columbus Day?""At the analyst day, Wall Street expects an update on HP's printing business strategy, including a timeline for a recovery in supplies sales and the recently announced acquisition of Samsung's printing business.Analysts also want to get more data points about a possible recovery in PC sales.""Given HP's subdued outlook for October-quarter PC performance, we think there could be upside to (HP's Personal Systems Group) results based on recent developments including Intel's (INTC) positive pre-announcement and data points from PC suppliers,"" Daryanani said.Also on the agenda are updates on HP's growth prospects in new businesses, including 3D printers and A3 copiers.On Friday, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha reiterated his outperform rating on HP stock, with a price target of 19.RELATED:Intel Stock Earns Price-Target Hikes On Apple, PC DevelopmentsHP Hopes To Disrupt Copier Market With Samsung Printer Purchase

212,HP,"Chipmaker Intel (INTC) is expected to show improved sales and earnings when it reports third-quarter results after the market close Tuesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Intel to earn 73 cents a share excluding items, up 14% year over year, on sales of $15.58 billion, up nearly 8%.For the December quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Intel to earn 77 cents a share minus items, up 4%, on sales of $15.86 billion, up 6%.IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it has outperformed 89% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. That's good, but there are even better stocks to consider. The IBD 50 list of superior stocks includes seven stocks from the semiconductor industry.Intel stock fell a fraction to 37.29 on the stock market today. Intel shares last month touched a 36.03 buy point out of a flat base, so it remains within buy range.The last time Intel reported quarterly results back on July 20, it was a mixed bag, with Q2 EPS better than views and sales slightly below targets.Intel preannounced better-than-expected results for Q3 on Sept. 16 when it raised its revenue guidance for the September quarter. The chip giant largely credited ""replenishment of PC supply chain inventory,"" but also said it's ""seeing some signs of improving PC demand.""With Intel's Q3 earnings report, analysts will be looking for signs that the improvement in PC demand is sustainable and for strength in the company's data center group.Wall Street also will be looking for information on the impact of Intel's baseband chip win in some models of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 series, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Monday.RELATED:Intel Inside iPhone 7; Chipmaker Wins Apple BusinessHP Gains On Lenovo In PCs; Apple Mac Sales Tumble

213,HP,"A survey of 3D printer resellers indicated a challenging market in the third quarter that was ""extremely discouraging"" for market leaders' Stratasys (SSYS) and 3D Systems (DDD), according to a Piper Jaffray survey.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen collected feedback from 68 3D printer makers and service bureau operators, skewed toward Stratasys and 3D Systems.""The results were extremely discouraging for both Stratasys and 3D Systems,"" Jensen wrote in a research report. Both companies are likely to miss revenue estimates when they report Q3 earnings next month, he wrote. EPS is less at risk due to cost cutting by both companies, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, and have weak performance ratings, based on a variety of IBD metrics. IBD's Stock Spotlight currently lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.Stratasys and 3D Systems are expected to report Q3 earnings in mid-November.The consensus estimate on 3D Systems is revenue growth of 5.6% to $160.2 million, and earnings per share minus items of 9 cents, up from a 1 cent in the year-earlier quarter. The company's earnings turned positive in Q2, rising 300% after five quarters of no growth or declines.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Stratasys revenue to climb 4% to $174.5 million, with EPS of 5 cents vs. a penny. It would be its first year-over-year profit gain in eight quarters.Stratasys and 3D Systems stock have both fallen for the last three days. 3D Systems stock closed Thursday at 14.82, down 5%. Stratasys fell 3.5% to 21.23.Among the reasons for the weak performance of the 3D printer market in Q3 is sustained weakness overall and the entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) into the market.HP made its long-awaited entry into the 3D printer market five months ago, with plans to begin shipping product later this year. Jensen and other industry analysts say some buyers have postponed purchases while they wait for HP to ship product.""We believe the biggest headwind continues to be increased competition, and believe the entry of HP and (privately held) Carbon 3D, as well as newer entrants, have caused customers to pause spending on traditional brands and assess these new offerings,"" Jensen wrote.RELATED:3D Printer Maker 3D Systems Eyes 'Inflection Point""General Electric Or HP Takeover Of 3D Systems Seen UnlikelyShake-Up At 3D Systems As Two Executives Depart 3D Printer CompanyGE Buys European 3D Printing Firms, Lifting 3D Systems, Stratasys

215,HP,"The overall 0.6% bounceback in retail sales last month comes with a caveat: Total spending looked healthy, but much of the gain came in categories that may not drive growth going forward.A core measure of goods spending that strips out restaurants, cars and gas, as well as building materials, rose just 0.1% in September. That was well below the 0.4% gain expected by economists and came after a 0.1% decline in this broad ""control group"" category of retail spending.Sales at electronics and appliance stores like Best Buy (BBY) remained a sore spot. Despite the midmonth launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.9% from August and 3.8% from a year ago. Best Buy shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today but are still near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs amid strong initial iPhone 7 demand and rival Samsung's overheating problems with its Note 7, which finally prompted the company to end sales and production of the smartphone.Slumping demand for PCs and printers led Hewlett-Packard (HP) on Thursday to announce a gradual reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. Electronics retailers also are being squeezed by the likes of Amazon (AMZN). Nonstore retailers saw September sales rise 0.3% from August after a 0.1% dip the prior month. Though online sales momentum has cooled a bit in the past few months, nonstore retailers still are posting double-digit year-over-year gains — 10.6% in September.Department store sales slid 0.7% from August and 6.4% from a year ago. Some of the slide reflects store closures. Still, analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded shares of Macy's (M) to neutral from buy on Friday, noting a slowdown in same-store sales growth. JPMorgan cut price targets and Q3 estimates on Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS).Macy's, Kohl's shares fell about 3% Friday while Dillard's skidded 4.6%. Kohl's and Nordstom fell fractionally.Everything to do with the housing market shined in September. Sales at building materials and garden equipment stores like Home Depot (HD) surged 1.4% from August, more than reversing a 0.8% decline the prior month. Meanwhile, furniture store sales rose 1.0% from August and 2.7% from a year ago.Home Depot shares rose 0.1%.One of the surprises in the retail report was the strong gain in spending at food service and drinking places, up 0.8% from August, when sales rose 0.7%. Sales have moderated on a year-over-year basis to 6.1% from the 8%-plus pace that prevailed for most of 2015. Still, the gains over the past two months are a pleasant surprise given that McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK) and others have cited pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.McDonald's stock fell 1.1%, while Wendy's and Jack in the Box rose fractionally.IBD'S TAKE: The Retail-Restaurants industry group is ranked in the lower tier by IBD, No. 113 out of 197 based on share performance. Investors will generally have more success buying leaders in top-tier groups, when the market trend is favorable. Sill, Papa Johns and Dunkin' Brands, are close to buy points and worth watching. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find out why they're the two top stocks in the group.September restaurant sales data out Thursday from TDn2K covering 25,000 locations shed further light on industry trends. Overall, same-store sales fell 1.1% from a year ago in September, while customer traffic slumped 3.5%. The sector is on pace for its worst performance since 2009.Still, overall sales are performing better than same-store sales because of continued industry expansion, and the quick-service industry is doing a whole lot better than the rest, growing same-store sales 2.2% from a year ago in the third quarter, Nation's Restaurant News reported.On Friday, Bank of America analysts upgraded Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to buy from underperform, noting that the research firm expects 10.4% U.S. same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Domino's reports on Tuesday before the open. Domino's rose 0.5%.Auto sales jumped 1.1% in September, as U.S. vehicle sales rose to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. Sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs outperformed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), helping offset their unit sales declines vs. a year ago.""The decline in gasoline prices relative to a year ago is likely to continue to support SUV sales,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""Nonetheless, overall vehicle sales are at a level that may be close to a ceiling.""Ford shares closed unchanged. GM rallied 1.1% and Fiat Chrysler shares 2.3%.Gas station sales helped pump up the overall retail sales gain, rising 2.4% from August. McCarthy and Simons noted that the big rise was based on seasonal adjustments: Gas prices fell in 0.8% in September, but they usually fall 2.8% during the month after the peak summer driving season.RELATED:Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

217,HP,"One chapter in Nvidia's (NVDA) rivalry with Intel (INTC) is nearing an end: Royalty payments from Intel that have boosted Nvidia earnings since 2011 could sunset next year — just as more competition unfolds between them in data centers, self-driving cars and augmented reality.Both Intel and Nvidia, whose stock has jumped 103% in 2016 after slipping a fraction on Friday, stick out as chipmakers hunting for the next killer app. Mobile phone sales are slowing globally, much as the PC market did earlier. Intel and Nvidia aim for leadership in semiconductors used in cars, artificial intelligence and visual processing.The moves into new markets are panning out, but Nvidia still gets 60% of revenue from PC graphics and gaming.Intel, which in Q2 derived 54% of its revenue from its PC unit, recently acquired startups in the AI and visual computing fields. Observers wonder what Nvidia might buy, with nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.But where Intel has had four chief executives since Nvidia was founded in 1993, Nvidia has had one CEO: Jen-Hsun Huang, one of Nvidia's three co-founders. The CEO gets kudos for reinventing Nvidia and for his ability to recruit top engineers to the chipmaker.""Jen-Hsun has made several gutsy calls in the past decade,"" Mark Hung, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, told IBD. ""Some of them worked out very well, a couple not so much. When he sees an opportunity, he's been able to marshal the company's full resources behind it. In data center and automotive, they're charging ahead.""IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia's big year hasn't just been good for a chip company or for a tech company, but for any company. How good? The IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks, with an emphasis on the most recent six months, is always a great place to find winners. Nvidia currently ranks No. 5 on that hard-to-make list.Huang is slated to deliver a preshow keynote address at CES 2017 in January and is expected to trumpet emerging gaming and AI technology, as well as AR headsets and self-driving cars. Its chips already help power the instrument and navigation displays in Tesla Motors (TSLA) e-cars and others.Nvidia continues to improve upon the high-end graphics processing that made it the leader in gaming, along with Advance Micro Devices (AMD). An Nvidia edge is that its powerful graphics processors, thanks to their ""parallel-processing"" circuitry, can be extended to artificial intelligence software.AI chips are well-suited for facial or object recognition, a plus for robotics and security applications, as well as spoken-language apps. Much R&D is focused on ""deep learning,"" an AI tool that enables computers to be trained and to perform actual reasoning. Self-driving cars map their surroundings and detect hazards, for example.In self-driving, Nvidia has ""the right product at the right time,"" said Malcolm Penn, founder and CEO of U.K.-based Future Horizons, a semiconductor research firm. ""Autonomous driving is all about vision and parallel processing,"" and Nvidia products are ""perfect for this; Intel ... is not.""Intel's chips still dominate in low-end PC graphics. And its chips are built into most computer servers packed into data centers. Nvidia's chips are gaining in data center gear as well, with technology well-suited for apps such as credit-card fraud-detection systems, says David Kanter, an analyst at Real World Technologies and the Linley Group.Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and others are racing to develop AI-based apps that can be delivered to consumers via the internet cloud. There's another race underway to equip data centers with AI hardware and software.Intel's August acquisition of startup Nervana Systems heated up its rivalry with Nvidia. Nervana's technology processes ""deep learning"" algorithms. For its part, Intel last month acquired startup Movidius, whose visual processors are used in drones, virtual reality devices and autonomous machines.""Intel has only recently started to focus on machine learning and doesn't offer the same level of performance as Nvidia's latest products,"" Kanter said. ""The Nervana acquisition is an attempt by Intel to get expertise in machine learning and defend its territory in the data center.""For its fiscal Q2 ended July 31, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia's revenue jumped 24% from the year earlier, easily its best showing in at least four years. EPS ex items jumped 56% to 53 cents, its best showing in two years.But for its fiscal 2018 ending Jan. 31, 2018, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling only 3% full-year EPS growth. That's where the patent cross-licensing deal signed by Intel and Nvidia in 2011 comes in. Intel agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion over six years, or roughly $264 million annually, to settle a patent dispute.In an email, Intel spokesman William Moss declined to comment on whether Intel plans to renew the agreement. Analysts say Nvidia has indicated there won't be a renewal.Nvidia can make up the Intel loss, says William Stein, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst. ""Nvidia's margins will be pressured in the near term for the nearly 90%-margin Intel-licensing revenue rolling off in 2017,"" said Stein in a research report. ""We believe this will be more than offset in the long term by growth in the high-margin data center end-market, plus new products in automotive, lifting margins above the corporate average. Increasing ASPs (average selling prices) in gaming will also help.""Some observers speculate that Nvidia could win back some PC business at Apple, where AMD's chips have recently been built into Mac desktops and laptops.Nvidia and AMD talked merger back in 2005. A deal would have created a bigger rival to Intel. Huang wanted to be CEO of the combined chip company, analysts say, and the deal fell apart.M&A has not been a big part of Nvidia's DNA, though it bought U.K.-based Icera for around $370 million in 2011. Nvidia had problems melding Icera's modem technology with its GPUs and wrote down the Icera business in 2015, says Will Strauss, president of market research firm Forward Concepts. While Nvidia has won some design wins in tablets, it's not a volume player in smartphones.With nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Nvidia could be primed for acquisitions, Nomura analyst Romit Shah speculated in a September research report.With a market cap over $13.5 billion, Xilinx (XLNX) could be out of Nvidia's reach, but it's a potentially potent combo. ""Nvidia and Xilinx … now that would change the world as we know it,"" said Penn via email. Intel plucked down $16.7 billion in 2015 to buy top Xilinx rival Altera, which like Xilinx has a sizable data center business.Shah speculates that Nvidia might be interested in IBM's (IBM) Power family of processors. IBM and Nvidia have been partners in AI projects.Nvidia garners just over 10% of revenue from its data center business and, for now, only about 8% from automotive. Besides Tesla, Nvidia works with such automakers as Audi, BMW, Honda (HMC), Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, providing technology for infotainment, navigation, digital instrument clusters and advanced driver-assistance systems.Self-driving cars are one big battleground for Intel and Nvidia. Intel has teamed with autonomous-driving tech company Mobileye (MBLY) and Germany's BMW with the goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2021.Nvidia's highest-profile customer and partner might be Tesla Motors (TSLA). (Nvidia, by coincidence, has a line of AI and deep-learning platforms brand-named Tesla, but its Tegra line is what is used inside Tesla and other cars.) In August, Nvidia nabbed another biggie, announcing a partnership with China internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to make an autonomous car platform.Self-driving cars would be a big leap forward technologically for the chipmaker, says Kanter, but he says it's far too early to call Nvidia a winner of the race.""It's not clear to me how well Nvidia's expertise will translate outside of gaming and PCs,"" Kanter said. ""Automotive products are totally different from consumer electronics and the car manufacturers play a much more active role in system integration than a PC (maker) like HP (HPQ) or Dell.""There are many other companies that are more specialized in automotive.""RELATED:Nvidia Debuts AI Supercomputer Chip For Self-Driving CarsNvidia Could Provide Graphics Chips For Apple Mac ComputersIntel Among Chipmakers Getting Vote Of Confidence

218,HP,"HP Inc. (HPQ) on Monday announced a $1.05 billion deal to buy the printer business of Samsung Electronics, in a move to shake up the stodgy office copier market.HP said it hopes the acquisition will accelerate its goal of disrupting and reinventing the $55 billion copier industry. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company wants to get customers to switch to more reliable multifunction printer technology and away from outdated, complicated copiers. HP said traditional copiers have dozens of replaceable parts and require frequent servicing to keep functioning.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 46 and ranks No. 3 out of 16 stocks in IBD's Computer-Hardware and Peripherals industry group. To find out which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Samsung's portfolio of A3 multifunction printers deliver the performance of copiers with the reliability and ease-of-use of printers and with as few as seven replaceable parts, HP said in a press release.HP expects to complete the all-cash acquisition within 12 months pending regulatory review and customary closing conditions.After the deal closes, Samsung has agreed to make a $100 million to $300 million equity investment in HP through open market purchases.""The acquisition of Samsung's printer business allows us to deliver print innovation and create entirely new business opportunities with far better efficiency, security, and economics for customers"" HP CEO Dion Weisler said in a statement.Samsung's printer business also brings an intellectual property portfolio of more than 6,500 printing patents.HP said the deal will strengthen its position in laser printing, a category where it has a partnership with Canon (CAJ).RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani says HP will be able to lessen its reliance on Canon technology through the Samsung printer business acquisition.""There is a strategic element to this deal as HP currently licenses its laser print technology from Canon,"" he said in a research report. ""Samsung's laser technology could reduce its reliance on Canon. In this scenario, HP could see potential synergies increase beyond straightforward consolidation.""Daryanani said HP could reduce its cost-of-goods profile as a result of the asset purchase. He estimates Canon represents about 10% to 15% of HP's cost of goods.HP stock was up 3% to 14.49 on the stock market today. Canon's U.S. shares fell 1.4% to 28.63.The Samsung printer unit generates about $1 billion to $1.6 billion in annual revenue and could add 5 to 15 cents to HP's annual earnings per share, Daryanani said. He rates HP stock as sector perform, with a price target of 14.RELATED:HP Printing Woes Hit Stock, But Not For Long

A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday afternoon, one person said.Micro Focus, based in Newbury, England, can use the assets to bolster its software products that help companies on a variety of fronts, including business applications, security and with data centers.HP Enterprise has been considering a sale of some of its software assets, people familiar with the matter said in July, in an effort to slim down its operations. The possible divestitures included a portfolio of acquisitions made over roughly the past decade, including Autonomy, Mercury Interactive and Vertica Systems.Kate Holderness, spokeswoman for HP Enterprise, declined to comment. Representatives of Micro Focus didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Chief Executive Meg Whitman -- who split HP Enterprise from sister company HP Inc. in November -- is looking for more ways to pare down her company. Her aim is to make the enterprise unit nimbler to woo customers with more options from cloud providers such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).Sky News previously reported that Micro Focus is planning to buy HPE's software business.

220,HP,"An acquisition of 3D Systems (DDD) is unlikely in the wake of General Electric's (GE) plans to buy two European makers of metal printing products, though Belgium-based Materialize (MTLS) could be acquired, speculates Pacific Crest Securities.Shares of 3D Systems and rival Stratasys (SSYS) closed down 1.9% and 3.5%, respectively, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. But they rose 5.6% and 3.8%, respectively, Tuesday after GE announced that it would buy acquire Sweden's Arcam and Germany's SLM Solutions Group for $1.4 billion, respectively. The two companies are leading suppliers of metal additive 3D manufacturing machines. Most 3D printer companies make parts from plastic and other materials.Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, says GE's acquisitions could pressure 3D Systems, but he doesn't expect a buyer such as HP Inc. (HPQ) to surface. HP is just entering the 3D printer field.""We don't expect any near-term bid for 3D Systems, despite GE's announcement,"" Twigg said in a research report late Tuesday. ""3D Systems has an overly broad product portfolio, in our view, and larger entrants like HP and GE are looking at ways to leverage in-house expertise to improve upon current 3D printing technology rather than entering the market through a large acquisition.""IBD'S TAKE: GE aims to be a leader in the industrial internet, but its core businesses include aviation, where 3D manufacturing could play a role. GE stock hit an eight-year high in early 2016, but shares have slipped of late. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.GE expects to generate $1 billion in revenue from 3D printing activities by 2020. GE's push into 3D printing is a negative for 3D Systems, which makes metal printers, and relatively neutral for Stratasys and Proto Labs (PRLB), says Pacific Crest's Twigg. He says GE might eventually try to buy Materialise.""If GE creates a more aggressive competitive dynamic, 3D Systems will need to decide whether it should continue to invest R&D to continue to develop its platform, or whether to exit metals altogether,"" added Twigg.

221,HP,"Chinese competition dogs the likes of Apple (AAPL), HP (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Intel (INTC) and many other U.S. companies -- but not so much the makers of fiber-optic components, especially at the high-end of the market.That's a good thing for optical component makers such as Acacia Communications (ACIA), Lumentum Holdings (LITE), Finisar (FNSR), Oclaro (OCLR), and NeoPhotonics (NPTN), which aim to ride a so-called ""supercycle"" that some analysts expect could last more than two to three years.Lumentum stock notched an all-time high on Thursday, while Finisar, Oclaro and NeoPhotonics all touched more than five-year highs. Acacia made its IPO in May and hit its record high on Sept. 7. The companies have helped drive IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group to No. 1 out of 197 groups tracked. The group reached a 15-year high on Sept. 7.Optics demand has surged as telecom companies like Verizon Communications (VZ) upgrade networks and internet firms such as Google and Facebook (FB) build new data centers packed with computer servers.U.S. optical parts makers and suppliers of system-level fiber-optics products, such as Ciena (CIEN), are far ahead of Chinese rivals in churning out faster communications products.IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks are often part of the best industry groups, which is why IBD ranks 197 industry groups by performance and goes deep on the weekly Industry Snapshot feature, including this one on the current No. 1 group, Telecom-Fiber Optics.U.S. companies are shipping optical transceivers and network switches that whisk data at 100 gigabits per second and are working on 400G products. At the low end of the market where Chinese suppliers operate, price competition is fierce for older, slower 10G and 40G products.""With the exception of InnoLight, which is the only Chinese company capable of doing 100G, Chinese component suppliers are mainly focused on low-cost, low-speed datacom optics today, at 10 and 40 gigabit,"" Dmitry Netis, an analyst at William Blair & Co., told IBD. ""Long-distance optics have not been an area of strength or particular know-how for Chinese component suppliers yet.""Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google invested in InnoLight in 2014. Other Chinese component suppliers include Accelink, Eoptolink, Wuhan Weiyun Technology, and Huihong Technologies. While Apple has Chinese smartphone rival Xiaomi to contend with and HP battles Lenovo in laptops, there's no rising star in China's optical components industry. Huawei, which has emerged as a global supplier of telecom networking equipment, makes some optical components internally at subsidiary Hisense, but it's a big customer of U.S. optical suppliers.Troy Jensen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, says it's more economical for U.S. companies to invest in the R&D needed to develop leading-edge 100G and 400G parts than it would be for Huawei, which would sell components mainly to itself. A company like Finisar sells components to Cisco, Ciena, Alcatel and many customers, he says.""China is typically a product generation behind the pure-play optical guys,"" Jensen told IBD.U.S. companies usually manage to garner high profit margins for three or four years before comparable Chinese products hit the market, says Alex Henderson, an analyst at Needham & Co.China, though, has made it a priority to create a world-class semiconductor industry to reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers. China now produces about 20% of the chips it consumes in phones, appliances, TVs and other manufactured products locally, Citigroup said in a research report this month. An initiative called ""Made in China 2025"" aims to increase local chip production to as much as 70% by 2025.Already Huawei, dating back to 2013, acquired Belgium-based Caliopa to gain know-how in high-end silicon photonics.But while China's semiconductor industry has made great strides in wireless and other chip areas, the government hasn't prioritized fiber-optics technology as much.One reason could be that the semiconductor industry is much bigger than fiber optics and spans many more end-markets, says Henderson. He says some optical products use advanced materials that Chinese companies have not yet widely utilized.China's government may rethink its fiber-optics strategy, analysts say, in the wake of the U.S. Commerce Department briefly banning component sales to China smartphone maker ZTE earlier this year. The U.S. said ZTE broke export sanctions against Iran.The U.S. has since lifted its restrictions on component sales to ZTE, which is a customer of Acacia and other parts makers, but China might set it sights on ensuring a local supply of high-end optical devices in the future, says Needham's Henderson.For now, though, U.S. companies are positioned to take advantage of the current supercycle in the fiber-optics industry, analysts say, with China among their markets.The U.S. optics makers that do the most business in China are NeoPhotonics, Lumentum, Oclaro and Finisar, says Piper's Jensen. NeoPhotonics' customers include Huawei.Chinese telecom companies, just like U.S. carriers such as Verizon, are upgrading networks in metropolitan areas to 100G technology, Jensen says. Metro networks as well as data centers need more bandwidth to handle internet video, mobile broadband and business-driven data traffic.Chinese internet leaders Alibaba Holdings (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) lag U.S. counterparts in upgrading data centers to 100G technology, but they are expected to pick up the pace over the next couple of years, says Vladimir Kozlov, CEO of LightCounting Market Research.He tells IBD that many Chinese component suppliers have focused on the residential and business broadband market, but companies like Eoptolink are making strides in 100G technology for telecom. The country, indeed, already has begun to focus optics, he says.""There are more domestic suppliers,"" Kozlov said. ""China's government has encouraged development of optics.""

(HPQ) and Apple, RBC Capital Markets said in a report Friday. Apple is expected to update its Mac computer lineup in October.UBS analyst Stephen Chin said PCs remain a driver for Intel's stock since the segment accounts for 53% of sales.""One outstanding question is whether this was a one-time benefit (for Intel's Q3) or the result of better consumer interest in new products and replacement of older PCs,"" Chin said in a report.In addition to improving PC sales, Intel is likely to benefit from better performance in its data center chip business, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said in a report Friday.""The Broadwell-E server refresh should drive stronger results in the second half of the year,"" Shah said.

225,HP,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone demand appears higher than conservative forecasts, giving Apple and the broader markets a lift. Wells Fargo (WFC) is still reeling from the major cross-selling fraud scandal. General Motors (GM) said its Chevy Bolt will have a higher battery range than the Tesla Motors (TSLA) Model 3, as Tesla and others gave autonomous vehicle updates. Two huge agribusiness mergers were announced.The major averages followed the Sept. 9 sell-off with several large and up-and-down days. Fed Gov. Lael Brainard's dovish comments Monday helped reassure investors that a September rate hike was highly unlikely. Meanwhile, Apple powered ahead on stronger-than-expected demand for its iPhone 7. Apple, which boasts the world's biggest market cap, is part of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials. The Nasdaq retook its 50-day line and rose 2.3% for the week.

Lael Brainard signaled she would prefer to be cautious with rate hikes. That reinforced expectations that the central bank will take no action at this week's policy meeting.Wells Fargo shares continued to slide over the cross-selling fraud scandal, losing nearly 7% for the week.

Both touted their international prospects.Intel expects third-quarter revenue of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion vs. its prior range of $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion.

226,HP,"Analysts don't see any near-term brightening of the picture for 3D Systems (DDD), after the 3D printer maker's Q&A at a trade show Monday.The 3D printer industry emerged with a flourish from 2009 to 2013, only to crash in the next couple of years when it turned out that industry hype — the printers make products out of plastics, metals and other materials — has gotten ahead of reality in both the industrial and consumer segments.Longer term, though, prospects remain bullish, so much so that HP Inc. (HPQ) and General Electric (GE) have recently entered the market, just another hurdle for 3D Systems and its longtime top rival, Stratasys (SSYS).IBD'S TAKE: For all its challenges, 3D Systems sports a good IBD Relative Strength Rating of 90, meaning it's performed in the top 10% of all stocks over the past year. And it gets good ""green"" ratings on three key metrics, along with bad ""red"" ratings on another three key metrics, as shown in IBD Stock Checkup.But those companies entered the market for a reason. 3D Systems' new CEO, Vyomesh Joshi, who joined this year after helping guide HP's printer business to the top — and other top executives, a number of whom also came from HP — said the company ""is at an inflection point as the 3D printing industry transitions over the next three years from prototyping to production,"" Needham analyst James Ricchiuti related in a research note Tuesday.But Ricchiuti maintained a hold rating on 3D Systems stock, writing that executives ""conceded that more work needs to be done in terms of meeting all of the major customer requirements (speed, durability, repeatability and total cost of ownership).""The company did not update its financial guidance in the session, held at the start of the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago.In terms of financial guidance, CFO John McMullen, one of the former HP execs at 3D Systems, ""suggested ... there is an opportunity for revenue and EPS growth in 2017,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg reported in a research note late Monday. But Twigg said ""we think this should be a minimum goal post,"" and ""we expect more aggressive goals to be rolled out through 2017 as operational improvements are accomplished.""Pac Crest maintained its sector weight rating on 3D Systems, which has seen its year-over-year revenue fall in each of the past four quarters.3D Systems on Monday announced a collaboration with computer-aided design company PTC (PTC), with 3D Systems' technology integrated into PTC's CAD platform. Analysts quoted CEO Joshi as saying that collaborations, not acquisitions, will be the company's style, and as conceding that the company has done a poor job of integrating its acquisitions.3D Systems stock fell 2.1% in the stock market today, to 15.16, but it's still up nearly 75% for the year.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 44 cents EPS and $11.46 billion in sales.For the current quarter, HP guided to non-GAAP earnings per share of 34 to 37 cents, when Wall Street was targeting 41 cents. The shortfall was attributed to changes in HP's printer and ink business. HP is reducing its printing supplies inventory and aggressively pricing printers to expand its installed base.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings time can be volatile for stocks. Investors looking to reduce risks at these times might want to consider investing in options, and can get help with options as part of IBD's weekly Earnings Preview feature.""We believe management's decision to draw down printer supplies and increase product placement is the right decision for the long term,"" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said in a research report. ""However, the near-term impact is now being felt in fiscal Q4 as these actions are pressuring margins without any offsetting gains the company had in previous quarters.""Benefits from its actions are not expected until the back half of fiscal 2017, which starts Nov. 1, Um said. He rates HP stock as market perform, with a valuation range of 13 to 14.""These actions should create a nice set up for HP in the future — low supplies inventory and high installed base of printers that should be in need of supplies replacement,"" he said. ""HP is sowing the right seeds, but we think it will take some time to bear fruit.""HP's key challenge is to stabilize its high-margin printer supplies business, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said in a report.

Best Buy (BBY) earnings surprised investors, while dollar stores came under pressure.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 0.7% and the Dow 0.8%. The major averages are still in sideways action. Drug stocks were big movers on Pfizer's Medivation (MDVN) deal and Mylan's EpiPen furor. Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported. The 12% rise from June surprised economists looking for a slight dip to 580,000. Luxury homebuilder Toll Bros. (TOL) confirmed that the high end of the market is prospering, reporting a 69% jump in third-quarter earnings per share, a 23.5% rise in revenue and a strong backlog of orders. Existing-home sales fell more than expected in July, though that was from June's cycle high. But applications for loans to buy a home fell to a six-month low. Toll shares soared to a seven-month high, moving above their 200-day moving average.The generic drugmaker Mylan sold off 11.55% for the week as members of the Senate and other politicians started inquiring into its price increases on its emergency allergy drug/device EpiPen. That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation. Biotechs rallied Monday on the news, with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) jumping on rumors that it was Sanofi's second choice of target. On Wednesday, Pfizer agreed to buy the antibiotics business of AstraZeneca (AZN) for $725 million plus possible future milestone and sales payments and royalties that could amount to $850 million.Oil prices may be settling into a trading range in the mid to high $40 range.

Domestic production fell slightly.The road to self-driving cars got a little more crowded as Mobileye (MBLY) announced it will partner with General Motors (GM) supplier Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to jointly develop off-the-shelf autonomous driving technology for automakers. The two companies will co-develop ""the market's first turnkey Level 4/5 automated driving solution."" Mobileye already has deal with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to bring an autonomous vehicle to market by 2021.Mobileye shares spiked Tuesday on the Delphi news, briefly topping a buy point.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million. But shares of the cloud-based human resources software maker rose 2.5%, hitting a 2016 high on Thursday.July IPO Talend (TLND) lost an adjusted $1.84 a share, according to its late Thursday release, but the French Big Data firm later clarified that the bottom line actually met estimates for a loss of 31 cents a share after adjusting for the share count following its initial offering. Revenue rose 38% to $25.4 million, just beating. Talend sees Q3 losses in line with views, but it guided revenue slightly higher. Shares fell 4% after much bigger intraday losses.Best Buy (BBY) stock jumped 21% for the week to a 17-month high on better-than-expected sales and earnings for its fiscal second quarter, including a surprise increase in same-store sales. The consumer electronics retailer credited rising demand for wearable technology, appliances and home-theater systems for the increase. Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views. For the current quarter, the printer and PC maker sees non-GAAP EPS of 34-37 cents, vs. consensus for 41 cents.

But is it the calm before the story ahead of Janet Yellen's big speech Friday?Dollar Tree (DLTR) bent 8% lower after a 188% earnings gain and a 100% rise in revenue stopped short of analysts' forecasts. Dollar Tree has been trading tightly, testing the 10-week moving average and is just below an Aug. 11 high.Jewelry retailers were also busy, with Signet Jewelers (SIG) diving 15% as its Q2 results missed expectations by a wide margin and the company carved its Q3 earnings guidance to well below the consensus view.Competitor Tiffany (TIF) surged 7%. The blue box jeweler turned in a solid second quarter beat and gave no-surprise guidance.Beyond retail, Workday (WDAY) punched up more than 5%, despite reporting late Wednesday that its Q2 earnings per share missed expectations. Workday's Q2 revenue topped analysts' views, but management guided Q3 revenue below projections.HP Inc. (HPQ) slumped 5% after reporting solid fiscal Q3 results late Wednesday, but offering weak Q4 earnings guidance.

246,HP,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) said late Wednesday that it would cut up to 5,500 positions, or 7% of staff, as part of a restructuring networking giant reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.The cuts, which will begin this quarter, were less than the 9,000-14,000 staff reduction that CRN reported Tuesday was likely.Separately, TechCrunch reported, citing a source that Cisco was aiming for a 15% cost cut that includes layoffs.Ahead of the actual news, analysts were generally positive on job cuts.RBC Capital Markets said in a Wednesday morning note: ""Given that the Company has been acquisitive over the past six months and Cisco is shifting its focus to software/security/services we think a RIF (reduction in force) would be beneficial to long-term operating margins.""RBC analysts said that a 20% cut might be ""severe,"" but that reducing 10,000 jobs would be ""fair.""Jefferies analysts wrote Wednesday morning that job cuts are ""likely"" and said they would be a positive, or at least not a negative:""Naturally, any headcount reduction could be viewed as a sign of weakness in business fundamentals. We believe that any headcount reduction at Cisco – at this point – would be driven by their natural re-organization of the business.""Cisco has made several acquisitions in recent quarters to shift to a software and cloud-based model from its router and switch origins. Those legacy divisions have been reporting revenue declines, while other divisions show increases.Microsoft (MSFT) and HP Inc. (HPQ) also have announced significant layoffs over the past year as they conduct ongoing strategic shifts. Microsoft said last month that it would cut a further 2,850 jobs. HP Inc. announced plans in February to cut 3,000 positions.Cisco earnings and sales topped forecasts late Wednesday.Cisco shares fell 2% in initial after-hours trading.

247,HP,"Shares of London-based Atlassian (TEAM) cooled off Tuesday, but the company got a rousing vote of approval from Summit Redstone Partners, which initiated coverage with a buy rating and said the 2015 IPO is taking enterprise software market share from such larger rivals as IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).Atlassian was founded in 2002 without a sales force, selling its software directly online, boosted by word-of-mouth. It makes collaborative software that businesses and other enterprises use to track issues, develop documents, provide customer and IT support, and more.""TEAM is gaining share from larger peers like IBM, Microsoft and HP (that) are not as focused as TEAM on team collaboration solutions and communications,"" Summit analyst Jonathan Kees wrote in a research report Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: You want stocks in the top 30 (of 197) industry groups tracked by IBD, and the top 20 is better. Atlassian has helped boost its group, specialty enterprise software, into the top 20, as you can learn from IBD Industry Themes.He said the company was ""unique from the start: from its differentiated, online sales model to its no-hassle, no discounting pricing to its high-growth, already profitable and generating cash business.""Atlassian, which went public in December at 21, soared to a record high of 32.54 on Aug. 5, after posting June-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street expectations. Atlassian stock also broke out of a cup base at a 31.56 buy point on that date.Shares have since fallen, however, and fell 1.3%, to 29.95, in the stock market today.Kees started coverage with a 35 price target on Atlassian stock, saying ""we believe TEAM's competitive advantages remain viable for the immediate future.""Atlassian's customers include big names such as: BlackRock (BLK), Amgen (AMGN) and Sotheby's (BID).
"
248,HP,"3D printer maker 3D Systems (DDD) early Wednesday posted adjusted earnings per share that doubled Wall Street expectations, sending its shares soaring by nearly 18% at the close.But illustrating the ongoing struggles in the 3D printer market, the company posted its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue declines. Q2 revenue fell 7% from the year-earlier quarter to $158 million, where analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $161 million.The 3D printer maker, however, also reported earnings per share minus items of 12 cents, double the consensus estimate.3D Systems stock ended the day at 14.35, up 2.17 on the stock market today, moving above its 50-day line.3D Systems cited strong demand for the company's health care solutions and software, as well as higher materials orders from health care and industrial customers, though that was not enough to offset the lower demand for 3D printers overall.Rival Stratasys (SSYS) reports Q2 earnings before the market open Thursday. The consensus is for revenue of $175.8 million, down 3.5%, which would be a fourth consecutive quarter of declines. It's expected to report EPS of 6 cents, down from 15 cents and marking a seventh consecutive quarter of declines.Stratasys stock was up 5.4% to 20.40 at the close.IBD'S TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys are far off their highs from 2014, as the 3D printer market has stumbled. They also have weak IBD Composite Ratings. To discover winning stocks, check out IBD Stock Checkup.Piper Jaffray last month said channel checks revealed a ""significant slowdown"" in product demand for 3D Systems and Stratasys, partly due to the entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) into the 3D printer market 10 weeks ago.""We believe several customers have and will likely continue to pause purchasing to assess these new HP offerings,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen in a research note at the time of HP's entry.Jensen says several existing resellers of Stratasys and 3D Systems are likely to partner with HP, which he says will distract the channels and stress relationships.Cowen analyst Robert Stone said visibility remains low in the additive manufacturing (3D printer) field, ""given recent results and the current global economic backdrop.""

249,HP,"Apple (AAPL) iPhones are drubbing Samsung and other Android rivals in the Bring Your Own Device race to provide ""bulletproof security,"" says Tech Research Pro.Yet, good security often, if not usually, is lacking on employee-owned mobile devices used in the workplace, a Tech Research Pro survey found and other sources say.Of 259 respondents in a Tech Research Pro survey in April and May of decision makers in companies worldwide, 76% said their companies let employees use personal smartphones for business but only a third of IT departments support these devices, and employees aren't too security conscious.""Enterprise security breaches reported by respondents also reflected a tendency on the part of employees to take a more relaxed attitude toward security on their mobile devices,"" Tech Research Pro said in its report.The BYOD trend is important for Apple and Samsung, which see the enterprise sector as a growth opportunity amid overall slowing smartphone growth, says ZDNet and TechRepublic editor Larry Dignan. Corporate information technology units are trying to respond.Industry tracker Forrester recently found that more than half of all corporations are developing BOYD programs. Still, 1 in 3 decision makers polled by Tech Research Pro said their IT departments support only company-provided smartphones, tablets, wearables and laptops.Apple is leading Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung in usage of tablets and wearables; it's leading Microsoft, Lenovo, Dell and  HP Inc. (HPQ) in laptops; and it beats Samsung in smartphones, according to Tech Pro Research. Apple's lead is partly on the opinion that it's more secure, Dignan told IBD.In the Tech Research Pro survey, more than half of respondents (51%) rated the iPhone as ""good or excellent in security."" Only 30% said the same for Samsung, though the company is closing the gap with its Knox mobile security app, says Tech Research Pro.The gap in actual usage is smaller -- 67% were using Apple vs. 62% using Samsung -- meaning some users could be trading lesser security for lower device costs, since Apple devices often cost more than others.BlackBerry (BBRY) also dominated Samsung in terms of security perception -- 39% rated its security as ""good or excellent."" And Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is also pushing for the enterprise segment, Dignan says.Still, the halo effect of Apple's security pays real dividends.""From the start, Apple has had good security built in,"" Dignan told IBD. ""It doesn't have the fragmentation that Android has. It's hard to protect Android, which has different versions, flavors and eight different operating systems vs. one iOS.""Apple's security reputation stems in part on its tight control of its App Store and requirements for installing apps, says Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint (PFPT) senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy.""The iOS devices, for a very long time, were considered more or less bulletproof from a security perspective, unless they were jailbroken,"" Kalember told IBD. Jailbreaking an Apple device escalates a user's privileges, allowing third-party apps not approved by the App Store to be installed.Many security professionals consider jailbreaking an opening to a Pandora's box. Such was the case when a hacker created Ex Code Ghost, mimicking Apple's Ex Code app which developers use to create legitimate apps. The Ghost version was uploaded near the end of 2015 and allowed apps to be created, but it inserted malicious code after the fact.Apple identified the offending code, but not before it penetrated 1,100 legitimate apps in the official App Store, including the app for Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing Technology, a ride-hailing service.""It was cleaned up, but it was a very a clever way to puncture the illusion that, just if you had iOS only and no jailbroken devices, then you were safe from a security perspective,"" Kalember said.Soon after, Proofpoint discovered another vulnerability shadowing Apple's security illusion -- Dark Side Loader, a fraudulent app store that clones legitimate apps by stealing certificates. Dark Side Loader takes advantage of an Apple mechanism that allows companies to create and upload their own apps to a private store for employees.But Dark Side Loader uses it to peddle free versions of paid apps, allowing Apple users to circumvent the official app store. Kalember likens it to Napster for apps, which is troubling because ""Apple never reviews that app ... like Apple does for every app in the enterprise store.""Still, Apple shines in the Tech Research Pro security survey. The lion's share of respondents (82%) rated Apple's iPad security ""good or excellent,"" vs. 77% and 73% for Microsoft and Samsung, respectively. In wearables, 65% rated Apple's security highly to 58% for both Microsoft and Samsung.Also, 42% felt Apple's MacBooks have excellent security, while only a third said the same for Microsoft. Dell, HP and Lenovo trailed at 30%, 29% and 27%, respectively.The BYOD trend kicked off in earnest less than a decade ago, but it's already entrenched. Of respondents to the Tech Research Pro survey, only 2% said there is absolutely no use of personal mobile devices -- smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables -- in their workplaces.To that end, Forrester Research found that 60% of corporate decision makers plan to invest heavily in mobile application development before year's end. CNBC reported recently that Target (TGT), Walgreens (WAG), Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) are leading the pack in developing mobile apps for their employees.But employees are the weak link in security, Tech Research Pro found. Only 12% of those surveyed had experienced a breach in the past year, but of those, 57% cited a lost device and 23% lack of data encryption on the employee's device.That extended to sharing the device and/or the data with unauthorized people within and outside the company.Nearly every laptop (96%) was password-protected, along with 89% of tablets, 85% of smartphones and 57% of wearables, researchers found.But less than half of all devices required data encryption or central management. Laptops are most likely to be encrypted (47%), but only 38% of smartphones and 36% of tablets are protected similarly, says Tech Research Pro.Mobile device management (MDM), which can remotely push updates or lock down a misplaced device, was used on 48% of laptops, 47% of tablets and 44% of smartphones. Wearables trailed in every security regard. Less than a third are protected by encryption or mobile device management.Wearables are just entering the workplace, though. Of those surveyed, 94% were using smartphones and laptops, 74% were using tablets and only 14% were using wearables. BYOD wearables were most prevalent in the military, law enforcement, health care, field maintenance and sports sectors, Tech Research Pro found.Usage has a part to play on security perception. Respondents ranked laptop security highest with tablets, smartphones and wearables trailing, respectively. This likely stems from the ability to track down a lost or stolen device, researchers said, which is why desktops are considered the most secure devices.BYOD security is an overwhelmingly mobile target, Proofpoint's Kalember says. IT departments are still inking their policies, which is why only the savvier companies require higher levels of protection like MDM and mobile threat protection, he told IBD.More stringent IT departments might install MDMs that scan for rogue apps, Kalember said. The tech team can lock a user out of corporate email and/or apps until the offending app is uninstalled. But IT departments employing such tactics are early adopters, he says.""The typical thing we see for most BYOD is that the IT department has a primitive understanding of an employee blacklist, and it's to avoid employee time-wasting,"" he said. ""They might install a mobile device management tool to prohibit employees from installing 'Angry Birds' or 'Pokemon Go.' ""

It increased its worldwide PC market share to 20.8% from 18.9% a year earlier. China-based Lenovo continues to lead, but its PC shipments fell 2.3% to 13.2 million units. But since Lenovo's decline was less than the overall market decline, its market share actually increased to 21.2% from 20.7%, IDC said.Total PC shipments fell 4.5% to 62.4 million units in Q2. That's better than the forecast decline of 7.4%.Dell held on to third place with 16% market share, followed by Asus (7.2%) and Apple (AAPL) (7.1%).Apple showed the biggest decline among the top five PC vendors, down 8.3% year over year.Improved inventory levels put the PC market on a better footing for the second half of the year, IDC said. Also, the expiration of free upgrades to Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 at the end of the month might spur people into buying new systems, the research firm said.In the U.S., PC shipments rose 4.9% to 17.03 million units in the second quarter, IDC said. Among the top five vendors, Apple was a laggard, notching a 7.6% decline in Mac shipments. The other four top U.S. vendors posted double-digit increases in Q2.HP is the No. 1 PC vendor in the U.S., with 27.9% market share in Q2.

(HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split, into the 3D printer market two months ago. HP introduced two 3D printers, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Proto Labs (PRLB).""We believe several customers have and will likely continue to pause purchasing to assess these new (HP) offerings,"" Jensen wrote. He also thinks several existing resellers of Stratasys and 3D Systems are likely to partner with HP, which will likely distract channels and stress relationships.""Our 2Q16 survey results were the poorest we have seen in recent memory, and given the internal challenges both Stratasys and 3D Systems have, we have become more cautious on both companies,"" Jensen wrote.Though Stratasys fared better than 3D Systems in the survey, ""the overall tone remained extremely negative and system demand has seemed to have hit a recent low,"" Jensen wrote about Stratasys. Jensen downgraded Stratasys to neutral from overweight and lowered to 24 from 32.Stratasys stock was down 9.1% to 21.17 at the close on the stock market today, falling below its 50-day moving average.Jensen lowered his rating on 3D Systems to underweight from neutral and his price target to 10.25 from 12. Channel checks on 3D Systems indicated ""demand was more challenging than ever.""3D Systems stock was down 8.4%, near 13.48, at the close, also dipping below its 50-day average.IBD's TAKE: Both 3D Systems and Stratasys have low ratings based on IBD's technical analysis. Stratasys has a Composite Rating of 10, putting it among the lowest 10% of all stocks in some key metrics. 3D Systems has a CR of 44.Shares of both companies were hammered in 2015 as 3D Systems and Stratasys posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales, before nearing a bottom in January. 3D Systems hit a six-year low of 6 on Jan. 20. Stratasys hit a six-year low of 14.48 on Jan. 26.3D Systems on April 4 announced it had recruited Vyomesh Joshi as CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. On June 4 Stratasys announced the retirement of its CEO, David Reis, succeeded by Ilin LevinStratasys is slated to report quarterly earnings on Aug. 4, while 3D Systems reports Aug. 3, both before the market open.In its survey, Piper Jaffray said it collected feedback from 55 3D printing resellers and service bureau operators. It said 87% of respondents were located in North America, while 13% were in Europe.

257,HP,"Simplicity is the most powerful force in business.That's from Ken Segall, author of ""Think Simple: How Smart Leaders Defeat Complexity.""He became convinced of that after spending more than 12 years working closely with Apple (AAPL) and CEO Steve Jobs as an outside ad agency's creative director. This included leading the team that created Apple's ""Think Different"" campaign. He was also agency global director for IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Dell and BMW (BMWYY).Segall says Apple isn't the only company ""succeeding with simplicity."" As a result of his conversations with more than 40 CEOs and business leaders around the world in researching his book, he discovered that ""they all have a story to tell about how they have leveraged the power of simplicity.""Tips on doing so for your business:Boil it down. Observe and adhere to the one-page rule when it comes to strategies and briefs, Segall reminds.""If you can't distill your thinking into a single page, it isn't clear enough for people to act on,"" he added.Among the believers in doing this, President Ronald Reagan.Do fewer things better. Don't dilute R&D and marketing budgets by trying to be everything to everybody, Segall advises.Instead, ""focus resources on doing things that truly stand out,"" he said. ""That brings clarity to employees and customers alike.""Segall also has found that providing too many choices can actually impede the buying process for customers. He points out while Dell and HP Inc. (HPQ) offer numerous laptop models, ""Apple offers a mere three -- yet it captures more of the profits in the PC category than Dell and HP combined. The key is providing the right choices, not endless ones.""Pare down tasks. Half of strategy is deciding what not to do, says Mark Rampolla, author of ""High-Hanging Fruit: Build Something Great by Going Where No One Else Will."" He's also the CEO and founder of ZICO Beverages.""This is more than simply prioritizing a to-do list,"" he continues. It means teaming up with the closest team members to ""define your collective values and goals for your business (and) having the courage to remind each other 'It will not be like this!' when things start to go sideways.""Streamline. Steve Jobs once said that Apple makes progress by ""removing the superfluous,"" Segall said.Scrutinize your processes, product features and website, he suggests, as you're likely to find the superfluous in them if you look critically enough for it.  Create a movement. Initiatives launched within a company are often met with muted interest or sometimes even resentment, Segall says.The way around that is simplification, he says, because ""everyone wants it, and employees will enthusiastically join the effort"" when things are presented that way.Listen to your intuition. Those who lead for simplicity refuse to be slaves to numbers, is another conclusion Segall has made.""With years of experience in business and in life, leaders trust their instincts to make key decisions,"" he said. ""Data is important, but just one factor among many.""Concentrate on now. Rampolla says it's easy of course to worry about things like quarterly reports and the next investor meeting. ""So easy, in fact, that our brains keep returning to whatever stress we've manufactured for ourselves and distract us from what we're doing in the present.""The solution, he added, is to ""truly focus on what you're doing right in the moment. Give it your full attention. When you can be present in the moment, you can take a breath and realize that despite all the hard stuff still ahead, right in this moment, everything is OK. This has a calming effect and lets you tackle, and maybe once again enjoy, the task at hand.""Keep a winning attitude. It's just as simple to do so as the opposite. Don't think of success as a distant, hoped-for payout, but as ""something we work to experience continuously,"" Rampolla said.When your daily journey of creating your business is meaningful, challenging and a personal quest, ""it becomes an endeavor where you literally cannot lose,"" he said.

265,HP,"Eight years ago, it took Continental Resources (CLR) and its service companies over a month to drill to the bottom of a well in the Bakken shale play. A year ago, it took 18-20 days, and it looked like that was the technical limit on how fast a well could be drilled.Wrong.Wells can now be drilled in 13-15 days thanks to improved sensors that keep drillers in the optimal drilling zone, more effective drill bits that can power though the Bakken's hard rock, and other advances.The number of oil rigs operating in the U.S., despite recent increases, could stay depressed for years. But don't let that fool you. New technology and techniques are unlocking more oil per well. While OPEC has succeeded in forcing U.S. producers to cut back, the industry that is emerging from the oil bust has found ways to pump oil faster and more cheaply, making it a tougher adversary for the next global standoff.""The downturn in oil prices has accelerated the adoption rate of new technology because at this point the industry's back is against the wall and you have to adapt or you're going to die,"" said Matt Marietta, an analyst at Stephens.Technological innovation will be key as oil prices head up again. By slashing costs, producers were able to continue pumping when oil prices first collapsed, but that was largely the result of squeezing discounts from suppliers.In fact, only 20% of current cost reductions have come from technology improvements, according to Dan Guffey, vice president of equity research at Stifel Nicolaus. The other 80% came from service providers slashing costs and working with negative margins. But rock-bottom prices won't last forever, he warned.While BP (BP), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and other oil majors with deep financial resources can take their time adopting new techniques, smaller producers have been forced to adapt quickly.Continental, which was among the pioneers in the original fracking revolution, is seeing success with enhanced well-completion techniques that it started doing two years ago when oil prices were higher.For example, the company now uses 15 million-20 million pounds of sand in each proppant load, which contain particles that hold hydraulic fractures open, up from 2.5 million-3 million pounds two to three years ago, said Warren Henry, vice president of investor relations and research at Continental, noting that the cost of sand has been falling.""In effect you're hitting (the well) with a really big hammer,"" he said.The result has been to keep oil flowing from some wells, even as prices neared recession-era lows. In its Q1 earnings report, Continental said enhanced completions in the Scoop shale play in Oklahoma have increased initial production rates 30%-35% vs. traditional completions.""I am proud of our teams as they continue to increase production and improve well economics through our ongoing process for optimizing completion designs,"" said Gary Gould, Continental's vice president of production and resource development, in an earnings release.""We continue to apply enhanced completion designs on all new operated wells, by testing, for example, various proppant volumes, stage lengths and proppant sizes in order to determine the optimum completion design for each area in each play.""Other companies are working on new twists on older practices. EOG Resources (EOG) announced last month that it has been injecting natural gas into existing wells in the Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas.EOG wouldn't provide further details on how exactly its new method works. But James Williams, an economist at WTRG, said the process is likely similar to a water or CO2 flood, where liquid or gas is pumped in a well, mixes with oil to add pressure, and pushes oil toward wells at the other end of a field to be pumped out.EOG has been working on the process for three years and plans to do another pilot project later this year to test 32 wells.The company cautioned that the new method might not work in other shale plays with different geologic properties.Halliburton (HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Flotek Industries (FTK) are working on customized nanofluids designed to reduce surface tension and increase a well's productivity.Nanofluids are made up of molecules that are smaller than those found in traditional fluids and reduce the friction to increase the flow rates of oil and natural gas out of the reservoir rock, Marietta said.Another technique that has gained popularity in U.S. plays is pad drilling, or drilling several wells from a single location to reduce the time and money spent disassembling the rig and moving it to another spot. Improving drilling time is a priority for shale drillers, as each additional drilling day can cost thousands of dollars.Meanwhile, the rigs themselves have also become more advanced. Helmerich & Payne (HP) pioneered the alternating current (AC) rig for shale back in the early 2000s. The rig's ability to drill at various speeds improves precision and energy efficiency vs. direct current (DC) rigs.Newer versions of the AC rig reduce ""spud to spud time"" -- or the time it takes between starting a new well to moving to another well -- to 7-10 days from 3-4 weeks, according to Marietta. That While good for oil producers, that also means suppliers of drilling products and services will see lower spending revenue and employment because fewer rigs are needed.More expensive offshore drilling is also seeing new advances that could be ready when prices get high enough to begin new projects.General Electric's (GE) oil and gas unit used carbon fiber technology to create a light-flexible pipe that connects a floating platform to the sea floor in deepwater drilling, like in the Gulf of Mexico or off Brazil.Ray Burke, a global product leader for GE Oil & Gas in the U.K., said the new pipe has been in the works for three years and will go into service in mid-2018.Burke wouldn't disclose the companies that are looking at the pipe but said several international and national oil companies are interested. He said the pipe can produce cost savings of 20%.""The simple story is we are going deeper and using carbon fibers and the end results are going to be cheaper for our clients.""Advances in drilling will help continue the success that U.S. companies have seen over the last five years, said Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.New technology can also lead to more gradual moves in the price of oil, instead of wild swings, as shale is more nimble than conventional production, he added.OPEC countries like Nigeria and Venezuela that haven't invested in newer technology will be hurt by advances in the U.S., said Thomas O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat. Russia also can't exploit shale and Arctic assets because of economic sanctions that limit Westerners from helping develop the new fields.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has low-cost production fields, and state-run oil company Saudi Aramco can bring in foreign experts knowledgeable about fracking and new technologies, he added.Still, OPEC must now grapple with U.S. shale producers on the rebound, which could lead to volatility, O'Donnell said. ""The oil order has changed. It's conventional oil on one side, and new shale oil on the other.""To be sure, new technologies and techniques don't all deliver immediate, upfront savings, and finding the right technique for each reservoir can be time-consuming and expensive.The oil business remains capital intensive, and capital has been in short supply for some companies. Breitburn Energy Partners, SandRidge Energy, Magnum Hunter Resources, Energy XXI, Goodrich Petroleum and others haven't been able to survive lower oil prices and filed for bankruptcy protection.But for those with strong balance sheets, the new techniques can, over decades, boost the estimated total recovery for a well, as more oil is recovered for longer.""We are leaving behind 80% of oil in place, even with the best technology we have today,"" Continental's Henry said. ""So we'll continue to be surprised at the improvements that can be made.""

266,HP,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) earnings growth might slow amid mounting competitive pressure from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and a “refocused” Juniper Networks (JNPR), says Goldman Sachs, which on Wednesday downgraded Cisco to neutral from buy.Cisco stock closed down 1.1% at 28.65 in the stock market today.While Cisco already faces “significant pressure” from Nokia (which this year completed its $17 billion acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent), Arista Networks (ANET), and China-based Huawei, new threats are emerging, says a Goldman Sachs research report. “We see heightened competitive pressure from a more focused HPE following its acquisition of Aruba last year and split from HPQ,” Goldman analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in the report. “In the data center segment, we see Juniper as a more meaningful competitor.”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and HP Inc., which focuses on PCs and printers. HPE last month said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC).HPE now could be on the prowl for acquisitions, analysts say.“Cisco has been able to offset share losses in networking with share gains in servers, but we see those as largely exhausted now,” Jankowski said. “In addition, the significant increase in management turnover over the last few months raises execution risks over the medium term.”Some analysts have speculated that Cisco could buy a data storage company with software expertise in converged infrastructure.“We believe HPE now has a much more rounded networking portfolio with the Aruba asset, as well as a much stronger focus on enterprise IT infrastructure,” added Jankowski. “In addition, its leadership in servers and significant presence in storage (where Cisco only participates through partnerships rather than directly) can give it a competitive advantage in situations where the customer is looking for bundled solutions.""HPE’s significantly lower margin structure allows it to undercut Cisco on price.”

271,HP,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) signaled that more acquisitions may be coming at its “Discover” customer conference this week, say analysts.There’s been speculation that Hewlett Packard Enterprise could acquire an enterprise software company or F5 Networks (FFIV), a supplier of data center gear.Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s recent acquisitions have turned out well.""While the company is focused on organic innovation, HPE is open to acquisitions similar to 3Par, 3Com and Aruba -- complimentary technologies that can be sold through HP's distribution channel,” Huberty said in a report. “Software-defined and hyperconverged products are a key area of focus with acquisitions potentially focused here.”At Jefferies, analyst James Kisner says Hewlett Packard Enterprise could be in the hunt for Seattle-based F5 Networks. (F5 Networks shot up nearly 13% on Tuesday on a report that it had hired Goldman Sachs (GS) to help review takeover approaches.)“From a strategic perspective, we believe HPE could be a possible suitor,” said Kisner in a report. “HPE’s Aruba acquisition has been doing well. At Discover, (CEO Meg) Whitman noted that the size of potential acquisitions is less of an issue than their valuation. We note that F5 is trading at a similar valuation as Aruba pre-acquisition.”Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz has an underweight rating on Hewlett Packard Enterprise.""The Discover customer conference highlighted management confidence in GDP-like revenue growth as the company invests outside the data center in the $25B campus/edge market and machine learning,"" wrote Moskowitz in a report. ""HPE exhibited some flexibility on M&A, as there was commentary suggesting acquisitions can be pursued if done at the right multiples. Given the successes of Aruba, 3PAR, and ArcSight, we think HPE’s M&A track record has enough support to pursue a larger acquisition if it can move the revenue needle.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise on May 25 said it would spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC), a move that could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say.HP Enterprise shares finished 1% higher on the stock market today, hitting a record high for a fourth straight day.

GE stock is in a two-month consolidation with a 32.15 buy point but found resistance at the 50-day line Wednesday.

GE has traditionally made big iron equipment like railroad locomotives, jet engines and wind turbines. It's undergoing a major transformation as it connects those devices with its cloud-based Predix operating software platform.Bill Ruh, GE's chief digital officer and CEO of the company's GE Digital business, said in a recent IBD interview that the company aims to have its Predix OS used by every large industrial company in the world.Predictive intelligence comes into play in Predix. Asked if that was the origin of the made-up word ""Predix,"" Ruh said, ""Absolutely. Deep machine learning is part of this. We couple it with physical machine models. Those are our secret sauce that differentiates us,"" from others creating software for the Industrial Internet of Things.

281,HP,"The entry of HP (HPQ) into the 3D printer market is a disruptive force against 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), but it's not an overwhelming slam, as the two market leaders have time to react, say analysts.HP's entry is a ""negative"" for 3D Systems and Stratasys, but it's ""been expected and the real competitive impact could take years to develop,” wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg in a research note late Tuesday.The long-awaited entry of HP into the 3D printer market began Tuesday, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK), ProtoLabs (PRLB) and Materialise (MTLS). HP said the printers are 10 times faster and half the cost of current 3D printing systems. HP is offering two 3D printers, one for prototyping and the other for prototyping and short-run manufacturing needs.HP has vast resources and a strong desire to turn 3D printing into a growth business, Twigg wrote. “The technology could be disruptive, and customers have shown a high desire to partner with HP on the development of the printer,” he said.The HP announcement is a “modest positive” for Materialise, a 3D printer maker that is partnering with HP on software and other areas, Twigg said. It’s also a modest positive for ProtoLabs, which focuses on the commercial market and offers industrial 3D printing as a service.Though not a direct competitor, Proto Labs is a close peer to 3D Systems and Stratasys and can quickly adopt HP printers if it makes economic sense, as Proto Labs is building out its additive manufacturing service bureaus.Sales of 3D printers totaled $5 billion last year, according to HP. It expects to ship and recognize 3D printing revenue by the Oct. 31 end of its fiscal 2016,  and ramp up the business in fiscal 2017. But HP does not expect 3D printing revenue to make a material revenue contribution in either year, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a research note.HP’s new lineup poses a threat to 3D Systems and Stratasys in price and speed, but the threat is not overwhelming, said Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen.“We do believe the aggressive pricing HP is promoting could cause pipelines to shrink over the next couple quarters as customers review HP’s printing capabilities,” Jensen wrote in a report. But select printers from 3D Systems and Stratasys “are better in certain applications,” he said.3D printing technology is being increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities. The market for 3D printers, including supplies, will grow 33% to $7.3 billion and will approach $10 billion in 2017, according to Wohlers Associates, which provides technical, market and strategic analysis on the 3D printer market.HP stock fell a fraction on Tuesday but was up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 11.50. HP stock has been below its 50-day line most of this month. 3D Systems stock, up nearly 1% Tuesday, was down more than 3% Wednesday afternoon, and.

282,HP,"Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system increased its market share among PCs on the internet in May as the company continues to prod users of older operating systems to take advantage of a free upgrade offer.The percentage of personal computers on the internet using Windows 10 rose to 17.4% in May from 15.3% in April, research firm Net Applications reported Wednesday. The operating system, released 10 months ago, ended 2015 with nearly 10% market share.Microsoft is offering Windows 10 as a free upgrade to users of Windows 7 and 8 machines, but that deal ends on July 29. With sales of new PCs on the decline, Microsoft has been relying on free upgrades to boost the market share for its latest PC operating system.Windows 10 is the second-most-popular PC operating system in use after Windows 7, which had 48.6% market share in May.Versions of Microsoft's Windows OS ran 89.7% of the PCs on the internet in May, Net Applications said. Apple's (AAPL) Mac OS was second with 8.5%, followed by Linux with 1.8%.In recent months, Microsoft has been trying to spur Windows 7 and 8 users to upgrade with a free download. Some journalists have accused Microsoft of using dirty tricks more typical of malware to get people to upgrade.Brad Chacos, senior editor of PCWorld, said Microsoft used deceptive pop-up alerts to trick users to download and install Windows 10. Forbes contributing writer Gordon Kelly said the Windows 10 upgrade tactic is ""borderline malware.""Tech writer Paul Thurrott said Microsoft’s actions with its Get Windows 10 advertisement are a violation of trust that is indefensible. Users who clicked the X on the pop-up ad to close the window were given the upgrade automatically, he said.In a blog post on May 3, Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, said Windows 10 was on 300 million active devices worldwide.Microsoft shares were down 0.3% at the close Wednesday to 52.85.RELATED:HP Inc.

283,HP,"The surprise move by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to spin off and merge its enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) could put pressure on IBM (IBM) to respond, analysts say.Shares in Hewlett Packard Enterprise rose 6.7% to 17.34 on the stock market today after HPE late Tuesday announced the tax-free spinoff of its services business. HPE also reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings, but EPS was still down 2% year over year.“We believe the HPE Services plus CSC transaction will cause Xerox (XRX) services to be looked at as an acquisition target, as well as put pressure on IBM to consider making acquisitions in its services business,” Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report.The combination of HPE’s enterprise services business and Computer Sciences will have about $26 billion in annual sales. The deal is expected to close in March 2017.Jason Kupferberg, analyst at Jefferies, says the HPE-CSC deal has merit.“We believe the combined firm will trail only IBM Global Services and Accenture (ACN) in terms of global IT Services revenue,” Kupferberg said in a report. “While neither CSC or HPE enterprise services are industry growth leaders and have been in turnaround mode, we see strategic rationale for the merger, given the complementary vertical exposures (CSC strong in insurance, health care and banking, with HPE enterprise services known for pharmaceuticals, transportation, and telecom.)”Hewlett-Packard split into two publicly traded companies last November, with HP Inc.

And he said Pure Storage has emerged as the largest and fastest-growing provider of flash-based storage technology “that we believe remains well positioned to grow 60%-plus this year, driven by share gains in a shrinking storage market.”IBD Take: Splunk ranks No. 4 in its group. Learn why at IBD Stock Checkup.Splunk provides software for machine-to-machine data analytics that companies use to attain real-time intelligence. The consensus on Splunk is for revenue of $174.1 million for its fiscal Q1 ended on or near April 30, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. That would be an increase of 38.5% year over year, maintaining its double-digit growth rate going back more than four years.Analysts expect a 2-cent loss per share minus items, vs. a 1-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter and an 11-cent profit in the previous quarter. Splunk is set to report after the market close Thursday.""We remain bullish on the prospects for Splunk to grow into a $1 billion-plus revenue franchise based on a differentiated software,” Bracelin wrote of the company that posted revenue of $668 million for fiscal 2016 ended Jan. 31.RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg has an outperform rating on Splunk stock and a price target of 60.Splunk shares ended trading up 1.6% to 53.71 in the stock market today.

288,HP,"Western Digital (WDC) on Tuesday received a price-target hike to 50 from 45 and an upgrade to outperform from market perform by Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman.The moves comes two days before Western Digital is slated to give new guidance that will include its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition last week, creating a big competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage. The company has said it would update its guidance after the market close Thursday for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1.Ackerman says while he expects the SanDisk acquisition to dilute earnings through 2017, “We think the stock should start to work higher from here, as Western Digital’s updated guidance should act as a positive catalyst and help eliminate uncertainty.""Western Digital stock finished trading up 4.5% to 42.28 in the stock market today. However, the stock is down 47% since the acquisition was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up 20% since then.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015, with $14.5 billion from Western Digital. It’s the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital's year-over-year revenue has fallen for six straight quarters. That’s largely due to lower disk drive sales in the slumping PC market and the migration of disk storage to chip-based storage in many products. Seagate's revenue has fallen for five straight quarters.“Now that SanDisk is subsumed into Western Digital’s operations, Western Digital now morphs from an enterprise highly exposed to the cannibalization of next-generation storage into a media agnostic, vertically integrated data storage provider capable of generating mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth,” Ackerman wrote.He said the top 10 customers shared between Western Digital and SanDisk include Best Buy (BBY), Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ)“With SanDisk, Western Digital can now more effectively service both enterprise and hyper-scale customers and capitalize on the explosion of data creation that should double every two to three years by 2020,"" Ackerman wrote.

290,HP,"Two years after Microsoft (MSFT) purchased Nokia's (NOK) mobile phone unit, the software giant is moving to exit Nokia's entry-level feature phone business.Microsoft announced Wednesday that it is selling the business for $350 million to FIH Mobile, a Hong Kong-listed subsidiary of Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn, and HMD Global, a newly created company in Finland that has licensed Nokia's brand and intellectual property.Microsoft said it will continue to develop Windows smartphones, such as its Lumia devices, and will continue to support third-party handsets from partners like Acer, Alcatel, HP Inc. (HPQ), Trinity and Vaio.Feature phones are low-end devices that have limited capabilities compared with full-fledged smartphones. Feature phones are targeted mostly at customers in emerging markets.Microsoft bought the Nokia handset business in April 2014 for $7.5 billion, a deal negotiated by Microsoft's previous CEO, Steve Ballmer, in September 2013. Microsoft wrote off the entire value of the deal in July 2015 when it recorded an impairment charge of $7.6 billion related to the Nokia assets.“Microsoft’s exit from the feature phone business is not at all surprising,” IHS analysts Ian Fogg and Daniel Gleeson said in a research report Wednesday. “The deal again highlights Microsoft’s continued failure in mobile.”Microsoft’s smartphone future is “up in the air” because the company hasn’t released any new flagship handsets for Windows 10 Mobile in a while, they said.Microsoft shipped just 2.3 million smartphones in the first quarter, down 70% from Q1 2015, IHS said.“Realistically Microsoft can hope to be no more than a bit player in the mobile phone market now,” Fogg and Gleeson said.The smartphone market is dominated by Apple's (AAPL) iPhone and Android-based devices from Samsung and others.Microsoft stock rose 0.6% to 50.81 on the stock market today, but has been trading below its 50-day line since its earnings release late last month disappointed.

291,HP,"3D printer maker Stratasys (SSYS) is set to report earnings before the open Monday, after archrival 3D Systems’ (DDD) report on Thursday showed continuing struggles for the sector.The consensus is that Stratasys will post Q1 revenue of $164.8 million, down 4.5% year over year and the third quarter in a row of declines.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a 4-cent per-share loss minus items, swinging from a 4-cent profit in Q1 2015, and marking the sixth quarter in a row of earnings deceleration.The Q1 earnings by 3D Systems showed a 5% drop in revenue to $152.5 million, nearly $4 million short of views. It was the company's fourth straight quarter of revenue deceleration. The company posted flat EPS ex items of 5 cents.Shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys were hammered in 2015, as both posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. Stratasys stock hit a six-year low of 14.88 three months ago and is up nearly 40% since then despite a six-day losing streak. Stratasys stock closed Friday at 21.06, down 1%.3D Systems has doubled since hitting a five-year low of 6 three months ago, but the stock has also fallen for that last six trading days. 3D Systems fell 3.1% Friday, to 13.16.But despite the struggles of the two market leaders, the 3D printing industry is stronger than it seems, say industry analysts who track the field. Global 3D printer revenue rose 34% last year to $3.3 billion and shipments rose 68% to 133,000 units, according to estimates from research firm Canalys.And globally, 3D printing technology is being increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities.But the 3D printer companies await a new, potentially major, rival, as HP Inc.

292,HP,"HP Inc. (HPQ) is making a play for the premium notebook computer market long dominated by Apple (AAPL). At a luxury products conference in Versailles, France, on Tuesday, HP introduced its Spectre notebook, which it billed as the world’s thinnest laptop.Spectre’s aluminum chassis is as thin as a AAA-battery at just 10.4 millimeters. That compares with 13.1 mm for Apple’s MacBook.Spectre has a full HD 13.3-inch diagonal edge-to-edge display and Bang & Olufsen sound. It is powered by Intel (INTC) Core i5 or i7 processors, depending on the model.It will be available for preorder online on April 25 starting at $1,169.99. It is expected to be in Best Buy (BBY) stores on May 22 starting at $1,249.99.HP also announced limited edition versions of its Spectre notebooks from designers Tord Boontje and Jess Hannah.“The HP Spectre is the thinnest notebook in the world, and unlike the majority of other super thin PCs on the market, this laptop doesn't compromise power or features,” said Kevin Frost, HP vice president and general manager for consumer personal systems, in a statement.The Spectre notebook weighs 2.45 pounds and has high-gloss copper accents that give it a jewel-like finish. It boasts up to 9.5 hours of battery life per charge.Also Tuesday, HP refreshed its Envy line of notebooks with screen sizes of 15.6 and 17.3 inches. The 15.6-inch Envy starts at $679.99.

293,HP,"Take your eye off iconic copier maker Xerox (XRX) for too long -- heck, Xerox stock had done little more than fall since December 2014 -- and you would have missed its run-up to Tuesday's eight-month high at 11.39, up 34% since touching a nearly three-year low in January at 8.48. Xerox stock closed Friday at 11.16, flat for the session.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha doesn't see much upside potential, giving Xerox a 12-month price target of 11 and a neutral rating in a research note issued Friday. He does see more first-quarter earnings in Xerox, modeling 1 cent more adjusted EPS than Wall Street's 23-cent consensus, which would be up 10% from the year-earlier quarter. Xerox is scheduled to release Q1 earnings before Monday's open.But Garcha sees slightly smaller sales than the $4.24 billion consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That Q1 consensus would be a 5.1% decline from 2015's Q1 sales and Xerox's 17th consecutive quarter of shrinking year-on-year revenue, albeit slower shrinkage than the 8% decline in Q4 and 10% contraction in Q3.The rise in Xerox stock may be tied to anticipation over its imminent split into two companies: the legacy copier/printer/office machine business and the business-process outsourcing (BPO) spinoff.Based on $18 billion in 2015 sales, down 8% from 2014, the business-machine side would wind up with about $11 billion a year in sales, and the outsourcing spinoff about $7 billion, Xerox CEO Ursula Burns said when she announced the split on Jan. 29, concurrent with the Q4 earnings release. Inspired by activist investor Carl Icahn, Burns said the breakup would unlock value in both companies. Icahn would get three seats on the new BPO board, while Xerox would get six.BPO sales, grouped currently as services under Xerox, is a ""show me story,"" Credit Suisse's Garcha said.""Management is trying to transition the business away from low-margin to more value-added business,"" he wrote in a research note. ""However, we think management has to show consistent improvement and deliver on results to regain investor confidence.""Garcha anticipates a Q1 decline of 5.4% to $2.4 billion in services revenue.As for the so-called ""document technology"" core hardware, software and document management businesses, Garcha estimates that about $1.6 billion of Xerox's annual cost of goods sold are ""yen-denominated,"" coming from the Fuji Xerox joint venture (75% owned by Fujifilm (FUJIY)). With the yen up about 9% year to date, foreign exchange ""will impact margins,"" but less than was earlier expected, Garcha said.For Q1, Garcha forecasts document tech segment revenue fell 12% to $1.6 billion.Not all of Xerox outsourcing will be part of the BPO spinoff. Document outsourcing, which fell 2% to $852 million in Q4 revenue, will stay with the larger portion of the split, a Xerox spokesman told IBD.Effective April 1, Xerox borrowed $1 billion unsecured from a consortium of seven banks to be repaid within a year or upon execution of the spinoff, whichever comes first. Xerox says the spinoff should be complete before year-end.With a market cap of $11.3 billion, Xerox is the fourth-largest member of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group, following Canon (CAJ), the newly reorganized HP Inc. (HPQ), and Fujifilm.Xerox carries a middling 66 IBD Compositing Rating. Its formidable BPO rivals, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and Infosys (INFY) rate better, with CRs of 75 and 80, respectively.
"
294,HP,"3D Systems (DDD) received a much-needed vote of confidence from an analyst report Thursday, sending shares of it and Stratasys (SSYS) rising on hopes the top two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound.Shares of both companies were hammered in 2015 as 3D Systems and Stratasys posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. In November, 3D systems announced that Avi Reichental had resigned as CEO and president after 12 years of leading the 3D printer pioneer. The company ran with an interim CEO until April 4, when 3D Systems announced it had recruited Vyomesh Joshi as CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ) -- formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.Optimism about Joshi's hiring anchored the positive report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan on Thursday. Mohan upgraded 3D Systems stock to buy from underperform and raised his price target to 26 from 11.3D Systems stock rose 10% Thursday to 18.28, hitting its highest price since June. The stock had touched a more than five-year low of 6 in January.Stratasys rose 5.9% to 29.35 and hit its highest point since October. In February, it touched a more than six-year low of 14.48.Smaller 3D priner makers Voxeljet (VJET) and ExOne (XONE) rose 8.6% and 7.6%, respectively, with ExOne achieving a nearly one-year high, and Voxeljet missing a five-month high by a penny.Merrill Lynch did not distribute the research report to the media, but according to a summary of the report from 24/7 Wall Street, Mohan wrote: “Our buy rating on 3D Systems is predicated on the strong likelihood that the new CEO will turn around the business through a new direction and strategy based on his experience as an executive of HP’s established printing business.”Mohan expects Joshi can boost earnings by improving operational efficiency and refocusing investments, “even while end-market demand remains subdued.”3D Systems and Stratasys struggled last year. 3D Systems reported 2% revenue growth in 2015, to $666 million. At Stratasys, revenue fell 7% to $696 million. Revenue for both companies, year over year, declined in each of the last two quarters of the year, ending a long string of double-digit gains for the pair.Terry Wohlers, president of Wohlers Associates, which provides technical, market and strategic analysis on the 3D printer market, says Joshi earned a strong reputation from his work at HP.“People have a high regard for his leadership,” Wohlers told IBD. “He can take 3D Systems to the next level.""Despite a challenging year, revenue from 3D printers, supplies and services overall rose 26% in 2015, to $5.16 billion, according to Wohlers Report 2016, the latest edition of an annual publication dedicated to 3D printing. This year, Wohlers forecasts the market will grow 29% to $6.7 billion, and that it will rise 31% to $8.8 billion next year.Still, Merrill Lynch aside, most analysts continue to take a cautious tone on 3D Systems and Stratasys, even after both reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings. Observers in general are not convinced of a full-scale rebound, even as 3D printing technology is increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities. And it's not just observers who are wary. Executive of both 3D Systems and Stratasys have used a cautious tone when talking about 2016.Wohlers is not among the cautious crew, at least when looking down the road a bit.“If you view the industry through the lens of investors and share price, you will have a distorted view of what’s happening in the 3D printer market,” he said. The long-term future of the technology, he says, is strong.“Some of the biggest corporations and brands in the world are making significant investments in 3D printing,"" Wohlers said. ""We see a tremendous amount of activity that is advancing the industry.”The 3D-printer believers include Nike (NKE) and General Electric (GE). Nike has said 3D printing has revolutionized the way it designs and manufactures footwear. GE has made big investments in 3D printing, which it calls additive manufacturing. GE used 3D printers to develop complex fuel nozzles for its next-generation jet engine, known as Leading Edge Aviation Propulsion, in a partnership with France-based Snecma.Lockheed Martin (LMT), Airbus (EADSY), NASA and United Technologies (UTX) are also becoming bigger users of 3D technology.While the boom in 3D printing is good news for Stratasys and 3D Systems, it has also attracted more competitors. In 2015, 62 manufacturers sold 3D industrial machines, up from 49 in 2014, says Wohlers.HP's entry is expected to ripple through the industry. UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, in a March 31 research note, partly pointed to HP when he rated Stratasys as a sell, with a price target of 19.“The stocks of Stratasys and 3D Systems have jumped on a sequential Q4 revenue increase and outlook for slightly up revenue in 2016. However, we are becoming more concerned about HP's entry later this year,” which could have a negative impact on the two industry leaders, he wrote.Troy Jensen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a research report on April 11 that he recently met with HP executives.“We believe HP is in the late stages of alpha trials and is planning a controlled launch within the next few months with a limited number of partners,” he wrote.HP has said its printers will be faster, more efficient and cost less than products currently on the market.Many 3D printer companies are based in Europe. Besides Germany's Voxeljet, they include EOS Manufacturing Solutions, a fellow German firm and one of the largest 3D printer companies, with a wide range of 3D printers. Others are Germany-based SLM Solutions, Belgium’s Materialise and Sweden-based Arcam.

295,HP,"Tesla Motors ignored the mild weakness seen among major market averages as the auto industry iconoclast sped ahead with another solid gain in solid volume.The stock shot forward more than 3% in early afternoon trading -- far better than the Nasdaq's slightly upward move. Tesla (TSLA) shares also got as high as 216.72, good for a two-month high. Tesla share volume was also running slightly above average. It trades on average 5.3 million shares each session, making it one of the most liquid names on the Nasdaq both in share volume and dollar volume.Meanwhile, in the stock market today, the Dow Jones industrial average also elbowed its way into positive ground, but was up only 0.2%. The Dow utility average scraped barely higher. But the S&P 500 eased 0.1% after rallying 1.1% last week for its fourth up week in a row. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.6%. Volume was running sharply lower on both major exchanges.Tesla continues to regain severely lost ground despite running large net losses in recent quarters. The gains are being fueled by positive analyst comments, including analysts at Robert W. Baird who on Monday noted that recent data points show Tesla accelerating production of its new Model X SUV, which ""should drive deliveries and margin expansion throughout 2016.""Baird analyst Ben Kallo also boosted his price target in Tesla shares to 300 from 230, meaning that he still sees at least 40% upside in the stock.Tesla is still showing technical weakness with a 21 Composite Rating and a 42 RS Rating out of a maximum 99 according to IBD Stock Checkup. But the stock has now charged ahead of its slumping 50-day moving average and is 25% below a 52-week peak of 286.65 -- a marked improvement from Feb. 9, when Tesla traded 51% below that high.While sales growth has downshifted from triple-digit-plus pace seen in 2013, the recent increases are still impressive. Over the past six quarters, revenue at Tesla has grown on average 44%. That's in huge contrast with the average 1.8% decline for GM (GM) over the same period and a 1.5% year-over-year gain for Ford Motor (F).Back to the broader market, oil and gas drillers paced the market downside, down more than 4% collectively. Yet the group is still up nearly 29% over the past four weeks. Helmerich & Payne (HP) retreated 4% in below-average turnover but is holding well above its 200-day line. April-expiration crude oil futures cooled Monday, down more than 4% amid news over the weekend that suggested Iran shows no willingness to cooperate with any production cuts in the near future.Gold mining stocks fell hard too, down 3% as a group. Seabridge Gold (SA), highlighted in a recent Industry Themes column, got slammed 9% in heavy trade but is still up nearly 10% past a 9.73 buy point.

296,HP,"Apple will revamp its iPhone lineup in 2017, according to a new note by Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities, according to various reports.The 2017 smartphone will have a curved glass body, similar to the iPhone 4/4s ""flat sandwich"" design, Kuo said, AppleInsider reported.  But instead of flat glass it will likely have curved glass front and back. The 5.8"" iPhone -- presumably the iPhone 8 -- will use AMOLED displays. While there have been widespread rumors that Apple would turn to OLED displays, Kuo had previously predicted that they wouldn't be used until after 2017.Organic light emitting diode displays are thinner and more power-efficient than liquid crystal displays. They also have higher color saturation and are more flexible than LCDs. Samsung, Motorola, LG, the Alphabet (GOOGL) Google Nexus and the upcoming HP Inc. (HPQ) HP Elite x3.The 2017 iPhone also will use some form of wireless charging, 9To5 Mac said, citing Kuo's note. It will also have some new biometric features, possibly facial or eye recognition.The 5.8-inch phone could replace the current 5.5"" size entirely if there is sufficient OLED supply, Kuo said. If not, it could be a new high-end model on top of the 5.5"" design. Apple also will have a 4.7-inch model in either case.The iPhone 7 due out later this year may not be radically different from the iPhone 6/6s, aside from being thinner and having no headphone port.

(HPQ) stock tumbled on Thursday, a day after the PC and printer maker reported in-line sales and earnings for its fiscal first quarter but signaled more challenges ahead.Shares were down more than 4%, near 10.30, in midday trading on the stock market today.At least four Wall Street analysts cut their price targets on HP stock after the company posted results.In response to continued sluggish PC and printer sales, HP management decided to accelerate its corporate restructuring actions. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company expects to cut 3,000 jobs this year instead of over a three-year period as originally planned.""We believe that management is taking the necessary steps to right-size its expenses and develop new products to drive profitable share gains,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a research report. She maintained her buy rating on HP stock but cut her price target to 13 from 16.BMO Capital Markets analyst Thanos Moschopoulos reiterated his market perform rating on HP stock but cut his price target to 12 from 13. ""We believe the tough road ahead will persist as PC and printer markets continue to shrink,"" he said in a report.For its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, HP earned 36 cents a share excluding items on sales of $12.2 billion, in line with forecasts. On a year-over-year basis, EPS and sales each dropped 12%. On a constant currency basis, factoring out foreign-exchange impact, sales slid 5%.For the current quarter, HP expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 35 to 40 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been modeling 39 cents, on sales of $11.9 billion. HP did not give a Q2 sales forecast.HP also reiterated its fiscal 2016 EPS guidance of $1.59 to $1.69 on a non-GAAP basis. Analysts had been targeting $1.60.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Rob Cihra said HP could have a tough time making its full-year EPS target unless it buys back more stock than planned. He rates HP as neutral, with a price target of 11.The PC market is a cyclical business at best and is in secular decline at worst, Cihra said. Meanwhile, the company's cash-cow printing business is facing declining sales in both hardware and ink supplies. New printing ventures like commercial A3 copiers/printers and 3D printers are unlikely ""to move the needle anytime soon,"" Cihra said.PCs accounted for 62% of HP's revenue in Q1, and printing brought in the remaining 38%. Printing accounted for 77% of operating profit, with PCs contributing 23% of the total.Personal computer revenue fell 13% year over year in Q1, while printing revenue dropped 17%. On a constant currency basis, PC revenue fell 6%, and printer revenue tumbled 11%. Printing supplies revenue dropped 14%, or down 8% in constant currency.""Fundamentals in the PC and printing industries continue to erode,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin said in a report. ""The pace of erosion in the printing segment, which represents 77% of profits, (is) problematic relative to expectations for profits to rebound in the second half. Until printing stabilizes, HPQ shares could remain at depressed levels.""“We operate in mature markets,” HP CEO Dion Weisler said on a conference call with analysts. “This is an environment where we know how to win, gain share and out-execute our competitors.”

300,HP,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock rocketed 15% in morning trading on the stock market today. Late Thursday HPE edged above earnings-per-share expectations for its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, met on revenue and roughly met views with its Q2 earnings guidance, while also promising to return more capital to shareholders.For Q1, the company posted EPS ex items of 41 cents, down 6.8% from pro forma earnings of 44 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. Sales fell 3% to $12.7 billion. For Q2, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents. It didn't give revenue guidance.""All in all, the headline news looks like a solid report from a top/bottom-line perspective,"" Daniel Morgan, a vice president of HPE shareholder Synovus Trust, told IBD via email.On Wednesday, the company filed with the SEC to change its pro forma figures for the year-earlier quarter, which it issued after its Nov. 1 split from the legacy Silicon Valley pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co.HPE contains the business software and services, servers, storage and cloud-migration operations of the old company, with the new HP Inc. (HPQ) taking the PC and printer business. HPE now has more freedom to battle broad-based business-technology providers such as IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).HPE changed its year-earlier figure for EPS minus items to 44 cents, from 48 cents. It didn't change its pro forma revenue figure.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected adjusted EPS of 40 cents for fiscal Q1, though it's unclear if that consensus estimate would have changed with the new pro forma figure. Analysts expected revenue of $12.68 billion.For Q2, analysts had modeled EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.3 billion.The company's fiscal 2016 EPS ex items guidance of $1.85 to $1.95 met the views of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. And HPE maintained its fiscal 2016 guidance on free cash flow -- cash from operations minus capital expenditures -- of $2 billion to $2.2 billion.HPE shares fell 2.2% to 13.60 Thursday. The stock, which debuted in early November, peaked Dec. 1 at 15.88.Looking for ways to speed growth and improve shareholder value, the Hewlett-Packard split came in the face of faster-growing competition from upstarts leading the way to cloud computing.Last week, HP Inc. said its Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.""During our first quarter as an independent company, we saw the progress that comes from being more focused and nimble,"" HPE CEO Meg Whitman said in the company's earnings release. Whitman also serves as chair of HP Inc. and had been CEO and chairwoman of the former Hewlett-Packard Co. before engineering the split-up.“We delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant-current revenue growth, and excluding the impact of recent M&A activity, we saw revenue growth in constant currency across every business segment for the first time since 2010,” she said.Revenue rose 4% year over year in constant currency, the company said.HPE CFO Tim Stonesifer said in the earnings release that the company will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1.The networking business was the clear winner last quarter, and in fact the only business that notched revenue growth. The company said its Enterprise Group overall rose 1% to $7.1 billion in revenue, with a 13.4% operating margin. Networking sales jumped 54% from the year-earlier quarter -- more than 60% in constant currency -- but storage revenue fell 3%, and tech services tumbled 9%.Also slipping were server sales, albeit by just 1%. Before the release, shareholder Morgan, of Synovus Trust, told IBD he was “looking for stabilization in areas of weakness (by) expecting strength in servers into next year, as cloud and Big Data growth spur purchases. Servers represents 48% of the Enterprise (Group) segment's revenue and was (up) 5% year-to-year last quarter.”HPE's separate Enterprise Services segment sales fell 6% to $4.7 billion, the company said. Infrastructure tech outsourcing sales fell 8%, while application and business services revenue slipped 3%.Software services fell 10% to $780 million. License revenue fell 6%, support fell 13%, professional services revenue contracted 7%, and software as a service (Saas) sales fell 9%.Financial services, which help customers pay for their purchases, fell 3% to $776 million.In its filing with the SEC on Wednesday, the company said the main differences with its new pro forma EPS number for the year-earlier quarter ""are related to cash acquired and debt incurred by HPE just prior to the distribution (of new shares to old shareholders). The primary differences between the previously provided figures and adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow are related to prepaids, deposits and liabilities associated with property, plant and equipment, pension obligations and income tax asset and liabilities that transferred to HPE from its former parent just prior to the distribution.""

301,HP,"One day before Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is slated to post fiscal Q1 earnings, the stock of half of the old computing pioneer Hewlett-Packard Co. rose 4.7% in the stock market today. The stock was doing what analysts expect it to do, outperforming the other half of the legacy company,  HP Inc. (HPQ), whose shares fell a fraction.The stocks, of course, reflect the market's interpretation of the companies' operational performance since splitting into two from the legacy corporation in November.  HP, which reported earnings last week, kept the PC and printer businesses -- and the old HPQ ticker. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the server, storage, networking, enterprise-software and cloud-migration businesses, seen as faster-growing endeavors, and kept the CEO, Meg Whitman (who in addition is chairwoman of HP Inc).Hardware and equipment-product sales comprise about 38% of Hewlett Packard Enterprise revenue, with services generating the rest.For the quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect HPE to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1. The company reports after the market close.HP Inc.'s Q1 EPS and sales each fell 12%, to 36 cents and $12.2 billion.For its first fiscal year ending in October, Hewlett Packard Enterprise expects EPS minus items of $1.85-$1.95, up from the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015, on revenue of $50.81 billion, down 2.5% from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015. Analysts have modeled $1.87 and $50.73 billion.""We like HPE because decent execution should be sufficient to move the stock higher,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a February research note.  ""We believe growth in servers, networking and storage, stabilization in high-margin technology services and continued improvement in the Enterprise Services margin should help close the gap between the current P/E of 7x and our target of 10x.""Storage head Manish Goel, as well as a few of our industry sources, say that HPE is taking business from Dell/EMC (EMC) during their proposed merge.  Still, we think it's time for Meg Whitman to provide a vision for the company. IBM (IBM) has cognitive computing.  What does hardware-heavy HPE want to be in 3-5 years and what will be its differentiation?""Nomura doesn't cover HPE, analyst James Chen advised IBD Wednesday, but he and colleague Jeffrey Kvaal are watching closely as HPE competes with companies that Nomura does cover, such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Arista Networks (ANET).Nomura said it expects 3% sales growth for HPE's enterprise group this fiscal year, compared with Cisco and Juniper's guidance ranges of 3% to 6%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise's ""projected growth rates are not likely to threaten networking incumbents, but don’t imply much share loss either,"" the Nomura analysts said in a research note.HPE's hybrid cloud business competes with IBM, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Cloud Platform services.Big Data startup Hortonworks (HDP), the Hadoop developer, on Tuesday said it would collaborate with HPE on the use of Apache Spark, making use of shared memory in HPE enterprise environments.UBS analyst Mulinovich, in his February note, said that ""upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock. . . .  Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016.""Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock is 12.5% off its Dec. 1 record high of 15.88, while HP Inc. is 26.5% off its record high of 14.82, set Nov. 24.

302,HP,"Stocks showed modest losses in early trading Friday after a positive February jobs report.The Nasdaq lost 0.3%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1%.Jobs and company reports were the early drivers in the stock market today, with the Labor Department reporting nonfarm payrolls expanded by 242,000 workers in February. The department also revised January's job tally upward to 172,000 from 151,000. Consensus estimates targeted an increase to 190,000 new jobs in February.Private employers added 230,000 employees during the month, up from 182,000 in January and crushing estimates for an uptick to 183,000 new hires. Average hourly earnings dipped 0.1%, vs. a 0.5% gain in January and estimates for a 0.2% increase.Dow stocks were quietly mixed, with Goldman Sachs (GS) up 0.7% to lead the upside and Intel (INTC) taking the deepest dip, down 1%.Energy and mining issues once again massed near the top of the S&P 500 in premarket action, but two tech names led the list: Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) soared 16% higher and Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 6% after reporting quarterly results late Thursday.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the cloud and enterprise service unit spun off from the HP mothership in November, reported fiscal Q1 earnings just above, and revenue in line with, analyst consensus views.  The November new issue ended Thursday's session in a three-month IPO base.IBD 50 stock Broadcom reported healthy fiscal Q1 beats on both its earnings and revenue line, in its first report since merging with Avago Technologies. The stock ended Thursday's session 1% below a 138.79 buy point in a double-bottom base.At the low end of the S&P 500, H&R Block (HRB) refunded 10%. The tax service and software provider reported late Thursday a deeper than expected fiscal Q3 loss and revenue fell more than expected.Another IBD 50 stock, firearms maker Smith & Wesson Holdings (SWHC), popped 5% in early trading.  The Springfield, Mass.-based company turned in its fiscal Q3 results late Thursday, with revenue and earnings topping expectations by wide margins. Earnings leapt 195%, revenue surged 61% and gross margins expanded to 41.1% vs. 33.6% a year ago. The stock ended Thursday less than 5% below a 26.64 cup base buy point.The mood overseas at the end of a strong week was positive, with most markets moving higher. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index posted the strongest gain, up 1.2% Friday, cinching a 4.2% gain in its third straight weekly advance. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3% Friday, enough to clear a 5.1% advance in its third straight up week.In Europe, the benchmark indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt all traded up around 0.9% near midday. For the week, the CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX were tracking toward gains of better than 3%. London's FTSE 100 traded up 1.7% vs. its week ago close.Image provided by Shutterstock.

303,HP,"Personal computer and printer maker HP Inc. (HPQ) continues to slump on diminished prospects for the PC market in 2016.HP stock on Thursday fell to its lowest level since it split from the former Hewlett-Packard on Nov. 1. HP shares were down 3% near 9 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, the stock fell as low as 8.92. HP had climbed as high as 14.82 post-split.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani on Thursday maintained his sector perform rating on HP stock but cut his price target to 11 from 13. He also lowered his estimates for HP’s fiscal 2016 “to reflect weaker market fundamentals.”“Recent PC-centric data points suggest to us that not just demand is soft, but there is also a continued PC inventory overhang, especially in Europe, that could negatively impact results in first half 2016,” Daryanani said in a report. “Similarly, we think both the print hardware and supplies businesses could have muted outlooks for fiscal 2016, based on Canon (CAJ) results/outlook and (foreign-exchange) movement.”HP is scheduled to report fiscal-first-quarter results after the market close on Feb. 24.HP executives have said the PC market will be challenging for several quarters but had expressed optimism for the second half of 2016. They had hoped Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system would help drive PC sales, particularly with enterprise customers, later in the year.""HP should see challenging growth dynamics through fiscal 2016 on foreign-currency translation headwinds, competitive industry pricing, and PC channel inventory issues,” Daryanani said.On Wednesday, Sterne Agee CRT analyst Rob Cihra reiterated his neutral rating on HP stock but cut his price target to 11 from 14.“While global PC demand remains weak and supply/demand negative starting calendar 2016, we actually believe HP’s PC inventories are in better shape than most, an ironic product of its weaker share in China,” Cihra said in a report. “But we still see a particularly weak start to the year.”Cihra is forecasting the PC market will unit declines of about 5% year over year in 2016, but HP could offset the industry decline through market share gains as the top-tier players continue to consolidate.The cash-cow printing business looks even weaker than PCs this year, Cihra said.On Tuesday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin maintained his sector weight rating on HP stock but lowered his estimates for HP for this year and next based on “eroding PC and printing fundamentals.”RELATED:Apple Bucks Declining PC Sales TrendHP Inc.

304,HP,"Stocks quickly turned slender gains to losses Thursday, navigating mixed influences from overseas markets, early economic data and a raft of quarterly results.The Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. The S&P 500 and the Dow struggled with fractional losses. Volume was unusually soft on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, suggesting large-scale investors were standing back from early trade.Today's stock market set out with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 recovering to narrow gains so far this week. The market's young uptrend is seeing some affirmative data points and has thus far managed to avoid distribution days -- days in which selling by institutional investors sends the market lower in rising volume. But a positive finish to the week would help bolster investor confidence.Europe's markets hung on to their early advances in afternoon trade, with the CAC-40 in Paris and London's FTSE 100 up more than 2% apiece.But a European rally and a positive surprise in January durable goods orders weren't enough to buck up investor confidence, as weekly jobless claims rose slightly more than expected, and the bulk of early earnings reports offered at least some disappointing news.The December Housing Price Index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency fit that same pattern, rising 0.4% -- good but below November's 0.5% increase and just missing consensus views for another 0.5% gain.Still, the Dow opened with two-thirds of its stocks positive. Nike (NKE) rose 1.5% to lead the index. Chevron (CVX) posted the widest loss, down 1.5%.Salesforce.com (CRM) topped the S&P 500 with a 10% advance. The cloud-based software leader posted Q4 results late Wednesday, with strong guidance drawing similarly strong support from investors. The advance stopped at the stock's 50-day moving average, which could present some resistance as shares attempt to climb the right side of a 37%-deep consolidation.Quanta Services (PWR) muscled 6% higher on above-forecast fourth-quarter results. HP Inc. (HPQ) dropped 7% following disappointing Q4 results.Among IBD 50 stocks, theater real estate investment trust EPR Properties (EPR) pared gains and was up more than 2% after an initial 5% surge. After Wednesday's close, the Kansas City, Mo.-based firm reported better-than-expected funds from operations, but a 7% revenue gain was just shy of estimates, and management lowered its guidance on full-year funds from operations. The move left shares in frustrated stasis, just below a 62.66 buy point.

306,HP,"Having just completed their first quarter since the Nov. 1 split of their former parent company, the stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the Big Data and hybrid cloud operations of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., has outperformed its sibling HP Inc., which retained the legacy personal computer and printer business.The new Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 2.5% in the stock market today, to 13.45. True, that's 15% off its all-time set Dec. 1 at 15.88, but HP Inc. (HPQ) is trading 33% below its post-Nov. 1 high of 14.82, touched Nov. 24. It fell 0.9% to 9.88 on Tuesday.""Upon the split we argued in favor of HPE over HPQ stock,"" wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research note Tuesday. ""Hewlett Packard Enterprise has momentum with expected slight revenue growth in constant currency and an improving operating margin in fiscal 2016. This outlook was reinforced on the last earnings call (Nov. 25).""In contrast, HP Inc. told investors it would be investing for long-term gain. Our initial issue was the unsustainability of printer margins, but then unit demand fell apart last quarter. We remain concerned that HPQ estimates could be too high.""For the fiscal first quarter ended Jan . 31, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the Enterprise company to report earnings down 17% to 40 cents per share on revenue down 2.7% to $12.68 billion, vs. a pro forma 48 cents on $13.03 billion in the 2015 Q1.Analysts expect the performance of HP Inc., the PC/printer company, to slide further than Enterprise, with Q1 earnings down to 36 cents on falling sales to $12.23 billion.For fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, the Enterprise company expects earnings of $1.85-$1.95 per share minus items, vs. the $1.84 pro forma earned in 2015.  It guided revenue to $50.81 billion, down from the pro forma $52.12 billion of 2015.Analysts expect 2016 EPS of $1.87 minus items on revenue of $50.68 billion.Hewlett Packard Enterprise and analysts expect profitability and sales to improve in 2017 and beyond.Reiterating a buy rating and 18.50 price target on Enterprise, Milunovich said: ""HPQ is slightly less expensive than HPE on all measures, but we prefer HPE's better earnings momentum. Even discounting HPE's segment P/Es by 20%-30% relative to comps results in an overall multiple of almost 10x and a price target of $18.50. The stock looks more expensive on current but inexpensive on normalized free cash, which we expect to be achieved in fiscal 2018.""UBS rates HP Inc. as neutral with a 15 price target.Meg Whitman, who remains chair of both companies, took the CEO title of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as she had with the former company, but named Dion Weisler CEO of HP Inc.Both companies are expected to report fiscal Q1 earnings this month.

But ""FireEye is cheap, despite having growth of 28%, vs. the peer average of 25%.""""While it is entirely possible that the company can provide 2016 revenue/billings outlook that is below consensus, we believe the pullback of shares from current levels is limited,"" he wrote in a research report.FireEye gets a very low IBD Composite Rating: 18 out of a possible 99.Cybersecurity Market GrowthNetwork sandboxing, FireEye's bread and butter, had a $600 million total addressable market (TAM) in 2014 and is expected to have a 24% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2017, Nandury wrote.FireEye's newer segments — intrusion detection/prevention, corporate endpoint and threat intelligence security, threat analytics and security information event management — have a combined TAM of about $9 billion, Nandury estimated.""In total, the TAM for FireEye is growing at 25% CAGR through at least 2018, providing the company with significant growth opportunity,"" he wrote. He expects FireEye to have ""years of high growth"" in the mid-20% range.Nandury also expects FireEye to catch more Fortune 2000 customers. Currently, FireEye serves 50% of the Fortune 500 and 35% of the Fortune 2000.""Given that FireEye is known to catch malware other vendors missed, we expect many of the Fortune 2000 companies to deploy FireEye's solutions eventually,"" he wrote.'A Very Attractive Potential Acquisition'Plus, FireEye ""could make a very attractive potential acquisition,"" Nandury wrote, noting that the company leads its universe in interception and remediation of advanced persistent threats (APTs).""We believe the cybersecurity industry is a consolidating industry,"" he added. ""Given that FireEye has one of the best technologies to defend against APTs, we believe it could be an attractive acquisition candidate for a variety of players in the industry.""Nandury lists Cisco Systems, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Symantec and Intel as likely acquisitive companies eyeballing FireEye.Between June 2006 and January 2014, 11 cybersecurity-oriented deals closed, Nandury wrote. Most of them are back-end heavy with six deals between 2011 and 2014.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

325,HP,"HP Inc. (HPQ) is making ""Star Wars""-themed personal computers, but the Force definitely wasn't with the PC and printer maker late Tuesday when it reported fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings.HP's PC and printer businesses brought in revenue of $12.66 billion in fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 31, down 14.2% year over year. The PC and printer businesses racked up earnings before taxes of $1.16 billion, down 18%.The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company also gave disappointing guidance.For the current quarter, its fiscal Q1, HP expects earnings per share minus items of 33 to 38 cents, vs. analyst expectations for 42 cents. On a GAAP basis, it is targeting EPS of 27 to 32 cents, vs. Wall Street's view of 38 cents.For fiscal 2016, ending Oct. 31, 2016, HP expects to earn $1.59 to $1.69 a share excluding items, where analysts were modeling for $1.71. On a GAAP basis, its EPS guidance was in line with forecasts, at $1.50 to $1.60 vs. expectations for $1.54.HP did not give sales guidance.HP stock plunged 14% Wednesday, to 12.64.Needham analyst David Rold downgraded HP stock to hold from buy on Wednesday.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um on Tuesday cut his valuation range on HP stock to 14.50 to 16, down from 16.50 to 18, but he continues to rate HP stock as outperform.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin reiterated his sector weight rating on HP stock, which he said was fairly valued between 13.50 and 14.'Consolidating Markets'The PC and printer markets are likely to be challenging for several more quarters, HP CEO Dion Weisler said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts.""Q4 was a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected,"" he said. HP remains a leader in two ""large, consolidating markets,"" he said.The PC market has been tough, especially in the consumer segment, because of elevated sales channel inventory, Weisler said.Also, Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system has yet to spark a rebound in PC sales.But on the commercial side of the PC business, HP achieved its highest market share position ever at 23.7%, Weisler said.""We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation,"" Weisler said. He pointed to the company's new lineup of enterprise and consumer PCs, including a Star Wars Special Edition Notebook PC made in partnership with Walt Disney (DIS) and Lucasfilm.The former Hewlett-Packard split into two companies on Nov. 1. HP Inc. sells personal computers and printers, while Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) sells information technology hardware, software and services to corporations and other enterprises. HP Inc. and HPE reported results together Tuesday, as Q4 was their last quarter together before their split.""Both companies are off and running,"" Meg Whitman, chairman of HP Inc. and chairman and CEO of HPE, said on the call. ""Each company has a clear, well-defined strategy and is well positioned to win in its respective market.""In Q4, HP's PC unit sales were down 12% from the year-earlier quarter, with desktops down 17% and notebooks down 5%. HP has walked away from volume PC deals that don't meet its profit margin targets, Weisler said.HP's printer hardware unit sales were down 17%, with commercial units down 23% and consumer units down 14%. Supplies revenue was down 10%.Speaking on CNBC on Wednesday, Whitman said HP Inc. performed well in a ""tough PC market.""While Windows 10 hasn't provided a catalyst yet for PC upgrades, she still says that will happen.""There's nearly 450 million PCs out there that are older than 4-1/2 years,"" she said. ""And at some point, our belief is that people are going to upgrade those PCs. And I think HP Inc. is well positioned when that happens.""Follow Patrick Seitz on Twitter @IBD_PSeitz and on Facebook.

327,HP,"3D Systems (DDD) missed with its Q1 revenue posted early Thursday, its third straight quarter of year-over-year declines in sales, as the 3D printer market resets expectations.Before the open, 3D Systems reported Q1 revenue of $152.5 million, down 5% year over year and missing the consensus of $156.3 million. Excluding the contribution of consumer products and services that the company no longer sells, revenue fell 2%.The company posted flat earnings per share minus items of 5 cents.3D Systems stock was down nearly 6%, near 14, in afternoon trading in the stock market today, and it touched a seven-week low.Vyomesh Joshi, named CEO last month, sees big market opportunities ahead.“I’ve spent the past month listening to and learning from customers, partners and employees,” commented Joshi said. “I will be focusing on improving quality, reliability and supply chain. The next phase for us is to develop a strategy to drive profitable growth with operational excellence and an appropriate cost structure.”Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly part of Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.In the company's earnings conference call, 3D Systems CFO David Styka said demand for professional 3D printers remained soft last quarter. Revenue from professional printers excluding desktop decreased 23%, on a 50% decline in unit sales.“The decrease in units was partially due to the availability gaps for new MultiJet Printers rolled out during the first quarter,” he said.CEO Joshi, on the call, repeated several times he was in a learning mode, but optimistic ahead.“The other important part that I am learning and that's the vertical approach where we want to go after health care, aerospace, automobile, and also higher education,” he said, “because, if you think about the universities, we need to get a lot of people trained in understanding the 3D market.”3D Systems did not give earnings guidance.It and and Stratasys (SSYS) are the two largest providers of 3D printers. Stratasys is set to report earnings before the market open Monday. Its shares were down nearly 3% Thursday afternoon.3D printer makers ExOne (XONE) and Voxeljet (VJET) are set to report earnings on May 11 and May 13, respectively, both before the market open.Needham analyst James Ricchiuti last week lowered his rating on 3D Systems to hold from buy, “as shares might be pricing in too much,” he wrote.“Notwithstanding solid sequential improvement in Q4 from the publicly traded 3D printing companies, we believe business remains challenging, compounded by the normal seasonal weakness experienced in the March quarter,” Ricchiuti wrote.
"
328,HP,"3D Systems (DDD) is set to report first-quarter earnings Thursday, followed by rival Stratasys (SSYS) next Monday, likely providing a clearer indication of whether the runup in both stocks this year -- or the more recent downturn -- is justified.The consensus on 3D Systems is for revenue of $156.3 million, down 3% year over year, and earnings per share minus items of 5 cents, flat, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys were hammered in 2015, as both posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. Stratasys stock, however, has nearly doubled since hitting a six-year low of 14.88 three months ago, and 3D Systems has more than doubled since hitting a five-year low of 6 three months ago.Both stocks, though, have faded in the past week. And 3D Systems shares were below 15, down 6%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Stratasys stock was down more than 4% Wednesday afternoon, below 22.The rise of both stocks most of this year was partly fueled by Q4 earnings from both companies that beat expectations, raising hopes the top-two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound. But 3D Systems and Stratasys executives took a cautious tone about the road ahead.3D Systems got a bounce when it announced Vyomesh Joshi as CEO on April 4. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly part of Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.Needham analyst James Ricchiuti last week lowered his rating on 3D Systems to hold from buy, “as shares might be pricing in too much,” he wrote.“Notwithstanding solid sequential improvement in Q4 from the publicly traded 3D printing companies, we believe business remains challenging, compounded by the normal seasonal weakness experienced in the March quarter,” Ricchiuti wrote.3D printer makers ExOne (XONE) and Voxeljet (VJET) are set to report earnings on May 11 and May 13, respectively, both before the market open.

329,HP,"It’s ""highly unlikely"" HP Inc. (HPQ) will acquire 3D Systems, says Citigroup, which downgraded both 3D Systems (DDD) and its rival Stratasys (SSYS) on valuation after their stocks jumped on Thursday.HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.3D System stock  lost 6.2%  in the stock market today, after rising 10% on Thursday. Stratasys stock tumbled 13.2%, easily negating a 5.9% rise on Thursday. Another 3D printer maker, ExOne (XONE), fell 8.45% Friday. HP lost 0.2%.IBD’s Take: How do shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys measure up? IBD Stock CheckupCitigroup analyst Kenneth Wong downgraded 3D Systems to sell and downgraded Stratasys to neutral.“(3D System) shares have nearly tripled since troughing mid-February and have doubled year-to-date, despite (3D printer) market conditions that remain unsettled. We believe the upside scenarios from operational efficiencies upside to take-out potential are overstated,” said Wong in a research note.3D Systems on April 4 named Vyomesh Joshi as its CEO. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP, formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split last year.“We expect Joshi to bring a fresh set of eyes to DDD’s strategic growth and profit initiatives,” Wong said. “Investors believe Joshi’s HP roots enhance the possibility of an HP acquisition of DDD. While we see how bullish investors might connect the dots here, (we) believe that an acquisition by HP is highly unlikely.”Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded 3D Systems on Thursday to buy on views that Joshi will spark a rebound at the company.Stratasys' stock run-up also raises valuation issues, said the Citigroup analyst.“We don’t believe ‘good enough results’ will be sufficient with the recent boost in sentiment, and with industry checks still soft, we believe near-term upside is limited,” said Wong. “Our conversations with those in the industry suggest unit volumes have held, but there has been a downshift in buying towards smaller lower priced systems.""Contrary to investor expectations, we still believe that under 'normal' operating conditions, SSYS can generate double digit margins.”

330,HP,"Carly, we hardly knew ye.A week ago, Carly Fiorina was in a good position to enjoy the sheen of respectability she had acquired. The former Hewlett-Packard chief had run a solid presidential campaign and established herself as an adroit debater who could cut Donald Trump down to size.Then she became Ted Cruz's vice-presidential ""nominee"" -- accepting a nomination Cruz had no authority to bestow. In a case of exceptionally bad timing, Fiorina hitched herself to Cruz at precisely the moment his candidacy began to implode. Fiorina's previous criticism of Cruz and her checkered record at HP were again in the news. And now, alas, so is her singing:I know two girls that I just adoreI'm so happy I can see them moreBecause we travel on the bus all dayWe get to play, we get to play.Fiorina sang these words to Cruz's two daughters in her ""acceptance"" speech. The eerie crooning, of the type heard in horror movies before something bad happens, made Fiorina a late-night sensation. ""It's like Disney gave the wicked stepmother her own song,"" Stephen Colbert observed.Musical sleuths identified the melody as Irving Berlin's show tune ""You're Just in Love"":Put your head on my shoulderYou need someone who's olderA rubdown with a velvet gloveThere is nothing you can takeTo relieve that pleasant acheYou're not sickYou're just in love.This selection by Fiorina -- she delivered the unsettling news that she has four verses to her song -- puts the ""old"" in Grand Old Party. It's from the 1950 musical ""Call Me Madam,"" in which the Ethel Merman character, an heiress and ambassador, comforts her young aide, a diplomat in love with a princess.Fiorina, 61, is the one taking orders from Cruz, 45, but their relationship is no less peculiar.It's not Fiorina's fault that news broke just after her ""nomination"" was announced that former House speaker John Boehner, still a popular figure in nearby Ohio, had called Cruz ""Lucifer in the flesh"" and a ""miserable son of a bitch."" Nor was it Fiorina's fault that Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Friday gave Cruz a tepid endorsement -- he said that he ""will be voting for Ted Cruz"" but that ""I particularly want to commend Donald Trump.""But if Fiorina picked investments the way she picked her candidate, you can see why HP stopped requiring her services. She bought Cruz at the peak, when polls showed him close in Indiana. But an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll Sunday found Trump up 15 points.And now Cruz and Fiorina have to explain all those things she used to say about him: that ""Cruz is just like any other politician""; that ""there's no honor in charging a hill that you know you can't take, only casualties, although Ted Cruz maybe got name recognition and money""; and that it was ""odd that Senator Ted Cruz did not renounce his dual Canadian citizenship until 2014.""Cruz now also has to defend Fiorina's record at HP, where she let go thousands and sent jobs to India and China. ""Will the Cruz-Fiorina team do the same thing to Indiana that she did to Hewlett-Packard?"" Fox News' Chris Wallace asked Cruz on Sunday.The treatment didn't improve for Cruz when he took questions from reporters Monday morning in Indiana: How can he possibly beat Trump in California? Would he drop out of the race before the convention in July?""I am competing to the end,"" said Cruz, reminding all of his endorsement from Pence -- and his running mate. ""I am so proud this week to be standing shoulder to shoulder with my vice-presidential nominee, Carly Fiorina.""But Fiorina was not standing at his shoulder later Monday, when he waded bravely into a group of Trump supporters outside his event. Cruz bravely tried to engage them in calm discussion. ""Donald Trump is deceiving you. He is playing you for a chump,"" Cruz said.The Trump supporters taunted Cruz: ""Do the math. ... Time to drop out. ... You are the problem, politician. ... Where's your Goldman Sachs Jacket? ... Lyin' like you always do. ... Are you Canadian?""If Cruz hadn't established himself as a singularly unlikable candidate, one could almost have felt sorry for him in that moment. He needed urgently for Fiorina to sing more Ethel Merman:They think that we're through, but baby,You'll be swell! You'll be great!Gonna have the whole world on the plate!Starting here, starting now,Honey, everything's coming up roses!

331,HP,"With a strong leap in the stock prices of 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), some analysts question if the rise was too far too fast.Needham analyst James Ricchiuti on Tuesday lowered his rating on 3D Systems to hold from buy, saying further upside in the stock over the near term will be challenging. He says the turnaround at 3D Systems should be more gradual than the market is anticipating.It follows a recent downgrade of 3D Systems and Stratasys from Citi based on stock price valuations of both companies.Shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys were hammered in 2015 as both posted quarter after quarter of disappointing earnings and sales. This year, Stratasys stock has nearly doubled since hitting a six-year low of 14.88 three months ago. 3D Systems has nearly triple since hitting a five-year low of 6 three months ago.“3D Systems shares are now above our 12-month target price,” Ricchiuti wrote in a research note. “With the stock trading at 32 times our 2017 EPS estimate, the market appears to be pricing healthy upside to estimates.”The rise of both stocks were partly fueled by the Q4 earnings reports of both companies that beat expectations, suggesting the worst might be over and raising hopes the top two 3D printer makers are poised for a rebound. But that wasn’t the message that 3D Systems and Stratasys tried to signal, as comments from company executives during the conference call were of a cautious tone about the road ahead.3D Systems got a further bounce when it announced Vyomesh Joshi as CEO on April 4. Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP plans to enter the 3D printer market this year.3D Systems stock was near 18, down 2%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Stratasys was trading near 26, up a fraction.3D Systems is set to report first-quarter earnings on May 5 and Stratasys on May 9, both before the market open.The consensus on 3D Systems is revenue of $156.3 million, down 3% year over year, and earnings per share minus items of 5 cents, flat, as polled by Thomson Reuters. Stratasys sales are seen rising 4.5% to $164.8 million as it swings to a 4-cent per-share loss from a 4-cent profit.""Notwithstanding solid sequential improvement in Q4 from eight of the publicly traded 3D printing companies, we believe business remains challenging compounded by the normal seasonal weakness experienced in the March quarter,"" Ricchiuti wrote.

332,HP,"Dell retook the U.S. personal computer shipment lead for the first time in over six years in Q1 as former No. 1 HP Inc. (HPQ) stumbled, market research firms Gartner and IDC reported late Monday.HP had been the top PC vendor in the U.S. for 25 consecutive quarters, IDC said. Dell shipped 3.48 million PCs in the U.S. in Q1, giving it a 25.6% market share, while HP shipped 3.44 million units for a 25.3% market share, IDC said. It was Dell's first No. 1 ranking in the U.S. since the third quarter of 2009, IDC said.Dell increased its domestic PC unit shipments by 4.2% year over year in the first quarter, while HP's U.S. shipments declined 14.1%, IDC said.Overall PC shipments in the U.S. fell 5.8% in Q1, IDC said. No. 3 vendor Lenovo increased its shipments by 21.1% to 1.92 million units, giving it a 14.1% market share. No. 4 vendor Apple (AAPL) grew its shipments by 5.6% to 1.76 million units, giving it a 13% market share.Gartner (IT), which measures the PC market differently from IDC, said Dell was No. 1 in the U.S. in Q1 with a 26.3% market share, followed by HP with 23.7%.On a worldwide basis, PC shipments fell 11.5% to 60.6 million units in the first quarter, IDC said. Gartner put the decline at 9.6%. Gartner said it was the sixth consecutive quarter of global PC shipment declines.Consumer PC sales remain weak, hurt in part by free upgrades to Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system. Enterprise customers are still mostly testing Windows 10, but adoption by businesses is expected to start in earnest later this year.Lenovo was the top PC vendor worldwide with a 20.1% market share in Q1, IDC said. HP was in second place with a 19.2% market share, followed by Dell (14.9%), Apple (7.4%) and Asus (7.2%), IDC said.

BofA sees Joshi improving profit margins by going after 3D's ""bloated cost structure.""""The past several years of our negative stance have been predicated on the company's poor M&A strategy, choice of assets that did not have complete exposure to 3D printing, increasing investments in low margin areas like consumer (now exiting part of low end consumer) and an aggressive investment and channel strategy that led to a bloated cost structure and revenue headwinds,"" BofA analysts wrote.BofA raised 3D EPS targets for 2016 by 2 cents to 30 cents, 2017 EPS revised up by 18 cents to 57 cents and 2018 EPS revised up to 71 cents from 43 cents.Smaller 3D printer makers ExOne (XONE) and Voxeljet (VJET) also rallied Thursday.

366,HP,"Highly rated small cap Super Micro Computer (SMCI) lowered its third-quarter estimates after the close Thursday and then watched its stock crash Friday.Super Micro stock plunged 20% in the stock market today, to 26.79. The stock had made a breakout at 33.89 from a cup-with-handle base, but that breakout has now failed.Scheduled to announce Q3 earnings after the close April 28, Super Micro founder and CEO Charles Liang said late Thursday in a preannouncement that the quarter ended March 31 turned out ""weaker than forecast due to weaker demand with some large customers and the channel than we anticipated. January and February were particularly soft, while March showed improved momentum. Storage and data center continued to grow.""Except for the reference to March, there was ""little detail on going-forward expectations,"" Needham analyst Richard Kugele said in a Thursday research note. ""We see great risk to the company's goal of 20%-plus annual revenue growth and expect the stock will return to the penalty box, at least until further clarity is provided on the April 28 call.""IBD's Take: Super Micro had been hot, but a breakout failed. How does the stock stack up? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupKugele, though, said he still likes the company in the long term and that it's outpacing the broader server/storage market. He reiterated his buy rating and 36 price target on Super Micro.Super Micro said Q3 revenue will come in at $530 million to $533 million instead of $530 million to $580 million. It now sees non-GAAP EPS of 33 cents to 35 cents vs. earlier guidance of 43 cents to 53 cents. Wall Street consensus had been 49 cents minus items, up 4% from the year-earlier quarter, and sales of $557 million, up 18%, Kugele said. Thomson Reuters on Friday cited consensus of six analysts on non-GAAP EPS of 46 cents and of seven analysts on revenue of $552 million.The preannouncement offered no guidance. Thomson Reuters put consensus on the current fiscal Q4 EPS minus items at 66 cents on revenue of $650 million vs. 57 cents on $574 million a year earlier.With an IBD Composite Rating of 98, Super Micro Computer had ranked as the best among all members of IBD's Computer-Hardware/Peripherals industry group. But its CR has now fallen all the way to 81. It's also one of the smallest, with a market cap of $1.35 billion. The largest, Canon (CAJ), with a $32.6 billion market cap, carries a 34 CR, followed by newly reorganized HP Inc.

368,HP,"The entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) into the 3D printer market is seen as creating problems for 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), causing an analyst to issue a warning about the two market leaders.While 3D Systems and Stratasys are the two largest providers of 3D printers, HP (formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split) will gain market share over time, wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research note. He reiterated a sell rating on Stratasys with a price target of 19. UBS also has a sell rating on 3D Systems and a price target of 9.Stratasys stock was up almost 3%, near 26, during afternoon trading in the stock market today. 3D Systems was near 15, down a fraction.The stocks of 3D Systems and Stratasys, having collapsed over the past two years due to numerous problems, are up sharply since recently hitting bottom. Despite the improvement and expectations of a turnaround, Milunovich believes that HP will be a disruptor. He says that HP expects to formally announce its first product in a few months, with availability by year end.“We expect HP to discuss betas with large industrial companies and provide impressive performance metrics,” Milunovich wrote. He also said, “(HP) indicates little interest in acquiring either Stratasys or 3D Systems, which surprises us.""He believes that HP could gain broader technology, patents, channels and, with 3D Systems, metals capability, via an acquisition of one or the other.HP has also said that it plans to avoid the consumer market, where 3D Systems and Stratasys have flailed.3D printer revenue, including supplies, is expected to top $7 billion this year and approach $10 billion by 2017. Despite the struggles of 3D Systems and Stratasys, the 3D printing industry is stronger than it seems, say industry analysts who track the field. Among companies with big investments in 3D technology are Nike (NKE) and General Electric (GE). Nike has used 3D printers to develop several sport shoes, while General Electric uses them to produce advanced jet-engine fuel nozzles.

369,HP,"Personal computer and printer maker HP Inc.

During the regular session Wednesday, HP climbed nearly 5% to 10.82.HP earned 36 cents a share excluding items on sales of $12.2 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 31. On a year-over-year basis, EPS and sales each dropped 12%. On a constant currency basis, factoring out foreign exchange impact, sales slid 5%.For the current quarter, HP expects non-GAAP earnings per share of 35 to 40 cents, or 37.5 cents at the midpoint. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had been modeling for HP to earn 39 cents a share ex items on sales of $11.94 billion in its fiscal second quarter. HP did not give a Q2 sales forecast.HP also reiterated its fiscal 2016 EPS guidance of $1.59 to $1.69 on a non-GAAP basis. Analysts have been targeting $1.60 EPS for the full year.PC and printer sales are mired in a prolonged slump. HP is the No. 2 maker of PCs worldwide with 19.9% market share by unit shipments in the fourth quarter, according to research firm IDC. Lenovo is No. 1 with 21.4% market share, IDC says.“We have a clear strategy that leverages our strengths, and we are focused on execution, taking cost out of the business and delivering innovations that will amaze our customers and partners,” HP CEO Dion Weisler said in a statement. “Although we have some tough quarters ahead, I am confident in the future.”

370,HP,"This week marked an important anniversary: The current bull market is now seven years old. That's many, many moons of watching stock indexes march higher and pocketing sizable returns on your hard-earned investments.Caution returned to the market in 2015, as the S&P 500 started to trade sideways. Stocks are taking a bit of a breather this year too. Perhaps you're in need of one too.So take a moment to catch up on ETF winners of the current bull market. As the table below shows, they span a host of asset classes, from financials and preferred stocks to retail and midcaps.The very top performer out of 1,646 nonleveraged ETFs is -- are you ready for this? -- Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV), an ETF that targets the cheapest third of the S&P 500 index.A bull market brings to mind higher beta positions, with a stronger growth skew. Yet in the past seven years, the market has rewarded value-oriented characteristics slightly more so than growth, said Guggenheim managing director William Belden. That's helped RPV outperform.Value ETFs are generally considered to perform well over longer periods of time. ""Their greatest appeal is when the markets have gone both ways,"" Belden said.A closer look at RPV may be timely, as the market seems to have arrived at an inflection point for value stocks.RPV produced an average annual 30% return from March 10, 2009, to March 9, 2016. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gained an annualized 19% over the same period.SPY was also outpaced by Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), with an annual average return of 22.4%.For investors seeking to make a style-focused bet on the markets, six Guggenheim ETFs offer style purity. They invest in only those stocks in the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 with the strongest value and growth characteristics.Traditional cap-weighted growth or value indexes generally have some overlap between growth and value stocks.Guggenheim's ""Pure Style ETFs"" avoid the muddle in the middle, as Belden likes to say. They also weight stocks by the strength of their growth or value characteristics.With $693.9 million in assets, RPV holds a mere 111 stocks from the S&P 500. They're selected based on metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios.Top holdings now include electricity supplier NRG Energy (NRG), tech business HP Inc. (HPQ) and seeds processor Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan cautions that this is a risky ETF investing strategy.""The S&P 500 Pure Value Index was about 47% more volatile than the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Value Index, which tracks the cheaper half of the S&P 500, during the past decade,"" he wrote in October 2015. ""It has also tended to underperform during market downturns.""Belden points out RPV has rewarded investors willing to take on a little higher volatility.""It has a good risk-adjusted profile,"" he said. The expense ratio is 0.35%.Most investors tend to combine RPV with an S&P 500 ETF such as SPY to overweight value stocks. But RPV can also be combined with its sibling Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) for broad and well-diversified exposure to large-cap stocks.Growth investing and value investing are generally seen as being in favor in alternating periods. But the ""Pure Growth"" and ""Pure Value"" strategies have the potential to outperform at the same time, according to Guggenheim.""The combination of both might be an attractive core position as opposed to one that's more tactically oriented,"" Belden said.It's worth noting that all six Guggenheim's ""Pure Style"" ETFs ranked in the 100 top-performing nonleveraged ETFs in this current bull market.Image at top provided by Shutterstock.

(HPQ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to the largest tech merger ever in Dell/EMC (EMC).""Dell offered $67 billion in October to buy EMC.""That said, it has been a tough road for many of these traditional tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM), Cisco (CSCO) and HP, as investors have gotten used to seeing lackluster growth on a quarterly basis in light of the massive secular and company-specific challenges these mature tech vendors face,"" Ives said.""The lone bright star in this cloudy large-cap enterprise tech space has been Microsoft, which is gaining momentum into 2016, as (CEO Satya) Nadella has made some tough decisions ('ripping the Band-Aid' off Nokia, cost cutting, free Windows 10 download strategy) to put (Microsoft) on the yellow brick road to the cloud.""We believe the combination of the Dell/EMC deal, Amazon (AMZN) (Web Services') laser focus on the cloud and Nadella's 'golden child' success has put more heat in the kitchen for CEOs such as (IBM CEO Ginni) Rometty, (HPE CEO Meg) Whitman, (Oracle co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd), and (Cisco CEO Chuck) Robbins to change from their 'treadmill approach' heading into 2016 and to focus on M&A and/or organic growth initiatives.""FBR's top 10 merger-and-acquisition wish list for 2016, ""in no particular order,"" Ives said, are:• (1) Cisco and NetApp (NTAP),• (2) Cisco and FireEye (FEYE),• (3) IBM and Splunk (SPLK),• (4) IBM and Qlik Technologies (QLIK),• (5) HPE and Box (BOX),• (6) HPE and Qlik,• (7) Oracle and Verint (VRNT),• (8) Oracle and NetSuite (N),• (9) Microsoft and Imperva (IMPV), and• (10) Microsoft and Qualys (QLYS).""... we believe EMC/Dell has disrupted the landscape and will force many of these mature tech stalwarts to finally be more aggressive in 2016 instead of fretting about valuations, as they need to focus on putting fuel back in their near-empty growth tanks,"" Ives said.

402,HP,"Windows 7 PC users are refusing to switch to Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system even though it's being offered as a free upgrade.Microsoft released Windows 10 worldwide on July 29 as a free upgrade for one year to owners of Windows 7 and 8 PCs. (It skipped Windows 9 in its naming scheme.) While Windows 7 was well-received by users, people generally hated Windows 8 with its redesigned user interface optimized for touchscreens.Windows 10 has received mostly favorable reviews, but Windows 7 users have largely stayed put with their 6-year-old operating system, according to data from Net Applications. In November, 56.1% of PCs on the Internet were running Windows 7, Net Applications reported Tuesday. The figure has remained stubbornly high since the Windows 10 launch. It was 57.7% in August, 56.5% in September and 55.7% in October.Meanwhile, the percentage of Windows 8 PCs in use rose last month. Windows 8 accounted for 14% of PCs on the Internet in November, compared with 13.2% in October. In June, before the release of Windows 10, Windows 8 had 16% market share, Net Applications said.In the four months since its release, Windows 10 has grown to 9% market share as of November. In October, it had 7.9% share, Net Applications said.Windows 10 adoption also has been slowed by sluggish sales of new PCs, which come with the new operating system installed.Versions of Microsoft's Windows ran 91.4% of PCs on the Internet in November, Net Applications said. Apple's (AAPL) Mac OS was second with 7% share, followed by Linux with 1.6%.On Nov. 23, market research firm Gartner (IT) predicted a fast migration to Windows 10.""In the consumer market, a free upgrade coupled with broad legacy device support and automatic over-the-air upgrades ensures that there will be tens of millions of users familiar with the operating system (OS) before the end of 2015,"" Gartner analyst Steve Kleynhans said in a statement.

404,HP,"While investors applauded Hewlett Packard Enterprise's first quarterly performance as an independent company -- beating Wall Street estimates and driving its stock up more than 13% Friday -- some analysts and owners are pushing CEO Meg Whitman to compete harder.That means more aggressively taking on cloud enterprise leaders Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), and buying up software  rivals such as Workday (WDAY) or Salesforce.com (CRM), rather than directing cash to shareholders.""I think we need to give Meg a chance to see if she can take advantage of the opportunities in servers with the cloud migration led by Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft on the service and software side,"" said Daniel Morgan, vice president of Synovus Trust, which holds 251,971 shares of HPE, in a Friday interview with IBD.""Further, the 54% year-over-year growth in the Q1 2016 quarter in networking allows HPE to build more momentum in this space"" vs. rivals Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR), he said.""And finally as we discussed before, the huge opportunity to expand the software unit with its 17%-plus operating margins (enables) a large acquisition in the cloud space. Right now software is just 8%-10% of total HPE revenues.""Buying enterprise software rivals Salesforce or Workday specifically is ""a chance to make that unit significant by bringing it up to 20%-25% of revenues,"" he said. ""Post-split, Hewlett Packard Enterprise was supposed to be the growth portion of the Hewlett-Packard Co., (creating) a reinvigorated growth company.""Nevertheless, happy with HPE's earnings performance issued after Thursday's market close, investors bid up its stock up 13.5% to close at 15.44 in the stock market today. That's less than 3% below its Dec. 1 high since splitting from its parent Nov. 1.For now, HPE stockholders interested in growth of any kind will need patience because the company is still shrinking, despite the slight Q1 beat.Hewlett Packard Enterprise reported earnings of 41 cents per share in the fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, on sales down 3% to $12.72 billion vs. pro forma figures from a year earlier. The results slightly beat the average view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, which called for EPS of 40 cents on sales of $12.68 billion. The non-GAAP 41 cents EPS is down from 47 cents a year earlier. (However, if HPE had been a standalone company at the time, Q1 2015 adjusted EPS would have been 44 cents, the company said in a March 1 note.)That's pretty much as planned, with HPE not projecting much growth until fiscal 2018. For Q2 ending in April, HPE expects EPS ex items of 39 cents to 43 cents.  Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Q2 EPS ex items of 42 cents on sales of $12.297 billion before Thursday's earnings release, but on Friday, the revenue consensus was revised up to $12.332 billion.For the entire fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31,  analysts  polled by Thomson Reuters projected $1.87 EPS ex items for fiscal 2016 ending Oct. 31, on revenue revised up Friday to $50.805 billion. HPE earlier had modeled $50.81 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016, down 2.5% from a $52.12 billion pro forma in fiscal 2015.The slightly smaller half of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., now called HP Inc. (HPQ), kept the legacy PCs, printers and ticker. HP Inc. lifted 0.6% to 11.18 Friday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise kept the enterprise software, servers, networking and financial services businesses.To encourage patience among Hewlett Packard Enterprise shareholders, CFO Tim Stonesifer said HPE will “return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders” in fiscal 2016, after devoting $1.3 billion to share repurchases and dividends in Q1. In ""addition,"" Stonesifer said, shareholders will receive a ""majority"" of proceeds from the sale of a 51% stake in its Chinese server and storage business to Tsinghua Holdings, valued at $2.3 billion at the time the deal was announced last May. The transaction was supposed to be done by February, but Whitman said regulatory delays have pushed back closing to May, after which the cash will flow to shareholders.To UBS analyst Steve Milunovich, who complained in the post-earnings-release conference call that HPE shares were priced too low, Whitman chuckled: “We appreciate that, which is why we’re backing up the truck” to buy back more shares, which helps boost the price.Whitman advised analysts that by investing internally and encouraging organic growth “you don’t end up with a Frankenstein of architecture"" as the company would risk doing by  growing through acquisitions. She cited HPE for pursuing both paths.“Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT (Internet of Things), all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems.” Aruba Networks is a networking leader in mobile enterprise that the old Hewlett-Packard agreed to buy last March for about $3 billion, strengthening the new HPE's rivalry with Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks.As for ""taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace,"" Whitman said, ""we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's (IBM) sale of their server business to Lenovo. ... We have a big opportunity to go take (merging) Dell and EMC (EMC) business, much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo.”She told CNBC on Friday that ""in the last quarter, we had about 107 deals that we actually took from Dell/EMC.""She also told analysts that HPE has become the ""leading infrastructure provider for SAP (SAP) HANA (application server) with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor.”In the cloud, she said, ""following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials.”It just wasn't enough for Needham analyst Richard Kugele, who chided the company in a research note issued Friday, arguing that the $2.3 billion windfall from Tsinghua should be spent on organic or M&A growth, not shareholders' short-term benefit.""We had hoped that post-split, HPE would be able to focus on getting its house in order and leverage its cash and balance sheet to buy/invest in solutions that solve their product gaps,"" Kugele said. ""Instead, the company seems intent on continuing financial engineering by doubling its cash return to shareholders (including the pending Tsinghua cash). In our view, this creates no sustainable value for the company or its investors but merely provides a floor for the stock during a period of poor enterprise spending.""With no material growth, revenue improvement or product strategy to build a buy thesis around, we reiterate our hold rating on the stock.""Said Morgan, the Synovus Trust portfolio manager who wants to give Whitman time to execute: ""I did hear HPE management touting its share repurchases and FCF (free cash-flow) generation capability on the call. And this is very reminiscent of when Mark Hurd was leading HPQ  (the former Hewlett-Packard Co.) and grew the share price through financial engineering and not new product growth.""Hurd is now co-CEO of Oracle (ORCL), one of HPE's toughest software rivals, and another legacy giant growing slowly.

407,HP,"Avago Technologies has been one of the hottest stocks in tech this year, thanks in no small part to the chipmaker's ties with the world's top-valued company, Apple.Now Avago's (AVGO) ties to Apple (AAPL) will strengthen when the former takes over chip company Broadcom (BRCM). In a deal valued at $37 billion, the new entity will take the Broadcom name, and Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan will head the combined firm.The two complement each other as Apple contractors, supplying chips to different parts of Apple's iPhone and other smartphones — Avago makes radio frequency chips and filters, and Broadcom produces controller and Wi-Fi combination chips. Set-top boxes and cars also use Broadcom chips.Avago expects the Broadcom deal to close early in the first calendar quarter of 2016. Avago has already been working on integration plans to get a head start on day one.""Avago has done a great job in integrating companies and cutting costs out of operations,"" analyst Thomas Diffely of D.A. Davidson told Investor's Business Daily.Diffely said in the shorter term, Avago will benefit from hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings from the Broadcom merger as it integrates the two operations.""Over time, Avago will have a more integrated chip solution for the mobile consumer in particular,"" Diffely said.HP OriginsAvago got its start in the 1960s as the semiconductor arm of Hewlett-Packard, now HP Inc. (HPQ). It later became part of Agilent Technologies (A) before private equity investors bought the business in 2005 and took it public in 2009.Shares have climbed steadily since that IPO, which was priced at 15. Avago's shares now stand at roughly 149, after surging 90% in 2014 and another 47% this year.Revenue also has been on a strong uphill run, more than quadrupling from $1.5 billion in 2009 to $6.9 billion in 2015. The 2015 number is up 60% from 2014.In addition to being used in Apple's new iPhone 6s and other smartphones, Avago's chips are found in data networking, telecom equipment and industrial uses. The firm's two biggest business segments, in wireless and networking, have grown through a string of acquisitions in recent years.Five Firms In Two YearsIn the last two years alone, Avago acquired five companies, including data-center chipmaker LSI for $6.6 billion; PLX Technology, which makes integrated circuits; and most recently, the networking company Emulex.As Broadcom merges with Avago, revenue in 2016 likely will grow another 8% to $7.39 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But Avago still will trail No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) and fellow chip company and Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM).Avago singled out one customer for contributing more than 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter: Foxconn, the Chinese electronics contract manufacturer that rolls out iPhones for Apple.Slowdown SeenBut Avago's first quarter, which ends in January, is expected to see a seasonal slowdown in iPhones, a drop-off made more noticeable in the aftermath of the iPhone 6s launch and ramp-up. Avago expects wireless sales in the current first quarter to decline in the low-teens-percent range from the fourth quarter.Still, analysts don't seem worried for Avago's future.""Even if units are flat, Apple is still increasing content,"" Diffely said.Other handset makers trying to close the gap with Apple, such as Samsung and China's Huawei, will need advanced technology, he adds.""Bottom line, the need for advanced chips for these phones continues to rise,"" Diffely said.Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach expects a sharp acceleration in Avago's wireless business during the second half of 2016, aided by new capacity to handle new wafer sizes and higher dollar value content in premium filters due to rising LTE penetration and new wireless bands. (LTE is a high-speed wireless standard.)""Now that the quarter is out of the way and, importantly, numbers are intact, we see Avago handily outperforming into 2016,"" Hettenbach said in a note to clients following the fourth-quarter report.Enterprise Storage BoomMeanwhile, Avago's enterprise storage business has been performing ""rather amazingly,"" Avago CEO Tan said in the fourth-quarter conference call in early December. Revenue in that October-ending quarter was up 9% from the third quarter, despite soft demand.Enterprise storage accounted for 35% of total revenue in the quarter. That was nearly as much generated by the firm's biggest division, wireless communications, which made up 37% of the total and was up 10% from the previous quarter.Avago expects its enterprise storage business to maintain its momentum in the first quarter, with revenue still growing slightly from the fourth quarter, Tan said on the call.""We also believe we may be gaining share in this segment,"" he added.Hettenbach noted that product enhancements via acquisitions of LSI, PLX Technology and Emulex likely helped Avago's enterprise storage business.The company's much smaller wired infrastructure business showed 2% revenue growth from the third quarter and 7% year-over-year. The even smaller industrial segment saw a 10% decline from the third quarter and a 7% drop from the year-earlier period, with the Americas and Japan the weakest regions.Total revenue in the quarter rose 15% over the earlier year to $1.85 billion, while earnings climbed 26% to $2.51 a share. Gross margin moved up to 62% from 58%.Analysts estimate that 2016 earnings will rise 8% to $9.71 a share, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.

409,HP,"Initial jobless claims fell by 5,000 last week to 267,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average rose by 1,750 to 272,500, a three-month high.But by either measure, unemployment filings have held below 300,000 for almost the entire year, hitting a long-term low in July. Sub-300,000 readings normally signal booming job gains, but not in this economic cycle.Net job growth has been mediocre. Yes, there have been layoffs. Hewlett-Packard, now split into HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), announced plans to cut 30,000 workers. Oil services firms Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have announced tens of thousands of job cuts as demand plunges with the price of crude.But jobless claims and layoffs aren't the culprit. The problem is that actual gross hiring — hiring before any job cuts or exits — still hasn't returned to pre-recession levels, according to Labor's JOLTS report. Truth be told, gross hiring wasn't booming in the prior 2001-2007 expansion either, so failing to live up even to that pace isn't encouraging.Weak gross hiring likely is one reason why the labor force participation rate, including among prime-age workers, remains so low. Weak hiring — and firing — also suggest a less-dynamic economy. Some labor market churn is good, as workers move to more-productive jobs and industries.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter @IBD_ECarson and on Facebook.

435,HP,"It should be among the most unusual earnings conference calls in corporate history — certainly in Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) history, which by the time the company reports after the close Tuesday will have gone back, oh, 24 days since it became a company, though it's also 76 years old and could claim to be the pioneering Silicon Valley tech outfit.Reporting its fiscal Q4, which ended Oct. 31, Meg Whitman will hold court as both the new chairwoman and chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and as the continuing chairwoman and former chair and CEO of the former Hewlett-Packard, now known as HP Inc. (HPQ).HP Inc. kept the former Hewlett-Packard's ticker, HPQ. Hewlett Packard Enterprise got a new ticker, HPE.HP Inc. keeps the legacy computers and printer businesses. Hewlett Packard Enterprise takes the more ephemeral but — some analysts say — more promising enterprise services and cloud-enabled technologies businesses.In the past week, investors bid up Enterprise stock 6%, and 3% on Friday alone, to 14.21. That was its second best day of the month but still 5.5% off its open Nov. 2.Q4 might also be known as a clean-up quarter, a place to book some of the losses and charges related to the restructuring. Whitman said in September that the reorganization will impact cash by about $2.6 billion over three years starting in the current year, its fiscal 2016.""These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,"" Whitman said in September. ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes, and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring.""Cost savings are coming, in part, from the elimination of as many as 30,000 jobs from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, three years after the old, combined Hewlett-Packard cut 55,000 jobs. At the time of the September Q3 earnings release, the combined company had about 302,000 jobs.For Q4 2015, the old Hewlett-Packard estimated that EPS minus items for the entire company would range from 92 to 98 cents. The estimate excludes 80 cents in separation costs and other charges.Analysts ascribed more than half of that income, 52 cents, to the future Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Thomson Reuters analysts estimated Q4 revenue at $13.5 billion.For Q1, ending Jan. 31, analysts expect Enterprise to earn 44 cents per share, minus items, on $12.77 billion in revenue.In Q3, ended July 31, the old Enterprise Group sales rose 2%, with a 13% operating margin, the old company said.""While we have to wait for HP's Q4 results to see the first full post-split balance-sheet details, HPE's filings disclose a pro-forma cash and investment position totaled approximately $11.5 billion exiting Q3,"" wrote Stifel analyst Aaron Rakers in a research report. ""HPE's total debt position stands at (about) $16 billion; however, it is important to note that this includes about $10.6 billion on HP Financial Services debt. This leaves HPE net operating cash at approximately $5.5 billion exiting Q3 (excluding about $615 million of reported HPFS cash).""We would note that prior conversations have suggested that HPE will be focused on maintaining an investment-grade debt rating or a debt-to-EBITDA in the 2.0x-2.5x range.""We expect investors to focus on HPE's capacity to make strategic acquisitions.""Stifel initiated Hewlett Packard Enterprise with a hold rating.

442,HP,"Dell Does Opposite
"
443,HP,"Investors gave a mixed greeting to the split stocks in their first day of trading Monday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which gets a new ticker, fell 1.6% to 14.49. But HP Inc. (HPQ), which retains the ticker Hewlett-Packard has used since it acquired Compaq, rose 13% to 13.83.
"
444,HP,"Ives says the split-up isn't meant to reverse HP's oft-criticized 2001 purchase of then-giant PC firm Compaq Computer for $25 billion. Opinions on that deal vary, but observers note that other tech Goliaths are trying the same method to keep from being slain by Davids. Most notably of late, privately held Dell announced an agreement in October to acquire EMC (EMC), at $67 billion the largest-ever merger of pure tech companies. That move could be considered the opposite of what HP is doing.
"
445,HP,"Many tech titans are scrambling to find ways to stay on their toes, but some observers question the strategy of HP and Chief Executive Meg Whitman. HP executives were unavailable for comment.
"
446,HP,"Rob Enderle, a longtime Silicon Valley analyst, is among the dubious. He points to Dell and China giant Lenovo as among companies that view offering a broad spectrum of technology as key.

"
448,HP,"Market Cap Vs. Sales
"
449,HP,"Right or wrong, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the ""new"" company that will aim to deepen technology's ties to corporations. It looks to make money providing services via the cloud or Internet. HP Inc. will focus on the consumer PC and printing businesses.
"
450,HP,"One signpost by which to gauge the split's success is how it transforms HP's market capitalization. For now, HP is the only tech company of its size with a market cap smaller than its annual sales. Prior to the split, the combined HP was valued below $48 billion, while revenue for its fiscal year, which ended Saturday, is estimated near $106 billion. Prior to the split, there were roughly 1.8 billion shares of HP; its stock closed Friday at 26.96.
"
451,HP,"By comparison, Apple's world-leading market cap of $683 billion compares with annual sales of $234 billion. IBM has less than 1 billion shares outstanding, roughly half of HP's; but its market cap is nearly triple HP's, at $136.4 billion, with its stock closing Friday just above 140. IBM posted 2014 sales of $93 billion.
"
452,HP,"Oracle has roughly double the shares that HP has but more than triple the market cap: $166 billion, with annual sales near $38 billion. Cisco is roughly equal to Oracle, with $146 billion in market cap and $49 billion in sales this fiscal year.
"
453,HP,"Ranking Low
"
454,HP,"Excluding financial services firms, which don't record revenue, HP ranks No. 33 among multinational companies in the Financial Times Global 500 in terms of sales, but it ranks No. 125 in market cap.
"
455,HP,"And HP ranks No. 111 in revenue per employee and No. 162 in market value per employee.
"
456,HP,"""How the hell do you even get there?"" asked analyst Enderle of HP's standing. ""For the most part, it's being clueless.""
"
457,HP,"But some — including Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at tech research firm IDC who has followed HP since the late 1990s — view the split as a solid move.
"
458,HP,"""It's hard for me to be skeptical (about whether) it's going to work,"" Del Prete said. ""I don't see how they're going to have trouble executing the split.""
"
459,HP,"FBR's Ives says that the key for HP is how well the enterprise unit adapts to cloud computing, a huge trend in the tech industry.
"
460,HP,"""HP was late to the cloud,"" Ives said. ""A lot of these (older, legacy tech) companies miscalculated how quickly this shift would happen. I think these companies have hubris and are seeing through rose-colored glasses not only on the board but (in) the CEO seat as well.""Now that Hewlett-Packard has split in two, the question for the iconic technology giant and pioneer is whether its divide-and-conquer strategy will spark a rebound and accelerate growth.HP's efforts to revisit the heights that it reached during the dot-com boom 15 years ago have largely failed.

While such tech titans as Apple (AAPL) find success and blue skies in new businesses, others such as IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) see clouds, as in cloud computing, as they gaze into their crystal balls.""HP is trying to figure out how to get off the innovation treadmill that's going 2 miles per hour,"" said Daniel Ives, a tech analyst at FBR & Co. ""It makes sense that they're willing to do something to shake up the status quo.""Dell Does OppositeInvestors gave a mixed greeting to the split stocks in their first day of trading Monday. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which gets a new ticker, fell 1.6% to 14.49. But HP Inc. (HPQ), which retains the ticker Hewlett-Packard has used since it acquired Compaq, rose 13% to 13.83.Ives says the split-up isn't meant to reverse HP's oft-criticized 2001 purchase of then-giant PC firm Compaq Computer for $25 billion. Opinions on that deal vary, but observers note that other tech Goliaths are trying the same method to keep from being slain by Davids. Most notably of late, privately held Dell announced an agreement in October to acquire EMC (EMC), at $67 billion the largest-ever merger of pure tech companies. That move could be considered the opposite of what HP is doing.Many tech titans are scrambling to find ways to stay on their toes, but some observers question the strategy of HP and Chief Executive Meg Whitman. HP executives were unavailable for comment.Rob Enderle, a longtime Silicon Valley analyst, is among the dubious. He points to Dell and China giant Lenovo as among companies that view offering a broad spectrum of technology as key.""HP seems to be an example of a company determined to do something wrong,"" Enderle said.Market Cap Vs. SalesRight or wrong, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is the ""new"" company that will aim to deepen technology's ties to corporations. It looks to make money providing services via the cloud or Internet. HP Inc. will focus on the consumer PC and printing businesses.One signpost by which to gauge the split's success is how it transforms HP's market capitalization. For now, HP is the only tech company of its size with a market cap smaller than its annual sales. Prior to the split, the combined HP was valued below $48 billion, while revenue for its fiscal year, which ended Saturday, is estimated near $106 billion. Prior to the split, there were roughly 1.8 billion shares of HP; its stock closed Friday at 26.96.By comparison, Apple's world-leading market cap of $683 billion compares with annual sales of $234 billion. IBM has less than 1 billion shares outstanding, roughly half of HP's; but its market cap is nearly triple HP's, at $136.4 billion, with its stock closing Friday just above 140. IBM posted 2014 sales of $93 billion.Oracle has roughly double the shares that HP has but more than triple the market cap: $166 billion, with annual sales near $38 billion. Cisco is roughly equal to Oracle, with $146 billion in market cap and $49 billion in sales this fiscal year.Ranking LowExcluding financial services firms, which don't record revenue, HP ranks No. 33 among multinational companies in the Financial Times Global 500 in terms of sales, but it ranks No. 125 in market cap.And HP ranks No. 111 in revenue per employee and No. 162 in market value per employee.""How the hell do you even get there?"" asked analyst Enderle of HP's standing. ""For the most part, it's being clueless.""But some — including Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at tech research firm IDC who has followed HP since the late 1990s — view the split as a solid move.""It's hard for me to be skeptical (about whether) it's going to work,"" Del Prete said. ""I don't see how they're going to have trouble executing the split.""FBR's Ives says that the key for HP is how well the enterprise unit adapts to cloud computing, a huge trend in the tech industry.""HP was late to the cloud,"" Ives said. ""A lot of these (older, legacy tech) companies miscalculated how quickly this shift would happen. I think these companies have hubris and are seeing through rose-colored glasses not only on the board but (in) the CEO seat as well.""

In Q1, China added 8 million new mobile subscribers, vs. 6 million in the U.S., says mobile gear maker Ericsson (ERIC).Cisco and HP don't want to miss China's growth in mobile, White says.""The mobile Internet in China will be the biggest in the world and that requires routers, switches and servers,"" he said.China's governmental clampdowns on Cisco and HP helps China vendors Huawei Technologies and ZTE. White says other Chinese vendors also will gain from the boost at home. ""Ultimately, you will have some major IT companies coming out of China that will be global players,"" he said.Huawei in particular is gaining traction, says Mehra.""Huawei in the last five years has become much more of a competitor in the networking market, which was not the case five years ago in switching and routing,"" he said.But HP might have found a way to compete in China.HP's move to sell a 51% stake in HC3, HP's China-based networking, server and storage services company, to Tsinghua University for $2.3 billion last month should give it continued access to China's market, analysts say.HC3 was originally a joint venture of Huawei and 3Com, a U.S.-based networking equipment and security products maker. HP bought 3Com for $2.7 billion in 2010.HP could also leverage the partnership to sell additional products such as wireless networking equipment from its recent acquisition of Aruba Networks, Mehra says.""It could evolve into a cross-selling relationship, then they could OEM all of the Aruba portfolio and sell it under the HC3 brand,"" he said.Other U.S. tech sellers also appear to be hurt by China's political climate.In a conference call to discuss its Q1 earnings in April, EMC (EMC) executive David Goulden said weakness in China was ""due to increased scrutiny of U.S. technology purchases in the government and financial services sectors.""Some vendors, though, apparently see no impact.This month, Israel-based Radware said it would provide its security software for China Railway, to help build its next-generation e-ticketing platform. And in January, Radware inked a deal to provide security software to the Shenyin & Wanguo Securities MU Fund.U.S.-based Oracle (ORCL), the No. 1 database maker, is another seemingly safe, White says.""Oracle shouldn't have much of an impact because it's tough to replace them,"" he said. ""What are you going to replace them with?""

543,HP,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) hopes to draw away enterprise data storage customers from Dell and EMC (EMC) using the classic approach of spreading FUD, business shorthand for ""fear, uncertainty and doubt,"" about its rivals.Last week, HP CEO Meg Whitman criticized Dell's planned $67 billion acquisition of EMC. HP later launched an opportunistic marketing campaign warning customers about potential upheaval in the storage business of the combined Dell-EMC.A recent Twitter (TWTR) advertisement by HP Storage said, ""Dell's acquisition of EMC — uncertainty ahead,"" with a picture of what looks like an earthquake-damaged road. The promoted tweet included a link to an HP blog post knocking the deal.That post, written by Jorge Maestre, competitive strategist for global storage at HP Enterprise, said that the Dell-EMC merger would create complexity. The combined company will have to figure out which products to keep and what its unified storage strategy will be, Maestre said.""A merger of this magnitude reshuffles the market, and every vendor on the planet is already in attack mode looking to pick off as many customers as possible,"" Maestre said. ""That leaves Dell with a TON of work to do. They have to merge two completely independent product, sales and support organizations.""When the deal was announced on Oct. 12, HP issued a statement claiming that the Dell-EMC merger provided a ""real opportunity"" for HP.""Two of our largest competitors are attempting a highly distracting, multiyear merger, just as we are launching two new, focused companies,"" the HP statement said, according to Barron's . ""The massive debt burden Dell and EMC are taking on undoubtedly means that they will have to radically reduce R&D, and integration inevitably will create disruption as they rationalize product portfolios, channel programs and leadership.""Whitman later sent a memo to HP Enterprise employees titled ""Seize the moment,"" which hammered home the same points.HP is scheduled to split into two publicly traded companies on Nov. 1. HP Inc. will run its PC and printer businesses. HP Enterprise will focus on enterprise information technology, including servers and storage.RELATED:Dell-EMC Deal Could Spark More Tech M&A Activity.Dell: Keeping VMware 'Important' To EMC Deal Success.

557,HP,"Hewlett-Packard's ill-fated 2011 acquisition of software maker Autonomy once again came back to bite the company, with Autonomy's former CEO reportedly suing HP in Britain.Meanwhile, directors formally approved Hewlett-Packard's split into two separate companies, one focused on the PC and printer businesses and the other on enterprise services.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) stock was down 1.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, after reports of the suit, which seeks $150 million.Reports said the lawsuit was filed in British courts Thursday by Mike Lynch, founder and former CEO of Autonomy, the entity that HP purchased in 2011 for $11 billion. It is a counterclaim to HP's attempt to get $5.1 billion in damages from Lynch and Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy's former chief financial officer. In his counterclaim, Lynch reportedly says HP made statements that were damaging to him.The acquisition of the maker of Big Data analysis software has been a rough one for HP. The company took an $8.8 billion accounting charge related to the acquisition in 2012, and alleged that company executives fraudulently inflated the British software company's value.Lynch has said that HP mismanaged Autonomy after it bought the company in August 2011.The Financial Times reported that Lynch's filing says: ""The fact that HP's impairment calculation fluctuated by such large sums in the days before the calculation was finalized show that HP's calculation was based (at least in part) on broad, subjective judgments on the part of HP's top executives.""HP responded by saying: ""Mike Lynch's lawsuit is a laughable and desperate attempt to divert attention from the $5 billion lawsuit HP has filed and the ongoing criminal investigation. HP anxiously looks forward to the day Lynch and Hussain will be forced to answer for their actions in court.""Meanwhile, HP said Thursday that its board on Wednesday formally approved to split the company into two entities: HP Inc., handling its PCs, consumer products and printers; and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., handling enterprise services and more. The split is set to go into effect Nov. 1.Hewlett-Packard expects to cut as many as 33,300 total jobs once the split takes place, with 25,000 to 30,000 coming from enterprise operations and up to 3,300 from HP Inc.Follow Russ Britt on Twitter @IBD_RBritt and on Facebook.

632,HP,"A few of the largest and oldest tech firms may finally get a shot at beating the upstarts in the fast-growing data analytics software market.
"
633,HP,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Oracle (ORCL) and others are armed with software to tackle what is becoming a growing concern and a big pain for companies: how to derive useful information from the reams of social media conversations, e-mail and other unstructured data on the Internet.
"
634,HP,"The old tech giants have been losing ground in the data analytics business to companies such as Tableau Software (DATA) and Qlik Technologies (QLIK) that have perfected ways of analyzing structured data. Structured data include spreadsheets and information from databases arranged in columns in a relational database system. Tableau's visualization software lets business professionals arrange structured data in easy-to-read charts and graphs without the need for IT departments.
"
635,HP,"But so far, neither Tableau nor Qlik can tackle unstructured data — considered the next big virtually untapped territory for data analytics, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets & Co.

"
639,HP,"For now, the structured data analysis market will be much larger — and will grow much faster than — unstructured analysis. By 2018, global sales of relational database software for working with structural data will reach $50 billion, up from $30 billion, says IDC.
"
640,HP,"Global sales of non-relational database software for unstructured information are expected to reach $5.08 billion by 2018, up from $4.19 billion in 2013, IDC says. The market for unstructured data will likely accelerate as more companies become aware that it is an untapped resource, Schubmehl says.

644,HP,"Many technology players, including HP and Oracle, have used acquisitions to help them serve the emerging unstructured market.

645,HP,"In one of the most controversial deals in recent history, HP paid $10.3 billion in 2011 to acquire Autonomy, a maker of software for sifting through unstructured data.

"
650,HP,"So far, Tableau and Qlik both rely on third-party partners when customers require analysis of unstructured data.
"
651,HP,"Tableau works with several partners including Splunk (SPLK) and Amazon.com (AMZN) units Amazon Relational Database Service, which helps customers set up a database in the cloud, and Amazon Elastic MapReduce, a Web-service that uses Hadoop open source database software to sift through large amounts of data.
"
652,HP,"A Qlik spokesman says using third-party companies is an effective strategy because it offers an unstructured expert to better serve the customer.
"

678,HP,"Rapidly advancing technology offers a mixed blessing. It doesn't take long for what was once highly advanced and expensive technology to become a more affordable standard. But it also often doesn't make a lot of sense to invest in costly stuff when a fairly short wait will make those products way less of a burden on your wallet.That's what's happening in the portables market. While you can still spend $500 on an Apple (AAPL) iPad Air 2 or $800 on a Microsoft (MSFT) Surface Pro 3, you can get much of the same utility for a lot fewer dollars.What can you get for $250 or less? Here are some options: Apple's tablets are expensive compared with alternatives, but if you have to have an iPad, the original iPad Mini is still being sold for $250.But if you can live with Windows 8.1, the E Fun Nextbook 10.1 has a lot to offer for the money. Selling for $179 at Wal-Mart (WMT), it's a 10.1-inch touchscreen tablet with a detachable full-size keyboard that turns it into a small laptop. Like many tablets, it doesn't have much memory, 2 GB of RAM and 32GB of solid state memory — but it does have an SD Card slot, so you can add another 32GB of RAM with an inexpensive card. The Nextbook 10.1 uses an Intel (INTC) Atom quad-core CPU, which does a decent job on multimedia streaming from YouTube and other sites like Hulu and Netflix (NFLX). If a 10.1-inch screen is a bit too small for you, consider one of the many slightly larger new laptops hitting the stores. The Samsung Chromebook 2 has an 11.6-inch touchscreen and runs the Chrome OS, which is based around Google's (GOOGL) Chrome Internet browser. Priced at $249, the Chromebook 2 doesn't have a lot of memory — 2MB RAM and 16GB of solid state storage — but is designed to be used primarily while connected to the Internet, with the on-device storage used to hold apps that can be downloaded from the Chrome store.Google Docs A BonusFor reports, spreadsheets and the like, you can use Google Docs online, or download these applications onto the Chromebook so you can work on documents, spreadsheets and presentations when not connected to the Internet. There are loads of free or cheap apps available for Chromebooks, but if you're mostly Windows-oriented, then it might not be your first choice. Fortunately, there are some very attractive choices in laptops priced at under $250 that run the new Microsoft Windows 8.1 operating system.The Stream 13 from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is a $229 Windows 8.1 machine similar in concept to the Chromebooks. It has minimal memory (2MB RAM, 32GB solid state drive) and is meant to be used primarily while connected to the Internet. A free year's subscription to Microsoft Office 365 and 1 terabyte of online storage is included in the price, and after the first year you can continue this subscription for $99 a year.There's a slot for a MicroSD Card so you can add up to another 64GB of storage for very little money. The Stream 13 is powered by an Intel Celeron CPU (as are most of the laptops in this column) and has a 13-inch display (a version of Stream is available with an 11-inch display for only $200). The Stream 13 (and Stream 11) is available in a bright blue or magenta color and weighs 3.4 pounds. The $249 Acer Aspire E 11 is similar to the 11-inch screen version of the HP Stream but offers a number of features that justify the extra cost. Rather than a small solid state disk, the Aspire E 11 has a 500GB hard disk. It also has 4GB of RAM and an 11.6-inch display, and it weighs only 2.8 pounds. Neither the Aspire nor HP Stream has a fan, and both feature long battery life, with up to five hours claimed for the Aspire and more than seven hours for the Stream. Finally, if you want an affordable full-sized laptop, consider the Asus X551MAV-HCL1201E. Priced at about $230, it is larger, heavier and thicker than the other laptops detailed here, but that 4.7 pounds and 1.2-inch thickness also gets you a large 15.6-inch display, a 500GB hard disk drive and a DVD drive that can read and burn discs, something that's not included with the other portables mentioned.As with the HP and Acer, the Asus laptop features an Intel Celeron CPU and includes Wi-Fi. Also included are an SD card reader (which is nice if you have a digital camera that uses this type of removable memory), a standard Ethernet connector and 4GB of RAM. The Asus portable runs Windows 8.1, the latest version of the operating system.None of the above machines can really be considered appropriate for high-end gaming. But for everyday computing and Web browsing, they all represent an excellent value.

""However, we think the market is real and could be about $20 billion in 2020.""Sales in the 3D printer market this year are estimated to come in at about $5 billion.Stratasys and 3D Systems are the two largest providers of 3D printers. The stock of both companies soared from early 2012 through early 2014. Then the stocks fell, on the reality that the industry had many mountains yet to climb.""We think 3D printing is a significant long-term opportunity, but the technology is immature in terms of speed, quality and reliability, which has caused problems for Stratasys and 3D Systems,"" Milunovich wrote.He says that HP has solved bottlenecks holding back 3D printing, such as speed.It is ""entirely believable that HP could become the leading 3D printing company,"" due to its current strength as a printing vendor, he wrote.""Our view is that 3D printing is in the early innings of commercial implementation, with the industrial greater than the consumer opportunity,"" Milunovich wrote. ""3D printing lacks economies of scale today for most applications. Over time, however, we believe 3D printing is on a path to overcoming its shortcomings in throughput, process stability, equipment life, post-processing elimination, materials know-how, production qualification and ease of use.""Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.

Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) shipped 15.88 million PCs worldwide in Q4, giving it 19.7% market share, IDC said.Lenovo increased its PC unit shipments by 4.9% year over year, but HP grew its unit shipments by 15.1%, IDC said.Lenovo surpassed HP to become the No. 1 PC seller in world in Q2 2013. HP had been the top dog since late 2006, when it took the crown from Dell.Overall PC shipments fell 2.4% in the fourth quarter, IDC said. Rival research firm Gartner, which measures the market differently, said PC shipments rose 1% last quarter.IDC said the top five vendors each increased their unit shipments year over year, while all other vendors saw PC shipments decline 20.7%.Apple (AAPL) posted the fastest growth among the top five, IDC said. Apple increased its Mac computer shipments by 18.9% to 5.75 million units in Q4. It maintained its No. 5 ranking with 7.1% market share, IDC said.Rounding out the top five were Dell (13.5% market share) in third place and Acer (7.7%) in fourth, IDC reported.For the year, PC shipments fell 2.1% to 308.6 million units, IDC said. Gartner put the decline at 0.2%. It was the third straight year of declining PC volumes, IDC said.""The strength from market leaders, as well as improvement in Asia-Pacific and the consumer market more generally, are positive signs for the PC market,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement.Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said Q4 sales were boosted by improved consumer PC business and lower-priced notebooks.""The fourth quarter of 2014 was the best holiday for PC sales in recent history,"" Kitagawa said in a statement. ""The primary driver was mobile PCs including regular notebooks, thin and light notebooks and two-in-ones. Low priced notebooks with about a $200-$300 price point boosted shipments, while thin/light notebooks and two-in-ones (laptops with a detachable or bendable screen) showed strong growth. These results supports our assumption that consumer spending is returning to the PC as tablet penetration has reached the majority of the market.""In the U.S. market, HP was the top PC vendor in Q4 with 30.1% market share. Dell was second with 23.8%, followed by Apple (12.7%), Lenovo (10.2%) and Toshiba (6.5%), IDC said.Later this year, HP plans to split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will focus on servers, storage, networking, services and software; and HP Inc. will sell personal computers and printers.

"
743,HP,"Now that Carly Fiorina has gained some steam in her longshot bid for the Republican presidential nomination, more questions are surfacing about what she did — or failed to do — as CEO of Hewlett-Packard.
"
744,HP,"Fiorina left the tech giant more than a decade ago, but her controversial five-year-plus tenure leading the tech giant is her biggest claim to fame as voters try to assess her abilities.
"
745,HP,"The 60-year-old Fiorina has been relatively inactive since she was dismissed by the Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) board in February 2005, so her time at HP gets scrutiny as a barometer of her leadership capabilities.
"
746,HP,"Fiorina touts her HP experience as proof that she can deal with complex issues. And like Republican rival Donald Trump, Fiorina says her outsider status as a non-career politician with business sensibilities will bring a fresh outlook to the White House.
"
747,HP,"Just how good Fiorina was as CEO is a question with a lot of answers. Fiorina herself declined to comment for this story.
"
748,HP,"The highlight, or lowlight, of her HP days was pushing through a contentious acquisition of Compaq Computer, which made HP the No. 1 maker of PCs. (It's now No. 2, behind China's Lenovo.) The acquisition came with public fights with members of the Packard and Hewlett families, and the subsequent layoffs earned Fiorina the enmity of many former and current HP employees.
"
749,HP,"Others, though, consider the Compaq deal a big win for HP.
"
750,HP,"""I think she's gotten a bad rap,"" said Robert Wayman, HP's longtime CFO, who served under Fiorina and took over as interim CEO after she left. ""More analysis would lead you to a different conclusion than she was just a failure. I do not think she was a failure.""
"
751,HP,"Others say Fiorina's tenure as the first female chief executive of a Fortune 20 company was too full of potholes to be deemed a success.
"
752,HP,"Besides the awkward merger with Compaq, HP's stock flailed and the company's vaunted culture deteriorated, many say.

"
754,HP,"Sonnenfeld recently wrote a piece for Fortune magazine examining Fiorina's qualifications.
"
755,HP,"After leaving HP, Fiorina made an unsuccessful bid for a California U.S. Senate seat in 2010, sat on several boards and served as a commentator on Fox News.
"
756,HP,"Fiorina was a surprise choice as HP CEO in 1999, to replace the retiring Lewis Platt. Fiorina had been running a division for Lucent Technologies, now Alcatel-Lucent (ALU).

"
760,HP,"One former HP executive from that period, who spoke only if not identified, said Fiorina violated the company's culture by laying off a few thousand employees within her first couple of years. While HP had made some employee buyouts in its past, these were its first involuntary layoffs.
"
761,HP,"The layoffs upset many employees, the executive said, but the big trauma for HP came in September 2001, about a week before the 9/11 attacks. Fiorina announced that the company would acquire Compaq for about $24 billion.
"
762,HP,"It was the defining moment in Fiorina's tenure, and the merger continues to be debated today.
"
763,HP,"Compaq led in PCs and was big in servers. But competition was fierce, and the timing hurt, with the deal coming amid the economic downturn sparked by 9/11. Detractors say HP was too late in making the move, with PCs fast becoming commodities.
"
764,HP,"Detractors say Fiorina mainly wanted to put her stamp on the company, instead of pursuing a strategy. Fiorina had failed months earlier to acquire a company in a completely different field, PricewaterhouseCoopers' management and tech consulting practice.
"
765,HP,"""It was a bad move,"" said Yale's Sonnenfeld of the Compaq deal.
"
766,HP,"The deal would result in roughly 15,000 people at the combined company losing their jobs because of overlap. The shareholder vote was close, with opposition led by sons of HP's co-founders, Walter Hewlett, who was then on HP's board, and David Woodley Packard.

"
770,HP,"Fiorina wasn't looking to simply boost PC sales, the executive said. She wanted to make HP the leader in servers and a number of other product lines, able to trump the likes of IBM (IBM) and Dell.
"
771,HP,"""Dell was taking over the world — of PCs in particular, but they were also moving into servers,"" said Wayman. ""This merger changed that. It absolutely did.""

"
774,HP,"Many investors didn't see the value in the Compaq deal. Two months after the May 2002 acquisition, HP's stock reached its lowest point in the Fiorina years, falling to 10.75, down 84% from its all-time high of 68.09 hit in July 2000, at the end of the dot-com bubble.
"
775,HP,"Detractors note that HP's stock underperformed IBM and Dell during Fiorina's tenure. HP stock lost about half its value from July 1999 through February 2005, vs. about 30% for IBM and just more than 3% for Dell.

778,HP,"Hewlett-Packard's (HPQ) enterprise unit will cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs from its work force as part of the restructuring as it separates from HP's consumer operations, company officials said Tuesday.HP made the announcement at a meeting with analysts and later disclosed the plan publicly in a press release. The tech giant now has 302,000 employees worldwide across all its operations, and would end up with as few as 272,000 as a result of the enterprise unit cutbacks. Company officials told analysts they may do some rehiring once the restructuring is complete.Further guidance on HP's consumer unit, known as HP Inc., was expected later in the day but sources didn't expect the company to announce further layoffs from that division, which formally separates from the enterprise operations Nov. 1.The enterprise unit's restructuring is expected to take out $2.7 billion in annual costs, company officials said in a press release. The costs associated with the restructuring will amount to a $2.7 billion GAAP charge, beginning in the fourth quarter, and the move will impact cash by $2.6 billion over the next three years, starting in fiscal 2016.""These restructuring activities will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,"" HP Chief Executive Meg Whitman said in a prepared statement. ""We've done a significant amount of work over the past few years to take costs out and simplify processes and these final actions will eliminate the need for any future corporate restructuring.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note late Tuesday that the ""expectation is that some of the savings will be invested back in the business and savings will be fully realized by fiscal-year 2017 to 2018 time frame.""The reductions come three years after HP slashed 55,000 jobs in 2012.HP also said it expects 2016 earnings, excluding items, of $1.85 to $1.95 a share for the enterprise unit. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters have been expecting $3.72 in adjusted income per share for both the consumer and enterprise divisions in 2016, 2.8% up from 2015's expected $3.62. Revenue for the combined entity, however, is expected to drop 1.6% to $102.4 billion.HP stock ended Tuesday's regular trading session in the stock market today up marginally to 27.11, but was trading down more than 2% after hours.

797,HP,"Hewlett-Packard's  (HPQ) CEO took to CNBC early Friday, which might have helped HP stock after its mixed fiscal Q3 earnings report late Thursday.

But shares…
"
798,HP,"Hewlett-Packard disappointed investors late Thursday with a mixed report for its fiscal third quarter and earnings guidance below views.
"
799,HP,"HP (HPQ) stock was down 1% after hours. During the regular session, HP shares dipped 1.4% to 27.35.
"
800,HP,"The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company earned 88 cents a share ex-items for the quarter ended July 31. That's down 1% from a year earlier but 3 cents above the 85 cents a share expected by Wall Street.
"
801,HP,"Earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) came in low. HP said GAAP EPS fell 10% year over year to 47 cents, vs. analyst views for 55 cents.
"
802,HP,"Sales also missed, dropping 8% year over year to $25.35 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected sales of $25.44 billion in fiscal Q3. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, HP's sales would have been down just 2%.
"
803,HP,"Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White called HP's Q3 report ""another uninspiring performance.""
"
804,HP,"""Fiscal Q4 EPS outlook is light, supporting our cautious view on the company,"" he said in a research note. ""Moreover, this was the 15th quarter out of the past 16 quarters that sales have declined on a year-over-year basis.""

807,HP,"HP faced a ""challenging macroeconomic and IT spending environment in the quarter, with soft consumer spending, continued weakness in Russia and China and stock market volatility driving uncertainty,"" Whitman said.
"
808,HP,"HP got 63% of its net revenue outside the U.S. in Q3. Several big tech companies have been hit by foreign currency headwinds in their latest-reported quarters, including Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT).
"
809,HP,"On the conference call, Whitman said she was pleased with HP's progress on multiple fronts.
"
810,HP,"For the current quarter, HP's fiscal Q4, Wall Street had been modeling for EPS of $1 ex items, on sales of $26.82 billion. But HP guided to non-GAAP EPS of 92 to 98 cents, or 95 cents at the midpoint.
"
811,HP,"The Q3 report was the company's last before it splits into two publicly traded companies on Nov. 1. HP Enterprise will focus on enterprise information technology and HP Inc. will sell PCs and printers.
"

During the regular session, HP shares dipped 1.4% to 27.35.The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company earned 88 cents a share ex-items for the quarter ended July 31. That's down 1% from a year earlier but 3 cents above the 85 cents a share expected by Wall Street.Earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) came in low. HP said GAAP EPS fell 10% year over year to 47 cents, vs. analyst views for 55 cents.Sales also missed, dropping 8% year over year to $25.35 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected sales of $25.44 billion in fiscal Q3. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, HP's sales would have been down just 2%.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White called HP's Q3 report ""another uninspiring performance.""""Fiscal Q4 EPS outlook is light, supporting our cautious view on the company,"" he said in a research note. ""Moreover, this was the 15th quarter out of the past 16 quarters that sales have declined on a year-over-year basis.""HP improved its flagging enterprise services unit and met its overall Q3 guidance while meeting goals for the upcoming corporate separation into two units, in November.The company's PC and printer business was hit by market declines and competitive pricing pressures since May, HP CEO Meg Whitman said on a call with analysts late Thursday. ""We now see a difficult business environment for at least several quarters to come,"" she said.HP faced a ""challenging macroeconomic and IT spending environment in the quarter, with soft consumer spending, continued weakness in Russia and China and stock market volatility driving uncertainty,"" Whitman said.HP got 63% of its net revenue outside the U.S. in Q3. Several big tech companies have been hit by foreign currency headwinds in their latest-reported quarters, including Google (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT).On the conference call, Whitman said she was pleased with HP's progress on multiple fronts.For the current quarter, HP's fiscal Q4, Wall Street had been modeling for EPS of $1 ex items, on sales of $26.82 billion. But HP guided to non-GAAP EPS of 92 to 98 cents, or 95 cents at the midpoint.The Q3 report was the company's last before it splits into two publicly traded companies on Nov. 1. HP Enterprise will focus on enterprise information technology and HP Inc. will sell PCs and printers.While the separation of HP into two companies makes sense, each of the businesses ""are rapidly being commoditized and thus future growth potential appears limited,"" analyst White said in his note.HP named the boards of directors for the two firms on Aug. 12.

818,HP,"The end of an era is drawing near for tech behemoth Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and the company is laying the groundwork for its upcoming incarnation as two separate companies — one focused on enterprise technology and the other on personal computers and printers.

"
819,HP,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) appears to be making progress as it works through the third year of a five-year restructuring process launched in May 2012 and prepares for a company split into two entities by the end of next year.
"
820,HP,"That's the assessment from several analysts after the global computer product giant reported a mixed bag of fourth-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday. Here is IBD's report.

"
822,HP,"In a Wednesday report, Steven Milunovich, an analyst for UBS Securities, called HP's Q4 performance ""a decent end to a strong year."" He has a neutral rating on the company.
"
823,HP,"""Although light revenue was the headline after the close, we aren't too concerned, as improving margin performance was a positive offset,"" he wrote. ""HP continues to have some momentum due to improved products, cost savings to protect profits, the coming breakup that adds modest value, and the roll-out of Meg Whitman's 'Playing to Win' approach borrowed from Procter & Gamble.""
"
824,HP,"Others agreed.
"
825,HP,"In a report late Tuesday, Maynard Um, an analyst for Wells Fargo Securities, says HP is making significant strides in its restructuring plan. He has an outperform rating on the company.
"
826,HP,"""We believe HP has largely turned the corner and is well positioned in a number of segments — share gain potential in PCs, strong portfolio and cycles in servers, improvement in services, a bottoming of supplies in printing, improved margins across its segments, strong cash flow generation, good growth in new higher margin businesses (networking, security, Big Data, Inkjet Pro X) and catch-up share repurchases ahead,"" he wrote. ""While it doesn't change the secular forces in the industry and the impact to HP, we think the company is much better positioned to move forward than it has been in quite some time.""
"
827,HP,"In a report late Tuesday, Brent Bracelin, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities, noted that healthy notebook PC growth of 9% was masked by a revenue shortfall in the enterprise group, which declined 4% vs. the year-earlier period. Storage and industry-standard servers revenue also fell by the most in over a year.
"
828,HP,"But HP's coming separation, which would place its PC and printer groups in one company and its enterprise and software businesses in another, could help reaccelerate the company's growth, Bracelin wrote.

833,HP,"Hewlett-Packard's road to revenue growth has hit another pothole.The computer products giant reported a mixed bag of fiscal fourth-quarter numbers late Tuesday as the company continues to work through a restructuring that will include splitting it into two separate entities by the end of next year.The company's Q4 sales missed analyst views, while its earnings for the quarter were merely in line.Hewlett-Packard's (HPQ) earnings forecast for the current quarter was lighter than expected.Shares fell about 1% in after-hours trading. HP stock ended the regular session up a fraction at 37.63.HP's revenue fell 2% year over year to $28.4 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 31. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a 1.2% decline to $28.76 billion.HP reported earnings per share minus items of $1.06, up 5% from the year-earlier period and in line with analyst estimates.The company's 2% decline in revenue in Q4 failed to match the 1% year-over-year revenue growth in the prior quarter, which had been its first positive revenue gain in 11 quarters dating back to July 2011. HP's sales miss comes even as the company posted its fourth consecutive quarter with year-over-year revenue growth in its PC business.HP has been scrambling to move into newer areas such as cloud computing and Big Data to offset declining growth in its printing and other businesses.The company launched what is expected to be a five-year restructuring effort in May 2012.But HP's third-quarter growth was more of an anomaly than a new direction for the company — at least for now, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""When you look at the big picture of HP and you look at all of the different businesses, there is really not one market where you can say, 'That is going to take off in terms of revenue,'"" he told IBD. ""Whether it's services or the enterprise group, PCs or printers — none of them is really growing, or at least the markets are not growing at respectable rates.""For the current quarter, HP said it expects earnings per share of 89 to 93 cents, or a decline of 1.1% to an increase of 3.3%.Analysts had modeled for 93 cents EPS and revenue to decline by 2.1% to $27.55 billion. HP doesn't provide a revenue forecast.For the full year, HP said it expects EPS of $3.83 to $4.03, up 2.4% to 7.7%.Analysts have been expecting $3.94 EPS, or growth of 5.3%, and revenue of $110.35 billion, down 1%.During a conference call with analysts, HP CEO Meg Whitman expressed confidence in the company's direction.""Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made,"" she said. ""On the top line, I have always said that turnarounds aren't linear and, while we are seeing clear pockets of growth, other areas still need more work. But overall our revenue performance has improved dramatically over the past three years.""HP will keep a sharp focus on its fundamental operations, she said, including its cost structure and supply chain.As in prior quarters, HP's line items reveal a company with more misses than hits.Revenue from the company's personal systems group, which is mostly PCs, increased 4% year over year to $8.94 billion.Sales of notebooks increased 9% to $4.86 billion while desktops decreased 3% to $3.18 billion.Printing revenue declined 5% to $5.74 billion.Sales of supplies slipped 7% to $3.59 billion.HP stock is up 35% year to date through Tuesday's close. Investors might be buying into the promise that HP can carve a niche in the growing 3D printing market after it announced the development of a product last month that is expected to be ready for sale in 2016, White says.""The 3D dream helps the perception around the stock,"" he said. ""The market does believe in 3D printing, and they are definitely a leader in printing.""Revenue from HP's enterprise group, including servers, storage and networking systems, declined 4% to $7.27 billion.Sales of industry standard servers fell 2% to $3.37 billion.Technology services revenue decreased 3% to $2.11 billion.Enterprise services revenue declined 7% to $5.51 billion.Sales of infrastructure technology outsourcing fell 7% to $3.44 billion, while revenue from application and business services fell 6% to $2.06 billion.HP will need more than just a resurging PC business to reaccelerate its growth, White says.""It comes back to (the question): Is this portfolio positioned for Big Data, cloud, Internet of Things, things that are major trends?"" he said. ""I don't think it's as well positioned as other companies.""Even though HP plans to split the company into two separate companies, the challenge for the company doesn't end there, says Rohit Mehra, an analyst for IDC.""The bigger challenge is for the personal systems side as well as the enterprise side to actually show the market that they have entered a period where they can show sustained growth,"" he told IBD.

834,HP,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD. ""The primary beneficiaries are those that sell (software) distributions, such as Red Hat, HP and Mirantis.""

That includes spending on servers, storage and ethernet switches to power public and private cloud systems.Non-cloud IT infrastructure spending grew just 6.1% year over year in the first quarter, IDC said.""Cloud IT infrastructure growth continues to outpace the growth of the overall IT infrastructure market, driven by the transition of workloads onto cloud-based platforms,"" IDC analyst Kuba Stolarski said in a statement. ""Both private and public cloud infrastructures have been growing at a similar pace, suggesting that customers are open to a broad array of hybrid deployment scenarios as they modernize their IT for the 3rd Platform, begin to deploy next-gen software solutions, and embrace modern management processes that enable agile, flexible, and extensible cloud platforms.""Among cloud hardware vendors, the top three companies outpaced the overall cloud infrastructure market and gained market share in Q1.No. 1 vendor Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) increased its cloud infrastructure revenue by 37.4% year over year in Q1 to $985 million. Its market share rose to 15.7% from 14.3% a year earlier.No. 2 vendor Dell grew its cloud hardware sales by 34.2% to $745 million.

He said the stock ""already reflects an anticipated stabilization in some of its most troubled areas.""He said positives include growth in large, tier-one hyperscale servers, while negatives included a decline in services revenue.""Overall, the outlook for FY16 is unchanged (albeit more back-end loaded) and the stock is likely range-bound at current levels,"" said Kugele, who maintained a hold rating on HPE stock.Responding to those who say HPE isn't selling enough services and products in the cloud, company CEO Meg Whitman told CNBC Wednesday that spending for private cloud products — networks and data centers that businesses keep in-house, which is HPE's focus — is growing as fast as public cloud. ""Most people don't understand that,"" she said.""Yesterday, we announced that we were partnering with Microsoft (MFST) Azure to provide the public cloud,"" she told CNBC. ""And then we have this great cloud system automation that helps you orchestrate your clouds in your data center. So if you think about where the money is spent today, interestingly, still about 85% of the spend is in traditional I.T. ... The next-biggest segment is private cloud. And the next after that is public cloud. And private and public cloud are growing at about the same rate.""So we are going right to the heart of what our customers are asking. And I feel really good about our strategy and excited about the partnership that we announced yesterday with Microsoft Azure.""Microsoft Azure competes with market leader Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others in providing public cloud services.Needham's Kugele liked the Azure partnership and the fact that HPE was ""abdicating"" in the public cloud sector, but he pointed out that Azure is fighting against AWS, ""and ultimate success is going to be a marathon and not a sprint.""New Era BeginsEnterprise is roughly half — most analysts say the more promising half — of the Nov. 1 split of the legendary 76-year-old Hewlett-Packard Co. The other half, HP Inc. (HPQ), focuses on the PC and printer businesses, and it kept the old HPQ ticker.The Q4 report was the last for the old company, which Whitman also chaired. It earned 93 cents per share minus items in its fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 31, down 12%, on revenue of $25.7 billion, down 9%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 97 cents on $26.35 billion.Enterprise's pro forma portion of Q4 sales fell 4% to $14.1 billion but was up 3% in constant currency. Analysts were expecting Enterprise to post Q4 revenue of $13.5 billion.Enterprise reaffirmed its fiscal 2016 outlook of $1.85-$1.95 in adjusted earnings per share, with the $1.90 midpoint higher than the $1.88 estimated by analysts on revenue of $50.81 billion.Whitman told analysts in the conference call following Tuesday's earnings release that HPE ""will double down on our private and managed cloud (efforts), and sunset our public cloud."" Of ""the move to a hybrid cloud environment ... you can expect to hear more.""Needham analyst Kugele said that with HPE still on its way to 30,000 layoffs, and the service business determined to ""drag its margins higher through careful contract signings, we are most focused on the storage and server opportunity for HPE. In servers, the lumpy buying pattern of tier-1 hyperscale customers helped them in the quarter but is hardly consistently reliable.""Nevertheless we expect the segment to show slight growth in fiscal '16.""He said storage has benefited from ""aggressive pricing,"" but he sees more competition from rivals such as NetApp (NTAP) and Pure Storage (PSTG).""Bottom line, there are more puts and takes and caveats than investors should accept in a long thesis,"" Kugele wrote.

But enterprise services revenue fell 16% to $4.81 billion.""The enterprise business is going through the biggest change in 30 years,"" White said. ""Everyone is trying to figure it out.""I just don't think they have a portfolio that is differentiated enough to say that, at the end of this major transition, they are going to come out a major winner.""Revenue from the personal systems group, which is mostly PCs, fell 5% to $7.74 billion.Notebook computer sales rose 5% to $4.17 billion, but desktop computer sales fell 17% to $2.76 billion. Industry standard servers grew 11% to $3.13 billion, but workstation sales fell 6% to $513 million.""The PC market is starting to fall off again,"" White said. ""We started to see that in March, and the IT landscape is just ultracompetitive, especially in the commoditized parts that they play in.""Printer and related revenue fell 7% to $5.45 billion.

"
935,HP,"The silver lining for Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), with its Q2 earnings posted late Thursday, appears to be more about cost savings than growth.The computer products company posted a mixed bag of earnings numbers for the quarter ended April 30, but still HP stock was up Friday.Along with reporting EPS that was 2 cents better than expected, HP said that costs associated with its move to split into two companies will be $400 million to $450 million, where some analysts had expected up to $1 billion.HP stock was up 3% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 35.The results could have been far worse, says Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities in a report Friday. He rates HP stock at outperform.""The bottom line is that this was a mixed report but not as bad as some had feared in light of HP's foreign exchange risk due to high international exposure (65% revenue), and expected dis-synergy costs (associated with the split) came in lower than expected,"" he wrote.HP continues to slog through a five-year restructuring plan launched in May 2012 and aimed at pushing new initiatives, including the cloud and security, to offset revenue growth decline in PCs and printers. The company has failed to post steady quarterly year-over-year revenue growth since July 2011. Splitting the company into two entities with PCs and printers in one company and enterprise services, equipment and software in the other is expected to help solve that issue.HP still has a lot of work to do, Seyrafi says.""Key concerns in the report include enterprise services revenue, down 16% year-over-year and 6% below consensus due to key account runoffs, weakness in EMEA, and IT outsourcing; ... desktop weakness as desktop units declined by 14% year-over-year due to less end-of-(Microsoft (MSFT) XP support benefit compared to last year and slight pause in front of W10; printing margins declining to 3% from 3.7% in the first quarter with weakness in consumer printing due to strong competition from Japanese competitors (Canon (CAJ), Epson), which are being price aggressive (note that consumer hardware revenue declined by 18% year-over-year, and consumer units declined by 6% year-over-year, so the average selling price decline here was over 10% year-over-year); and some deceleration on a constant currency basis year-over-year in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, Japan,"" he wrote.

"
937,HP,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) will have a lot to prove when it reports its fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close Thursday.The computer products giant aims to rebound from its first-quarter earnings report, which included revenue that fell short of analyst estimates. Sales fell or were flat across all six of HP's business sectors. HP stock tumbled nearly 10% on Feb. 25, the day following its earnings report, to a seven-month low. HP stock is down more than 15% this year.Prior to Q1, HP had been building a groundswell of support from investors as the company gets closer to splitting into two separate companies, with PCs and printers in one company and enterprise services, equipment and software in the other. The split is expected to occur in October.HP is also amid a five-year restructuring plan launched in May 2012 aimed at placing more emphasis on emerging growth areas, including the cloud and security, as PC and printer growth slows.HP is in a quandary by operating in a difficult PC and printer market while trying to compete with rivals such as Accenture (ACN) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) in the enterprise services and equipment businesses, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. He rates HP stock a hold.""PCs is obviously a very difficult business,"" White told IBD. ""though they did pretty well last year. And they do a good job in printing, but it's kind of a secular, declining business.""They are not really great at the enterprise side. In services, they kind of stubbed their own toe and weren't investing in the right places and making promises (to customers) that they didn't deliver on... . I don't think there is anything to look at in services and say that is a great growing business for them.""EPS, Sales Both Seen FallingThis month, Cisco reported stronger-than-expected April-quarter earnings that included growth in its data center enterprise business.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect HP to report earnings per share minus items of 85 cents, down 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter. That would be its first EPS decline in six quarters.Revenue is expected to fall 6% to $25.65 billion, which would be its worst showing in the past seven quarters.For the current quarter, analysts expect EPS to fall 2.2% to 87 cents and revenue to fall 6.1% to $25.88 billion.HP's coming split should boost its shares, Sherri Scribner, an analyst for Deutsche Bank, said in a May 14 research report. She has a buy rating on HP stock.""We view HP as well positioned to benefit from growth in emerging segments like Big Data and converged infrastructure, and expect further operating margin improvements in HP's enterprise business,"" she wrote. ""With shares not currently reflecting HP's strong industry position, growth opportunities and operating margin expansion, we view current valuations as attractive and the stock remains one of our top picks for 2015.""While many investors have focused on near-term negative synergies of the deal, we believe the split will create positive synergies for the company, which should offset any negative synergies over the longer term.""

Helmerich & Payne will pay the dividend Aug. 30 to shareholders of record Aug. 15.""We are pleased to be in position to deliver a meaningful level of yield to our shareholders while retaining a strong ability to continue to pursue growth opportunities,"" said Chairman and CEO Hans Helmerich in a press release.Helmerich & Payne had already sharply increased its dividend for its fiscal first quarter. The firm has hiked its dividend each year for more than 40 years.At the new rate, Helmerich & Payne pays $2 a share each year, giving it a yield of about 3.2%. It has one of the highest yields among the 10 dividend-paying stocks in the Oil & Gas-Drilling group.Helmerich & Payne drills oil and gas wells for oil and gas exploration companies in the U.S. and abroad. Weather, oil and gas prices, the economy and foreign country risks can impact its bottom line.In 2009, earnings fell due to contract terminations stemming from lower commodity prices and tough credit conditions. Profit was also down in 2010, hurt by losses from discontinued operations in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government seized its rigs and other property. The declines weigh on its Earnings Per Share Rating, which is 75.Helmerich & Payne is in a cup-with-handle base with a 66.12 buy point. The current pattern's correction of 20% is less than half of its prior base.While the market is having a tough time this week, Helmerich & Payne is holding just above its 50-day moving average.

963,HP,"Worldwide personal computer shipments fell 11.8% year over year to 66.1 million units in the second quarter. But Apple (AAPL) defied the overall market trend and saw its Mac shipments rise 16.1% to 5.14 million units, research firm IDC said late Thursday.Apple was the only top 5 PC vendor to show an increase in shipments last quarter, IDC said. It ranked No. 4 behind Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Dell.Though they all experienced year-over-year declines in PC shipments in Q2, Lenovo, HP and Dell gained market share because their declines were less than the overall market.China-based Lenovo was tops with 20.3% market share in Q2, up from 19.4% a year earlier, IDC said. Its shipments dropped 7.5% year over year.Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP was No. 2 with an 18.5% market share, up from 18.2%. Its PC shipments fell 10.4%.Round Rock, Texas-based Dell was No. 3 with a 14.5% market share, up from 14%. Its PC shipments fell 8.7%.The PC market's year-over-year decline was 11.8%, a little more than expected, IDC said.The market faced tough year-over-year comparisons because of the surge in PC buying last year related to Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for its popular but aging Windows XP operating system, prodding many users to upgrade to newer PCs. Also, sales channels last quarter reduced their inventories ahead of the July 29 launch of Windows 10, IDC said.Plus, weaker exchange rates for foreign currencies led to increased PC prices in many markets and reduced purchasing power, IDC said.""Although the second-quarter decline in PC shipments was significant, and slightly more than expected, the overall trend fits with expectations,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement. ""We continue to expect low to mid-single digit declines in volume during the second half of the year, with volume stabilizing in future years.""PC shipments in the U.S. fell 3.3% to 16.4 million units, IDC said.Rival market research firm Gartner late Thursday said global PC shipments declined 9.5% to 68.4 million units.

1021,HP,"Hewlett-Packard showed some muscle in the fledgling Network Functions Virtualization market by beating Cisco Systems, VMware and others in signing telecom carrier Telefonica to a multiyear pact.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) is one of several tech giants scrambling to offer NFV, a virtualization computing system that relies more on software than hardware to help service providers speed an increasing amount of data through their networks at a reduced cost.Besides Cisco Systems (CSCO) and VMware (VMW), other NFV providers include Juniper Networks (JNPR).HP will fuel Telefonica's Unica project. Telefonica is moving all of its services, including Internet and mobile, to a new platform driven by NFV and software-defined networking, another technology system where software presides over hardware. The project will take several years.Spain-based Telefonica (TEF) is a large telecom operating in 21 countries, mostly in Europe and Latin America.HP is stepping up its NFV efforts, launched only last year, as the company gets closer to splitting into two separate companies. One will focus on PCs and printers, the other on enterprise products and services.Signing Telefonica should boost HP's revenue and set a bar for rivals in the NFV market, says Crawford Del Prete, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""It's a nice win in advance of the split,"" Del Prete told IBD. ""Carriers are going to be moving more toward these network functions and virtualization environments. This is a big industry shift that is going to be measured in billions.""UBS on Tuesday upgraded HP to buy from neutral and hiked its 12-month price target to 40 from 37.25. HP stock is trading near 33. In a research report, UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said, ""(HP Enterprise is) too hardware-dependent but improving. Software and services need to pick up, or HP Enterprise might be forced to merge with another larger computing vendor.""With the Telefonica contract, HP has seemingly leapfrogged rivals in what looks to be a very large market, says Roz Roseboro, an analyst for Heavy Reading, a market research firm that focuses solely on the telecom market.""From an endorsement standpoint, it's very big,"" she told IBD. ""The market right now is very much up in the air in terms of who is going to end up in the lead position with all of this NFV transformation.""HP provides NFV services for several customers, but Telefonica is a milestone for the company, says Saar Gillai, general manager of HP's NFV program.""This is our biggest deal in terms of providing end-to-end capabilities across our entire portfolio with open NFV,"" he told IBD.Not all of HP's rivals can handle such a large NFV migration, Gillai says.""We are uniquely positioned in this space because a lot of the traditional vendors are playing defense — they have a lot of existing systems that are in the old architecture, and they are not necessarily that motivated to get the new architecture that quickly,"" he said.Other vendors, such as Cisco, are stepping up their efforts in the NFV and SDN markets, said Amitabh Passi, an analyst for UBS Securities, in a March 2 research report.""Unlike years past, Cisco is more openly embracing shifts to software defined networking and Network Functions Virtualization, and in fact accelerating the shift to software and cloud services,"" he wrote.Several other telecom carriers, including AT&T (T) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY), are in the process of adopting NFV.Reducing costs and streamlining networks are top priorities, says Roseboro.""They are moving from a world where you have lots of different boxes that are specialized to do one thing and moving all of that onto more commodity servers, which allows you to lower your capex,"" she said. ""And once it's virtualized, you can start using some other kind of IT tools to automate a lot of your processes and reduce your opex quite significantly.""Gillai declined to put a value on the Telefonica contract.""I can say that it's meaningful revenue, and it's also an indicator of things to come,"" he said.HP's revenue needs a boost. In the quarter ended Jan. 31, its enterprise revenue was flat with the year-earlier quarter, at $6.98 billion. And its enterprise services revenue fell 11% to $4.99 billion.

1060,HP,"Dell rose from dorm-room startup to global giant during the 1990s as a PC maker stayed focused on businesses with its build-to-order, direct sales model.
"
1061,HP,"That's not to say it didn't try to tap the retail market.
"
1062,HP,"""Even though we were tempted and did venture off into some areas that didn't prove very attractive for us, the core direct-business model was so powerful that it kept chugging along and did very well for us,"" founder Michael Dell told IBD in 1999.
"
1063,HP,"But that laser focus also might have caused it to miss the industry's shift to the consumer market as businesses slowed their spending. Dell got blindsided by the rapid rise of ultraportable devices such as tablets and smartphones, and fell behind the curve.
"
1064,HP,"Struggling since the mid-2000s, Michael Dell took the company private last year. The company continues to serve the corporate PC market, where it remains a leader as it emphasizes services and more. But it's also boosting its presence in tablets, software and services.
"
1065,HP,"One key constant, analysts say, has been Dell's strong customer relations.
"
1066,HP,"""Dell was able to emerge as this player that was able to provide custom-built PCs very quickly and had strong direct engagement with customers,"" said Krista Macomber, an analyst with Technology Business Research. ""As a result, the business was able to grow, and Dell was able to really establish itself as a partner with customers.
"
1067,HP,"""We see that even today. Dell is the IT department for many of its midmarket customers.""
"
1068,HP,"The Round Rock, Texas-based company shook up the PC industry with its custom-built, mail-order business model.
"
1069,HP,"The PC business, which Michael Dell famously started out of his University of Texas dorm room, thrived on his concept of building the machines at low cost to customer specifications using commodity components from high-volume electronics manufacturers. Efficient assembly, logistics and just-in-time inventory management sparked Dell's success.
"
1070,HP,"The streamlined business model enabled Dell to sell at lower prices than others, often 15% or so lower. Some other companies also offered build-to-order PCs at low prices, but were not considered up to par with Dell's quality.
"
1071,HP,"Michael Dell said tailoring personal computers to user preferences would make Dell computers easier to use and troubleshoot. And if users had problems, Dell's customer service was a phone call away.
"
1072,HP,"Turned out he was right. He launched Dell Computer Corp. in 1984 with $1,000 and a few employees. By 1995, the company employed more than 7,000 people in 15 countries and boasted $3.5 billion in sales.
"
1073,HP,"High-End Yet Affordable
"
1074,HP,"The company became known for its relatively affordable but high-quality PCs and reliable customer service — keys to its tremendous success against stalwart rivals such as Compaq Computer, IBM (IBM), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Gateway.
"
1075,HP,"Dell's stock surged a staggering 124,000% from its February 1990 low to its April 2000 peak.
"
1076,HP,"While Dell continues, many of its 1990s PC rivals are gone. HP bought Compaq in 2001. IBM sold its PC business to China's Lenovo in 2005. China's Acer bought Gateway in 2007.
"
1077,HP,"Dell's secret to its longtime success in the corporate market goes back to the strong relationships it formed with customers, analysts say.
"
1078,HP,"""That was a very big differentiator for Dell ... . It helped Dell to keep a pulse on its customers and what they needed with their technology,"" Macomber said.
"
1079,HP,"Michael Dell conducted his own due diligence by surfing the Internet to gather insight on market trends, speaking directly with customers to find out how they use technology, and walking around at trade shows testing out the latest technology.
"
1080,HP,"""In an industry that changes as fast as ours, where product innovation is a constant, if you don't know how your customer feels you're in trouble,"" Michael Dell told IBD in a 1996 interview. ""It's important to deal directly with the customer.""
"
1081,HP,"He also made sure to keep the communication lines open within the company, bringing brown-bag lunches and discussing strategy with employees.
"
1082,HP,"""My job is to communicate what's going on inside the company and make employees feel proud,"" he said in '96. ""I try to develop an environment that's self-critical and challenging, and encourage people to speak up.""
"
1083,HP,"In 1992, the then-27-year-old became the youngest chief executive to run a Fortune 500 company. As CEO, he earned a reputation as a straight-shooter who knew his stuff but didn't crave the spotlight.
"
1084,HP,"In presentations to analysts, ""my feeling is that I'm getting the truth, not spin,"" Kurt King, an analyst with Montgomery Securities at the time, told IBD in 1996. ""With other CEOs, you sometimes get campaign speeches, and you have to discount some of what they say.
"
1085,HP,"Yet for many years, the company's build-to-order computers were not attractive to consumers, since some key components, including the Intel (INTC) chips that it mostly used, could be expensive, making PCs often too pricey for most consumers.
"
1086,HP,"Asked by IBD in a 1995 interview if the company was missing out by not catering to consumers, Michael Dell responded: ""Given the multitude of options we have, we see the consumer market as the least attractive of them. We're more focused on expanding in the business market. Dell is outgrowing the industry and key competitors in a profitable way. If we weren't, then that would be a more interesting question.""
"
1087,HP,"'Dude' TV Commercials
"
1088,HP,"Dell, though, became a force in the consumer market in the early 2000s, when it started running TV commercials with the popular catchphrase, ""Dude, you're getting a Dell!""
"
1089,HP,"But businesses still accounted for the bulk of its sales, and as PC spending by companies began to slow in the mid- to late 2000s, so did the PC maker's revenue growth.
"
1090,HP,"Michael Dell resigned as CEO in 2004 but remained chairman as he handed the reins to Kevin Rollins. In 2007, Rollins stepped down and Michael Dell became chief again.
"
1091,HP,"That same year, the company finally began selling Dell systems through retailers, enabling potential customers to see, touch and try out PCs and laptops before making a purchase.
"
1092,HP,"In his return as CEO, Dell made management changes, closed plants and cut jobs. Then, in February 2013, Michael Dell and Silver Lake Partners announced a $24.4 billion leveraged buyout, taking the company private. The deal closed in October, 25 years after Dell first went public.
"
1093,HP,"Today, besides PC competitors such as HP, Acer, Asus and Lenovo, Dell faces Apple (AAPL) and Google 's (GOOGL) Android on the consumer tablet front.
"
1094,HP,"Dell's commercial business is still larger than its consumer segment.
"
1095,HP,"""Dell was not able to get ahead of these trends and so as a result, for example, its consumer notebook market share was declining quite rapidly, particularly in 2012,"" Macomber said. ""It re-entered the entry tablet space last year, so we think this will help them in the consumer marketplace.""
"
1096,HP,"Dell might face some tough sledding as it tries to grow share in the consumer market, but its customer-engagement reputation could again become the differentiator as it competes in tablets, software and other newer markets.
"
1097,HP,"""I think Dell is going to be certainly a competitor to watch over the next couple of years,"" Macomber said. ""It's a private company now, so this means that it has a lot more leeway to act strategically on a longer time horizon.

1241,HP,"Hewlett-Packard has stepped up investments in cloud computing, prompting some analysts to speculate that it could make a big move such as acquiring Rackspace Hosting.That, however, would require HP (HPQ) to ratchet up its spending significantly, since Rackspace (RAX) could sell for $6 billion or $7 billion.HP in May said that it plans to spend $1 billion over the next two years to develop cloud products and services. At an annual conference for business customers in Las Vegas this month, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP said that it will expand from two data centers to 25 by the end of 2015. The data centers will be packed with servers and data-storage systems that customers rent via the cloud.HP is playing catch-up to Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), in the cloud field known as Infrastructure as a Service. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL) and IBM (IBM) also are IaaS leaders.As in the case of IBM and other traditional IT suppliers, HP's sales of hardware and software could slow as more companies opt to rent computing technology rather than build new data centers of their own. That's why expanding into IaaS and related cloud products and services is a good move for HP, analysts say. HP stock is up nearly 25% in 2014 as the company is two years into its turnaround plan.Rackspace sells cloud services, including extra customer support and custom tools, as well as self-serve, on-demand IaaS products. The company is a co-developer, with NASA, of the open-source OpenStack cloud operating system.Would acquiring Rackspace, which has a market cap of $5.2 billion, boost HP's cloud strategy? Views are mixed.""It's possible that HP will decide to do something foolish, but I don't think Rackspace is a logical acquisition. Rackspace really hasn't been successful selling OpenStack to the enterprise,"" Lydia Leong, an analyst with market-research firm Gartner, told IBD. ""It would be a $6 billion to $7 billion acquisition.""And if HP were to spend so much on an acquisition, it could get a lot more for that money, Leong says.HP, IBM and Red Hat (RHT) are among companies that have embraced OpenStack, which helps companies connect private data centers to the public cloud.Large companies, though, have been slow to move big computing workloads to OpenStack. Amazon and others, meanwhile, have different cloud software.Some Pluses To Merger""An HP/Rackspace combination could drive favorable top-line synergies by combining Rackspace's strong brand in the cloud/hosting segment with HP's established enterprise sales channels as well as greater momentum in OpenStack, which both companies are actively sponsoring,"" Jonathan Atkin, an RBC Capital analyst, said in a recent research report.""However, Rackspace's lack of a highly automated (cloud) platform compared to earlier hosting/cloud takeout targets could present an additional operating challenge in the eyes of a potential acquirer,"" Atkin wrote.IBM acquired IaaS firm SoftLayer for $2 billion last year after taking a look at Rackspace, analysts say.Last month, San Antonio-based Rackspace hired Morgan Stanley to explore strategic options, including a sale or partnership. Rackspace's year-over-year earnings have fallen the past four quarters amid slowing revenue growth.Rackspace has been hurt by severe price cutting in the IaaS market, analysts say. AWS, by far the biggest IaaS company, in particular has been slashing prices.However, Jim Breen, an analyst at William Blair, sees Rackspace's OpenStack as possibly valuable for a potential acquirer.""Rackspace has had difficulty keeping pace with Amazon Web Services and with monetizing OpenStack's nascent popularity,"" Breen said in a research report. ""OpenStack is still in the early innings of paid deployment, and Rackspace lacks the enterprise reach of many of its competitors, namely Red Hat, VMware (VMW), HP and Microsoft.""Because Rackspace operates the largest production deployment of OpenStack and is the second-largest public cloud provider to AWS, it could be a strategic asset to other companies in the OpenStack ecosystem, such as AT&T (T), IBM, EMC (EMC), HP and VMware.""Most OpenStack supporters are pushing a hybrid cloud-computing model, which meshes both private and public infrastructure. Some business apps stay behind a private corporate-security firewall, but companies can access public IaaS providers for on-demand services.Gartner's Leong says that HP has hundreds of its own software engineers already working on OpenStack, one reason why it doesn't need Rackspace.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan says that Rackspace has been augmenting its OpenStack-based platform with more VMware-compatible offerings.Some analysts say that Rackspace's market cap and asking price might put off HP and other possible buyers. Horan speculates that Rackspace might sell in the low to mid $50 per share range.""At around $7 billion, Rackspace would require a significant commitment,"" said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich, who has a neutral rating on Rackspace stock.Cisco Systems (CSCO) last month signaled that it is not interested in buying Rackspace.Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, downgraded Rackspace on Friday to underperform.""With the stock now trading at an enterprise value of approximately 7.5 times our 2015 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) estimate, we believe the valuation is more than fair for the ongoing cloud business, given the growth profile,"" Kelleher said in a research note.

1243,HP,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is expected late Wednesday to report triple-digit earnings growth for the second consecutive quarter, but revenue growth is forecast to hit record deceleration.For its fiscal Q4 2015, the consensus of 34 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Palo Alto Networks pulling in 25 cents earnings per share ex items, up 127% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Revenue is forecast to increase 44% up to $256.25 million.While still robust, the revenue increase would be Palo Alto Networks' smallest percentage gain since the company's IPO in December 2010. Over the past year, the Silicon Valley firm has posted revenue growth above the 50%-mark every quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks has handily beat consensus earnings and revenue estimates every quarter this year.Wall Street's Q4 forecast mostly mirrored the company's. During its Q3 earnings conference call, Palo Alto Networks guided to between 24 and 25 cents non-GAAP EPS on $252 million to $256 million in revenue.CEO Mark McLaughlin expressed revenue optimism during a recent company sales event, Wells Fargo analyst Gray Powell wrote in a research report.McLaughlin claimed revenue would breach $2 billion over the next two years, Powell wrote.The growth will happen organically, McLaughlin said. But, Powell points out, analysts don't see Palo Alto Networks nearing the $2 billion line. For the year, the consensus models $900.6 million in revenue.""PANW's unofficial target is some 20% above current Street forecasts and implies 40% per year growth vs. the Street (estimate) at 29% for the next two years,"" Powell wrote.Powell acknowledged the comments were likely aspirational, but ""we view the fact they were made just three weeks after the close of FQ4 '15 as an indication that current trends remain strong.""The company's position on Wall Street hasn't been strong recently, however. Palo Alto Networks stock has declined 18% over the past six weeks vs. the Nasdaq drop of 8%.Powell saw the silver lining.""We think this creates a compelling entry point into a high quality/high growth security company that benefits from favorable secular trends,"" he wrote.Palo Alto Networks' marketing efforts have paid off, Powell wrote. Currently, the marketing focus is on endpoint software Traps, the next generation firewall and WildFire, a cloud-based malware analysis machine, he wrote.Powell maintained his outperform rating on Palo Alto Networks stock.Palo Alto Networks closed up fractionally Friday at 162.39. With the market in a correction, Palo Alto stock dropped 3.3% for the week after hitting a four-month low at 140.39 on Aug. 24.The same day, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group fell 3.4%, hitting a seven-month low.Palo Alto Networks leads the group with a 97 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.

The company has struggled vs. bigger rivals like Amazon Web Services, the cloud services unit of Amazon.com (AMZN), amid intensifying price competition.""We believe that if Rackspace announces it is selling, a deal would be done for at least 43 (per share), which would represent 10 times estimated 2014 EBITDA, but if it announces it is not selling the stock, could reach as low as 26, which would mirror its previous 52-week low,"" Colby Synesael, a Cowen analyst, wrote in a research report Monday.Rackspace's high market value, near $4.8 billion, is a drawback for most possible buyers, say several analysts, including Mark Kelleher of DA Davidson.""We do not believe Rackspace Hosting possesses enough proprietary intellectual property to motivate a buyer to spend over $5 billion to purchase the Rackspace Hosting cloud business,"" he wrote in a research note Monday. ""As take-out fever continues to subside, we believe the stock will return to its pre-Morgan Stanley announcement levels (near 30).""Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) has stepped up investments in cloud computing, but analysts have mixed views on whether a Rackspace acquisition makes sense for HP.Rackspace is co-developer, with NASA, of the open-source OpenStack cloud operating system.Aside from AWS, Rackspace competes with Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and IBM (IBM) in the cloud field known as infrastructure as a service. Rackspace also sells Web hosting services.Citigroup, in a June 19 report, speculated that phone company CenturyLink (CTL) could acquire Rackspace. CenturyLink bought Savvis, a Web hosting and cloud company, for $2.5 billion in 2011. CenturyLink took a $1.1. billion impairment charge in Q3 2013 related to the Savvis acquisition.""We think Rackspace would be valuable to CenturyLink as it would give them exposure to OpenStack, but it may prove difficult to fold into their current portfolio,"" Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan wrote in a research note.Analysts had speculated that AT&T (T) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) were also among potential buyers.Cowen's Synesael says that the number of potential buyers may be dwindling.""While we believe a deal remains likely, in recent weeks the size of potential buyers seems to have narrowed, with at least IBM and Cisco indicating they have less interest in a deal,"" he said.

1310,HP,"Hewlett-Packard is on the hunt.The computer product and service giant is looking to reaccelerate growth in part by acquiring cloud, mobile, Big Data and security firms. Analysts, though, don't expect any overnight miracles.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) CEO Meg Whitman listed all of the above target areas during a Feb. 20 conference call with analysts to discuss its fiscal Q2 earnings.All are sectors where HP is playing catch-up, says Bill Kreher, an analyst for Edward Jones.""Meg basically gave you a laundry list of all of the buzzwords in tech right now, and Hewlett-Packard will certainly have to make meaningful acquisitions in order to have a presence in those growing markets,"" Kreher told IBD.HP's acquisition push into newer areas looks to offset generally declining sales in its core PC and printing units.Those two businesses combined represent half HP's total revenue, so their decline has led to 10 straight quarters of year-over-year drops in overall revenue.HP has little choice but to try to buy into those fastest-growing technology segments, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald. ""They are absolutely right to do it,"" he told IBD. ""They don't have the products, but a lot of guys have good stuff already, like IBM (IBM), (which) has a phenomenal Big Data analytics platform.""Whitman says HP expects to have free cash flow, or cash profit, of $6.5 billion at the close of its fiscal 2014 ending Oct. 31.$3.5 Billion For AcquisitionsShebly Seyrafi, an analyst for FBN Securities, says the figure could be closer to $7 billion, which he says leaves $3.5 billion for mergers and acquisitions and half for dividends and share repurchases.""The way to think about logical candidates for HP are companies that have $3.5 billion or less of a market cap and are in the security, mobility, Big Data or cloud areas,"" he told IBD.He says security candidates include Fortinet (FTNT), Proofpoint (PFPT), Imperva (IMPV), Aruba Networks (ARUN) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS).Tibco Software (TIBX), with its market cap of $3.6 billion, could also be a candidate. The company makes middleware and infrastructure software. But Seyrafi says Teradata (TDC), a data analytics and management company, would likely be too expensive with its $7.5 billion market cap.The values of some takeover candidates have risen on speculation that Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM), in addition to HP, will likely step up their M&A activity, Kreher said. ""All of these large conglomerates are looking at the same companies, which is pushing market values higher,"" he said.HP's stock, meanwhile, has generally been rising since touching a 10-year low in November 2012, as investors bet Whitman can forge a turnaround. HP stock is trading near a 30-month high of 32.41 that it touched on Thursday.But HP's recent acquisitions have been hit and miss.Its biggest blunder might be Autonomy, a U.K.-based search software maker that HP acquired for $10.3 billion in 2011.In 2012 HP took an $8.8 billion write-down on the deal, while charging its former managers with fraud.HP has seemingly fared better with Vertica, a data analytics software company it acquired for an undisclosed sum in 2011.Though HP's software revenue fell 3.7% in its Q1 ended Jan. 31 vs. the year-earlier period, HP CFO Cathie Lesjak noted in the company's earnings conference call last month that Vertica and security ""gained traction"" in the company's Big Data business.HP has also received favorable reviews for its acquisition of 3Par, a maker of systems and software for data storage and information management. It acquired 3Par for $2.35 billion in 2010.Buying 3Par let HP offer converged storage architecture to handle growing customer demand for cloud and virtualized applications, says Crawford Del Prete, an analyst for market tracker IDC.""HP had a problem; they had this virtualized application product that was old and needed to be refreshed, and they didn't have the IT to do it, so buying 3Par was superimportant because it allowed them to improve their product line significantly,"" he said. ""3Par is a huge part of reaccelerating the revenue growth.""But HP's acquisition strategy is likely more about preparing for the long haul than a quick fix for its declining revenue, Seyrafi says.""They are a very big company, so a $3.5 billion market cap security company is not going to swing the needle that much,"" he said.Today's acquisitions could make all the difference for whether HP succeeds or fails several years from now, says White.Acquisitions today ""are not going to matter in the near term,"" he said. ""It's more of 'Let's build the pieces (now) so that in five years we are not totally irrelevant.'""

Some of these companies showcased products at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.HP plans to enter the higher-priced commercial market.""While it remains to be seen which type of printer technology the firm will ultimately roll out, we believe the firm will focus on the enterprise and industrial segment, and leverage its existing printing-head technology and distribution channel to become a formidable player in this market over time,"" Daryanani wrote.""We continue to see the 3D printing market growing at around a 24% compound annual growth rate from 2013-2021, to become a $15 billion industry, fueled by lower average selling prices, increased industry awareness, increased ability to manufacture production-grade parts,"" he said.RELATED: HP Fiscal Q1 Earnings Beat, But Not Enough.

1339,HP,"Investors had an unpleasant surprise for ServiceNow after the fast-growing enterprise software company released Q1 earnings late on April 23 that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The company also provided a stronger-than-expected outlook for the current quarter.Yet ServiceNow stock fell more than 6% on April 24, and fell the following two days as well.The investor reaction perplexed ServiceNow (NOW) CEO Frank Slootman, whose company is taking share from larger rivals including CA Technologies (CA) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) in IT service management software.""I don't think in all my years of doing this kind of thing that have I ever seen anything remotely close to it,"" Slootman told IBD . ""It all goes under the motto of 'no good deed goes unpunished.' Investor sentiment is in turmoil right now and it really has nothing to do with our business or our company.""ServiceNow's results, with sales up 62% from the year-earlier quarter, were exceptional, says Matthew Hedberg, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets.""They couldn't have done much more in the quarter,"" he said.But ServiceNow wasn't alone.Highflying software companies such as Tableau Software (DATA), Splunk (SPLK), Workday (WDAY) and Salesforce.com (CRM) have seen their stocks dive this year despite strong quarterly earnings and outlooks.Shares of ServiceNow were down 9% this year through Tuesday before rallying 16% the rest of the week. Salesforce's stock has declined 6%. Tableau, a fast grower in the data analytics market, is down 12% this year. Workday, a leader in the human capital management market, is down 3%. The Nasdaq composite index is up 3.5%.High ValuationsInvestors generally appear to be nervous about the high valuations in the sector — all of the above companies are in the red except Salesforce — rather than any specific fundamental issues, says Kirk Materne, an analyst for Evercore Partners. Also, the young software stocks tend to move up and down more greatly than older legacy software stocks, he points out.""It's more of a general nervousness around some of the higher beta stocks and tech in general,"" he said.Older tech stalwarts such as Oracle (ORCL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and HP are up this year despite recent quarters with decelerating or declining sales and EPS.Investors are placing a higher premium on size and stability rather than fast growth — for now, says Karl Keirstead, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.""You are seeing a growth-to-value rotation,"" he said. ""What is hurting Workday is the flipside of what is helping Oracle.""Splunk might the biggest victim among the highflier group.Splunk stock is down 37% this year, after falling 16% the day after its recent Q1 earnings soundly beat views.The magnitude of Splunk's sell-off is out of the company's hands, says Brian White, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald.""It's the cycle of the stock, the stock is in a bad mood,"" White said. ""There was really nothing in the (Q1) report that wasn't good. It was a very solid report.""Splunk raised its revenue forecast for the year from $400 million to $402 million-$410 million. Analysts had modeled for $406.9 million, slightly above Splunk's midpoint.The company's forecast could be construed as light, but there likely are bigger forces at work, says J. Derrick Wood, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group.""The shorts are winning over the longs right now,"" he said. ""The issue there is a re-evaluation for these high-growth assets. Where that value should fall is what the market is trying to figure out.""Prior to the sell-off, on Feb. 26 Tableau's stock reached an all-time high of 101.86 a share, or 13 times above the $476.2 million that analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project for 2015.Workday's peak price of 116.47 on Feb. 27 was roughly 19 times its expected revenue of $1.09 billion for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Splunk's all-time high of 106.15, set on Feb. 28, was 29 times the $547.5 million revenue that analysts had projected for its fiscal year ending on or near Jan. 31, 2016.Those valuations have come down to earth. After Friday's close, Splunk's stock was trading near nine times revenue for its next fiscal year, with Workday at 13.5 times revenue and Tableau at eight times revenue.Over the past 15 years, ""growth company"" stocks have seen a mean average of eight times projected revenue, with anything near 20 among the highest, says Daniel Ives, an analyst for FBR Capital Markets.Those high valuations can make investors nervous, Ives says.""Once they start to sell off, it starts to be like yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater,"" he said.Where Is The Sweet Spot?As Deutsche Bank's Keirstead puts it, investors in cloud software companies are still struggling to find prices they are comfortable with.""You are seeing a re-evaluation of the growth software sector and that is why these stocks are struggling,"" Keirstead said.Legacy vendors, meanwhile, are up despite their own struggles.Oracle, Cisco and Microsoft are each up 11% this year, while HP is up 21%.All four companies are in various stages of some sort of reorganization or reprioritization, looking to recharge growth.Investors are attracted to these companies for varying reasons, Keirstead says.""In the case of Oracle, their total revenue growth rate in the most recent reported quarter was actually the highest in three years,"" he said.

The bottom line also compared favorably with the year-ago adjusted loss of 41 cents.Revenues of $564.1 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $538 million. Further the top line witnessed an increase of more than 53% from the year-ago number of $368.6 million. Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

While average rig revenue per operating day was $22,400 — 10.7% below the year-ago period — average rig margin per day was down 7.6% to $8,854. However, utilization levels of 57% in the quarter under review (versus 31% in first-quarter fiscal 2017) resulted in an operating income of 24.7 million at the segment marking a turn around from the year-ago loss of $30.9 million.Offshore: Helmerich & Payne’s Offshore revenues came in at $33.4 million compared with $33.8 million in the prior-year quarter. Daily average rig revenue rose 14.2% to $35,776 and average rig margin per day rose 18.1% to $12,375. Owing to this, the segment’s operating income increased 28.6% to $8.7 million. However, rig utilization came down from the year-ago level of 78% to 63%.International Land: Helmerich & Payne’s International Land operations generated revenues of $63.2 million, down slightly from $68 million in the previous-year quarter.

1374,HP,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is set to release fiscal first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Jan 25.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 38.1% on the back of higher drilling activities in the North American markets. Further, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.93% in the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. QuoteWhich Way Are Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents for the quarter under review has been stable over the last seven days. It reflects a narrower loss of about 65.8% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $538 million for the quarter, up 45.8% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of October to December-quarter 2017 were $60.46 per barrel, up about 19.6% sequentially amid tightening supplies, improving demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks. The drilling contractor is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices.Helmerich & Payne’s industry leading drilling fleet including its advanced FlexRig along with its term contracts with well-capitalized oil majors poise the company to report strong revenues. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the revenues of Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment — U.S. Land — is pegged at $453 million compared with $439.4 million in the prior quarter.The International and Offshore segments are also expected to witness improvement in their revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich & Payne’s international and offshore segment revenues are pegged at $58 million and $33.2 million respectively, reflecting a sequential rise of 5.4% and 2.2%.The company also has a solid balance sheet with impressive leverage and liquidity ratios giving Helmerich & Payne enough financial flexibility to take advantage of the recovering energy landscape.However, declining margins remains a concern and is likely to offset the optimism surrounding the stock. The company’s average rig margins in the U.S. Land segment have been compressing considerably. Thought the fleet utilization has been improving, the firm’s margin in its the Land segment has plunged from over $17,000 in fiscal 2016 to around $8,000 in fiscal 2017. The trend is likely to continue in the coming period as well.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus estimate for the average rig margin in the U.S. Land segment is pegged at $7,610 as against the reported level of $8,039 in the prior quarter. The declining margins are likely to dent the earnings of the most significant segment of the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +11.62%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 13 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 14 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterZacks Rank: However, Helmerich & Payne’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Energy Stocks with Favorable CombinationThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Helmerich & Payne, here are some companies from the same industry which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter.Noble Corp. (NE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.55% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release fourth-quarter earnings results on Feb 21.

1375,HP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a higher-than-expected weekly draw to the lowest level since 2015. On a further bullish note, domestic oil production snapped its steadily rising trend and fell for the first time since October.But the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was partly offset by another build in gasoline and distillate supplies.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures edged up 0.3% (or 20 cents) to end at $59.84 per barrel yesterday – within touching distance of the more-than-two-year highs reached earlier in the week.Energy Stocks on a RollWith the federal data showing the sixth consecutive week of U.S. stockpiles decline, energy stocks have been in a strong uptrend lately.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) added 2.9% and 7%, respectively, in the past month. Meanwhile, some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 during the period were oil and oil-related stocks like Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report) and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels for the week ending Dec 22, following a decrease of 6.5 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.5 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand and decline in U.S. output for the first time in more than two months led to the larger-than-expected stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 30 of the last 38 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 431.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 11.1% below the year-ago period and the lowest since 2015 though they are in the middle of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.6 million barrels to 51.4 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 25.6 days in the previous week to 25.2 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 29.4 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the seventh straight week on strong production. The 591,000 barrels addition – less than the polled number of 1.3 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 228.8 million barrels. Following last week’s increase, the stock of the most widely used petroleum product is now up 0.6% year over year and is also above the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) was up 1.1 million barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 780,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The surprise weekly rise could be attributed to higher output. At 129.9 million barrels, current supplies are 14.3% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 1.6% from the prior week to 95.7%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, HollyFrontier Corp.

1376,HP,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices lost ground.On the news front, U.S. energy major Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) set its investment budget for 2018 at $18.3 billion, down 4% from its projected spending this year. Meanwhile, Bill Barrett Corp.  and Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) struck separate acquisition deals.Overall, it was a dismal week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost about 1.7% to close at $57.36 per barrel, while natural gas prices slumped 9.4% to $2.772 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Exxon's Restructuring, Shell's Cash Dividend Resumption & More)Notwithstanding OPEC and other major producers’ agreement to expand their output-cut deal beyond March – for another nine months to the end of 2018 – the U.S. oil benchmark dropped to its lowest settlement since Nov 16.The major culprit was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. In fact, U.S. output rose by 25,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. A massive build in gasoline supplies also played spoilsport.Meanwhile, natural gas futures sunk to their lowest finish since Oct 27 following a surprise increase in supplies and predictions of warmer-than-normal weather (translating into weak heating gas demand) over the next few days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Chevron Corporation offered a glimpse of its 2018 capital spending plans.The company has set its capital and exploratory budget at $18.3 billion, down by 4% from its 2017 projected investment of less than $19 billion. Next year's budget is also around 18% lower than the company’s 2016 spending of $22.4 billion and down 46% from the 2015 expenditure of $34 billion.Revised downward for the fifth consecutive year, the second-biggest U.S. oil and gas group's cut in capital spending reflects Chevron's plans to optimize its expenses, while relying increasingly on shale drilling.Of the American multinational's total 2018 capital expenditure, a little over 86% is planned to be incurred in its upstream operations. In particular, Chevron is concentrating on increasing its investment in shale as it strives to boost its U.S. shale production next year.For 2018, the company intends to spend $4.3 billion in shale – up 70% year over year – the lion's share (or $3.3 billion) going to the lucrative Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico alone. The remaining $1 billion has been set aside for other shale investments.Overall, the oil giant plans to shell out $6.6 billion for its domestic upstream operations. An additional $9.2 billion will target international upstream projects. (Read more: Where Will Chevron Spend the Bulk of Its 2018 Capex?)2.    Shares of the upstream player Bill Barrett Corp. declined about 4% on Dec 5 after the company announced plans to acquire the private energy firm Fifth Creek Energy Company, LLC. Shares of Bill Barrett further plunged 18.71% to eventually close at $4.65 on Dec 6.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s plans to issue common stock to repay Fifth Creek’s debt did not find much favor among investors. However, despite the stock dilution, the combined entity is poised for long-term growth on increased scale and synergies. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The acquisition transaction is valued at $649 million based on the closing price of Bill Barrett’s shares on Dec 4. Subject to satisfactory conditions and shareholder’s approval, the transaction is set for closure by the first or second quarter of 2018.Post the acquisition, the new combined entity will be listed on the exchange under the name “New BBG” with both Bill Barrett and Fifth Creek becoming its subsidiaries. Mr. Scott Woodall, President and CEO of Bill Barrett, will continue to serve at the same positions of the combined entity.Fifth Creek will receive 100 million shares of the New BBG. Along with that, the transaction value also includes the assumption of $54 million of Fifth Creek’s debt by Bill Barrett.

However, the terms of the deal have been kept under wraps. Contract drilling services provider Helmerich and Payne remains focused on increasing directional drilling. Earlier this year, the company had acquired Dallas-based drilling tech firm MOTIVE Drilling Technologies, Inc. for around $75 million.Established in 2010, MagVAR provides technological assistance pertaining to directional drilling to energy explorers and drillers. The technology is utilized in both onshore and offshore fields in Asia, North America, South America, Europe and Africa.With the help of comprehensive 3-D geomagnetic reference modeling, MagVAR aims at the identification and the elimination of the anomalies in real-time, thus improving the accuracy of directional drilling process. It will help to enhance well production and lower drilling costs.The acquisition will improve the directional drilling process and will enable Helmerich & Payne to drill wells more efficiently and accurately leading to better quality wellbore.

(ECR  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal with private operator Travis Peak Resources LLC to acquire the latter’s north-central Pennsylvania assets. Post the announcement, shares of the company rose more than 6% to eventually close at $2.28 on Dec 11.Per the deal, Eclipse Resources will acquire 44,500 net acres in Tioga and Potter counties of Pennsylvania in an all-equity deal valued at $93.7 million, thus maintaining its leverage and liquidity metrics. Subject to satisfactory closing conditions, the transaction is set for closure by January 2018.In a separate transaction, Eclipse Resources agreed to acquire Cardinal NE Holdings, LLC for 18.3 million in cash. The deal will entitle Eclipse Resources to gain midstream assets and related gathering infrastructure in the acquired acreage.The Travis Peak acquisition will add around 87 net drilling locations and boost the company’s Utica dry gas acreage by approximately 85%. The acquisition includes one proved developed producing well with production capacity of 6.5 million cubic feet per day.5.    Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) and Phillips 66 (PSX  -  Free Report) plan to gauge shippers’ interest in transporting significant volumes of liquid, through Gray Oak Pipeline, to the Gulf Coast market from Permian Basin of West Texas. The to-be-built pipeline’s open season has been announced on Dec 11.As per the firms’ estimates, the Gray Oak Pipeline will initially have a daily throughput capacity of 385,000 barrels. If shippers show significant interest, Phillips 66 and Enbridge will think of expanding capacity.The Gray Oak Pipeline will likely commence operations by the second half of 2019. Investors should know that the pipeline system will open access to shippers and crude producers for transporting liquid to oil refining facilities and export terminals.Price Performance The following table shows the price movement of some the major oil and gas players over the past week and during the last 6 months.CompanyLast Week Last 6 MonthsXOM-0.8%+1.1%CVX+0.8%+13.2%COP+1.4%+15.3%OXY-2.3%+13.9%SLB+1.1%-7.3%RIG-2.3%+13.3%VLO+2.3%+33.6%ANDV+5.3%+20.9% Shrugging off the week’s bearish oil market sentiment, the Energy Select Sector SPDR – a popular way to track energy companies – generated a +0.3% return last week.

1378,HP,"We issued an updated research report on drilling contractor Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) on Oct 5. The company’s industry-leading drilling fleet, comprising advanced FlexRigs, and drill operating expertise lend it an edge over its peers. However, volatile oil and gas prices remain overhangs on the stock.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), implying that the stock will perform in line with the broader U.S. equity market over the next one to three months.Helmerich & Payne is a major land and offshore drilling contractor in the western hemisphere, having the youngest and most efficient drilling fleet. The company specializes in shallow to deep drilling in oil and gas-producing basins of the United States and international locations.The contract driller is relatively immune to economic turmoil as it has contracts with well-capitalized oil majors and larger independent companies. Additionally, term contracts and shale drilling demand for its rigs have helped Helmerich & Payne maintain a relatively high level of utilization.Helmerich & Payne’s technologically-advanced FlexRigs are the key to its success. These rigs help drive its count of active rigs and maintain relatively strong daily-rate margin even during periods of market uncertainty.Despite these factors, the company has lost 23.9% over the past year, underperforming the 19.3% downfall of the industry.Also, though oil prices have recovered from its historic lows, it is way below the mid-2014 level. Thus, many energy companies have been forced to cut spending (particularly on the costly upstream projects) on the back of lower profit margin. This, in turn, means less work for contract drillers like Helmerich & Payne.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked players in the energy sector are Par Pacific Holdings Inc. (PARR  -  Free Report), Transmontaigne Partners LP (TLP  -  Free Report) and Lonestar Resources US Inc. (LONE  -  Free Report). All the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

The company delivered a strong 97% economic utilization of its floater fleet and 98% on its jack-up fleet. However, the bottom line deteriorated from year-ago adjusted earnings of 59 cents per share owing to lower revenues and high restructuring costsTotal operating revenues of $577 million in the reported quarter was down 34% from $868 million in second-quarter 2016. Lower revenues are attributed to the lower day rates along with West Tucana and Sevan Louisiana drillships which remained idle during the quarter.EBITDA in the reported quarter was $264 million, as compared with $557 million in the year-ago quarter.Seadrill Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Seadrill Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Seadrill Limited QuoteSegmental AnalysisFloaters: This segment reported revenues of $375 million compared with $610 million in the year-ago quarter. Net operating income was $46 million as compared to the prior-year quarter figure of $270 million.  Jack-up Rigs: The segment registered revenues of $179 million as against $234 million in the prior-year quarter. The segment reported a net operating loss of $148 million as against operating income of $92 million in the year ago quarter.Other: Revenues of $23 million were lower than $24 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Operating income of $2 million remained unchanged from the year ago quarter. BacklogAs of Aug 24, total order backlog at SeaDrill was $3.1 billion. This comprised $1.2 billion for the floater fleet and $1.9 billion for the Jack-up fleet. The average contract duration is 10 months for floaters and 30 months for Jack-ups.ExpensesSeaDrill incurred operating expenses of $517 million in the reported quarter, reflecting a marginal increase from the year-ago quarter level of $509 million. The decrease is primarily attributed to the lower vessel and rig operating expenses which was partly offset by increasing general/administrative and depreciation costs.Capital Expenditure & Balance SheetAs of Jun 30, 2017, SeaDrill — which counts Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) and Ensco plc (ESV  -  Free Report) as some of its peers —had cash and cash equivalents of $1,345 million and long-term debt of $5,284 million. The debt-to-capitalization ratio was approximately 35.9%.        GuidanceThe company projects second-quarter EBITDA to decrease to $175 million due to a couple of drilling rigs which are expected to become idle including West Tucana and Sevan Louisiana. Lower day rates and higher restructuring costs are also likely to adversely impact the EBITDA. The company forecasts net income of $40 million in the second quarter.Restructuring UpdatesSeaDrill which reported a net loss of $15 million in the quarter and is battling with huge debt and liabilities is in advanced discussions with lenders regarding the restructuring of debts. The company is likely to file for Chapter 11 within three weeks. In July 2017, the company reached an agreement with its bank group to extend the date to Sep 12 by which a comprehensive restructuring plan must be agreed upon.On Aug 15, SeaDrill — which carries a Zacks Rank #3(Hold) — announced the completion of the amendment of three credit facilities to protect its subsidiary Seadrill Partners LLC from going bankrupt. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. With the amendment, the partnership sets itself free from the possibility of default by Seadrill restructuring process, wherein the lenders cannot take any action against the partnership’s assets during negotiations.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1380,HP,"International offshore drilling company SeaDrill Limited  is set to release second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 24.In the last quarter, SeaDrill delivered a positive earnings surprise of 220% on the back of cost-cutting initiatives and strong economic utilization of fleets. The company surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 97.13%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Seadrill Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Seadrill Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Seadrill Limited QuoteFactors at PlaySeaDrill – which counts Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) and Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) as some of its peers – is a leading offshore drilling contractor in the world with one of the youngest and most advanced fleets. Further, we appreciate the company’s aggressive cost-cutting initiatives and impressive earnings surprise history. The company has also been awarded a number of contracts lately.SeaDrill recently won a contract from Statoil ASA   for exploration drilling in Santos Basin. The offshore driller's subsidiary – North Atlantic Drilling – also secured a contract for semi-submersible West Hercules to work in the UK. Uptick in drilling contracts bodes well for the company which already has a robust backlog of over $3.5 billion.However, the company’s price performance lacks luster. Over the last one year, SeaDrill’s stock has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to. During the aforesaid period, SeaDrill’s shares have tanked more than 89%, compared with the 36% decline for the broader industry.Debt woes and bankruptcy fears are likely to hurt SeaDrill's near-term business to a considerable extent. SeaDrill, being one of the worst sufferers of the industry’s downturn, has the maximum debt in the oil rig industry. The company has been contemplating restructuring measures under bankruptcy for quite some time now and cautioned shareholders for the second time of severe losses due to the same. The company restated that current common stockholders will have minimal recovery, suggesting that debt holders will get the majority of the equity holdings even if the restructuring takes place.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that SeaDrill will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at a loss of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: SeaDrill currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1381,HP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded its biggest drop since Sep on continued strong refinery runs. With oil supplies falling for the seventh week, investor sentiment has turned slightly positive on dissipating fears about a meltdown to sub-$40 levels. Analysts also believe that the trend, if sustained, could help tighten the market significantly.However, the positive effect from the hefty crude inventory draw was more than offset by the steadily rising domestic oil output that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market. At 9.502 million barrels a day, production is at the highest level in more than two years, thereby cancelling out cuts from OPEC and its allies. Surprise builds in refined product inventories – gasoline and distillate – added to the pessimism.As a result, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures shed 1.6% (or 77 cents) to $46.78 per barrel Wednesday.Investors Dump Energy StocksThe federal data sparked widespread selling in energy stocks, which pushed the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – down almost 1% Wednesday.The two energy representatives in the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report) were down 0.7%. Meanwhile, some of the biggest casualties of the S&P 500 were oil and oil-related stocks like Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. (DO  -  Free Report), Hess Corp. (HES  -  Free Report) and Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories slumped by 8.95 million barrels for the week ending August 11, 2017, following a decline of 6.45 million barrels in the previous week.The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 3.6 million barrels. Continued strength in refinery crude runs led to the massive stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer even as domestic production rose to the highest level since Jul 2015.The seventeenth inventory reduction in 19 weeks has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. Nevertheless, U.S. still remains awash with excess oil. At 466.49 million barrels, current crude supplies are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.However, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was up a second week (this time by 678,000 barrels) to 57.05 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 27.4 days in the previous week to 26.7 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 31.2 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second successive week as demand weakened. The nominal 22,000 barrels addition – contrary to the polled number of 400,000 barrels fall in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 231.13 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 0.7% below the year-earlier level but is close to the upper limit of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) went up by 702,000 barrels last week, as opposed to analysts’ expectations for 700,000 barrels decrease in supply level. The first weekly rise in five weeks could be attributed to fall in demand. At 148.39 million barrels, current supplies are 3.1% below the year-ago level but are in the upper half of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization edged down by 0.2% from the prior week’s 12-year highs to 96.1%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Stock to BuyGiven the bearish numbers above, it shouldn't come as a surprise that most of the companies from this space are set to underperform in the near term. Furthermore, the Oil-Energy sector has a Zacks Sector Rank in the bottom 13% (14 out of 16), so there is little hope for a turnaround soon. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)But if you are still looking to stay in this industry for a near term play, Range Resources Corp. (RRC  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

1382,HP,"Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) reported net operating loss per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 – excluding special items – of 18 cents, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 31 cents. The better-than-expected results can be attributed to higher drilling activities, especially in the North American markets. Increased rig margins and operating income from the offshore and international markets also provided an impetus to the results. The bottom line also compares favorably with the year-ago adjusted loss of 47 centsRevenues of $498.5 million were up 36% from the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $440 million.Helmerich & Payne, Inc.

1383,HP,"Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is set to release fiscal third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27.Helmerich & Payne is a major land and offshore drilling contractor in the western hemisphere with the youngest but the most efficient drilling fleet. The company specializes in shallow to deep drilling in oil and gas-producing U.S. basins. It also drills oil and gas at international locations.In the preceding three-month period, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 17.50% mainly on the back of lower drilling activity, especially in the international markets. Further, the company missed estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average negative surprise of 4.24%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. QuoteFactors at play Industry leading drilling fleet including its advanced FlexRig and drill operating expertise give Helmerich & Payne an edge over its peers. Moreover, rising momentum in the North American land market calls for higher revenues for drillers like Helmerich & Payne from the domestic markets which accounts for the major portion of its total revenue.The company also has a solid balance sheet with impressive leverage and liquidity ratios giving Helmerich & Payne enough financial flexibility to sustain through industry downturn and take advantage of any upturn. Moreover, the dividend history of the company is also quite stunning. The company has a record of hiking its dividend every year for 44 years, even in the recent downturn.During the quarter, the company entered into a deal to acquire Dallas-based drilling tech firm MOTIVE Drilling Technologies, Inc. This seems to be a prudent move by Helmerich & Payne as it will enhance the technological expertise of the company further and lead to the addition of shareholders value. The acquisition will improve the directional drilling process and will enable Helmerich & Payne to drill wells more efficiently and accurately leading to better quality wellbore.However, weak oil and gas prices might mar demand for drilling contractors. During the second quarter, oil and natural gas prices declined 8.4% and 5%, respectively. Lower commodity prices might lead to reduced exploration and production activities. This could call for lower investments by oil majors which will impact revenues of equipment supplier companies. This is also reflected in the share price of Helmerich & Payne which witnessed a decline of around 18.5% in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings While earnings beat looks uncertain for Helmerich & Payne, here are some firms in the Oil and gas Drilling industry that you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.

1384,HP,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is a Growth & Income pick that has been soaring to new 52-week highs lately. The company recently announced fiscal first quarter results and its plan to fulfill new build contracts, noting that operating income for the quarter reached a new record level . HPs net profit margin of 26.3% is above the industry average of 22.2%. 
"
1385,HP,"Full Analysis 
"
1386,HP,"Helmerich & Payne, Inc. is primarily a contract drilling company, engaging in the contract drilling of oil and gas wells in the United States and internationally. The company provides drilling rigs, equipment, personnel, and camps on a contract basis to explore for and develop oil and gas from onshore areas and from fixed platforms, tension-leg platforms, and spars in offshore areas. 
"
1387,HP,"This Growth & Income pick performed well in the past and has been soaring to new 52-week highs lately thanks to solid fundamentals and todays hot oil industry. 
"
1388,HP,"The company recently announced fiscal first quarter results and its plan to fulfill new build contracts. HP noted that operating income for the quarter reached a new record level, adding that its continued growth was driven by the U.S. land segment, where revenue days as well as average daily rig revenue and margins were up again sequentially. The strong results more than offset operating income reductions in the company's offshore and international land segments.  
"
1389,HP,"Helmerich & Payne said it has plans to construct eleven additional FlexRigs® to operate under long-term contracts for three exploration and production companies. HP signed three-year term contracts to operate four new FlexRigs in the U.S., and has also signed letters of intent to operate the remaining seven new FlexRigs in Latin American locations. 
"
1390,HP,"The company delivered quarterly earnings per share that exceeded Wall Street estimates by about 5%, and projections for the future are on the rise. Six out of eight covering analysts increased earnings forecasts from last months $3.85 per share to $4.07 for the year ending September 2008. The most accurate estimate is higher at $4.09. 
"
1391,HP,"On the income side, HP stands out in its industry by offering a dividend yield of 0.4% while the majority of the companies in the oil industry do not pay out a dividend. 
"
1392,HP,"The companys net profit margin of 26.3% is also above the industry average of 22.2%. Helmerich & Paynes return on equity (ROE) of 22% is in line with the industry average.
"
1393,HP,"Many people seem to believe that there are some magic numbers out there that equate to stock-picking success. 
"
1394,HP,"Two things in particular that I hear over and over again relates to P/E Ratios and Price/Book Values. 
"
1395,HP,"For some reason, many people believe that P/E Ratios of 20 or less and Price/Book Values of 1 or less are these so-called magic numbers. 
"
1396,HP,"Unfortunately, statistics prove otherwise. 
"
1397,HP,"Looking at the best-performing stocks of 2007 (as qualified by stocks that were trading at $5 or higher at the beginning of the year, traded on average of 50,000 shares a day and had increased in price by 50% or greater by the end of the year), only 36% of those stocks started with P/Es (using 12 mo. EPS Actuals) of under 20. The other 64% were over 20. 
"
1398,HP,"This may or may not sound like a big deal. The point is, though, that if you limited yourself to only those stocks with P/Es under 20, your screen would have kept over 60% of the best-performing stocks off your radar screen. And that IS a big deal. 
"
1399,HP,"True, there were/are stocks in there with P/Es under 20, but you wouldve missed a lot of fantastic winners if you excluded those over 20. 
"
1400,HP,"As for the Price/Book Value, the median P/B was 3.3 at the beginning of the period and over 5 (thats right, 5!) by the end. Percentagewise, only 2% of the stocks had P/Bs of less than 1 at the start. This means that using the magic number of 1 for a P/B value would have excluded nearly every top performer of 2007. 
"
1401,HP,"So if youre determined to look for stocks with low valuations (P/E, P/B), try looking for low valuations as compared to their Industries. 
"
1402,HP,"Why? Because 61% of the stocks on that list of winners had P/Es under the average for their Industry, while 62% had P/Bs under the average for their Industry. This means that the majority of the best companies would have made it through a relative valuation screen, giving you a chance to buy them. 
"
1403,HP,"So instead of thinking about low valuations as an absolute number, try thinking about them as a relative measure. 
"
1404,HP,"Ive found that companies outperforming their Industries on earnings, but are undervalued to their group in terms of valuations, are great candidates. 
"
1405,HP,"So in this weeks screen, Im looking for companies with upward price momentum that are trading over $5; have a minimum average trading volume of 50,000 shares a day; have shown positive EPS growth over the last two quarters greater than their Industrys average; and have lower P/Es and Price/Book Values than their Industrys average.

1406,HP,"There are 10 companies that passed this screen for Tuesday, 2/12/08. Here are three of them:

The rig count is back on the rise and many service companies are finally seeing the turnaround in business as well.Use the Zacks Rank to Find the Top StocksIt’s easy to get overwhelmed looking at your options for investing in “energy.” There are plenty of subgroups within the sector. And even within the subgroups, there are dozens of companies.Take the E&Ps, as an example.Zacks has 77 companies in that industry. That’s a lot.How does an investor differentiate between them all?A good place to start is by using the Zacks Rank to narrow the list.In the E&P industry, 8 stocks are Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buys) and 10 are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). That likely means rising earnings estimates. That’s what you want.From there, you’d have to do your homework to narrow the list even further.Tracey takes a look at some of the top names from various industries within the energy group. It’s not all about the E&Ps on this podcast. There are opportunities in a lot of different areas.5 Energy Stocks to Keep on Your Short List1.       Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) is the big oil superstar right now. It has that coveted Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) along with a forward P/E of just 14.8. It also pays a nice dividend, currently yielding 3.5%. Big oil stocks, with their sizable dividends, are a conservative play on crude’s rebound.2.       Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. (BCEI  -  Free Report) is a small cap E&P that is not in the Permian Basin. It drills in the Wattenberg Field. It’s a way to diversify away from the Permian players. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has no outstanding term debt and $182.5 million in liquidity.

1412,HP,"Crude supply has been normalizing, which has pushed the price of WTI and Brent to new three-year highs. More importantly, most companies are now able to cover their investment and payouts with cash from operations — something investors really want right now. In fact, riding on improving commodity prices, stronger production outlook and healthier cash flows, the companies look poised to continue the momentum in the coming years.However, despite these positives, it’s difficult for oil prices to reach 2014 levels for quite some time. So, picking dividend growth stocks appears to be a winning strategy currently as these provide steady income and cushion against market risks. These stocks are generally less volatile in nature and hence, are dependable when it comes to long-term investment planning.Dividend Cuts & Leaner Strategies to Survive the SlumpFollowing the supply glut and lackluster global demand, oil prices remained low for more than three years. From $100 a barrel in 2014, crude spectacularly fell to a low of $30 in 2016. During the industry downturn, the energy companies adopted cost-cut strategies and realigned their business models to a leaner and efficient structure to stay competitive in the long run.The companies engaged in reducing headcount, streamlining operations, divesting non-core projects, slashing capex and operating costs to adapt to the weak pricing environment and bolster financials. In fact, in many cases, the companies first resorted to dividend cuts to shore up the cash flows in order to fund the in-process growth projects.The downturn not only impacted the smaller and the more-leveraged companies, it also affected the fairly larger companies (generally considered safe haven investments). They were forced to cut or suspend cash dividend and share buyback programs.Pricing Gains & Robust Cash Flows Ease Dividend Payout PressureThanks to rebounding oil prices and strategic initiatives, many energy companies have finally managed to come out of the slump. With the crude markets having recovered from the historic lows and comfortably trading above $60 a barrel for a couple of months now, the impact of improving energy landscape is clearly visible on the energy sector. Moreover, the uptrend is expected to continue on the back of tightening supplies, rising demand and OPEC-deal extension talks.Importantly, cash flow from operating activities, which is a key metric to gauge the financial health of the firms, was the highest in 2017 since the downturn period. The companies generated enough cash to pay off debt along with funding capex and dividend payments. Further, the energy stocks look poised for further growth and greater investor rewards. The companies are set for more cash generation and the top priorities of the CEO’s are shifting from cost-containment efforts to boosting shareholder value.Dividend Investing in FocusAs evident from the energy market story, stocks can take a sudden turn for the good (or bad), making stock picking a risky game. With uncertainty ruling the markets, it is not surprising that dividend investing, in general, is one of the most popular investing themes. In particular, given the robust fundamental backdrop and the high cash flow momentum, which we expect to further strengthen over the course of this year, now seems just the right time to invest in some high-octane dividend stocks.In fact, dividend investing continues to be, as it always has been, a legitimate strategy. While picking the dividend stocks, it is best to pick the ones that have high yields and pay dividends consistently.Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth generally act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as these belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market while simultaneously offer downside protection with consistent increase in payouts. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. All these make dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Picking the Right WayTargeting dividend stocks and combining them with a strong Zacks Rank is a great way to increase the chances of beating the market, while also ensuring a steady stream of cash heading to your portfolio. Further, we prefer to choose stocks that have high market capitalizations, which provide for a safer and a more reliable backbone to any portfolio. These large cap companies enjoy leading market positions, have a global footprint, strong cash positions and are large enough to remain stable even in the face of unfavorable events.Thus, using the Zacks Stock Screener we have zeroed in on three large-cap stocks (which according to our model have a market cap of more than $5 billion) in the Zacks Oil-Energy Sector,  with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.These stocks not only offer current dividend yield of more than 4% but also have a five-year historical dividend growth of greater than 1% to reflect their solid dividend growth history.  Our ChoicesBP plc (BP  -  Free Report): Based in London, it is among the leading integrated energy players in the world with a market cap of more than $130 billion. This Zacks Rank #2 stock sports a robust dividend yield of 6.12%, highest among the top-integrated energy stocks.

The supermajor’s five-year historical dividend growth is 1.9%. The stock has gained about 14.7% over a year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 6.7%.Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS.A  -  Free Report): The Hague-based supermajor is a Zacks Ranked #2 company with a market cap of more than $260 billion. For 2017, the Anglo-Dutch company generated an impressive $27.6 billion in free cash flows, the most by any supermajor and has been consistently paying dividends for the past several years.

(NBR  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted loss from continuing operations of 34 cents per share, slightly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 33 cents.

Further, the top line was 31.5% higher than the year-ago quarter level of $539.2 million.

The tragedy, one of the deadliest oil and gas related accidents in the last few years, occurred at one of Patterson-UTI's APEX 1500 rigs and killed five workers.However, Patterson-UTI’s performance improved from the year-ago loss of 53 cents per share as shale drilling picked up amid rebounding oil prices.Revenues of $787.3 million compared with $246.9 million in the year-ago quarter and were also higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $760 million.Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc.

However, average direct costs per operating day came in at $12,940, down from $13,770 in the year-ago quarter. The segment was also boosted by a jump in both the operating days (from 6,288 to 14,776) and the number of rigs operational (from 68 to 161) on the back of resilience in Patterson-UTI’s operations amid an improving market.Consequently, the segment recorded operating loss of $16.4 million – significantly narrower than the loss of $62.5 million incurred in the year-earlier quarter.Pressure Pumping: Revenues of $406.7 million almost trebled from the year-ago sales of $105.6 million.

However, the rebound in commodity prices notwithstanding, the unit incurred a wider quarterly loss of $7.8 million, as against the loss of $1.1 million recorded in year-ago quarter. The deterioration was mainly on account of steep rise in direct operating costs – from $2.8 million to $20.9 million.Direct Operating CostsThe company – whose larger rival Helmerich & Payne Inc.

In fact, the company sees 2018 as an exciting year for super-spec rigs. The company has 130 of them in its fleet with 98% under contract.While Patterson-UTI sees an average rig count of 169 in the first quarter, it also expects average rig revenue per day to increase $300 sequentially, driven by favorable repricing of short-term contracts. At the same time, average rig operating cost per day is also expected to go up in the first quarter.Patterson-UTI expects an average of 96 rigs to be operational under term contracts during the first quarter and 67 for the entire 2018.In pressure pumping, the company expects first quarter revenues to fall slightly from the fourth quarter due to weather-related disruptions.

1418,HP,"Results from 179 S&P 500 members are already out, bearing evidence to a strong start this earnings season.Picture This FarPer the latest Earnings Trends report dated Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 members have already reported results with their total earnings up 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues. Notably, 82.8% of the firms surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings, while 67.8% topped revenue estimates.So far, just five of the energy companies on the S&P 500 index have reported their Q1 results. These include Halliburton Company, Kinder Morgan, Inc., Schlumberger Limited, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation.Both the oilfield services players, Schlumberger and Halliburton met earnings estimates, indicating that the North American drilling market remains robust, driven by increased activity. Kinder Morgan delivered an earnings beat on the back of increased contribution from the liquid terminals and Texas Interstate System. Further, Baker Hughes and Hess Corporation also delivered better than expected results.Year-over-Year Gain Leads to Bullish ExpectationsA look back at the last earnings season reflects that earnings for the energy sector saw the strongest growth, recording a massive 136.6% year-over-year gain on 23.6% higher revenues.Also, for the first quarter of 2018, we expect the energy sector to eclipse all the 16 Zacks sectors. Per our expectations, earnings for the sector are expected to jump 59.6% from first-quarter 2017, while the top line is likely to witness an improvement of 15.9% from the year-ago levels.What’s Going in Favor of the Energy SectorThe first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014, despite record high domestic production. Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices, as they will be able to extract more value for their products.Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.Stocks’ Earnings to Watch on Apr 26Let’s find out what’s in store for the below-mentioned five energy companies that are slated to release their quarterly numbers on Apr 26.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report fiscal second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 85.71% on the back of higher drilling activities at its U.S. Land Segment. Further, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 37.06% in the last four quarters.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to increase its odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Our proven model shows that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The company has an Earnings ESP of +16.93% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Recovering commodity prices along with higher rig utilization in Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment — U.S. Land segment — are expected to buoy the results this quarter also. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment’s operating income is pegged at $27.51 million, up from the last quarter’s figure of $24.75 million and the year-ago quarter’s operating loss of $51.85 million. (Read More: Can Helmerich & Payne Deliver a Beat in Q2 Earnings?)Pittsburgh, PA-based integrated energy company EQT Corporation (EQT  -  Free Report) is slated to come up with January-March operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT — an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm, with primary focus on production and midstream operations — has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports.For this quarter as well, our model predicts an earnings beat as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +18.59%.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the average daily sales volume for the first quarter is pegged at 3,959 million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), higher than 3,200 MMcfe/d in the preceding quarter and 2,110 MMcfe/d in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the Production segment is pegged at $371 million, reflecting an increase from $267 million in the last quarter and $257 million in the year-ago quarter.( Read more: EQT Corp Gears Up for Q1 Earnings: A Beat in Store?)The largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States, Valero Energy Corporation (VLO  -  Free Report), is another company to come up with quarterly numbers before the opening bell.The company boasts an excellent track record of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 10.26%.However, our model indicates that Valero Energy’s earnings streak might come to a halt this time around, as the company does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients. While the company carries a Zacks Rank #3, its negative Earnings ESP of 4.58% makes surprise prediction difficult.While improved refining margins and tax reform benefits bode well for the downstream operator, unplanned downtime and weather-related issues might affect Valero’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018. (Read More: What to Expect From Valero Energy in Q1 Earnings?)Then there is Houston, TX-based exploration and production major, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report), coming up with first-quarter numbers tomorrow, before the opening bell.ConocoPhillips has an average positive earnings surprise of 144.45% in the trailing four quarters. Our model indicates that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around too, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.62%.Higher expectations for prices of natural gas, natural gas liquid and crude oil will likely favor the company’s first-quarter earnings.Lastly there is Houston-based, National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV  -  Free Report), another energy company set to report results after the closing bell.  Last quarter, the company met the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. In the trailing four quarters, National Oilwell witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 6.9%, without missing any estimates.Our proven model does not show that National Oilwell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -20.00%.Apparently, National Oilwell even warned investors that its first-quarter 2018 revenues are expected to miss expectations primarily due to declined progress in new offshore rig construction as well as client-associated equipment deferrals. The company expects its revenues to come in at $1.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting 3.4% year-over-year decline.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1419,HP,"Domestic oil and gas explorer Whiting Petroleum Corporation (WLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Monday, Apr 30, after market close. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a profit of 22 cents on revenues of $473.2 million.In the preceding three-month period, the company beat the consensus mark by 46.9% on robust output and prices.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, the Denver, CO-based upstream operator is on a firm footing, having gone past the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four reports. This is depicted in the graph below:Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whiting Petroleum Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whiting Petroleum Corporation QuoteInvestors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Whiting Petroleum surpasses earnings estimate this time too. Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors impacting the results.Factors to Consider This QuarterWe believe that the improving oil price environment and strong production bode well for the company’s upcoming report.Management had earlier guided first-quarter total production in the band of 11.1-11.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) – primarily from the Williston Basin. We note that the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly output is 11.40 MMBOE, at the midpoint of the company’s forecast range and above the 10.56 MMBOE reported in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, analysts polled by Zacks expect average realized oil price to rise 25.2% from the year-ago quarter to $55 per barrel.However, Whiting Petroleum’s per unit depreciation, depletion, and amortization costs remain on the higher side and could push up the company’s breakeven point. This might affect the Whiting Petroleum’s bottom line in the first quarter of 2018.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Whiting Petroleum will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -12.95%.Zacks Rank: Whiting Petroleum is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderWhile earnings beat looks uncertain for Whiting Petroleum, here are some energy companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model, which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1. The firm is expected to release earnings on May 3.

1420,HP,"We expect Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fiscal second-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 85.71% on the back of higher drilling activity at its biggest segment — U.S. Land. Further, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 37.1% in the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. QuoteEstimate Revision TrendLet’s look at the estimate revision trend to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents for the quarter under review has been stable over the last two months. It reflects a wider loss from 2 cents in the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $562 million for the quarter, marginally down from $564 million in the prior-year quarter but up from $405.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of January-March quarter of 2018 were $62.73 per barrel, up about 8.4% sequentially amid improving demand outlook and OPEC-production cut deal. This has resulted in an increase in onshore drilling activities in the United States. The Tulsa, OK-based drilling contractor is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating revenues of Helmerich & Payne’s largest segment — U.S. Land — is pegged at $467 million, higher than about $331 million in the year-ago quarter and $461.6 million in the last reported quarter. Higher rig utilization in the sector is expected to back the results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of rig utilization in this sector is 59%, up from 42% in the year-ago period and 57% in fiscal first-quarter 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income of U.S. Land segment is $27.51 million, up from the last quarter’s $24.75 million income and the year-ago quarter’s operating loss of $51.85 million.The company also has a solid balance sheet with impressive leverage and liquidity ratios, giving Helmerich & Payne enough financial flexibility to take advantage of the recovering energy landscape.Helmerich & Payne is  upgrading its fleet to increase efficiency, which can increase its market share in return. The company has increased its capital expenditure recently by 25%, which will enable it to reach its target of upgrading the rigs.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Positive Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +16.93%. This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Helmerich & Payne carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with +16.93% ESP makes us confident about an earnings beat.Note that stocks with a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.

1421,HP,"After having witnessed extreme volatility in terms of pricing over the last three years, the commodity market has gradually recovered from its historic lows, to comfortably trade at more than $60 a barrel since the start of this year.In fact, the first quarter of the year saw the U.S. oil benchmark attain its highest settlement since December 2014 despite record high domestic production. Crude was supported by various catalysts, including strong demand and continued production curb from OPEC and its allies. Needless to say, such favorable developments have buoyed investors’ optimism surrounding the sector’s first-quarter results.Q1 Progress Report: What’s Going in Favor?Per EIA data, the commodity rose about 7.5% in the first three months of 2018 to finish the quarter at $64.87 per barrel. It goes without saying that all oil-related stocks are thus poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices as they will be able to extract more value for their products.One of the main reasons why the U.S. oil benchmark soared revolved around expectations that OPEC and other major producers agreed to expand their output-cut deal beyond March. The coalition prolonged the agreement for another nine months to the end of 2018 in an attempt to clear the supply gut.Another major factor fueling higher oil prices is fast-growing demand for the commodity, which continues to tighten the market. Per the International Energy Agency (IEA), global oil demand is likely to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day this year to average 99.3 million barrels a day.Sharp inventory drawdowns have also led to the commodity tread on growth trajectory. Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 36 of the last 51 weeks and are down more than 100 million barrels since April last year. The gradual fall – stemming from a combination of lower imports and spiraling exports – has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 429.9 million barrels, current crude supplies are 20% below the year-ago period.ConcernsWhile there is renewed optimism among U.S. oil companies amid the $65-plus WTI prices, the positivism could be undermined by soaring U.S. production. Volume from U.S. oil fields (inclusive of shale) has risen 25% since mid-2016 to more than 10.5 million barrels per day — the highest since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983. In early February, oil production broke through the 10-million-barrels-a-day threshold for the first time in nearly 50 years and has maintained the record levels thereafter.A rise in the oil drilling rig count points to a further increase in domestic output. An early gauge of future activity, rigs drilling for oil in America totaled 1,003 in the week to Apr 6, as per the latest weekly report by Baker Hughes, a GE Company.Nevertheless, while we do not rule out chances for short-term pullbacks on oversupply concerns, we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future.The Picture So FarWith the Q1 earnings season finally kicking off, 24 S&P 500 participants released their financial numbers as of Apr 11. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the results reflect a positive trend, with an above-average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations. Overall earnings, for the companies that have already reported, are up 39.3% from the year-ago period on 11.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 75% while that for the top line was 70.8%.The strong momentum we saw in the preceding earnings season is expected to continue in this reporting cycle, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index expected to be up 16 % from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. This would follow 13.4% earnings growth on 8.6% revenue growth in the 2017 Q4 earnings season, the best quarterly performance in more than six years.Encouraging Numbers From Energy SpaceThe Oil/Energy sector put up a stellar show in the October-December 2017 period. Earnings for the sector recorded a massive 136.3% jump from the year-ago period — the highest among the 16 broad Zacks sectors — on 23.6% higher revenues.The Q1 earnings season for the Energy sector is just around the corner. Investors are eagerly awaiting the flow of results, starting Apr 20, when Schlumberger Limited (SLB) reports first and foremost from the S&P energy cohort.In fact, the Energy sector is poised to witness the highest growth in Q1 yet again. The Earnings Trends report shows that earnings for the sector are expected to be up 60.1% from the year-ago quarter, while the top line is likely to register 16.1% growth.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonThe encouraging figures suggest that there are a number of companies which are likely to trump first-quarter estimates.However, with a wide range of energy firms thronging the investment space, it is by no means an easy task for investors to arrive at stocks that have the potential to deliver better-than-expected earnings.While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, our proprietary methodology - Earnings ESP - makes it relatively simple.

1422,HP,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) introduced a new competitive video gaming service geared towards developers on Monday. GameOn is the e-commerce and web hosting power’s latest foray into the multibillion-dollar gaming industry and should be a further sign to investors that the video game market is rapidly expanding.Amazon’s new service aims to allow developers and gamers to integrate and create competitions natively across mobile devices, PCs, and gaming consoles. GameOn, which was built on Amazon’s AWS cloud infrastructure, will also allow gamers to win prizes, most of which Amazon will offer through its e-commerce site.Amazon sees its new cloud gaming division as a way to profit from the proliferation of gaming and the rise of esports. The basic idea is that millions of people play video games and want to experience high-level competition with real monetary benefits on the line, but not all of them are at the level of professional gamers.“Game developers have consistently told us they are looking for ways to increase player engagement and retention,” Amazon’s Director of Competitive Gaming, Marja Koopmans, said in a statement. “We built Amazon GameOn to give developers simple, yet powerful tools to foster community through competitive gameplay.”Some relatively well-known gaming companies and esports teams, including nWay, Game Insight, and Millennial Esports’ Eden Games, are currently using GameOn.Amazon’s new competitive gaming platform comes nearly four years after the company purchased esports streaming platform Twitch for nearly $1 billion.The esports ecosystem is expected to expand by almost 40% in 2018 to become a $905.6 million business, based on new estimates from market research firm NewZoo. A majority of this money is set to come from non-endemic sponsors, advertisers, and media companies.This year, HP (HP  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Toyota (TM  -  Free Report), and T-Mobile (TMUS  -  Free Report) all sponsor Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI  -  Free Report) new “Overwatch League,” which models its structure on major U.S. professional sports leagues. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report) and Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report) have also bolstered their partnerships with more mainstream sports.Amazon looks poised to capitalize on esports while also infusing its e-commerce business with another potential revenue stream through GameOn-based prizes. The company is also set to take on Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) quickly expanding gaming unit.Microsoft recently purchased a similar tournament and leaderboard-based gaming service called PlayFab, and also just launched its own cloud-based gaming division.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1423,HP,"It was a week where both oil and gas prices logged handsome gains.On the news front, oil refiners Valero Energy Corp. (VLO  -  Free Report) and Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC  -  Free Report) raised their respective quarterly dividends. Meanwhile, driller Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) came out with better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Overall, it was a good week for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained about 4.5% to close at $66.14 per barrel, while natural gas prices soared 10% to $3.505 per million Btu (MMBtu). (See the last ‘Oil & Gas Stock Roundup’ here: Schlumberger & Halliburton's Q4, BP's Horizon Woes & More)The U.S. oil benchmark recorded its fifth increase in six weeks, attaining its highest closing since December 2014. The major catalyst was the Energy Department's inventory release, which revealed that crude stockpiles recorded another weekly draw. A tumbling dollar – that made the greenback-priced crude more affordable for investors holding foreign currency – provided further support.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 34 of the last 42 weeks and are down almost 114 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 411.6 million barrels, current crude supplies are 15.7% below the year-ago period and the lowest since February 2015.Meanwhile, natural gas – one of 2017’s worst-performing commodities – had an excellent week of its own following a larger-than-expected decrease in supplies. The 288 billion cubic feet (Bcf) withdrawal was also was significantly higher than both last year’s drop of 137 Bcf and the five-year (2013-2017) average net shrinkage of 164 Bcf for the reported week.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Valero Energy Corporation's board of directors recently announced plans to raise regular quarterly cash dividend to 80 cents per share from 70 cents per share, representing an increase of 14.3%.Following the hike, the company’s new annualized dividend will amount to $3.20 per share, up from $2.80 distributed earlier.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The oil refining and marketing giant was able to pull off the dividend hike due to the strategic actions it undertook last year for generating long-term cash flow. Notably, Marathon Petroleum's $8.1 billion drop-down deal with its midstream subsidiary MPLX L.P. bodes well for the company as it will lead to huge cash influx, boosting dividend and buyback programs. Moreover, the recent tax reform by the U.S. government has reduced the company's cash burden, leading to the hike.Marathon Petroleum is known for raising dividends since it became a standalone public company in mid-2011. Additionally, it has an active share repurchase program. These highlight the company’s commitment to return more value to shareholders. Notably, the dividend hikes and buybacks, since the company's inception, have totaled $13 billion.

1430,HP,"The U.S. Energy Department's inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a lower-than-expected weekly draw. On a further bearish note, the report revealed that refined product inventories, gasoline and distillate, both rose slightly from their week earlier levels. Meanwhile, refinery activity improved.However, the talking point from the data sets was the steady trend of rising domestic oil production that continues to be the biggest headwind for the market.Despite the mostly negative data sets, the benchmark was buoyed by the fact that commercial inventories actually dropped after notching up successive weekly builds.The U.S. oil benchmark also rallied on expectations that OPEC and other major producers will agree to expand their output-cut deal beyond March when they meet at the end of the month. The agreement, already renewed once, keeps 1.8 million barrels a day off the market in an attempt to clear a supply glut.Further support came from the shutdown of TransCanada Corporation’s (TRP  -  Free Report) 590,000 barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline – one of the largest from Canada to the United States – due to a leak and subsequent cleanup operations.As a result, the front month West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 2.1% (or $1.19) to $58.02 per barrel yesterday – the highest settlement since Jun 30, 2015.Energy Stocks GainThe bullish oil market sentiment encouraged buying in energy stocks, which lifted the Energy Select Sector SPDR – an assortment of the largest U.S. energy companies – almost 0.4% Wednesday. Some of the biggest gainers of the S&P 500 yesterday were oil and oil-related companies like Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK  -  Free Report), Range Resources Corporation (RRC  -  Free Report), Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO  -  Free Report), Southwestern Energy Company (SWN  -  Free Report) and Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report).Analysis of the EIA DataCrude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels for the week ending Nov 17, following a rise of 1.9 million barrels in the previous week. The analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts – the leading independent commodities and energy data provider – had expected crude stocks to go down some 2.1 million barrels.An uptick in refinery demand led to the stockpile draw with the world's biggest oil consumer. But the withdrawal failed to match up with expectations as U.S. output rose by 13,000 barrels per day last week to 9.7 million barrels per day – the most since the EIA started maintaining weekly data in 1983.Oil stockpiles have shrunk in 25 of the last 33 weeks and are down more than 76 million barrels since April. The gradual fall has helped the U.S. crude market shift from year-over-year storage surplus to a deficit. At 457.1 million barrels, current crude supplies are 6.5% below the year-ago period though they are in the upper half of the average range during this time of the year.Meanwhile, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma – the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange – was down by 1.8 million barrels to 61.2 million barrels.The crude supply cover was down from 28.3 days in the previous week to 27.8 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 30.7 days.Gasoline: Supplies of gasoline were up for the second straight week as production jumped. The small, 44,000 barrels addition – compared to the polled number of 1 million barrels rise in supply level – took gasoline stockpiles up to 210.5 million barrels. Despite last week’s increase, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product remains 6% below the year-earlier level but is in the middle of the average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) edged up 269,000 barrels last week, contrary to analysts’ expectations for 1.8 million barrels decrease in supply level. The marginal weekly rise could be attributed to healthy production. At 125 million barrels, current supplies are 16.2% below the year-ago level and are in the middle of the average range for this time of the year.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was up by 0.3% from the prior week to 91.3%.About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.Want to Own an Energy Stock Now?If you are looking for a near-term energy play, ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report) may be a good selection.

1431,HP,"Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is set to release fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 16.Helmerich & Payne — which counts Nabors Industries Limited (NBR  -  Free Report), Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (DO  -  Free Report) and ENSCO PLC (ESV  -  Free Report) as its peers among others — is a major land and offshore drilling contractor in the western hemisphere, having the youngest and most efficient drilling fleet. The company specializes in shallow to deep drilling in oil and gas-producing basins in the United States and international locations.In the preceding three-month period, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 41.94% on the back of higher drilling activities, especially in the North American markets. Increased rig margins and operating income from the offshore and international markets also provided an impetus to the results. Further, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 9.22% in the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Helmerich & Payne, Inc. Quote Factors at PlayPrices of oil at the end of the third quarter were $51.67 per barrel, up about 10.5% sequentially amid tightening supplies, improving demand outlook and OPEC-deal extension talks. The drilling contractor is poised to benefit from recovering commodity prices. With oil prices rebounding from their historic lows, the energy companies have started increasing their spending on upstream projects on account of higher profit margin. This, in turn, means more work for drillers like Helmerich & Payne. Thus, rising momentum in the U.S. markets and modest improvement in international markets are likely to drive the company’s revenues. Helmerich & Payne’s industry leading drilling fleet including its advanced FlexRig and drill operating expertise are keys to its success.The FlexRig will help the company maintain relatively strong daily-rate margin in turn driving its earnings and revenues. Helmerich & Payne’s term contracts with well-capitalized oil majors and other independent companies will enable the contractor to achieve high level of utilization.The company also has a solid balance sheet with impressive leverage and liquidity ratios giving Helmerich & Payne enough financial flexibility to take advantage of the recovering energy landscape. Moreover, the dividend history of the company is also quite impressive. The company has a record of hiking its dividend every year for 44 years, even during the industry downturn.What Does Our Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Helmerich & Payne is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for this company is +7.32%.

1436,HP,"We are entering the heart of the Q2 earnings season, with more than 50% S&P 500 members expected to come out with results by the end of this week.Picture Emerging Thus FarWe now have Q2 results from 97 S&P 500 members that combined account for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization. According to the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% positive earnings surprises and 72.2% beating revenue estimates.At this stage, we don’t have too many results from the ‘Energy’ sector. However, a number of companies have earnings lined up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.Energy: First-Half RecapLast year, 'Energy' was the strongest S&P sector performer, with a market-thumping 24% return. In particular, November's historic OPEC-led production cut deal to alleviate a supply glut managed to buoy oil prices and stabilize them around the psychologically important $50 per barrel threshold. The commodity was on a stellar run on optimism surrounding the agreement, and the outlook for oil stocks was getting better.The seemingly positive developments encouraged investors to bet on firming prices for 2017 with the oil industry finally hoping that 'this would be the year.' True to the strong sentiments, U.S. oil prices reached around $55 per barrel in late February, the highest level in 19 months.However, the situation is drastically different now, with the commodity having floundered in recent weeks. By Jun 21, crude had cratered more than 20% from its February highs and officially plunged into bear territory. In fact, prices ended down 14.3% for the first half of the year – the worst performance since 1998.Let's take a look at how oil and gas prices behaved during the second quarter of this year.Strong Q2 Earnings Growth PredictionA look back at the Q1 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil/Energy sector were spectacular, driving the aggregate growth picture for the S&P 500 index.The Jan-Mar 2017 period turned out to be a rather good one with both oil and natural gas prices benefiting from easier comparison figures from the year-ago period. While crude slumped to some 12-year low in the first quarter of 2016, natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years.As a result, the sector – whose year-earlier comparison was to an aggregate loss – came out swinging. For the sector components on the S&P 500 index, total Q1 earnings had robust year-over-year dollar growth on 33.8% higher revenues. While 69.7% of the companies were successful in beating earnings estimates, 63.6% of them outperformed the topline.The picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q2 earnings season as well. This is not surprising, considering that oil and gas are both averaging higher compared to the second quarter of 2016 when the energy companies reported unusually low bottom-line. While earnings for the Oil/Energy sector are set to jump a massive 271.4% – the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors – the top-line is likely to show a growth of 15.1% from the second quarter 2016 levels.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Jul 27Let’s see what’s in store for six energy companies expected to come up with Jun quarter numbers on Thursday, Jul 27.Contract drilling services provider Helmerich & Payne Inc. (HP  -  Free Report) is expected to report before the opening bell.In the previous quarter, this Tulsa, OK-headquartered provider of drilling rigs, equipment and personnel to explore for and develop oil and gas missed estimates, weighed down by lower drilling activity, especially in the international markets.Regarding earnings surprises, Helmerich & Payne is on a bit of a slippery surface, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four reports. And our model indicates that the company is unlikely to beat on earnings this time around too.This is because, as per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat earnings. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.For the quarter to be reported, Helmerich & Payne has an Earnings ESP of -6.45%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.

(NOV  -  Free Report) is another energy company set to report second-quarter 2017 results – this time after market closing. The company – which is one of the biggest manufacturers of drilling equipment – has a good track of having outperformed estimates in three of the last four quarters.However, National Oilwell is likely to break the trend in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because the company is a Zacks Rank #4 stock that has an Earnings ESP of -14.29%.National Oilwell Varco, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  National Oilwell Varco, Inc.

(EQT  -  Free Report) coming out with Apr-Jun operational results before the opening bell.As far as earnings surprises are concerned, EQT – an Appalachia-focused natural gas firm with primary focus on production and midstream operations – has a decent record, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate just once in the last four reports. However, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, our proven model shows that an earnings beat is uncertain for EQT in the upcoming quarterly release.

(MPC  -  Free Report) reporting second-quarter 2017 results tomorrow - again ahead of the opening bell. Coming to the earnings surprise history, this Findlay, OH-headquartered downstream operator has a good record: it’s gone passed estimates in three of the last four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 189.75%.But our model does not indicate that the company is likely to beat on earnings this time around, as it has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. While a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

(VLO  -  Free Report) is the fifth company to come out with quarterly numbers tomorrow morning.Boasting of an excellent track of having outperformed estimates in each of the last four quarters, Valero Energy is likely to encounter a speed breaker in the upcoming release.
