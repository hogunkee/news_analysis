1,APD,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at APD given that, according to its RSI reading of 29.97, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI?RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, APD’s low RSI value isn’t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Air Products and Chemicals’ earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 2 earnings estimate revisions moved higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for APD has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $7.36/share two months ago to just $7.37/share right now.If this wasn’t enough, Air Products and Chemicals also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.

2,APD,"Investors interested in Chemical - Diversified stocks are likely familiar with Air Products and Chemicals (APD  -  Free Report) and Praxair (PX  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Air Products and Chemicals has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Praxair has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that APD is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.APD currently has a forward P/E ratio of 21.16, while PX has a forward P/E of 22.83. We also note that APD has a PEG ratio of 1.30. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PX currently has a PEG ratio of 1.99.Another notable valuation metric for APD is its P/B ratio of 3.19. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, PX has a P/B of 6.43.These metrics, and several others, help APD earn a Value grade of B, while PX has been given a Value grade of D.APD is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that APD is likely the superior value option right now.

Also, strengthening operations in international arenas — Europe accounted for 50% of TiO2 sales volume in 2017 while the Asia Pacific and the rest of the world accounted for 9% and 10%, respectively — and effective marketing strategies will be advantageous.Research and development, aimed at uplifting the product quality, production process and application areas, remain a priority for Kronos Worldwide.

19,APD,"The chemical industry has gotten its mojo back on strength across major end-markets and a resurgent world economy. The industry’s upturn is expected to continue in 2018 as the fundamental driving factors remain in place.Despite a few industry-related and macroeconomic headwinds, there are a number of reasons to be optimistic about the broader chemical industry for both the short and long haul. Let’s find out what’s supporting the bullish case for chemical stocks.Shale Bounty – Driving Force for Chemical InvestmentThe shale gas revolution in the United States has been a huge driving force behind chemical investment on plants and equipment in the country. According to the American Chemistry Council (“ACC”), the United States has emerged as an attractive investment location and petrochemical makers are now significantly expanding capacity in the country leveraging new supplies of natural gas. New methods of extraction such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) are boosting shale production, bringing down prices of ethane (derived from shale gas) in the process.The shale boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies to pump in billions of dollars for setting up facilities (crackers) in the United States to produce ethylene and propylene in a cost-effective way. Per the ACC, 320 new chemical projects have been already announced by chemical makers worth more than $185 billion that are under construction or complete. Such investments - many backed by Federal government support - are expected to boost capacity and export over the next several years.Chemical industry capital spending also continues to go up, clocking $38 billion in 2017, according to the ACC. This also accounts for one-half of overall construction spending by the manufacturing sector. The trade group expects capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.Strong Momentum in ConstructionA rebound across housing and commercial construction - major chemical end-markets - has been another supporting factor for the chemical industry recovery. After being hit hard in the recession, the construction sector has bounced back on the back of strong housing fundamentals.The U.S. homebuilding industry performed remarkably well in 2017 and the momentum is expected to continue this year. Strong employment, rising income, increasing interest from first-time homebuyers, tight inventory of new and existing homes and high homebuilder confidence are among the factors that should support continued growth in housing demand in 2018.Moreover, 2018 has started on a positive note for the commercial construction sector. The U.S. Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides a roughly nine to 12 - month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, hit the highest level in January 2018 since 2007.Per the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the ABI score was 54.7 (a reading above 50 indicates an increase in billings) for January, an increase from 52.8 a month ago, indicating an upturn in architectural activity. The AIA also expects non-residential construction spending to go up 4% in 2018 and 3.9% in 2019.Positives such as an improving economy, an impressive job market, rising consumer confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the construction sector’s performance. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s plan to double economic growth through an ambitious stimulus program featuring higher infrastructure spending, tax cuts and deregulation augur well for the sector.Demand Strength in Automotive SectorChemical makers continue to see healthy demand from the automotive sector - a major end-use market. 2017 has been another record-setting year for global light vehicle sales. IHS Markit expects another strong year for the automotive industry on a global level in 2018 and envisions global light vehicle sales to increase 1.5% year over year to 95.9 million units this year.Moreover, demand is expected to remain healthy in the United States this year. Rising demand for crossovers, sports utility vehicles and light trucks are aiding the U.S. auto industry. The National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) foresees a stable, healthy market for new vehicles in 2018 and expects new cars and light trucks sales to reach 16.7 million units.The auto industry in Asian countries, especially China, is also expected to thrive over the next several years. China is the biggest and fastest growing auto market in the world in terms of number of vehicles sold. This augurs well for chemical demand in this important end-market. Upturn in the Eurozone EconomyEurozone’s economic recovery continues apace, as evident from recent upbeat economic data. The region’s recovery is backed by a pickup in the global economy, declining unemployment, strengthening business and consumer confidence and monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank. The European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of a rebounding Eurozone economy.Eurozone wrapped up 2017 on a strong note with GDP rising 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 (according to Eurostat data) on a quarter-over-quarter basis, driven by strong growth across Germany and France. The bloc’s economy also expanded 2.3% in 2017, the fastest rate in more than a decade.While geopolitical risks may still remain a drag, the Eurozone economy is poised for a strong 2018. The European Commission, in its winter 2018 forecast, said that it expects the Eurozone to grow 2.3% in 2018 (up from previous estimate of 2.1%), followed by 2% in 2019.Resurgent Energy SectorA rebound in crude oil prices has led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space, an important end-use market. Oil prices have been steadily recovering from their nadir of below $30 a barrel in early 2016, currently trading above the important psychological level of $60 a barrel. Oil prices recently soared to their highest level in more than three years at $66 a barrel.The uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U.S. oil stockpiles, upbeat demand outlook and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018.Improving fundamentals in the energy space is expected to support chemical demand moving ahead. The rebound in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.Chemical M&A Wave ContinuesChemical makers remain actively focused on mergers and acquisitions to diversify their business, enhance operational scale and shore up growth. The $130 billion mega-merger of The Dow Chemical Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont) to create DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) - the biggest chemical deal ever - is a huge testimony to these strategic moves.Other major deals that have taken place in the chemical space in the recent past include China National Chemical Corporation’s $43 billion acquisition of Syngenta AG, Albemarle Corporation’s (ALB  -  Free Report) $6.2 billion buyout of Rockwood Holdings, Inc., Merck KGaA's $17 billion acquisition of Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, and the $66 billion proposed mega-merger between Monsanto Company MON and Bayer AG.Strategic Actions to Reap Margin BenefitsChemical companies continue to switch their focus on attractive, growth markets in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are grappling with weak demand. Moreover, cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies are expected to deliver industry-wide margin benefits in 2018. Some chemical makers are also disposing non-core assets as they shift their focus on high-margin businesses.Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking pricing actions (reflected by hikes in chemical prices in the recent past) in the wake of a sharp rise in raw materials costs. This is also expected to reap margin benefits moving ahead.Stocks to Bet on Right NowAs you can see from the above-mentioned factors, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the chemical industry. Chemical stocks that are well placed in the current operating backdrop include Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

20,APD,"The chemical industry is riding an upturn in the world economy and continued strength across major end-use markets such as construction, automotive and electronics. Another positive for the industry is a recovery in demand in the energy space – a key chemical end-market that had been out of favor for a spell. The recovery has been driven by the rebound in crude oil prices from their historic lows.The Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry has outperformed the broader market in a year’s time. The industry has gained around 19.4% over this period, higher than the S&P 500’s corresponding return of roughly 17.8%.Fourth-quarter earnings season had been a good one for chemical stocks. Notwithstanding a few headwinds including some lingering impacts of devastating hurricanes, chemical companies continued the earnings momentum in the December quarter. We note that a number of companies in the space – including prominent names such as Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN  -  Free Report), Celanese Corp. (CE  -  Free Report), PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) – produced earnings beats in the quarter.The outperformance was driven by solid demand across major end-markets as well as strategic measures including productivity improvement, pricing actions, portfolio restructuring and earnings-accretive acquisitions.Chemical companies continue to shift their focus on high-growth markets (driven by megatrends) in an effort to cut their exposure on other businesses that are struggling with weak demand and input costs pressure. These companies are also increasingly looking for cost synergy opportunities and enhanced operational scale through consolidations.Cost-cutting measures and productivity improvement actions by chemical companies should continue to reap industry-wide margin improvements in 2018. Moreover, a number of chemical makers are taking appropriate pricing actions to offset raw materials cost inflation, which should also provide margin benefits.Chemical makers also continue to see strong demand from construction and automotive sectors – major chemical end-use markets. The underlying trends in the housing space remain strong, backed by strong economic growth, steady buyer demand, high homebuilders’ confidence and low unemployment levels.The automotive sector also continues its good run amid certain challenges, supported by an improving job market, rising personal income, favorable credit conditions, improved consumer confidence and impressive vehicle launches. Rising demand for profitable crossovers, sports utility vehicles and pickups are also aiding the auto industry.A rebound in crude oil prices has also led to a recovery in demand for chemicals in the energy space, an important end-use market. The recent uptrend in oil prices has been supported by a decline in U.S. oil stockpiles and extension of oil production cuts by OPEC and other major world producers until the end of 2018. The recovery in oil prices has also led to a favorable pricing environment for chemical products.U.S. Chemical Industry Set to Ride Growth WaveThe U.S. Chemical Industry has recovered from the damaging effects of hurricanes and is set for solid growth in 2018. The American Chemistry Council (""ACC""), an industry trade group, envisions national chemical production (excluding pharmaceuticals) to rise 3.7% in 2018, further accelerating to a 3.9% growth in 2019. The growth is expected to be spurred by higher demand across light vehicles and housing markets, capital investments and improved export markets.The trade group also expects basic chemicals production to expand 4.7% in 2018 and further gain steam with a 5.2% rise in 2019 on the heels of new capacity additions. The specialty chemicals segment is also expected to see production growth of 2.3% in 2018, per the ACC.Surging Capital SpendingThe United States remains an attractive investment destination for chemical investment and domestic chemical makers continue to enjoy the advantage of access to abundant and cheaper feedstocks and energy. This is driving investment in chemical production projects.The shale gas boom has incentivized a number of chemical companies including industry heavyweights such as BASF SE (BASFY  -  Free Report) and LyondellBasell Industries N.V. (LYB  -  Free Report) to invest billions of dollars to beef up capacity. According to the ACC, roughly 320 chemical projects have been already announced worth more than $185 billion, 62% of which is foreign direct investment.Moreover, roughly 65% of the chemical investment announced since 2010 are complete or under construction. New capacity is expected to provide a boost to chemical production as these investments come on stream.The ACC expects chemical industry capital spending to rise 6.3% in 2018 and 6.8% in 2019 and eventually reach $48 billion by 2022.Strengthening Export MarketsThe ACC sees improving export markets to contribute to solid growth of the domestic chemical industry. Strengthening export markets and increasing capital spending are driving chemical demand across key end-use markets such as light vehicles and housing. Major export markets, such as Latin America and Asia, are also expected to play a significant role in basic chemical production growth this year and the next.EU Chemical Sector Back in BusinessThe European chemical industry has also swung back to life on the back of improving global economic sentiment and a resurgent Eurozone economy. Eurozone’s recovery has been backed by a pick-up in global economic activity, declining unemployment and strengthening business and consumer confidence.The outlook for the European chemical industry is positive. The European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) expects chemical output in the European Union to rise 2% year over year in 2018.Per the CEFIC, the growth of manufacturing production across sectors such as automotive, construction, metal production and electronics in the European Union has led to higher demand for chemicals in the region. Exports of chemicals produced in European Union have also increased, particularly in Asia and Russia.A Few ConcernsThe chemical industry, however, faces certain headwinds. A number of chemical companies are witnessing a spike in raw material prices, exacerbated by short supply due to last year’s hurricanes. Some of these companies, in their fourth-quarter earnings call, had warned of continued headwinds from elevated input costs through the first half of 2018. As such, raw material cost inflation may unfavorably impact margins of these companies.Chemical makers also continue to feel the pinch of depressed demand in agriculture markets. Sustained pressure on agricultural commodity prices is scuttling a meaningful recovery in this key chemical end-market.The outlook for the fertilizer and agricultural chemicals space remains cloudy due to continued weakness in crop prices, low farm income and sluggish economic conditions in certain emerging markets, including Latin America.Moreover, concerns regarding China’s future growth remain a source of near-term uncertainty for the chemical industry. Uncertainties surrounding China – a key market for chemicals – is expected to remain an overhang on the industry in the short to medium term. Sustained overcapacity, weak private investment and high levels of corporate debt are still hurting the world’s second-largest economy.What Zacks Industry Rank SaysWithin the Zacks Industry classification, the chemical industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors), which had a 2.6% share of total earnings for the S&P 500 in 2017. We rank all of the more than 250 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. (To learn more, visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.)We have three chemicals related industries – Chemical Diversified, Chemical Plastics and Chemical Specialty – at the expanded (aka ""X"") level. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The Zacks Industry Rank is #63 for Chemical Diversified (placing it at the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), #88 for Chemical Plastics (at top 34%) and #183 for Chemical Specialty (at bottom 29%).The location of these industries suggests that the general outlook for the chemical industry as a whole is leaning toward 'Positive.'Solid Q4 Earnings, Q1 Predictions Look PromisingThe Basic Materials sector is among the Zacks sectors that racked up the strongest gains in fourth-quarter 2017. Overall earnings for the sector climbed 45.2% while revenues spiked 21.3%. Roughly 89.5% of the sector participants posted earnings beat and around 73.7% surpassed revenue estimates.The Basic Materials sector is expected to continue the earnings growth momentum into first-quarter 2018. Earnings for the sector are projected to rise 42.1% in the first quarter while revenues are expected to go up 21%.For more details about the earnings of this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.Valuation Looks Bit StretchedGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries like chemicals, valuation for the ‘Chemicals’ industry looks bit stretched at the moment when compared to its own range and the broader market.The industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.7, which is above its own average of 12.7 in the past year. Moreover, the industry compares unfavorably with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA for the S&P 500 is at 11.8. As such, there seems to be little room for an upside moving ahead.Final ThoughtsWhile the chemical industry still faces a few headwinds, its momentum is expected to continue this year on sustained demand strength across light vehicles and construction markets, a rebound in demand in the energy place and significant shale-linked capital investment. Strategic actions including expansion of scale through acquisitions, operational efficiency improvement and continued focus on cost and productivity should help chemical makers weather the macroeconomic and industry-specific headwinds in 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

24,APD,"PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG  -  Free Report) won a contract from Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report). Per the contract, PPG Industries will produce heated pilot and co-pilot windshields for the Bell 525 Relentless commercial helicopter. The windshields will be made available for customer specification for helicopters operating in hilly regions and cold environments and for off-shore rescue operations. PPG Industries demonstrated the functioning of Aircon heating system and provided a cross-section sample of the same to Bell Helicopter. Bell Helicopter approved PPG Industries’ design for the composite windshields by completing the critical design review. The windshield will have an outboard ply of stretched acrylic with a scratch-resistant coating and an inboard polycarbonate ply which enhance the product’s strength. The windshields can withstand the impact of a 2.2-pound bird at 185 knots — Bell Helicopter’s bird-strike requirement. PPG Industries, which is among the prominent chemical companies along with Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD  -  Free Report) and Eastman Chemical Company (EMN  -  Free Report), witnessed a roughly two-fold year-over-year jump in net earnings from continuing operations to $184 million or 72 cents per share in fourth-quarter 2017. Adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18. Net sales rose around 8% year over year to $3,682 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,605 million. The company gained from favorable currency translation in the quarter. For 2018, PPG Industries expects acquisitions to contribute to sales roughly $125 million. The company recently agreed to acquire Netherlands-based leading architectural paint and coatings wholesaler, ProCoatings. Through its network of 23 multi-brand stores, ProCoatings distributes a large portfolio of professional paint brands across the Netherlands. The transaction is expected to close in first-quarter 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. To improve its cost structure, PPG Industries is pursuing significant restructuring actions that are mainly focused on regions and end-use markets with the weakest business conditions. The restructuring activities are expected to deliver around $125 million in annual savings with roughly $50 million of savings already realized in 2017 and another $45-$50 million expected in 2018. During the fourth-quarter call, PPG Industries stated that it is committed toward deploying at least $2.4 billion of cash in 2018 on acquisitions and share repurchases as part of its earlier communicated goal of deploying $3.5 billion in 2017 and 2018 combined. However, the company is exposed to raw materials cost pressure. PPG Industries is seeing higher raw materials costs and implementing pricing strategies to offset the impact of inflation. The company anticipates raw material inflation to continue through first-half 2018.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

In addition, the company has hiked its facility fees by roughly 15%. Price changes for individual customers will depend on their contract provisions or products purchased.Praxair cited increasing costs of energy, distribution and labor as the reason behind the rise in prices of the industrial gases.A month ago, the company had announced up to 10% increase in helium prices for its bulk liquid helium customers across nations. The price hike will be effective Jan 1, 2018. The price increase will cover higher costs for crude and refined helium, higher distribution costs and investments to improve its helium operations.We believe Praxair’s margins and profitability is highly dependent on costs of sales and expenses, as any unwarranted increase in these will lower the margins and profitability and vice versa.

Also, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.5% year over year.Despite such adversaries, increasing applications have been raising the demand for industrial gases over time, proving beneficial for companies like Praxair.

47,APD,"Industrial gas producer and supplier, Praxair Inc’s (PX  -  Free Report) proposed merger with Linde AG yesterday received a green signal from the Russian antitrust authority. As revealed by Linde plc — the company that will house the businesses of Linde AG and Praxair upon completion of the deal — the approval received was unconditional.   In a separate release on Oct 12, Praxair announced the signing of a long-term contract to supply industrial gases to Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation, a unit of Shanghai-based Huahong Group. Financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.We believe that market sentiments are positive for Praxair, as evident from 19.4% rally in its share price over the last six months. The stock has outperformed 16.4% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to over the same period. Praxair-Linde Merger DealPraxair signed a business combination agreement with Linde AG in June 2017. The proposed all-stock transaction will combine Praxair’s efficient operating model and Linde’s expertise in engineering and technology, creating a leading industrial gas company with a strong international presence, large customer base and solid financial flexibility.As agreed upon then, Praxair’s shareholders will be offered one share in the new company for each existing share while Linde’s shareholders can exchange each share with 1.54 shares in the new company. Praxair and Linde will each have 50% ownership in the new company.Based on 2016 results, the new holding company’s combined proforma revenues were approximately $29 billion while market capitalization was roughly $70 billion as of May 31. Incorporated in Ireland, the company will have 12-member board of directors and will be listed on both the NYSE and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard segment).The merged company is anticipated to benefit shareholders with realization of annual synergistic benefits of approximately $1.2 billion and cost reduction in a period of three years from closing of the transaction.Subject to pending closing conditions, the parties involved anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.Details of the Supply ContractPer the deal agreed upon, Praxair will supply nitrogen, high purity oxygen, helium and other gases to Shanghai Huali Microelectronics’ production base in Kangqiao Industrial Park. The company will build and operate two new air separation plants, with combined daily production capacity of 600 tons of nitrogen. Praxair anticipates the plant to start production in early 2018.Praxair’s association with Shanghai Huali Microelectronics can be dated back to 2010, when the former started supplying industrial gases to the latter under a long-term bulk supply contract.We believe such contracts reflect customers’ preference for Praxair’s products and will prove beneficial for its growth, going forward. Notably, the Shanghai Huali Microelectronics contract will strengthen the company’s foothold in China, particularly increasing its presence in the semiconductor end market.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWith a market capitalization of $40.4 billion, Praxair currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

48,APD,"Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) provided updates on third-quarter 2017 results. The company announced a non-cash net of tax charge of $114 million, or $1.05 per share, for goodwill impairment related to the Cast Products business. Allegheny anticipates third-quarter results to be in line with its July outlook excluding the impairment charge. A year-over-year improvement in High Performance Materials and Components segment is expected to continue over the next few years, courtesy of the ongoing next-generation aerospace ramp.  The company’s Flat Rolled Products segment results are expected to be adversely impacted by a sharp decline in raw material prices, mainly ferrochrome and nickel. This is expected to reduce profit margins due to out-of-phase raw material surcharges, resulting in a loss in this segment.  Further, the company expects financial results to be at or near break-even in 2018, and drive profitability by the beginning of 2019.  Sales in the third quarter are expected to be in the range of $865-$875 million with a reported loss in the range of $1.11-$1.14 per share, including the $1.05 per share charge for the goodwill impairment. Excluding this charge, the reported loss is expected in the range of 6 cents-9 cents per share. Allegheny has outperformed the industry it belongs to over a year. The company’s shares have moved up around 47.8% during this period compared with a roughly 35% gain recorded by the industry.   Allegheny is likely to benefit from its diversified global growth markets as well as cost-reduction and restructuring measures.

Price and EPS Surprise  Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. QuoteFactors to considerAir Products has a significant amount of cash to invest in its core industrial gases business. The company expects to deploy roughly $8 billion in strategic, high-return opportunities to create shareholder value over the next three years.  For fiscal 2017, Air Products expects adjusted earnings per share of $6.00–$6.25, which at midpoint, represents a 9% increase over last year. For third-quarter fiscal 2017, Air Products anticipates adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.55–$1.60 per share, which at midpoint, also represents a 9% increase over last year. Air Products is well placed to leverage the cyclical recovery in core industrial end-markets. The company has built a strong project backlog. These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow over the next few years. Acquisitions and new business wins are expected to continue to drive results. The company is also progressing well with its $600 million cost-cutting program. However, Air Products' industrial gases business in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region is experiencing pressure from a weak operating environment. The company is also seeing lower volumes in Latin America due to weak demand. Moreover, volumes in packaged gases continue to be weak while LNG (liquefied natural gas) sales remain under pressure due to low project activity. Air Products sees roughly 30 cents per share headwind associated with its LNG business in fiscal 2017 on a year over year basis. The company is also exposed to currency headwinds. Air Products’ shares have moved up 2.4% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s gain of 5.7%.  Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Air Products is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Air Products is currently pegged at 0.00%.

110,APD,"Monsanto Company  is slated to report fiscal first-quarter 2018 (ended November 2017) results on Jan 4, before the market opens.In the last year, Monsanto’s shares have yielded a return of 13%, outperforming 5.8% gain recorded by the industry.In the last four quarters, the company pulled off an impressive average positive earnings surprise of 244.78%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlaySolid demand for crop-yield enhancing products (like Roundup Ready 2 Xtend soybeans) and specialized glyphosate-based herbicides (like XtendiMax) are anticipated to bolster Monsanto’s sales. In addition, ongoing research and development investments will also likely aid the top line growth going forward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the company’s Agricultural Productivity and Seeds and Genomics segments is currently pegged at $844 million and $1,926 million, respectively, higher than $802 million and $1,848 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Moreover, Monsanto believes that its margins in fiscal 2018 will likely be stronger on the back of improved Intacta penetration and pricing in South America, gains secured from Precision Planning business spin-off (closed on Sep 5, 2017) and improved glyphosate pricing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gross profit of the company’s Agriculture Productivity and Seeds and Genomics segments are currently pegged at $146 million and $1,201 million, higher than $119 million and $1,140 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. However, in the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained unchanged for both fiscal 2018 and 2019, reflecting neutral sentiments.  We fear that stiff rivalry within the global seeds, traits and agricultural chemical industry might dent Monsanto’s growth.Moreover, Monsanto is a highly levered company with approximately $7.3 billion of long-term debt at the end of fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. We believe, if unchecked, such high debt levels will increase the company's financial obligations and impact its profitability.Monsanto’s cost and sales are highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations. For instance, weak agricultural products’ prices might continue to weigh on Monsanto’s revenues and margins.Monsanto accepted Bayer AG’s (BAYRY  -  Free Report) buyout offer worth $66 billion, inclusive of debt, in September 2016. Both companies look to close the deal by early 2018.   Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Monsanto will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Monsanto currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are pegged at 38 cents per share.Monsanto Company Price and EPS Surprise  Monsanto Company Price and EPS Surprise | Monsanto Company QuoteZacks Rank: Monsanto carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are two stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +1.04% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Its adjusted earnings for the quarter of $1.76 per share rose 18% from the year-ago quarter and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69. Revenues rose 13% year over year to $2.2 billion in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 billion.Air Products, in its fiscal fourth-quarter call, said that it expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.60-$1.70 for first-quarter fiscal 2018, up 9-16% from the year-ago quarter. For fiscal 2018, Air Products expects adjusted earnings per share of $6.85-$7.05, up 9-12% year over year.Estimates Northbound: Annual estimates for Air Products have moved north over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ confidence on the stock. Over this period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has increased by around 1.6% to $7.00 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has also moved up 4.4% over the same timeframe to $7.63.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Air Products has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 2.6%.Strong Balance Sheet: Air Products ended the fiscal fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3,273.6 million, a 153% year-over-year surge. Total long-term debt fell around 13% year over year to $3,402.4 million. The company remains committed to invest in its core industrial gases business leveraging its strong balance sheet to create significant value for its shareholders.Growth Drivers: Air Products has a long-term (three-five years) expected earnings per share growth rate of roughly 12.1%, higher than the industry average of 10%. Air Products is well placed to leverage the cyclical recovery in core industrial end-markets. Moreover, strategic investments in high-return projects, new business deals and acquisitions are expected to drive results in fiscal 2018.The company has also built a strong project backlog. These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow over the next few years. Air Products, in July, inked a long-term gas supply agreement with Huntsman Corporation (HUN  -  Free Report). Under the deal, Air Products will build, own and operate a new steam methane reformer and cold box in Geismar, LA. Air Products facilities which will supply hydrogen, carbon monoxide and steam to Huntsman's Geismar operations are expected to be onstream in Jan 2020. The new state-of-the-art facility will provide high reliability and sustainability with enhanced energy efficiency and will help to lower emissions.Air Products is also expanding in China. The company recently landed a second long-term oxygen and nitrogen supply contract with a leading global materials supplier in Guangdong in South China. The move will help to strengthen Air Products' position in the strategic industrial base as well as its relationship with this global customer. Air Products and Yankuang Group also recently entered into an agreement for a $3.5 billion coal-to-syngas production facility to be constructed in Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, China.Air Products also remains on track in delivering on its cost reduction programs, which should support its margins. The company is making a good progress with its $600 million cost-cutting program and has already delivered more than $475 million of cost savings and plans to deliver the balance in next two-three years.Moreover, Air Products has significant amount of cash to invest in its core industrial gases business. The company expects to have at least $8 billion to deploy in strategic, high-return opportunities (including acquisitions and large industrial gases projects) to create shareholders value over the next three years.Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

Operating profit increased to $61.7 million from $47 million in the prior-year quarter.

The segment’s operating loss came in at $7.3 million compared with the year-ago quarter loss of $20.8 million. Results were adversely impacted by a sharp decline in raw material prices, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher operating levels and the benefits of cost reductions and restructuring actions.Financial PositionAllegheny’s cash in hand as of Sep 30, 2017 was $124.9 million, down 33.7% year over year.

125,APD,"Industrial gas producer and supplier Praxair Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In each of the last four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results. Average earnings surprise was a positive 1.46%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.46 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.10%.In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 14.2% return, outperforming the gain of 11.9% recorded by the industry. Let us see how things are shaping up for Praxair prior to this earnings announcement. What’s Affecting Q3 Results?Praxair sources more than 60% of revenues from its North and South American operations. This has made the company’s financials highly susceptible to economic or political uncertainties in these regions. For the second half of 2017, the company believes that customer demand in the United States will be below expectations while economic conditions in South America will continue to suffer from political tensions. Europe will likely remain stable.Adding to the concerns is the adverse impact of the hurricanes in the United States on the demand of Praxair’s industrial gases. Also, the company faces headwinds from adverse movement in foreign currencies, geopolitical issues, rise in production costs and industry competition.Moreover, Praxair’s balance sheet is highly leveraged, with a debt-to-capital ratio of 58.5% in second-quarter 2017. We believe, if unchecked, higher debt levels might increase the company’s financial obligations and hence, prove detrimental to its profitability. Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

Newmont has surpassed expectations in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 14.4%.Shares of Newmont have moved up 11.5% in the past three months, outperforming the 5.1% growth recorded by its industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayNewmont, in July, revised its guidance of attributable gold production to the range of 5-5.4 million ounces for 2017 (up from 4.9-5.4 million ounces), as production at Long Canyon and Merian is expected to compensate the impact of declines at Yanacocha and Twin Creeks. However, the company kept attributable copper production forecast for 2017 unchanged from the previous guidance of 40,000-60,000 tons per year.Newmont also revised its AISC (all-in sustaining costs) guidance for 2017 and now expects it to be between $900 and $950 per ounce (down from $940 and $1,000 per ounce expected earlier).  In second-quarter 2017, Newmont's attributable gold production increased 13% year over year to 1.4 million ounces. The increase was due to production from Long Canyon and Merian, offsetting lower grades at Yanacocha and Tanami.Moreover, attributable gold production for North America, South America and Africa increased year over year while the same declined for Australia.Newmont is making notable progress with its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine. Tanami expansion project achieved commercial production in August. The Ahafo expansion projects represents additional upside.Moreover, the acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor (“CC&V”) represents a significant opportunity.  The company expects gold production from CC&V to be between 420,000 ounces and 470,000 ounces in 2017, at AISC in the range of $680-$730.Newmont is also making notable progress with its cost and efficiency improvement initiatives, which should lend support to its third quarter results. Strong operational performance is also allowing the company to generate positive free cash flow.Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Newmont is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

129,APD,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 25.Last quarter, the mining company reported a negative earnings surprise of 15%. Freeport missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 20.1%.Freeport’s shares have moved up 14.4% in the last three months, underperforming the 16.6% growth recorded by its industry.  Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFreeport, in July, cut its sales volume expectations for 2017. The company now sees sales volumes to be roughly 3.7 billion pounds of copper (down from 3.9 billion pounds expected earlier), 1.6 million ounces of gold (down from 1.9 million ounces expected earlier) and 93 million pounds of molybdenum, including 940 million pounds of copper, 375,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum in third-quarter 2017.The company assumes average prices of $1,250 per ounce of gold, $2.65 per pound of copper and $7.50 per pound of molybdenum for the remainder of 2017.The company’s consolidated copper sales volumes in the second quarter were lower than its expectations reflecting the impact of worker absenteeism on mining and milling rates in Indonesia. However, gold sales were higher year over year on higher ore grades from Indonesia. Copper sales from Freeport’s North American Copper Mines for the third quarter is projected to witness a 13.5% decrease from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 353 million pounds. The segment’s sales volume also decreased in the previous quarter mainly due to lower ore grades. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.Gold sales from the Indonesia  Mining for the third quarter is projected to decline 11.9% from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 376,000 ounces.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for copper sales from the company’s South America Mining is expected to be 315 million pounds for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 8.9% growth on a sequential-comparison basis. The company’s sales were affected in the second quarter due to reduced mining rates, ore grades and recoveries.Freeport is taking actions to cut mining costs and reduce debt. It is also conducting exploration activities near its existing mines with a focus to expand reserves that will support additional future production capacity. The company’s copper cash costs declined roughly 10% year over year in the second quarter. Freeport’s cost reduction actions should lend support to its margins in the third quarter.The company is also expected to gain from higher copper prices in the to-be-reported quarter, providing support to its top line. Copper prices have enjoyed a healthy run so far in 2017.However, Freeport has cut its copper and gold sales volume guidance for 2017, partly due to the impact of the suspension of exports in Indonesia. Freeport reduced its Indonesia workforce by 10% and cut investments in the Grasberg underground expansion to make up for the losses suffered due to the halt of export. Nevertheless, Freeport and the government of Indonesia have agreed on a framework that would allow Freeport to keep operating its Grasberg mine.Freeport-McMoran, Inc.

Cash production cost per ton increased 6% year over year to $57.37 in the reported quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher employee-related expenses, as well as increased energy rates, repair and maintenance costs, partly offset by reduced idle costs. Asia Pacific Iron Ore: Sales volumes in the segment decreased 20% year over year to 2.2 million metric tons. The decrease was mainly driven by lower production volumes due to operational decisions reflecting availability of quality ore and present market conditions. Revenues per ton were $43.36, up around 1.8% from the prior-year quarter. Cash production cost per ton was $40.54, up around 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.

131,APD,"The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 24.In the last quarter, the paints and coatings company reported a negative earnings surprise of 0.44% by posting adjusted earnings of $4.52 per share. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.54.Sherwin-Williams recorded net sales of $3,735.8 million in the quarter, marking a 16% year-over-year rise. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,571.9 million.Sherwin-Williams beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, while missing in the other two, delivering an average positive surprise of around 3.03%.Shares of Sherwin-Williams have moved up 10.5% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 6.9% growth.  Can Sherwin-Williams surprise investors this earnings or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLast month, Sherwin-Williams provided its revised guidance for third-quarter 2017 after hurricanes affected its stores. The company lowered its profit outlook for the third quarter to reflect the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria on its operations in Texas, Florida, the Caribbean and neighboring areas as well as disruptions from two earthquakes in Mexico.Sherwin-Williams noted that the hurricanes affected more than 600 stores while 40 locations in the Caribbean still remain closed. Sherwin-Williams operates 706 paint stores across Texas, Florida and the Caribbean and has 145 company-operated stores and 387 dedicated dealers in Mexico.As a result of the aforementioned disruptions, the company envisions third-quarter revenues in its Americas Group unit to be reduced by $50-70 million. It also sees its third quarter sales and profits to be hurt by lost sales days, costs associated with the clean-up and recovery initiatives and tightened supply of certain raw materials.Considering the impacts of hurricanes and earthquakes, Sherwin-Williams now expects its core net sales to rise by a low-single digit clip year over year in the third quarter compared with its earlier view of a low to mid-single digit percentage increase.At this expected sales level, the company now expects earnings for the third quarter to be in the band of $3.40-$3.70 per share, down from its earlier view of $3.70-$4.10. The revised outlook includes a $1.10 per share charge associated with the Valspar acquisition and a 40-60 cents per share increase from Valspar operations.Notably, the company is expecting the current sales momentum to continue in most geographies, especially in the company-operated stores in the unaffected regions of the United States and Canada. This will allow the company to recover some of the third-quarter earnings shortfall over the remainder of 2017.Sherwin-Williams, in June, closed its acquisition of Valspar, creating a premier global paints and coatings company. The buyout has positioned it as a leading paints and coatings provider globally. However, the company also faces earnings headwinds from sizable charges related to this buyout. It now expects charges related to the Valspar acquisition to be a $2.50 per share for 2017, roughly six times higher than its previous expectation of 40 cents per share.Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Sherwin-Williams Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Sherwin-Williams Company (The) QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Sherwin-Williams is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

135,APD,"Premium industrial metals & minerals company, BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report), recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Sep 30, 2017) operational results.Aggregate iron-ore output came in at 56 million tons (Mt) during the reported quarter, down 3% year over year. The downside was stemmed by weaker-than-expected production accrued from the Western Australia iron-ore mine, reduced opening of stockpile levels (following the Mt Whaleback screening plant fire in June 2017) and planned maintenance activities conducted in other mines.  However, BHP Billiton reaffirmed its iron-core productivity within the range of 239-243 Mt (estimating a year-over-year upside of 3-5%) for fiscal 2018. The company believes that the funding for South Flank project ( in June 2017) will likely augment gross output of this major steel-making metal in the quarters ahead.Notably, energy coal’s output in the reported quarter came in at 7 Mt, down 2% year over year. The fall was witnessed primarily due to lower productivity of the company’s Cerrejon mine.Nonetheless, it should be noted that in the fiscal first quarter, output volumes of petroleum dipped 8% year over year to 50 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). However, productivity guidance for fiscal 2018 has been reaffirmed within the range of 180-190 MMboe.Notably, metallurgical coal output was 11 Mt in the reported quarter, flat year over year.In addition, aggregate copper output came in at 404 kilo tons (Kt), up 14% year over year. The uptick came on the back of sturdy productivity accrued from Escondida, Olympic Dam and Antamina copper mines.Moving AheadBHP Billiton intends to boost its near-term operational performance on the back of increased safety measures, greater capital discipline and elevated productivity. The company anticipates that the successful accomplishment of the three-major petroleum and potash projects (worth $5.1 billion) will boost its productivity.The company also stated that the primary development work of its Spence Growth Option and Mad Dog Phase 2 projects commenced during the third quarter. These projects are likely to bolster the company’s aggregate productivity in the near future.Our TakeOver the last six months, BHP Billiton’s shares yielded a return of 19.7%, outperforming 12.5% growth recorded by the industry. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock currently flaunts a VGM Score A.The company is poised to grow on the back of escalating prices of major core metals and operating cash cost improvements. Moreover, we believe the upward trend in iron-ore prices will likely benefit BHP Billiton going forward. Iron-ore prices were up 1.5% to $61.83 per ton as of Oct 17, 2017.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Albemarle Corporation (ALB  -  Free Report) has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.17% for the last four quarters and currently carries a Zacks Rank of 2.

136,APD,"Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 20.Cleveland-Cliffs reported net earnings from continuing operations of $77 million or 26 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $30 million or 7 cents logged in the prior-year quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents.Sales for the quarter came in at $569.3 million, up 14.7% from $496.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $483 million.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, with an average negative surprise of 42.7%.Can Cleveland-Cliffs surprise investors again or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayCleveland-Cliffs, in July, cut its profit outlook for 2017. The company now sees net income of roughly $310 million, down from its earlier view of $380 million. It has also cut its adjusted EBITDA guidance to $650 million from $700 million expected earlier.Cleveland-Cliffs, in June 2017, said that it has selected a location in Toledo, OH, for the development of its first HBI production plant. The company has selected Midrex Technologies for design, engineering and procurement of necessary equipment for the new facility, which will produce 1.6 million tons of HBI per year.The new production facility is estimated to require roughly $700 million investment. The company expects the construction to begin by early 2018, and production of commercial tonnage of HBI is expected to initiate in the middle of 2020.The company now expects its full-year selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to be around $110 million, an increase from previous expectations of roughly $100 million to incorporate HBI prefeasibility spending and higher-than-expected incentive compensation accruals.Revenues from product sales and services for Cleveland-Cliffs’ U.S. Iron Ore segment for the third quarter is projected to witness a 5.5% increase from the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at $497 million. The segment’s sales volume increased in the second quarter mainly due to higher demand. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from product sales and services for the Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment is expected to be $96 million for the third quarter, reflecting an estimated 2% decline on a sequential-comparison basis. The company has also lowered its sales volume guidance for this segment for 2017 owing to termination of certain shipments caused by unfavorable market conditions.    Cleveland-Cliffs is exposed to headwind from lower expected iron ore pricing for the balance of 2017. Rising global supplies (notably from Brazil and China) are expected to put downward pressure on iron ore prices in second-half 2017. The company has reduced its profit outlook for 2017 factoring in lower expected iron ore prices.Cleveland-Cliffs’ shares have declined around 3.7% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s 9% growth.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cleveland-Cliffs is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Cleveland-Cliffs for the third quarter is -6.65%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 30 cents and 32 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

Tow volume and pricing declined in the reported quarter mainly due to lower industry capacity utilization rates and outpaced productivity gains in the quarter. The Consumer Specialties unit’s performance suffered a decline on a year-over-year basis.Acetyl Chain: The unit witnessed growth in profitability despite operational and supply chain disruptions in the Gulf Coast caused by Hurricane Harvey. The success of commercial actions mainly in Asia as well as continued strength in global acetyls lead to higher pricing as compared to the year-ago quarter.

138,APD,"Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Oct 19.The steel giant witnessed its profits surge year over year in second-quarter 2017, but its earnings and sales fell short of expectations. Nucor logged a profit of $323 million or $1.00 per share for the second quarter, compared to earnings of $243.6 million or 76 cents it registered a year ago. The figure, however, trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07.Revenues went up around 22% year over year to $5,174.8 million in the second quarter, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,307.8 million.  Nucor beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, with an average positive surprise of 8.99%.Shares of Nucor have declined 4.8% in the last three months, significantly underperforming the industry’s 6.6% growth.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLast month, Nucor provided its revised guidance for third-quarter 2017 and it expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 75-80 cents per share. This is a decrease from $1.00 per share recorded in the previous quarter and 95 cents it earned a year ago.Notably, expected earnings for the third quarter are also lower than the qualitative guidance provided by the company during its second-quarter 2017 earnings call in July. Earlier, the company had expected earnings in the third quarter to be in a band similar to the quarterly results of first-half 2017.Nucor expects a decrease in earnings of the steel mills segment in third-quarter 2017 on a sequential-comparison basis. Regardless of higher utilization rates at its sheet mills, continued import pressure has not allowed pricing to keep pace with rising input costs during the quarter. Earnings of plate mills unit are also anticipated to be considerably less owing to tepid demand in plate end-use markets.The company expects profitability of its steel products unit to improve on a sequential basis in the third-quarter 2017, but less than what was witnessed a year ago. Non-residential construction indicators are showing signs of marginal improvement compared to activity levels in 2016.Moreover, Nucor Steel Louisiana was affected from unexpected outages for most of third-quarter 2017, which caused the company to lower its forecasted earnings estimate for the raw materials segment. The unit halted production in late July for repairing materials handling systems and to address other equipment issues.  Despite the punitive trade actions in the recent past (in the form of imposition of heavy tariffs on imports), the U.S. steel industry still remains under the risk of cheaper imports. Despite the U.S. steel industry’s low capacity utilization, imports continue to flow into the domestic market due to foreign producers’ overcapacity. In the first eight months of 2017, finished steel imports have increased by an estimated 16.5% year over year, and accounted for about 28% share of the American market.Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Nucor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Nucor Corporation Quote Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Nucor is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

146,APD,"(0:30) - Berkshire Hathaway Buys Pilot Flying J(2:40) - 3 Lessons To Learn From Warren Buffett's Recent Interview(8:00) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks(15:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #62 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Warren Buffett was recently giving television interviews because Berkshire Hathaway bought a 38.6% stake in Pilot Flying J travel centers, which is the largest travel center company in North America, with 750 locations and 27,000 employees.When you heard the news, you might have been thinking, “travel centers? That’s so boring.”After all, this is a world filled with electric cars, 1-hour home delivery, ride-sharing, Airbnb, AI and social media.What are the lessons value investors can learn from what Warren Buffett is buying?3 Investing Lessons Learned from Warren Buffett1.     Boring is beautiful. Sometimes the “ho-hum” companies are what turn out to be the cash-generating superstars. Take Pilot Flying J, for instance. It’s not just a travel center, but it also operates 279 restaurants making it the 10th largest restaurant franchise in America.2.    Buy companies that are profitable. Sounds simple, right? But many don’t do it.3.    Buy building block companies. Buffett likes to buy companies that operate in the shadows that few people give a second thought to. Travel centers is one of those. A railroad is another.Tracey thought about these lessons and then wondered, what stocks fit into these parameters right now?There’s not really a screen for stocks Warren Buffett would like that are building block companies, profitable and boring.But she did find 5 stocks that have Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong  Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold) that fit into the parameters. Not all are classic value stocks, however, but they each fit into Buffett’s lessons.5 Stocks That Are Buffett-Like1.     Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) has been in business 100 years.

147,APD,"AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) has reached a four-year labor agreement with the members of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 3044. This new deal covers about 319 hourly production employees at the company's Rockport Works, Indiana.The contract which was ratified via voting on Sep 27 will be in effect till Sep 30, 2021. The agreement provides a competitive labor contract that is in the best interest of the company and its workforce.Shares of AK Steel have lost 10.5% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s 5.4% gain. The company expects shipments in the third quarter to be relatively flat compared to the second as higher shipments of the carbon distributing and converting market are expected to be offset by lower automotive shipments. Average selling price in the third quarter is expected to be modestly lower than the second. The expected decline assumes a change in the mix of shipments related to an anticipated reduction in automotive shipments and decline in raw material surcharges.The company’s sustained initiative to manage costs amid a challenging operating environment is expected to lend support to its bottom line. AK Steel is looking for cost-saving opportunities in 2017 through a number of means including process improvement, headcount cuts, reduction in process time and procurement activities.AK Steel also remains focused on expanding its core automotive business in 2017. The company is laying importance on de-emphasizing commoditized products and launching new value-added products. As part of this strategy, the company, last year, launched Nexmet — an innovative product range of high-strength steel for use in automotive light weighting applications. The products are expected to greatly benefit automotive manufacturers and reinstate the company’s focus on innovation and technology for product development.The acquisition of Precision Partners is also in sync with AK Steel's commitment to broaden its portfolio of high-value products and processes and reinforces collaboration with the company’s automotive market customers.However, AK Steel remains exposed to weakness in electrical steel pricing in the overseas markets. Prices remain under pressure in the international markets due to global overcapacity. The company expects the global electrical steel market to remain volatile in the near future due to production overcapacity.AK Steel Holding Corporation Price and Consensus  AK Steel Holding Corporation Price and Consensus | AK Steel Holding Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAK Steel currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic material space are The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

148,APD,"PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) provided an update on the impact of the recent natural disasters on its operations and also issued its third-quarter guidance. The recent hurricanes that originated in the Atlantic Ocean and the earthquakes that occurred in Mexico impacted employees in Texas, Florida and the adjacent states, Mexico, Puerto Rico and other parts of Caribbean. The company reported that though its properties suffered damage, it is on its way to resume operations. Also, the company assumes certain amount of inventory that will not be recoverable. The disruption of supply chain has been the most significant impact from hurricanes. This has had a ripple effect on the company’s operations throughout the United States and Mexico.  The company anticipates the impacts from hurricanes and earthquakes to affect its third-quarter earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents. This includes increased transportation and logistics costs to move raw materials and inventory to avoid PPG Industries’ customer disruptions, increased raw materials costs, facility and inventory damage net of any insurance recoveries, and the impact from lower sales in the affected areas.  PPG Industries expects third-quarter volume growth rate to be above 1.5%, exceeding the growth rate for first-half 2017. In the third quarter, moderate raw material cost inflation was earlier anticipated by the company. As a result of high levels of inflation persisting due to ongoing impacts from supplier outages in Europe and continued mandatory curtailments of raw material production in China, the company expects third-quarter inflation rate to match or possibly exceed the sequentially prior quarter, excluding the hurricane impacts.  Inclusive of the recent business trends and hurricane effects, PPG Industries expect third-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations to be $1.48-$1.55.  PPG Industries has underperformed the industry over a year. The company’s shares have moved up around 5.1% over this period, compared with roughly 27.7% gain recorded by the industry.  PPG Industries expects modest global economic growth. Also, the company anticipates a higher level of earnings-accretive cash deployment in the second half of 2017 including acquisitions and share repurchases.  PPG Industries is taking steps for growing organically. The company is also taking measures to lower costs. The company also remains committed to deploy cash on acquisitions and share repurchases. It plans to deploy $2.5-$3.5 billion cash for acquisitions and share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 combined and is now targeting the top end of that range at a minimum. Additionally, the company remains on track with its cost cutting and restructuring actions and is expected to deliver $120-$130 million in annual savings, with $40-$50 million of savings expected to be realized in 2017. However, PPG Industries faces currency headwind and macroeconomic challenges.
