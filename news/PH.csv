6,PH,"U.S. diversified stock mutual funds extended their rally in February, picking up steam while tacking on 2.68% on average after gaining 1.83% in January, according to Lipper Inc.That reflected gains by the broad stock market, measured by the S&P 500, which advanced 3.97% last month after notching a 1.90% gain in January. But market leadership rotated back to more defensive sectors, reflecting growing caution among investors.""The more-defensive stocks did well, while cyclical energy and materials did not outperform,"" said Lew Piantedosi, who is lead manager of seven Eaton Vance funds, totaling $3.9 billion in assets. ""It was a complete reversal from the Q4 postelection market rally, which was a cyclicals rally.""Sentiment flipped back in favor of growth-oriented cyclicals after President Trump's address to Congress on the last night of February.But the tilt earlier in February toward cyclicals reflected investors' concern that Trump and the Republican-majority Congress may have a harder time than previously expected in implementing pro-growth policies.Reflecting the optimistic portion of February's market performance, health/biotechnology funds led sectors last month, gaining 6.72%.Among U.S. diversified stock fund categories, S&P 500 index funds led the way with a 3.87% gain.World equity funds lagged U.S. diversifieds, advancing just 1.90%, led by India region funds' 6.08% climb.Taxable bond funds eked out an 0.87% gain on average last month. Emerging markets local currency funds outpaced other taxable categories, rising 1.94%.Piantedosi is guardedly bullish, going forward. ""The bull market is in place until proven otherwise,"" he said. Many investors and market observers have tried to call a market top. But the economy keeps getting better, Piantedosi says. ""Corporate earnings keep getting better, and earnings support the market,"" he added.The wild card that could derail the rally is the political landscape, he warns.As long as the economy stays on track, Piantedosi likes the shift to digital by advertising. ""That benefits Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL),"" he said. ""And Amazon (AMZN) dominates online retail.""Another area he likes is biotech, which is producing a parade of treatments for diseases. ""Celgene (CELG) is a leader within cancer treatments,"" he said. ""It has an unbelievable pipeline. It is growing earnings north of 20% annually and trades at a 17-times forward multiple, just below the market multiple of 18.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. See which biomed/biotech firm is No. 1, and check out its easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data at IBD's Stock Checkup.In energy, he likes energy explorer and producer Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and field services provider Halliburton (HAL).He said, ""Anadarko is once again profitably growing production, generating significant cash flow and is attractively valued."" He added, ""Halliburton's exposure is mainly to North American shale, and with oil prices (steady) in the mid-50s, you're starting to see rig counts increase. That increases the need for field services. They put rigs together, service them, replace broken parts and so on.""He added, ""In consumer discretionary, it's hard to find good names. But there's Advance Auto Parts (AAP). They're an auto parts retailer. That sector is less susceptible to be Amazoned. Their business doesn't require a lot of capital expenditure, so it's a good cash flow type of business. And Advance got a new CEO three or four months ago. He's a supply chain expert, which is what Advance needs.""One key reason it is hard for investors to find consumer discretionary that names they like is because so many big-box retailers are getting kicked by online retailers, says James Abate, chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management and manager of its $125 million Select Equity (DHAMX). Add to that the risk that many will be forced to cope with higher costs stemming from the border adjustment tax — basically, a value-added tax on imports — proposed by Trump, Abate says.Names in the sector that he does still like include media company CBS (CBS) and specialty food retailer Whole Foods Market (WFM).Sporting an OK 86 Composite Rating from IBD, CBS is trying to clear a consolidation after a run-up that started in the fall.Whole Foods has a very weak Composite Rating of 20 from IBD and is trading at less than half its late 2013 high.The supermarket chain in January reinstalled co-founder John Mackey as sole CEO.Also, the Trump push for infrastructure construction should benefit a number of telecommunications and utility companies, including Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ), Abate says. Comcast has been running up since the election and is near its all-time high. Verizon, range-bound between 57 and 46 since July, is trading near 49, 12% below its 52-week high.Flow-control systems manufacturer Parker-Hannifin (PH) also stands to gain from infrastructure spending. Likewise, Quanta Services (PWR), which provides engineering and construction services. ""They should benefit from increased spending on pipelines and energy transmission projects,"" he said.The market faces risks in the form of geopolitical uncertainty, possible trade wars and rising stock valuations, Abate says. ""There's a lot of downside risk facing this market,"" he said. ""I expect a lot of volatility going forward.""RELATED:Mutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

7,PH,"Machinery makers Dover Corp. (DOV), Flowserve (FLS), Parker Hannifin (PH) and DXP Enterprises (DXPE) rallied again Thursday on higher oil prices and hopes for more infrastructure spending. Stronger manufacturing data and a Parker Hannifin acquisition also may have helped.U.S. oil prices rose 3.3% to $51.06 on Thursday, after surging more than 9% Wednesday on OPEC's agreement to cut production. Higher prices should spur more exploration and drilling in U.S. shale and elsewhere, boosting machinery makers that have seen profit and sales decline.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale plays are big winners from the OPEC deal, but here's why U.S. oil production won't ramp up quickly.Dover, an industrial equipment maker than serves the oil and gas industry among others, climbed 4% to 75.53 at the close on the stock market today. That cleared a buy point of 75, with the stock trading at the highest levels since June 2015. Dover rose 4.1% on Wednesday.Flowserve, which makes flow control products, popped 5.1% to 49.85 Thursday afternoon after climbing more than 5% on Wednesday. Flowserve cleared resistance near 50 and is nearing a traditional buy point of 52.60.DXP Enterprises, which also makes flow control products, rose 3.8% to 34.97, rising intraday to the highest since August 2015. Shares rose 12.8% on Wednesday, clearing a 31.44 buy point.Parker Hannifin rose 3.3% to 143.47, hitting a record high after climbing more than 1% on Wednesday. Parker Hannifin will buy Claracor for $4.3 billion including debt, or $83 a share. Claracor will expand Parker Hannifin's product reach into filtration products. Claracor rose more than 17% to 82.58 by the closing bell.

The company raised its full-year 2016 EPS guidance from continuing operations to $3.95 to $4.10, up from $3.80 to $4 earlier, and well above Wall Street's $3.92 target.The Ireland-based maker of climate control systems sold its remaining equity interest in Hussmann Parent on April 1 as part of a transaction in which Panasonic bought 100% of Hussmann’s shares. Ingersoll-Rand received net proceeds of about $415 million.

23,PH,"Large caps are looking tired. A recent check of the Big Cap 20 found 16 stocks that were either late stage or too extended to buy.Leaders have plenty of reasons to be suffering from exhaustion. Yes, many stocks have had a long run, but success doesn't fully explain the tired look of the Big Cap 20. A fresh rotation of new stock names is supposed to keep the lineup at least interesting. But the new names aren't stepping forward to lead.Why is that?Part of the reason is that the expected leadership never won favor. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) made the Big Cap 20 at the start of the year. In late January, Horton reported quarterly earnings growth of 42%, the best in 10 quarters. But the stock kept falling in the weeks ahead. In late April Horton reported 52% earnings growth and then fell some more.When good earnings growth can't persuade either a stock or its group to advance, it's best to back away. Arguing with the market is folly. In this case, the whole industry went into a decline.Caterpillar (CAT) is another stock that made the Big Cap 20 in early January. Caterpillar reported quarterly earnings growth 160% in late January. The stock began a choppy consolidation after the results.Caterpillar is now about 11% off its high.Sometimes an out of favor old name can show new strength. In early January, Parker Hannafin (PH) raised that hope. The stock made the Big Cap 20. But the motion-control technologies provider couldn't overcome the market. The S&P 500 dropped about 12% in 10 sessions in late January and early February, and Parker Hannafin sank with the market.Big cap bank stocks were another group that garnered generous coverage but never delivered as expected.Earnings growth has not been a problem for most stocks. But the market has had trouble converting good news into stock gains.What's the other part of the problem?The other problem appears to be news-driven. The market's troubles began around the same time that President Trump slapped tariffs on solar panels and washing machines Jan. 22. The list of targets grew from there.Meanwhile, starting in November, China has had three waves of tariff cuts. This has not received much attention, but it could pay off for China.China has trimmed tariffs on avocados, mineral water, strollers, washing machines, refrigerators, cosmetics, drugs, shoes, kitchenware and fitness supplies. Some say the cuts are insignificant.But if those kinds of tariff cuts were to lead to reciprocal actions, the world economy would benefit. And the stock market would likely see some new leaders.RELATED:Like Your Stocks On The Trashy Side?

Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares.

43,PH,"After serving in the U.S. military, some veterans become financial advisors. They find that their Armed Forces experience influences them in positive ways.Financial advisors with a military background often cite their years of service as a valuable asset. From gaining discipline to learning how to weather a crisis, they carry lessons learned, work habits and best practices into their career as financial planners.""The military shaped me in a distinct way,"" said Reid Hartsfield, a certified financial planner in Jacksonville, Fla. ""It makes you think differently. It teaches you to solve problems.""Hartsfield spent 10 years in the Navy, including stints on fast-attack, nuclear-powered submarines. His job required that he become a quick learner.""With only 130 crew on a sub, you wear a bunch of different hats,"" he said. ""You have to know a little bit about a lot of stuff so that you can fill in for someone in a pinch if you had to.""Thanks to frequent military drills, Hartsfield learned to think ahead. He mentally prepared for flooding or fire on a sub and rehearsed what actions to take to mitigate the damage.Throughout his naval training, he engaged in ""what if"" thinking. Anticipating what he'd do under ever-changing conditions has made him a better advisor who understands the value of scenario planning.When meeting with clients, he likes to pose lots of hypothetical questions such as, ""If your partner dies, what will happen to your assets?"" or ""What if your portfolio takes a severe hit?""Wealth management is easy when everything's rosy. But challenges arise when obstacles or irregularities threaten to interfere with a client's long-term financial plan and retirement.Hartsfield's military training helps him solve client problems in a systematic manner. He learned in the Navy to identify an anomaly, such as low pH level in the reactor coolant, and determine the cause. Similarly, he addresses a client's complex estate plan or cash flow issue with analytical precision.""You have to go through a progression of stuff to figure it out,"" he said. ""It prevents you from making assumptions.""The ability to diagnose a complicated situation with clear-eyed, rigorous analysis is especially useful in an unpredictable world. If you let biases or hunches supplant careful observation, you can draw faulty conclusions and lead clients astray.In his 26 years in the U.S. Army, Russ Robertson gained an appreciation of standard operating procedures. Now a certified financial planner in Springfield, Va., Robertson says that having step-by-step protocols to manage important activities invariably improves results.""Standard operating procedures make you more organized when chaos swirls around you,"" he said. ""Things are a lot calmer because of that.""When undergoing routine audits at his advisory firm, Robertson follows a checklist. It's a lesson he learned as an Army colonel.""It makes inspections easier,"" he said. ""We give inspectors our checklist and say, 'Here you go.' Then we get back to work.""Serving in the military can resemble an extended exercise in stress management. To cope with sudden crises, cadets learn how to think quickly and fix what's broken.""Nobody makes good decisions under stress,"" said Sean Pearson, a certified financial planner in Conshohocken, Pa. He has served in the Pennsylvania National Guard for 19 years.Stationed in Iraq, Pearson recalls donning his chemical-protection suit as air-raid sirens blared. While waiting for incoming missiles, he knew that he'd resume his duties after the threat passed.""You have to have patience under fire and stick with your plan,"" he said. ""I tell my clients, 'Let's create a plan and stick to that plan, even under stress.'""He finds that many individuals face periods of financial stress. If markets plummet, for instance, they may impulsively seek to abandon their long-established investment strategy.""I learned from the military to persevere through unpleasant stuff,"" said Pearson, who works for Ameriprise Financial Services. ""Things get better. Stress dissipates over time. I'll tell clients, 'We're five years into a 20-year plan. What you're feeling right now is temporary.'""In addition, the military instilled in Pearson an eagerness to expand his knowledge. Going through basic training and officer school, Pearson remembers the constant focus on absorbing and retaining new information such as details about certain weapon systems.He learned that after digesting new information, the next step was applying it and demonstrating technical prowess. Then he would teach others.""It's like being an advisor where I keep learning,"" he said. ""I got an MBA. I learned about insurance. From the military, you get the discipline to pursue lifelong learning and then share what you know.""RELATED:How Advisors Coach Retirees To Avoid Wasting Money On Costly BuysEager To Avoid Burning Out, Advisors Maintain A Fresh PerspectiveAdvisors Guide Clients Through The Complexities Of Social Security

""While we are excited about the technology and view the VA announcement as great for patients, we think the exoskeleton market will take time to grow, given the business model is resource-intensive and there is a lack of broad reimbursement.""""We note that RWLK ended the Q3 with $25 million in cash, which at the current burn rate would imply about 3 to 4 quarters of cash. Given the announcement, we are raising our 2017 revenue estimate to $21 million from $18 million and our price target to 11.""Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

45,PH,"Shampoo tycoon Paula Kent Meehan chased silver-screen dreams. Then her star bubble burst. ""After painfully coming to the conclusion Hollywood wasn't going to make me the next Joan Crawford, I wanted to control my own destiny,"" she said.Meehan (1931-2014) ended up turning heads in the business world.With $3,000 earned from acting jobs — equivalent to $23,500 today — she launched hair-care startup Redken Laboratories in 1961. The shampoo firm lathered industry stalwarts like Clairol and took 20% of the U.S. hair-care market by 1980.In 1993, Meehan sold the firm — which tallied $165 million in sales that year — to a L'Oreal (LRLCY) American subsidiary for an undisclosed sum.""Although Paula Kent Meehan did not achieve her ambition to be a Hollywood star, she launched one of the most influential American beauty startups of the 1960s and 1970s,"" Geoffrey Jones, author of ""Beauty Imagined: A History of the Global Beauty Industry,"" told IBD.Meehan restyled the industry by applying highbrow science to hair care products. The company's concoctions — formulated by partner and chemist Jheri Redding — promised to make tresses healthier.""Simultaneously, she decided not to compete with incumbents in department stores and drugstores, but instead sell directly to the professional salon channel,"" said Jones.That move elevated the role of stylists, whom Meehan trained to market her wares. Competitors rushed to copy the approach.Good Look""It's a model of how a crowded and quite mature market can be shifted and reshaped by a new entrepreneurial entrant,"" Jones said.As a businesswoman, Meehan shone. ""Paula Kent was a truly inspiring woman who transformed the hair care industry,"" said Shane Wolf, Redken Worldwide general manager. ""With her great passion and entrepreneurial spirit, she touched the hearts and minds of so many people.""Meehan led the firm for decades — partner Redding sold his stake in the mid-1960s and launched competing firms — and maintained a high profile in business and philanthropy until her death at age 82.""Like any company, Redken had its ups and downs but never once experienced a losing year, so we had a good reputation on Wall Street,"" she told the Beverly Hills Courier.She was born Paula Baer in that Los Angeles enclave to accountant Richard Baer and housewife Lois.The California girl began acting at age 12 and dropped out of school at 15 to marry beau Donald Slocum.A divorced mother by age 17, Paula made ends meet as a secretary, gas station attendant and actress. Her stage name: Paula Kent.She appeared in commercials and won bit parts in TV shows, peaking with a recurring role as a restaurant hatcheck girl on the 1960s detective show ""77 Sunset Strip.""""Like every actress, I had to spend many hours with studio makeup artists and hairdressers,"" she recalled.Unlike other actresses, she had allergic reactions to hair products. So she turned to a friend's husband, Redding, who owned a beauty salon in Van Nuys, Calif.""More than strictly being a beautician, he was actually a frustrated chemist who knew all about the ingredients contained in the products being put on people's hair,"" Meehan said.His formulations eliminated allergic reactions and made hair healthier because he matched the suds' pH — or measure of hydrogen vs. hydroxide ion levels — to the hair's acidic pH level, which made locks stronger and shinier.Hence the oft-marketed phrase ""pH balanced.""With Redding's concoctions, Meehan looked beautiful without breaking out in itchy bumps.On the hunch that other women would benefit, the duo launched Redken Laboratories — taking Red from Redding and ken from Kent — in 1961.""My primary motivation selfishly was not only to find natural and gentle products suitable for my own hair and skin, since what I'd come across wasn't doing the trick, but also be in a business that would help others,"" Meehan said.The first batches were mixed in a bathtub with a rowing oar and dubbed with lab-inspired names: Amino Pon and PPT S-77.The solutions seemed unconventional. Redken's shampoo didn't lather, and the conditioner would turn hair brittle if overused.The need to educate beauticians on how to properly apply the products turned into a marketing boon.""We began to pioneer the teaching of the chemistry of hair to stylists so they could be better equipped to serve their clients' needs,"" Meehan said. ""In effect, this served to elevate the art of hairdressing to a higher technical and professional standard.""Come On InThe in-salon retailing approach became the new style.""Salons began to realize that it was crazy not to sell a woman shampoo. She was going to buy it someplace,"" Meehan said in a 1984 interview with Forbes.Her pioneering paid off. Redken's sales hit $1.5 million in 1966, or $11 million in today's money.For a promotional push, Meehan pursued a big name to expound on her shampoos and conditioners. The one-time aspiring actress understood celebrity power and went after the biggest in hair: French stylist Vidal Sassoon.When he spoke, women listened.""I never thought I'd pay anyone what I paid Vidal,"" Meehan told Modern Salon magazine. ""I was shocked at the expense, but I was also shocked at the numbers of people who turned up to see him.""Meehan knew how to attract good people.She hired John Meehan as a vice president of sales in 1969 and married him in 1971.The opposites achieved professional balance.""John Meehan was a buttoned-down kind of guy with a very low tolerance for risk, and my mother was an entrepreneur who took a lot of risks,"" Michael Miller, Paula's son from a previous marriage, told Modern Salon. ""John was analytic; she was creative. But the two of them together were able to do great things for the industry and for themselves.""Great things were happening for the future Mrs. Meehan.In 1970, the company was operating out of a 20,000-square-foot building in Van Nuys, and she was invited to join a local bank's board.The experience let the entrepreneur rub shoulders with some of California's top businessmen and emboldened her to expand.ExpansionRedken's 1971 initial public offering raised $5 million, with which Meehan built a 250,000-square-foot headquarters, manufacturing plant and research facility in L.A.'s Canoga Park neighborhood. The added capacity helped the firm expand distribution to 35 countries.The hair care industry, meanwhile, became a scientific arms race as competitors vied to outformulate each other.""One thing we never scrimped on was research. It was an ongoing effort by a large staff,"" Meehan told the Beverly Hills Courier.Her company would hold more than 80 patents, and the enterprising executive who'd taken night classes in business became an evangelizing chairwoman who shared her enthusiasm with employees and distributors.""By 1988 and sales of $120 million, I had enough of being a public entity and decided to take the company private again,"" Meehan said.With a personally guaranteed $58 million loan, Meehan bought back the company's publicly owned shares in 1988. By 1993, sales had soared to $165 million.The company had long turned away suitors such as Revlon (REV) and Helene Curtis. But after 32 years of business, Meehan accepted a purchase offer from Cosmair, the U.S. licensee of cosmetics giant L'Oreal.Meehan didn't rest after the sale, instead remaining active in business and philanthropy.She helped launch an annual industry recognition event called the Global Salon Business Awards and purchased the Beverly Hills Courier a few months before her death.Meehan simply went after what she wanted, said son Michael: ""She had a drive and appetite that far exceeded her experience.""

46,PH,"There's nothing like a promising corporate marriage to make a big splash on Wall Street.
"
47,PH,"That's how the scenario has played out for water products industry leader Pentair (PNR). Its stock has spurted up about 62% since the company tied the knot with Tyco International's (TYC) Tyco Flow division, in September 2012, six months after announcing plans.
"
48,PH,"The $10 billion stock-for-stock merger created a roughly $8 billion-a-year powerhouse in flow control, filtration and equipment protection. Tyco Flow complements Pentair's offerings and gives it a strong position in fast-growing markets, including the energy arena, while giving a nice lift to revenue and profit, as well as generating cost synergies.
"
49,PH,"The combo also gives Pentair an opportunity to apply its Pentair Integrated Management System to Tyco Flow's business with the goal of boosting efficiency, performance and productivity — in turn driving earnings growth, analysts say. The PIMS approach, as Pentair calls it, involves a studied set of methods and processes for finding new market opportunities, speeding product development and planning rollouts, while trying to stay lean and sharp as a company.
"
50,PH,"Pentair was already a big player in the water and fluid systems arena prior to the merger, with products ranging from energy-efficient pumps and point-of-use filtration to engineered pumps and fluid processing systems. It also had a strong position in technical solutions with products that guard and protect electronics and electrical equipment such as enclosures and cases, and made heat management equipment and thermal management systems.
"
51,PH,"Tying With Tyco
"
52,PH,"Tyco Flow, a maker of flow control products, added to the mix a lineup including highly engineered valves and controls used in energy, general process, mining and water industries.
"
53,PH,"""The deal was transformational,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst John Quealy. ""It gets Pentair into the energy market where they weren't a player, and from a financial perspective it doubled the size of the company.""
"
54,PH,"Pentair posted revenue of $4.4 billion in 2012. It estimates 2013 sales will grow to $7.4 billion.
"
55,PH,"The rationale behind the deal was diversification, says Quealy.
"
56,PH,"Prior to the merger, he says, Pentair was ""very strong"" in water and electrical equipment, but had ""de minimis"" exposure to energy. Meanwhile Tyco was ""very strong"" in energy-related applications, he adds, and energy was an area in which Pentair intended to participate.
"
57,PH,"The combination gives Pentair more exposure to energy applications in industrial sectors and doubles its presence in the energy sector as a combined company, said CEO Randall Hogan on a conference call in March 2012 announcing the deal. Pentair expected the transaction to be ""highly accretive"" to earnings, adding 40 cents a share to 2013 earnings. It estimates combined company earnings will be greater than $5 a share by 2015, reflecting synergies through efforts such as streamlining operations and economies of scale.
"
58,PH,"Since closing the deal, adds Quealy, Pentair has ""encouraged the Street"" it can hit the 2015 earnings target. Most recently, on Dec. 10, Pentair said in a statement that it ""remains committed to the target synergies from the transaction, and its $5 per share 2015 EPS goal.""
"
59,PH,"Pentair is able to drive earnings through operating efficiencies and continuous improvement processes, says Wedbush Securities analyst David Rose.
"
60,PH,"""It's still very early in the process, but right out of the gate it looks like the company is a little ahead of expectations in cost-saving synergies,"" he said. ""The outlook so far is encouraging.""
"
61,PH,"Fruits Of Synergy
"
62,PH,"Investors believe the merger was a good move for the company, he says, and consequently the stock has made a fairly large move.
"
63,PH,"""We think there are a lot of opportunities ahead and clearly see the path to more operating efficiencies and cost reductions,"" Rose said, ""probably on the higher end of expectations.""
"
64,PH,"Pentair now expects its ""realized synergies"" relating to the merger integration in 2013 to be about $120 million, above the $90 million previously estimated, said Hogan on the company's Oct. 22 third-quarter conference call.
"
65,PH,"""The increase over previous estimates is being driven by sourcing and lean savings in Flow Control and is the result of building momentum around our proven PIMS operating system,"" Hogan said.
"
66,PH,"Quealy figures Pentair is in about the ""third or fourth inning"" of the merger integration process.
"
67,PH,"Pentair will likely shed more light on its prospects in the wake of the merger when it gives its full-year 2014 outlook on Tuesday.
"
68,PH,"Quealy says he expects the forecast to be ""consistent with other industrials,"" and that he doesn't expect any ""major surprises.""
"
69,PH,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see 2014 earnings rising 24% to $3.96 a share.
"
70,PH,"Meanwhile, Pentair is faring well on the financial front, with double-digit profit gains the past two quarters. Earnings rose 34% to 86 cents a share in the third quarter. Sales jumped 111% to $1.8 billion. Analysts expect full-year earnings to rise 34% to $3.20 a share.
"
71,PH,"""The third quarter met our expectations on the bottom line, as margins expanded 210 basis points to 13.6%,"" said Hogan on the quarter's conference call. ""Price and productivity more than offset inflation, mix was positive and synergies read out better than expected. Our adjusted EPS grew 25%, even though sales declined 1% organically.""
"
72,PH,"Regional Ups And Downs
"
73,PH,"But sales were $50 million below Pentair's expectations, he added, due primarily to weak results in Australia. The weakness was not only related to the local economy, but also ""a significant foreign exchange head wind,"" he said.
"
74,PH,"On a brighter note, Pentair continues to see strength in the residential end market as it benefits from an improving housing market in North America and more spending on dwellings amid rising home values.
"
75,PH,"Pentair's huge lineup for this market ranges from treatment products that filter and purify water to energy-efficient systems that ensure water pressure is just right. Pentair is also a leading provider of pool and spa equipment.
"
76,PH,"Sales in the residential and commercial end markets, which accounted for about 45% of the company's Water & Fluid Solutions segment revenue in the quarter, rose 12% from a year earlier.
"
77,PH,"The food and beverage sector — also a part of the Water & Fluid Solutions segment — remained ""very strong"" in the quarter, Hogan says. Sales to that market grew 20%.
"
78,PH,"In the Valves & Controls segment, created after the Tyco Flow merger, sales declined 1% in the quarter. They would have been up 1% if Australia were excluded, said Hogan on the call.
"
79,PH,"Sales to the oil and gas industry were flat, he added, as many ""downstream"" customers deferred annual maintenance shutdowns due to high activity.
"
80,PH,"Pentair is the fifth-largest company by market cap in IBD's Machinery-General Industrial industry group, after Illinois Tool Works (ITW), Parker-Hannifin (PH), Ingersoll-Rand Co. (IR) and Dover (DOV). The group currently ranks No. 20 of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks.
"
81,PH,"On Tuesday Pentair announced that its board has authorized a share buyback program of up to $1 billion through Dec. 31, 2016. The buyback will leave Pentair with another $2 billion in cash and balance sheet capacity for additional business reinvestment or share repurchase by 2015, Hogan said in a statement.
"
82,PH,"The same day, Pentair said that its board has approved changing the parent company's place of incorporation from Switzerland to Ireland. Shareholders are expected to vote on the proposed change at an anticipated second-quarter shareholders meeting.

85,PH,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PH due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Parker-Hannifin Beats on Q3 Earnings, Lifts View AgainParker-Hannifin kept its impressive streak of beating estimates alive for the 11th consecutive quarter, as its third-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62 by 6.9%.The earnings figure was even more impressive on a year-over-year basis, reflecting an improvement of 33%. The uptrend came on the back of remarkable revenue expansion, improved margins and the revamped Win Strategy.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter under review jumped 20% year over year to a record $3,750 million and also trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,690 million. Contribution from the CLARCOR acquisition and consistent performance in the Diversified Industrial segment were major growth drivers. Organic sales increased 8% year over year.Parker-Hannifin’s adjusted total segment operating income for the reported quarter came in at $610.1 million, up 16.3% from the year-ago quarter’s tally of $509.9 million. Orders also increased 11% in aggregate for the company. The company witnessed order growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, mirroring improving demand in the key end markets and regions.Segmental PerformanceIn the Diversified Industrial segment, North American sales for the quarter climbed 25% to $1,761.8 million, maintaining its striking momentum. Additionally, this segment recorded 11% growth in orders on a year-over-year basis.Industrial International, which is also classified under the Diversified Industrial segment, performed strongly as well, delivering a 23% year-over-year jump in sales to $1,389.3 million. In addition to robust sales growth, orders in this segment also advanced 8% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues in the Aerospace Systems segment charted positive growth in the quarter review and rose 4% year over year to $598.4 million. Orders grew 17% in this segment on a rolling 12-month average basis.In addition to strong sales growth, Parker-Hannifin achieved robust operating margins during the reported quarter as well. Adjusted segment operating margins during the quarter came in at 16.3%, expanding 20 basis points (bps) year over year. Apart from accelerated revenue growth, successful execution of the company’s Win Strategy initiatives drove margins.LiquidityAs of Mar 31, 2018, Parker-Hannifin’s cash and cash equivalents were $1,089.5 million, higher than $819.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Long-term debt was $4,818.6 million at year end, lower than $5,255.2 million recorded a year ago.AcquisitionsIn third-quarter fiscal 2017, Parker-Hannifin closed its most notable acquisition agreement to buy air filtration-systems provider — CLARCOR Inc. — for roughly $4.3 billion in cash. The acquisition will unlock fresh recurring revenue streams for Parker-Hannifin’s Filtration Group as 80% of CLARCOR’s revenues are generated through aftermarket sales. The company is bullish on the integration of CLARCOR with its filtration business, which will help it double sales in this unit and optimize the after-market mix of Parker-Hannifin.Further, Parker-Hannifin announced the acquisition of Helac Corporation in 2017, which specializes in the design and manufacture of helical rotary actuators. Helac will aid Parker-Hannifin in expanding its hydraulics product portfolio and cater to customers in a wide variety of markets.The company is currently integrating these two filtration units into its businesses. We believe that these acquisitions will unlock significant synergies and drive growth for the company in the times to come.GuidanceOnce again, Parker-Hannifin raised its guidance for the fiscal year ending Jun 30, 2018. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations are projected in the range of $9.95-$10.15 per share (previous projection: $9.65-$10.05). The guidance is adjusted for expected business realignment expenses of approximately $50 million and CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses of $45 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price and Consensus  Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price and Consensus | Parker-Hannifin Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, PH has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value, growth, and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PH has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

The acquisition will unlock fresh recurring revenue streams for Parker-Hannifin’s Filtration Group as 80% of CLARCOR’s revenues are generated through aftermarket sales. The company is bullish on the integration of CLARCOR with its filtration business, which will help it double sales in this unit and optimize the after-market mix of Parker-Hannifin.Further, Parker-Hannifin announced the acquisition of Helac Corporation in 2017, which specializes in the design and manufacture of helical rotary actuators.

88,PH,"The first-quarter earnings season is rapidly unwinding with 87 members of the S&P 500 index already having released results. By the end of this week, more than half of the S&P 500 members will have reported financial numbers. The trajectory so far indicates that growth of earnings and revenues are treading materially above historical levels.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies who have reported are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 82.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 67.8% outperforming on the top-line front. In fact, 62.1% of companies have topped both EPS and revenue estimates.Clearly, the first quarter of 2018 is projected to register better earnings growth and revenue momentum than what we have witnessed in the previous quarters. Overall earnings for all the S&P 500 are expected to be up 18.3% on 7.7% growth in revenues. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter and is likely to be driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.In fact, we expect double-digit year-over-year earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. The Industrial Products sector, placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, is one of the sectors expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by the U.S. tax reforms.After struggling with soft commodity prices, reduced investment in the energy sector and dismal economic conditions in some developed and developing nations in the last few years, the sector seems to have regained its momentum in 2017. The turnaround was primarily driven by higher infrastructure spending and other growth-friendly policies of the new administration. Rise in manufacturing and mining activity also played a crucial role.Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks. For first-quarter 2018, industrial production — a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities — rose at an annual rate of 4.5%. Also, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) tally was 59.3% in March. This indicates strong growth in manufacturing, led by continued expansion in new orders, production activity, employment and inventories.According to our latest projections, the sector is projected to log an earnings growth of 25.8% in first-quarter 2018 on the back of 12.8% rise in revenues.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. A company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans. Notably, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Let’s take a sneak peek at some companies from the sector scheduled to report quarterly figures tomorrow and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.Illinois Tool Works Inc.

The company recorded its 10th consecutive earnings beat in the last reported quarter, surpassing estimates by 4.4%. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is expected to deliver strong numbers in the Diversified Industrial segment business, which constitutes a significant portion of total revenues.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Parker-Hannifin has the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat estimates. A stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Parker-Hannifin has an Earnings ESP of +0.68%, as the Most Accurate estimate of $2.64 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62.

Further, its diligent global restructuring initiatives are proving conducive to profits. These initiatives enabled the company offset weakness in some vital regions, which strengthened its position in the end markets.The CLARCOR buyout has reinforced the company’s filtration product suite, consequently driving recurring revenue growth. Further, other bolt-on acquisitions including Arnold Jäger Holding GmbH‘s operating units, President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation are expected to prove conductive to its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters as well.The company has benefited tremendously from the global restructuring initiatives undertaken over the past few quarters. The initiatives helped combat weakness in some key regions and also served to strengthen its position in end markets.Recently, the company’s orders have been accelerating as well. Orders improved 13% in aggregate in second-quarter fiscal 2018. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of order growth for the company, which indicates improving demand in the key end markets and regions. Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation Quote Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Diversified Industrial — North America segment — in the to-be-reported quarter remains high at $1,727 million, reflecting an expected growth of 22.2% year over year. Revenues from Industrial International segment are also projected to be strong, with the estimate pegged at $1,347 million, up 19.3% compared with reported revenues of $1,129 million in the year-ago quarter. Further, the Aerospace segment is expected to rise 2.8% year over year to $593 million.This apart, the company’s revamped Win Strategy along with a host of simplification initiatives has helped it attain significant cost savings and expand margins. For instance, the company achieved strong adjusted segment operating margins of 14.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, expanding 20 basis points year over year. This trend is likely to continue, which will be reflected in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.36% and a Zacks Rank of 1.

91,PH,"Roper Technologies (ROP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 3.1% in the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $2.70, delivering a beat of 3.5%. In the to-be-reported quarter, the company is anticipates strong revenues from its Industrial Technology segment, which constitutes a significant portion of total revenues.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderRoper has successfully maintained a dominant position in most of the markets where it operates. In addition, the company’s optimum mix of highly engineered, niche-oriented products has enabled it to gain market share. Roper’s diversified revenue stream also allows it to counter headwinds, stemming from a cyclical business environment. We believe that the company’s innovative product pipeline is likely to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, the company’s unique asset-light business model helps it to remain less dependent on large-scale production equipment. Also, it aids Roper to generate strong cash flow that is likely to boost forthcoming financial results. In addition, the company’s large project wins as well as strong order trends are expected to drive the top line in the upcoming quarters.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the Industrial Technology segment currently remains high at $206 million compared with $183 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from Energy Systems & Controls segment are also anticipated to be strong, with the consensus mark projected at $136 million, reflecting growth of 8.8% year over year.Furthermore, the company’s accretive acquisitions enable it to strengthen its business and expand its market share. Meanwhile, Roper’s major investments, including ConstructConnect and Deltek buyout, have reinforced its software and network businesses, thus driving the top line as well as margins. We believe that the successful integration of the acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix should prove conductive to its top-line growth in the upcoming quarters as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Roper in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

92,PH,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.19 cents per share, delivering a positive surprise of 2.6%.We expect Danaher to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Danaher has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Danaher has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% as the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Behind Better-Than-Expected ResultsDanaher has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company by expanding its footprint in the healthcare and dental markets. These markets are expected to benefit from rise in the aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness. Also, prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company. Per Danaher, it is well-positioned in the biopharma business, which in turn is expected to prove conductive to its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the first quarter.Additionally, within the Danaher Business System (‘DBS’) framework, the company’s number of strategic initiatives with respect to idea generation, product development and others have been significantly boosting its key financials over the past few quarters. For instance, in fourth-quarter 2017, DBS contributed appreciably to the company’s impressive run in delivering year-over-year core revenue growth, earnings improvement and margin expansion.Meanwhile, the company’s recent acquisitions are acting as major profit churners. The buyouts  are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review. This apart, Danaher expects core growth rate to accelerate moving ahead, in the light of improving order trends and recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex. Notably, Phenomenex has meaningfully enhanced Danaher’s Life Sciences portfolio and is expected to help the company achieve a double-digit return on investment in less than five years.Further, the company’s continuous focus on introduction of products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and gain competitive edge over its peers. Of late, Danaher has also witnessed compelling secular market drivers across each of its platforms and believes that rapid market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Crane Company (CR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank #2.

93,PH,"Accelerating growth of the global economy, from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017, had been a propeller for many countries, both advanced and emerging, including the United States. Over the two years (2016-2017), the country’s major stock indexes – S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq – have surged 30.8%, 41.9% and 37.9%, respectively. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded roughly 1.5% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2017.The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) growth projections are also encouraging. In its January 2018 report, the IMF predicted that the global output will expand 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019. The U.S. economy is projected to grow 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. These estimates reflect an improvement of 0.4% for 2018 and 0.6% for 2019 from its earlier growth forecasts.Our in-house projections indicate roughly 18% growth in earnings and a 5.6% increase in revenues for the S&P 500 companies in 2018. The earnings projection compares favorably with a growth rate of 9.7% recorded in 2017.We believe that advancement in the global economy and a strengthening domestic market will prove beneficial for demand of industrial machinery. Technological advancement in agriculture and mining industries will require upgraded farming and mining machineries, while growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations will raise need for highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, the need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces will raise the demand for heavy construction machinery.Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.Industrial Machinery by NationThe United States: Many factors are currently working in favor of industrial machinery companies here. Encouraging job data, with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in February versus 4.7% in the year-ago month, infrastructural improvement plans of the government and strengthening housing markets are some tailwinds.Some other key economic indicators are pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. The country’s industrial production grew 4.4% year over year in February. This marked the highest increase on a year-over-year basis since March 2011. Mining sector expanded 9.7%, utilities 10.5% and manufacturing 2.5%.Also, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery in January 2018 grew 11.4% year over year while the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index for February expanded 1.7 percentage points from the previous month. The improvement in the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index suggests expanding economic activities in the manufacturing sector — the key highlights being healthier business conditions, favorable export orders and production, solid backlog and employment growth.Also, the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 lowered taxes for many corporations, enabling them to invest the free resources in growth projects. However, the government’s tariff imposition on import of steel and aluminum jolted the market somewhat, with fears of possible increase in competitive threats from international players, hike in production costs and retaliatory measures by affected nations.Japan: The country’s economy is still struggling with internal issues, including an aging population and a huge public debt.However, strengthening exports driven by a rise in automobile shipments, improvements in domestic demand induced by healthy growth in private investments and improving employment and wage rates will be beneficial. The country’s GDP grew 1.5% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while registering a 0.5% rise over the previous quarter.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 8.2% in January 2018. However, this is predicted to decline 1.5% in the first quarter of 2018 while total machinery orders are predicted to fall 6.9%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 50 basis points (bps) to 1.2% for 2018 and by 10 bps to 0.9% for 2019.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while it expanded 6.9% in 2017, higher than the government’s target of 6.5%. Healthy export demand, flexible property market and rising manufacturing activities were the prime growth drivers.The country’s industrial production improved 7.2% year over year in both January and February 2018. Electricity, gas and water production as well as manufacturing sectors flourished while the mining recovered during the period.For 2018, the government of China anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that robust investment for the development of infrastructure and transportation will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery. Also, the country’s efforts to lower its debt burden will be advantageous. However, the possibilities of a trade war with the United States, triggered by its imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium, might be a concerning factor for the both the countries’ trade relations.The IMF projects economy of China to grow 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country’s major economic decisions — including demonetization and goods and services tax — along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth. Also, favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production grew 7.5% year over year in January 2018 versus a 7.1% gain recorded in December. Manufacturing output expanded 8.7%, electricity production jumped 7.6% while mere 0.1% growth was registered in mining.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 7.4% in 2018 and 7.8% in 2019.Brazil: The country is grappling with uncertainties on the political front that has over time adversely affected the country’s growth opportunities. General elections are due this October with high probability of abandoned initiatives to reform the country’s pension system becoming a major topic of discussion. Moreover, inadequate infrastructure and a still high unemployment rate of 12.6% (in three months ended February 2018) are other major hurdles.Partially negating these, growth in export demand, strengthening spending in the housing markets and rise in consumer confidence are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation has prompted the country’s Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered 25 bps in March 2018, this being its 10th consecutive rate cut since 2017. The country’s GDP in 2017 grew 1% after 3.5% decline in both 2015 and 2016 and is predicted to grow 3% in 2018.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging, with year-over-year growth of 5.7% recorded for January 2018. This compares favorably with 4.5% growth in December 2017 and 4.7% in November 2017.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 1.9% in 2018, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projections for 2019 have been increased 10 bps to 2.1%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing improvements in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP improved 2.7% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 while advanced 2.3% in 2017. Industrial production improved 2.7% year over year in January 2018.The unemployment rate was 8.6% in January 2018, down from 9.6% in the year-ago month but stable compared with December.The IMF raised output growth estimates by 30 bps both for 2018 and 2019 to 2.2% and 2%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingIndustrial machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. It currently occupies the second position in the Zacks sectors list.Of the 265 industries comprising the Zacks sectors, those in the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) have higher chances of beating the bottom half (i.e., the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)We believe that investors keen on exposure to industrial machinery companies have reasons to rejoice. Machinery industries with their positions are as follows: electrical products is in the top 2% of the 265 industries while construction and mining equipment is in the top 6%, farm equipment in the top 36% and thermal products in the top 49%.Also, companies dealing in electronics are in the top 15%, material handling products in the top 5%, industrial tools and providing related services is in the top 29% and companies serving general industrial purposes are in the 42%. However, companies dealing in printing equipment for industrial use are in the bottom half at 95%.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorIn the past five years, the Industrial Products sector has yielded a solid 35.4% return.In the fourth quarter of 2017, earnings of Industrial Products grew 34.8% year over year, while revenues improved 14.5%. The earnings and sales growth was above 19.6% growth in earnings and 4.8% rise in revenues in the third quarter.Our in-house projections, published in the Earnings Trends report dated Mar 23, indicate roughly 19.6% growth in earnings and 8.2% increase in revenues of Industrial Products sector in 2018. Margins are likely to expand roughly 1%. Growth for earnings and margins is higher than 18.7% and 0.46%, respectively, recorded in 2017, while that for revenues is below 2017-figure of 12.9%.In the next three to five years, earnings of the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 10.7%.Our TakeInternal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in further accelerating growth.It will be interesting to watch the activities of industrial machinery companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar Inc.

94,PH,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) posted impressive results in the first half of fiscal 2018, after charting robust earnings beats and strong top-line growth in 2017. Recently, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company reported its 10th consecutive earnings beat in second-quarter fiscal 2018 results.The company’s top line has been gaining momentum on the back of contribution from the CLARCOR acquisition and continued outstanding performance in the company’s Diversified Industrial segment, particularly in North America.Further, its diligent global restructuring initiatives are proving conducive to profits. These initiatives helped Parker-Hannifin offset weakness in some vital regions, which strengthened its position in the end markets.Buoyed by the competency of the revamped Win Strategy and its strategic acquisitions, Parker-Hannifin is bullish about delivering fundamental financial goals for fiscal 2018. Concurrent with second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, Parker-Hannifin raised its fiscal 2018 guidance once again.Adjusted earnings from continuing operations are projected in the range of $9.65-$10.05 per share (up from the previous band of $9.10-$9.70). The guidance is adjusted for expected business realignment expenses of approximately $58 million, a net one-time adjustment in income tax expense of $224.5 million and CLARCOR acquisition-related expenses of $52 million. Parker-Hannifin expects to generate synergy savings of about $58 million from CLARCOR integration in fiscal 2018.The company expects sales to grow in the range of 15.3-18.9% from the previous fiscal, with organic growth projected at around 6.5% and acquisitions to contribute roughly 8.1%. Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation Quote Further, analysts too seem to be optimistic on the stock over the last two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings has inched up from $9.57 to $9.93, supported by 11 upward estimate revisions versus none downward.In spite of so many growth drivers and positive developments, the company’s shares have declined 6.6% year to date, underperforming the industry’s upside of 0.1%.  The reason for the disappointing performance could be investors’ concern over the company’s margin trends. It is true that Parker-Hannifin is suffering from near-term margin issues. The reason for the same is that the company is in the middle of integrating CLARCOR and targeted plant closures (23 in fiscal 2017, 39 in fiscal 2018) are also disturbing margins as well as operational efficiency. However, these factors are expected to smoothen in the near term.The fact that the company’s orders are accelerating should pacify investors. Orders increased 13% in aggregate in fiscal second quarter. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of order growth for the company, which indicates improving demand in the key end markets and regions.Also, the company is well placed when compared with its peers in terms of valuation. Parker-Hannifin’s trailing 12-months PE ratio is pegged at 20.73, which is quite a bit lower than the industry’s PE of 24.75. This indicates that investors who want exposure to industrial recovery should consider the company as an investment right now. Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the same space worth considering now include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

95,PH,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) recently unveiled a Low-Lead Brass body (LLB) series of solenoid valves for the beverage dispensing industry. The latest LLB series of solenoid valves is suitable for various potential uses in dispensing systems like cold, hot and superheated water shut-off, boiler water-loading control, steam control, steam mixing and steam pressure control.Notably, the valves feature stainless steel pilots and are designed to improve valve life, endurance as well as resistance to limescale accumulation. The valve body is composed of CW510L brass (containing less than 0.25% lead) and the design maintains high system reliability that minimizes equipment failure risk apart from avoiding potential downtime. The metal structure also allows high temperature variations, heat transfer and high durability required in beverage dispensing systems.Our TakeParker-Hannifin has benefited tremendously from the global restructuring initiatives undertaken in the past few quarters. Apart from this, the company is streamlining business and corporate functions as well as removing complex bureaucracy from organizational structure to create a leaner frame. Furthermore, it has devised a complimentary business realignment action, which when combined with the simplification initiative is likely to strengthen the manufacturing footprint, going forward.Moreover, the company’s eye on strategic acquisitions and alliances has bolstered its core business. For instance, the CLARCOR buyout has strengthened the company’s filtration product suite consequently driving revenue growth. Also, its other acquisitions including Arnold Jäger Holding GmbH‘s operating units, President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation might prove to be major catalysts for the company’s growth moving ahead.In the past six months, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock yielded a return of 15.8% outperforming the industry’s growth of 12%.This apart, the company recently completed two years of implementation of the Win Strategy and remains bullish about delivering fundamental financial goals. The strategy has started delivering immediate results and unlocking further opportunities to drive ongoing EPS growth for the next several years. We believe that the improvised Win Strategy will aid Parker-Hannifin to stay firmly on the growth track.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the same space include Cimpress N.V (CMPR  -  Free Report), Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) and CIRCOR International, Inc. (CIR  -  Free Report). While Cimpress and Dover sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), CIRCOR International carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

CLARCOR will unlock fresh recurring revenue streams for Parker-Hannifin’s Filtration Group as 80% of CLARCOR’s revenues are generated through aftermarket sales. The company is bullish on the integration of CLARCOR with its filtration business, which will help it double sales at this unit, and optimize the after-market mix of Parker-Hannifin.Further, on Feb 1, 2017, Parker-Hannifin announced the acquisition of Helac Corporation, which specializes in the design and manufacture of helical rotary actuators. Helac will aid Parker-Hannifin in expanding its hydraulics product portfolio and cater to customers in a wide variety of markets.The company is currently integrating these two filtration units into its businesses.

97,PH,"Cleveland, Ohio-based Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) is a prominent built-up components & equipment company, conducting trade in the global industrial goods sector. The company produces control and motion technologies as well as systems that are traded across different aerospace, industrial and mobile marketplaces located around the world.Parker-Hannifin’s “Win Strategy”, its core business system focusing on key areas, including customer engagement, customer experience, profitable growth and financial performance, has acted as a staple growth driver for the past few quarters. Also, the company’s initial savings from division consolidation and simplification initiatives continue to manifest themselves in the strong margin performance.However, prolonged sluggishness in natural resources market that includes oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment are proving to be a major concern for the company.

98,PH,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 60 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents, thereby continuing its earnings beat streak of 24 straight quarters, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings last quarter.The earnings figure improved 27.7% from the year-ago tally of 47 cents. The bottom-line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth.For 2017, the company generated adjusted net earnings of $378.3 million or $2.17 per share, up 16% from the prior-year figure.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 10.1% year over year to $768.6 million. The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $767.1 million by a whisker. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers, and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.For the full year, the company posted record sales of $3 billion, up almost 12% from the 2016 tally.Coming back to the fourth quarter, A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 6% year over year to $460.8 million. Higher volumes of commercial water heaters, strong sales of boilers, and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. Water treatment products contributed about $9 million to revenues, thus supplementing the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings rose an impressive 17% year over year to $104.9 million. The segment’s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel costs. Consequently, operating margin expanded 230 basis points (bps) to 22.8% on a year-over-year basis.Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Smith (A.O.) Corporation QuoteQuarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (including China, India and Europe) were up 17% year over year to $313.8 million. The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s premium water-heating and water-treatment products, particularly in India (up 40%). Also, favorable pricing actions added to the top line.Operating earnings at the segment climbed a whopping 33% year over year to $50.8 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in India and China, along with favorable pricing actions, was partially offset by escalating steel and installation cost. Operating margin advanced 200 bps to 16.2% year over year.Share RepurchasesDuring 2017, A.O. Smith repurchased around 2.5 million common shares for $139.1 million. At the end of the year, the company has approximately 2.4 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the year on Dec 31, 2017, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $346.6 million compared with $330.4 million a year back. Cash generated from operations during the year came in at $326.4 million, lower than $446.6 million recorded last year, as higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital.At the end of the reported quarter, long-term debt was $402.9 million compared with $316.4 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31, 2016.Also, earlier this month, A.O. Smith announced a 29% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The new dividend of 18 cents per share will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Jan 31.This translates to a dividend of 72 cents per share on an annualized basis, and marks the 13th consecutive year in which the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend.GuidanceConcurrent with the fourth-quarter results, the company released optimistic guidance for 2018, and expects adjusted earnings to lie in the range of $2.50-2.58 per share. The mid-point of the range reflects impressive year-over-year growth of 17%. The buoyant guidance reflects the company’s robust growth momentum, backed by solid demand.Our TakeA.O. Smith wrapped up 2017 with solid momentum, with double-digit sales growth driven by continued strong demand for its consumer products in China, and positive end markets for the company’s water heaters and boilers in North America. A.O. Smith’s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company’s underlying strength.We believe stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth in the near future. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water-heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets, is likely to stoke growth.However, over the past few quarters, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s SG&A expenses in China (including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers) have been quite high, which is creating pressure on the company’s operating margins. Furthermore, transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer-driven one might impact A.O. Smith’s sales in the region.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Illinois Tool Works Inc.

Revenues from Industrial International segment are also anticipated to be strong, with the estimate standing at $1,245 million, compared with reported revenues of $1,006 million in the year ago quarter. Further, the Aerospace segment is anticipated to rise 2.8% year over year to $559 million.Separately, the company’s ardent lookout for strategic acquisitions has enabled it to strengthen core business. The company’s recent major investments including the CLARCOR buyout has reinforced the company’s filtration product suite, consequently driving recurring revenue growth. Further, other bolt-on acquisitions including Arnold Jäger Holding GmbH‘s operating units, President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation are anticipated to prove conductive to its top-line growth, in the upcoming quarters as well.This apart, the company’s revamped Win Strategy along with a host of simplification initiatives has helped it attain significant cost savings and expand margins. For instance, the company achieved strong adjusted segment operating margins of 16% in the fiscal first quarter, expanding 60 basis points year over year. This trend is likely to continue for the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Parker-Hannifin in the to-be-reported quarter.

100,PH,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 3.Last quarter, the company posted its seventh consecutive earnings beat, recording a positive surprise of 13.4%. Parker-Hannifin boasts an average positive surprise of approximately 14.9% over the trailing four quarters.We expect the company to beat earnings in the about-to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows an earnings beat for Parker-Hannifin as it possesses the key components.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Parker-Hannifin is +0.87% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.33 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $2.31. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter..Zacks Rank: Parker-Hannifin has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The favorable combination of Parker-Hannifin’s Zacks Rank #2 and +0.87% ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Parker-Hannifin continues to benefit from its extensive distribution network, which sells to the more lucrative MRO markets. Robust distribution sales have helped it in reaching out to smaller OEMs. We believe that the company’s strong aftermarket sales are likely to raise its bottom line and margins for the fiscal fourth quarter. This apart, Parker-Hannifin’s revamped “WIN Strategy”, which cushions against global macroeconomic uncertainties, has acted as a staple growth driver.The WIN Strategy, coupled with a host of other consolidation and simplification initiatives, helped Parker-Hannifin garner significant cost savings and witness margin expansion. During the reported fiscal fourth quarter, the company’s adjusted segment operating margins expanded 140 basis points (bps) year over year thanks to its concerted restructuring activities, undertaken over the last few years. This trend is likely to continue for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.In addition, the recent CLARCOR buyout, which has strengthened Parker-Hannifin’s filtration product suite, will supplement the company’s recurring revenue growth. Also, other bolt-on acquisitions completed over the past two years, namely, Jäger Automobil-Technik GmbH, Jäger Automotive Polska President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation, are also expected to stoke its inorganic growth for the fiscal fourth quarter.Despite these positives, Parker-Hannifin’s diverse geographic presence is exposed to currency headwinds. The company’s sales shrunk 3.2% for fiscal 2016 due to the same. We believe foreign currency translation risks will play a major spoilsport for fiscal 2017. This apart, sluggishness in its key natural resources market that includes oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, are likely to hamper the company’s growth.In addition, rising prices of core materials like steel and aluminium are expected to erode the company’s financials for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, Parker-Hannifin’s high restructuring charges might pose as headwind for the upcoming results. Earlier, the company declared incurring business realignment expenses of about $48 million in fiscal 2017, which is projected to impact earnings per share to the tune of $0.25.Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and a Zacks Rank #1.

106,PH,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the opening bell on Nov 2.Last quarter, the company posted its eighth consecutive earnings beat, recording a positive surprise of 6.1%. Parker-Hannifin boasts an average positive surprise of 14.5% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderParker-Hannifin continues to benefit from its extensive distribution network, which sells to the more lucrative MRO markets. Robust distribution sales help it reach out to smaller OEMs. We believe the company’s strong aftermarket sales are likely to raise its bottom line and margins for the fiscal first quarter. This apart, Parker-Hannifin’s revamped “WIN Strategy”, which cushions against global macroeconomic uncertainties, has acted as a staple growth driver.We expect the company’s Diversified Industrial -- North America segment to continue its solid growth trajectory in the coming quarterly results as well. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s sales currently is pegged at $1,504 million, which reflects growth of 28.9% year over year. The Industrial International segment is also projected to grow 16.7% year over year to $1,185 million.The Aerospace segment of the company has been tepid in recent times. In the coming results, we estimate its revenues to inch up 2% year over year to $572 million.Separately, the WIN Strategy, along with a host of other consolidation and simplification initiatives, has helped Parker-Hannifin garner significant cost savings and witness margin expansion. During the reported fiscal fourth quarter, the company’s adjusted segment operating margins expanded 120 basis points year over year, thanks to its concerted restructuring activities, undertaken over the last few years. This trend is likely to continue for the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Parker-Hannifin Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Parker-Hannifin Corporation QuoteIn addition, the recent CLARCOR buyout, which strengthened Parker-Hannifin’s filtration product suite, will supplement the company’s recurring revenue growth. Also, other bolt-on acquisitions completed over the past two years, namely Jäger Automobil-Technik GmbH, Jäger Automotive Polska President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation, are also likely to stoke its inorganic growth for the fiscal first quarter.Despite these positives, Parker-Hannifin’s diverse geographic presence is exposed to currency headwinds. This apart, sluggishness in its key natural resources market that includes oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, might hamper the company’s growth.In addition to this, escalating prices of core materials like steel and aluminium are expected to erode the company’s financials for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, Parker-Hannifin’s high restructuring charges might pose as headwind for the upcoming results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Parker-Hannifin will likely beat earnings estimates in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0.00%.

While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +3.17% and a Zacks Rank of 2, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Nov 1.

107,PH,"The Q3 earnings season is underway with major banks set to report this week. Earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to grow 2.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues, as per the latest Earnings Trends.However, earnings growth is on track to be the lowest this year after double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters and with high single-digit expected earnings growth in the last quarter. This is especially true as twin attacks by hurricanes Harvey and Irma have taken toll on many industries such as insurance, energy, airlines and autos. Per Moody's Analytics, the two storms may lead to $150-$200 billion in damages (read: Hurricanes Impact on Earnings ETFs?).While earnings estimates for Q3 have declined from 6.3% at the start of the period, the magnitude of negative revision is lower than the recent quarters. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, seven are likely to be contributors to earnings growth, with energy leading the way. Like the last reporting cycle, the energy sector has the strongest growth projection of 122.3% for Q3, primarily reflecting easier comparisons. This is followed by earnings growth of 16.1% for conglomerates, 9.7% for technology, 8.7% for industrial products, and 8.3% for construction.Given this, we have highlighted one ETF and one stock from some of these sectors that could make great plays as the Q3 earnings season unfolds. Each of these ETFs and stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). For stocks, we have added the extra flavor of a positive Earnings ESP. This is because stocks with this combination have a 70% chance of beating estimates when their earnings are released, and a VGM Style Score of B or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.EnergyVanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH  -  Free Report): This fund tracks the MVIS U.S. Listed Oil Services 25 Index, which offers exposure to companies involved in oil services to the upstream oil sector, which include oil equipment, oil services or oil drilling.

108,PH,"(0:30) - Berkshire Hathaway Buys Pilot Flying J(2:40) - 3 Lessons To Learn From Warren Buffett's Recent Interview(8:00) - Tracey's Top Stock Picks(15:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome to Episode #62 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio service, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.Warren Buffett was recently giving television interviews because Berkshire Hathaway bought a 38.6% stake in Pilot Flying J travel centers, which is the largest travel center company in North America, with 750 locations and 27,000 employees.When you heard the news, you might have been thinking, “travel centers? That’s so boring.”After all, this is a world filled with electric cars, 1-hour home delivery, ride-sharing, Airbnb, AI and social media.What are the lessons value investors can learn from what Warren Buffett is buying?3 Investing Lessons Learned from Warren Buffett1.     Boring is beautiful. Sometimes the “ho-hum” companies are what turn out to be the cash-generating superstars. Take Pilot Flying J, for instance. It’s not just a travel center, but it also operates 279 restaurants making it the 10th largest restaurant franchise in America.2.    Buy companies that are profitable. Sounds simple, right? But many don’t do it.3.    Buy building block companies. Buffett likes to buy companies that operate in the shadows that few people give a second thought to. Travel centers is one of those. A railroad is another.Tracey thought about these lessons and then wondered, what stocks fit into these parameters right now?There’s not really a screen for stocks Warren Buffett would like that are building block companies, profitable and boring.But she did find 5 stocks that have Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong  Buy), #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold) that fit into the parameters. Not all are classic value stocks, however, but they each fit into Buffett’s lessons.5 Stocks That Are Buffett-Like1.     Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) has been in business 100 years. It makes motion, control and filtration systems. It’s forward P/E is 19.5 but it’s expected to see double digit earnings growth this fiscal year and next.2.    Air Products & Chemical (APD  -  Free Report) was founded in 1940. It provides atmospheric and process gases to customers in 50 countries. It has a 30 billion market cap and pays a dividend yielding 2.5%.3.    Casey’s General Stores (CASY  -  Free Report) operates small town convenience stores that sell gas and food in the Midwest. Because it operates in towns under 5,000, it often is the only pizza provider in town. As a result, it’s now the 5th largest pizza chain in the country.4.    Hanesbrands, Inc. (HBI  -  Free Report) has been in business 116 years. It makes basic apparel such as bras, socks and underwear. It has a forward P/E of just 12.5.    Ryder System (R  -  Free Report) operates one of North America’s largest truck fleets. Founded in 1933, it has a market cap of $4.5 billion. It has a price-to-book ratio of just 2.1 and a price-to-sales ratio of 0.6.What else should you know about Buffett’s investing lessons?Tune into this week’s podcast to find out.Want more value investing insights from Tracey?

109,PH,"The market's recent positive momentum reflects the solid second-quarter earnings season and the relatively reassuring guidance from management teams about the coming quarters. There is ample evidence that the economy appears to be moving into a moderate patch of economic growth in the next few quarters, but will most likely avoid some of the more dire outcomes.  
"
110,PH,"The emerging narrative of moderate but sustainable domestic economic growth, solid corporate profitability, low interest rates and a robust emerging-market growth outlook should help the equity markets drift upwards in the coming months. While I am not necessarily looking for straight upward moves in the benchmark indices going forward, I do envision the overall trend to be positive.   
"
111,PH,"But risks remain to this favorable view; the biggest being reversal in the recent positive, albeit very slow, improvement in private-sector hiring, as well as fears of deflation. Moderate Economic Growth 
"
112,PH,"In-line with recent soft economic reports, estimates for second-half economic growth have been steadily coming down in recent days. These lowered market expectations put third- and fourth-quarter GDP growth rates at 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively. In the first and second quarters of this year, the economy generated growth rates of 3.7% and 2.4%.  
"
113,PH,"An unbiased reading of the economic reports point to a temporary growth moderation in the next couple of quarters with enough fundamental support to resume normal growth next year and beyond. The corporate sector remains in excellent financial health, with growing evidence that firms have started using their record cash hoard towards capital investments. Corporate outlays for equipment and software continue to expand  with a gain of 17% in the second quarter after a 7.8% increase in the first quarter. As such, even though manufacturing activity levels appear to have softened lately, investment spending should remain supportive to growth in the coming quarters.  Slow-Healing Labor Market 
"
114,PH,"While the corporate balance sheets remain in excellent shape, the same can't be said of the household sector. It is this lack of a clear handoff of the recovery from the corporate side to the household side that has been the source of uncertainty for the economic outlook. Deleveraging households in a backdrop of long-lasting labor market weakness remains the weakest part of this economic recovery.  
"
115,PH,"In the absence of a solid turnaround in the labor market, we need the trend of positive private sector job creations in the last seven months to remain in place. Gains in temporary hirings, hourly earnings and the workweek all point to a slow-healing labor market. Reversal of these trends remains a major risk factor to our market outlook.  Supportive Fed 
"
116,PH,"With benchmark short-term interest rates at historically low levels, many pundits are bemoaning the lack of arrows in the Fed's quiver. But counting the Fed out may be premature.   
"
117,PH,"They can engineer quantitative easing through a number of ways in response to the moderating growth outlook and continued labor market issues. The most readily available tool being a resumption of the treasury-bond purchases that they discontinued in the spring. At a minimum, the markets can remain assured that the Fed's continued usage of the extended period reference means that interest rates will remain low for quite a long period.  
"
118,PH,"I was initially looking for an early-2011 timeframe for the onset of the Fed's tightening phase. But now, I don't think the Fed will start removing the monetary stimulus before late 2011. An environment of low interest rates and a supportive Fed are key positives for stocks. Solid Corporate Profitability
"
119,PH,"As referred to earlier, the turnaround in corporate profitability remains firmly in place. We had solid earnings reports in the second quarter, with year-over-year gains in excess of 40% and more than 75% of companies beating expectations. And not all of the gains have come from cost cutting alone. More than 59% of the firms have beat revenue expectations, with overall top-line gains in excess of 10%.   
"
120,PH,"Not only have second-quarter earnings been solid, but management teams have been coming out with reassuring guidance for the coming quarters. Given the tendency for management teams to be inherently conservative with respect to guidance  often under-promising and over-delivering  the odds are looking good that current earnings expectations will be met, if not surpassed. Current expectations for full-year 2010 and 2011 earnings gains are approximately 34% and 19%, respectively.Portfolio Update 
"
121,PH,"We made four changes to the Focus List portfolio last week; adding and deleting two each. We didn't make any changes to the Growth & Income portfolio. There were changes to the Timely Buys list as well.   
"
122,PH,"A quick comment on the year-to-date performance of the Focus List and G&I portfolios is in order here. Returns on both the portfolios handily beat the S&P 500.  
"
123,PH,"We added Carbo Ceramics (CRR  -  Free Report) to gain exposure to the fast-growing shale natural gas development scene. This $1.8 billion oilfield service player is a major supplier of a key chemical that is used in the development of shale natural gas fields, in addition to other services. A favorable outlook for shale natural gas development underpins the company's solid earnings prospects.   
"
124,PH,"We added Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO  -  Free Report) to gain exposure to a favorable outlook for the rural economy given positive prospects for agricultural commodities. This $2.8 billion market operator of 930 retail farm and ranch stores in 44 states has a solid earnings track record, with beats in the last 9 consecutive quarters and estimates on the rise.   
"
125,PH,"We dropped Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL  -  Free Report) after the stock fell to a Zacks # 4 Rank ('Sell'). While estimates have held up and the investment story remains intact, we don't see any near-term catalysts that can aid the stock price over the coming days. We had added the stock in June and took a roughly 2% loss on this one.  
"
126,PH,"We exited our Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) position to get ahead of negative estimate revisions in the coming days, in our view. We had a 2.5% gain in the stock. The company reported solid results, but provided an under-whelming guidance for next year. We think that estimates would be coming down in the coming days to reflect the weak guidance. 
"
127,PH,"On Dec 29, Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $102.06 during intraday trading, finally closing lower at $100.99.The stock has a market capitalization of $14.92 billion. Average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 1.02 million. Investors are optimistic on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's efforts to simplify portfolio and invest in market-leading platforms with strong margin profiles. Also, solid booking trends and backlog growth bodes well.The stock has surged 32.2% in a year, higher than the S&P 500's growth of 20.0%. Dover has also outperformed the industry's 29.9% gain.Growth DriversDover has decided to spin-off its Wellsite business into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company, in order to separate the company’s upstream energy businesses in the Energy segment. The company's Wellsite business, which includes Dover Artificial Lift, Dover Energy Automation, and US Synthetic, operates in the oil & gas drilling as well as production industry.Dover estimates that the spin-off will be in the form of a distribution of 100% of the stock of Wellsite, which will be tax-free for the company and U.S. shareholders, for income tax purposes.  As part of the transaction, Wellsite is projected to raise new debt in the range of $700-$800 million — the proceeds of which will be paid to Dover in the form of a dividend. The company expects to return the proceeds to shareholders as the primary source of funding for its $1 billion of share repurchases. The share buyback is expected to be completed in 2018.It has also recently signed an agreement to sell the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn for $250 million. The divestment is anticipated to close in the fourth quarter. These steps will aid the company in streamlining business along with investing in market-leading platforms that have strong market positions, margin profiles and are less volatile with bright prospects.The company has also announced to expand the scope of its previously-announced rightsizing initiatives. These include headcount reductions and facility closures, as well as consolidations due to the company’s focus on reducing cost structure to prepare for Wellsite’s spin-off. The anticipated 2018 benefits, before associated costs, of these actions are now estimated to be $50 million.The company’s bookings at the end of the last reported quarter were worth $1.94 billion, up from $1.69 billion. Backlog increased 18% to $1.27 billion at the end of the reported quarter. Consequently, the company is poised for a solid fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results. For 2017, it projects earnings per share to in the range of $4.23-$4.33. The mid-point of the guidance reflects an increase of 38% over 2016 on an adjusted basis. The company estimates revenues to grow in the range of 14-15%, comprising organic growth of 6-7% and acquisition growth of approximately 10%. This will be partially offset by a 2% impact from the dispositions.Dover anticipates Printing & Identification platform to deliver consistently solid performance, backed by unique position in the digital textile market along with focus on consumables in marking and coding. From the current 3-4% rate, Dover projects the penetration rate of digital technology to surge 30% over the next decade. The company’s comprehensive solutions, including equipment, ink and software, poises it well to fully capitalize on this technology shift. In refrigeration, food retailers in an effort to manage operating cost and differentiate themselves in the market are now investing in closed-door refrigeration cases, energy-efficient systems and in specialized display cases. The company is anticipated to benefit from this demand as it has a leading position in these categories.Further, its Energy segment has a large backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells in the last few quarters due to significant drilling activity. It expects most of these wells to be completed over the coming quarters.All these factors are anticipated to boost the company's share price in the days ahead. Its positive long-term growth rate of 13% holds promise.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same sector are Kadant Inc. (KAI  -  Free Report), Sun Hydraulics Corporation (SNHY  -  Free Report) and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report).Kadant sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

128,PH,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation’s (PH  -  Free Report) Electronic Controls Business Unit recently unveiled new functional safety controllers for mobile machinery applications. The latest RISE (“SP”) certified IQAN-MC4xFS controllers offer cost-efficient means of meeting the safety standards needed for heavy mobile machinery, along with providing robustness and straightforward system integration.Certified to IEC 61508 SIL2, the IQAN-MC4xFS is designed to control hydraulic valves, making it a best choice for mobile machinery applications. Having being built on Parker’s earlier MC4x versions, the latest IQAN-MC4xFS is suitable for use in applications with full pin compatibility, which incorporates a considerable amount of monitoring functionality to address application needs. Apart from extensive start-up tests, extended diagnostics measures were also introduced, like run-time diagnostics of dangerous faults. Other features like implementation of safety-related applications in the lockstep core, ECC-protected Flash and RAM, as well as the execution of a safety-certified Real-Time Operating System were also included.Based on similar hardware as IQAN-MC4x performance-optimized standard versions, the latest controllers offer accurate and real-time control of hydraulic systems. The IQAN-MC4xFS controllers enable faster development of new machine functionality, aided by full compatibility powered by the established IQANdesign platform. The IQANdesign platform offers an inbuilt tool for programming, testing, production, simulation as well as service and maintenance.Our Take Parker-Hannifin has benefited tremendously from the global restructuring initiatives undertaken in the past few quarters. Apart from this, the company is streamlining business and corporate functions as well as removing complex bureaucracy from organizational structure to create a “leaner” frame. The company has also devised a complimentary business realignment action, which when combined with the simplification initiative, is likely to strengthen the manufacturing footprint, going forward.Buoyed by the competency of the revamped Win Strategy and strategic acquisitions, the company is bullish about delivering fundamental financial goals. Investors also seem to be optimistic on the company’s future prospects, as the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock yielded a return of 36% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s average growth of 25.5%.Moreover, the company has been proactive in making acquisitions from time to time to strengthen its core business. The company has concluded major investments recently. For instance, the CLARCOR buyout has strengthened the company’s filtration product suite, consequently driving recurring revenue growth. Also, other bolt-on acquisitions including Arnold Jäger Holding GmbH‘s operating units, President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation are anticipated to supplement top-line growth, going forward.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Acco Brands Corporation (ACCO  -  Free Report) and Donaldson Company, Inc.

129,PH,"Headline: Late-Summer Trading
"
130,PH,"Despite all of the news flow, the major indexes aren't moving much. Rather, stocks are stuck in a typical late-summer environment.
"
131,PH,"Volume has been unimpressive at best. I saw some stocks trade at less than half of the average daily volume this week. It's neither good nor bad, but rather just what often happens this time of year.
"
132,PH,"Late-summer vacations and the end of earnings season are both big reasons why many traders are sitting out. The uncertainty about the economic environment is also playing a role. Then there is Russia, which has become more militarily aggressive.
"
133,PH,"In environments like this, I feel sorry for people like Jim Cramer who feel obligated to make something out of nothing. This is a quiet market environment and nothing else. My advice is let events unravel and see what trends develop after Labor Day.
"
134,PH,"The markets will change from day-to-day; your investing strategies shouldn't.
"
135,PH,"And part of your strategy should be to always maintain some exposure to stocks. Those who try to time the markets are often the ones who take large losses and miss out on the big gains. Conversely, the most successful investors never stop researching stocks.
"
136,PH,"Financial Stocks
"
137,PH,"As I have previously stated, we have intentionally kept financial stocks out of the Focus List. Earnings estimates continue to be cut for both 2008 and 2009 as the credit crisis continues. Banks still don't know what is on their balance sheets, making it impossible for brokerage analysts to do little more than guess what future earnings will be.
"
138,PH,"The other big problem, that is not getting as much press, is the damage being done to shareholders. The actions taken by many financial companies to stay afloat are dilutive, at best, to existing shareholders. Unfortunately, many firms have gotten themselves into such a large mess that they don't have much choice.
"
139,PH,"Lehman Brothers (LEH) is talking to Korea Development Bank because it can't find other suitors. Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) are in need of massive taxpayer help because they have been so mismanaged. These are the type of situations that investors should avoid rather than using the latest rumor of salvation to pick up shares at discounted prices.
"
140,PH,"Always remember that just because something is cheap doesn't mean it is a bargain.
"
141,PH,"The Markets
"
142,PH,"The late-summer environment is evident in the charts of the major U.S. indexes, which show trading ranges.
"
143,PH,"Focus List UpdatesParker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) was sold because of a drop in profit projections for fiscal 2009. The company remains fundamentally strong, but we are concerned that there could be additional short-term weakness in the stock.
"
144,PH,"We are watching shares of Central European Distributors (CEDC). Our presumption is that the recent weakness in the stock is being caused by the military situation in Georgia. Earnings estimates are up during the past 30 days and CEDC is a Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock.
"

147,PH,"Parker Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) could be of great benefit to investors looking for both growth and income. In addition to having strong fundamentals that include record quarterly results, the company is growing through acquisitions. Most recently, PH acquired Titan Industries, a manufacturer of industrial rubber hoses. On the income side, Parker Hannifin boasts a solid record of increasing annual dividends for 52 consecutive years. The companys dividend yield stands at 1.2%, well above the industry average as very few of its peers pay a dividend.
"
148,PH,"Company Description
"
149,PH,"Parker Hannifin manufactures motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision-engineered solutions for a wide variety of commercial, mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. The company employs more than 57,000 people in 43 countries around the world. 
"
150,PH,"A Long Record of Raising Dividends
"
151,PH,"Parker is certainly rewarding from an income perspective as it increased its annual dividends for 52 consecutive years, among the top five longest-running dividend-increase records in the S&P 500 index. The companys dividend yield stands at 1.1% right now, well above the industry average as very few of its peers pay a dividend.
"
152,PH,"Strong Growth
"
153,PH,"Growth is also abundant. The company recently announced its acquisition of Titan Industries, which manufactures industrial rubber, custom made and composite hoses for fluid and material transfer as well as related products, services, and accessories. 
"
154,PH,"Parker explained that Titan Industries racked up sales of $28 million last year, adding that this acquisition strengthens Parker's position in the industrial hose market by substantially expanding the product offering and providing entrance into the marine, aircraft, food and dock side refueling markets.
"
155,PH,"In late April, the company announced record results in several areas, which included fiscal third-quarter sales of $3.2 billion, 14.4% higher than the year-prior $2.8 billion. Third-quarter earnings per share of jumped from last years $1.19 per share to $1.49 per share. The earnings result was about 11% above the consensus estimate. 
"
156,PH,"Earnings per share are expected to grow by 16% over the next 3  5 years, compared to the industry average expectation of 15%. Parker Hannifin offers a return on equity (ROE) of 19%, which tops the industry average of 17%.
"
157,PH,"Bullish Forecasts
"
158,PH,"The company hiked its earnings outlook to a range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share. The previous guidance for earnings was $5.15 to $5.40 per share. 
"
159,PH,"""Since fiscal 2008 continues to be strong overall, we have again raised our earnings guidance,"" said Washkewicz. ""Orders are growing in Europe, Asia, Latin America and North America. Many of our key markets, including Aerospace, continue to grow. For other markets, especially those in North America which have been in recession, we are positioned to benefit when they return to more normal growth levels."" 
"
160,PH,"Wall Street forecasts are in line with PHs range. Current earnings estimates for the year ending June 2008 are at $5.51 per share, up from the two months-ago level of $5.47.
"
161,PH,"Parker Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) is the type of company that the market looks toward to see how an economic recovery is going. If PH were the only determining factor in such a judgment, then there would be no question on the strength and sustainability of this turnaround.  
"
162,PH,"When it comes to the important factor of order trends, PH is certainly moving in the right direction and has more favorable market conditions as a backdrop. These factors are some of the main reasons why we have a longer-term ""Outperform"" recommendation on this diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems.  
"
163,PH,"Let's not forget that this company has also put together 4 straight quarters with better-than-expected earnings. In fact, if you average out those quarters, the company has amassed a positive surprise of more than 76% (with a major assist from a triple-digit beat in the fiscal first quarter).  
"
164,PH,"Earnings estimates, though, haven't moved much in the last 30 days. But the company is holding onto some pretty substantial revisions from shortly after its last quarterly announcement, thereby keeping its Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy'). Enhanced Guidance Leads to Higher Estimates 
"
165,PH,"One of the biggest aspects of Parker Hannifin's fiscal third quarter report was its guidance for the full fiscal year. The company expects between $2.95 and $3.15 per share, compared to its earlier outlook of $2.40 to $2.80. The new range was well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate in late April of $2.73 per share. 
"
166,PH,"As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year, ending this month, is now $3.08 per share, marking a nearly 13% improvement from 2 months ago.  
"
167,PH,"Parker Hannifin is also expecting a more stable environment for next fiscal year, and analysts seem to be in agreement. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2011 is $4.28 per share, up 13.5% from 60 days ago. This guidance is also  39% better than this fiscal year. Fiscal Third Quarter 
"
168,PH,"In that fiscal third quarter report, Parker Hannifin announced earnings per share of 94 cents, which was ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a little more than 22%. The result was also almost 200% better than last year's 33 cents.  
"
169,PH,"Sales of $2.6 billion jumped year over year by 11.5% from $2.3 billion. Total orders increased by 23% in the quarter.  
"
170,PH,"""Order levels are improving across most of our markets and regions, which give us confidence that the global economic recovery is sustainable,"" said Chairman, CEO and President Don Washkewicz.

"
172,PH,"Parker Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report) has recently traded lower with the market, but the company still has a strong fundamental profile with positive earnings momentum, growing its earnings and surprising in each of the last four quarters by an average of 77%. We have also seen estimates move higher in the last month, with the current year adding 37 cents to $3.08 and the next year up 52 cents to $4.28, a 39% growth projection.
"
173,PH,"Perrigo Company (PRGO  -  Free Report) has also recently traded lower with the market, but only moderately as the company's strong earnings and revenue growth over the last few years buoys shares. Perrigo's Q3 results from late April easily beat expectations, coming in at 21% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate on 6% revenue growth from last year. The current-year estimate is up 18 cents in the last month to $2.78, while the next year has added 24 cents to $3.25, a 17% growth projection.
"
174,PH,"Parker Aerospace, a business unit of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report), has inked a long-term agreement with Lufthansa Technik for the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (“MRO”) services of Airbus A350 components. The deal includes the majority of repairable components for the A350 fuel, hydraulic and fuel tank inerting systems.The collaboration will help increase component and systems reliability and diminish related maintenance costs for airline customers globally. The partnership will help optimize services by focusing on repair development, instead of replacing components. This will help keep the aircraft in flight longer, in turn, reducing costs.In addition to being an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Parker-Hannifin develops and integrates components across many aerospace technologies, while Lufthansa Technik is a leader in MRO with expansive knowledge of airline operations. The integration of OEM data with powerful MRO insight and repair capabilities will likely help drive efficiency, optimize reliability and reduce costs.Parker-Hannifin has been enjoying remarkable revenue expansion and improved margins on the back of the revamped Win Strategy, in recent times.The company is also seeing improving demand in key end markets and regions, with order growth being positive for four consecutive quarters.In addition, Parker-Hannifin continues to benefit from its extensive distribution network, which sells to the more lucrative MRO markets. Robust distribution sales helped it reach out to smaller OEMs. We believe the company’s strong aftermarket sales are likely to raise its bottom line and margins for fiscal 2018 and beyond.Buoyed by the competency of the revamped Win Strategy and strategic acquisitions, Parker-Hannifin is bullish about delivering its fundamental financial goals. Investors also seem to be optimistic on the company’s future prospects, as its shares have risen 41% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s average return of 28%.Furthermore, Parker-Hannifin’s strategic buyouts have constantly broadened its market presence and boosted its core revenue growth. For instance, the CLARCOR buyout has strengthened the company’s filtration product suite, thus driving recurring revenue growth. Also, other bolt-on acquisitions completed over the past two years, namely Jäger Automobil-Technik GmbH, Jäger Automotive Polska President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation are anticipated to supplement top-line growth, going forward.Also, the company’s diligent global restructuring initiatives are proving conducive to profitability. These initiatives helped Parker-Hannifin offset weakness in some vital regions, thus strengthening its position in the end markets.The company has made impressive progress in key areas, including safety performance, customer experience, and profitable growth, and believes these initiatives will unlock further growth opportunities.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been affected by an escalation in prices for core materials like steel, aluminum, castings and nickel, among others, over the past few quarters. Such price hikes can significantly mar the company’s profits and margins. Also, Parker-Hannifin has been experiencing sluggishness in its key natural resources market, including oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, which can exert a lot of pressure on the company’s distributors engaged in the oil and gas business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), A.O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) and Franklin Electric Co., Inc. (FELE  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Barnes Group has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates each time for an average of 11.6%.A.O. Smith also has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 3.3% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.Franklin Electric generated one beat and two in-line earnings over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 0.4%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

175,PH,"Parker Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report) recently hit a new multi-year high after reporting excellent Q3 results that blew past expectations. The longer-term view looks solid too, with the next-year estimate projecting 38% earnings growth. 
"
176,PH,"Company Description
"
177,PH,"Parker-Hannifin Corp. manufactures parts and systems like valves, fittings, filters, cylinders and pumps for industrial applications worldwide. The company was founded in 1918 and has a market cap of $11.21 billion.
"
178,PH,"Parker Hannifin suffered through the economic decline of 2008 and 2009 just like many other companies, with its full-year revenue showing its first decline in ten years. But with the economy on the mend, the company began to see its sales perk up toward the end of 2009 as its corporate customers returned to spending on increased confidence. That momentum showed up on April 20 when Parker reported much better than expected Q3 results.
"
179,PH,"Q3 Results-April 20
"
180,PH,"Revenue for the period was up 11.5% from last year to $2.6 billion. Earnings also came in strong at 94 cents, 22% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has an average earnings surprise of 77% over the last year.
"
181,PH,"Parker's saw strong results from its largest segment, industrial, where international sales were up 19% from last year to $995 million and domestic sales were up 12% to $959 million. Its aerospace division didn't fare as well, down 6.4% to $49 million.
"
182,PH,"Clearly, Parker has some very nice upward momentum working in its favor, with this being the third consecutive quarter of sequential sales and earnings growth coming out of the recessionary environment of 2009. The company acknowledged the encouraging trend in its earnings call, saying its total order rates both sequentially and year-over-year suggest that the global economic recovery is under way.
"
183,PH,"Balance Sheet Improving
"
184,PH,"In spite of the company's long-term debt load of $1.8 billion, its balance sheet still looks strong and adequately capitalized with a debt-to-equity ratio of 29% and 25% on a net basis. This should provide the company with the ability to pursue opportunities to grow its business.

192,PH,"The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently raised its outlook for the global economy, with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3.6% in 2017. It expects 2.2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.7% in 2018, including 2% growth for advanced nations and 4.9% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery. Moreover, healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations, especially in emerging countries, are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces require heavy construction machineries.Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector has performed well, yielding a solid return of 18.3% year to date. This outpaces growth of 16.9% recorded by the S&P 500 and roughly 13.2% by the NYSE Composite.Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corp., PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial Machinery: DescriptionIndustrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.The United States: The country’s industrial production increased2.9% year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining, manufacturing and utilities output. In September, industrial production increased 1.6% year over year.In addition, a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report,new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 6.4% in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries.Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 261,000 new job additions in October. Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162,000 (accounting for hurricane affects). The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points (bps) to 4.1%. Also, the country’s GDP has advanced 3% in the July-September quarter.We believe that implementation of the Trump government’s growth policies, especially the proposed $1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement, will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country. To continue supporting the growing economy, the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December.The IMF projects the U.S. economy to grow 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018. These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018.Japan: The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, an aging population and huge public debt.Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in April 2014.However, strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country’s annualized GDP growth of 1.4% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter. In addition, we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 4.7% in third-quarter 2017. However, the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter, with total machinery orders likely to decline 1.9%. Core orders are expected to fall 3.5%, orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9.4% and that from government clients might decline 3.3%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1.5% for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0.7% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% from the year-earlier period in the third quarter. However, this improvement was slightly below 6.9% registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments.The country’s industrial production improved 6.6% year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in October grew 6.2%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that implementation of the government’s plan to spend more than $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery.The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.8% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2018, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country is currently witnessing the after-effects of some major reforms —demonetization and goods and services tax — implemented in the trailing 12 months. These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward.A favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production decelerated to 3.8% in September 2017, having expanded 4.5% in the previous month. Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs. In the first half of fiscal 2017 (ended September), industrial production expanded 2.5% year over year.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 7.4% in 2018, down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates.Brazil: One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation, somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities. Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country’s poor investment grade ratings. Moreover, low private investments, inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12.4% are other major hurdles.Partially negating the impact of these aspects, growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation have prompted the countries’ Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October, this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year. Per the latest data, industrial production in September grew 2.6% from the year-ago comparable month.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.7% in 2017, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1.5%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP has improved 2.5% year over year in third-quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3.3% year over year in September. The unemployment rate at September end was 8.9% versus 9% at the end of the previous month.The region’s GDP when compared with the previous quarter inched up 0.6% versus 0.7% recorded in the second quarter. Industrial production, on a month-on-month basis, fell 0.6% in September.The IMF increased output growth estimates by 20 bps both for 2017 and 2018 to 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingOf the 16 Zacks sector, Industrial Products is currently in the top 25%, holding the fourth position. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. As a rule, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)The machinery industry comprises stocks that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipment (currently such stocks collectively carry Zacks Industry Rankof 17), construction and mining equipment (ranked 5), industrial electronics (ranked 186), electrical products (ranked 115), thermal products (ranked 28), material handling products (ranked 28), printing equipment for industrial use (ranked 115), industrial tools and providing related services (ranked 20) and companies serving general industrial purposes are ranked 62.Going by the Zacks rule, we see that machinery sub-industries, except for one, fall in the top half. These sub-industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorPer the Zacks Earnings Trends report dated Nov 16, roughly 470 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the July-September quarter, with 72.3% beating earnings estimates and 66.5% surpassing revenue projections.Of the Industrial Products stocks, roughly 95.8% reported results til Nov 16. Earnings grew 16.7% year over year, with roughly 65.2% companies beating estimates. Revenues improved 2.9%, with a sales beat of 69.6%.In the quarter, the S&P 500 companies collectively are projected to deliver earnings growth of 6.5% and sales growth of 5.8%. Seeing the results so far and the favorable operating conditions, we believe that the overall performance of the Industrial Products sector will be encouraging. Earnings for industrial stocks are projected to grow 18.7% while sales to increase 4.5%.Our TakeIt will be interesting to watch the activities of companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar, Inc., ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR  -  Free Report) and Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.In the S&P 500 group, a major machinery company is Caterpillar. It has a market capitalization of $82.7 billion and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). In the next three to five years, the company’s earnings are predicted to grow 10.3%.Earnings for Deere & Company are predicted to grow 8%. It currently has $48 billion market capitalization and Zacks Rank of #1.The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.Internal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in accelerating growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

CLARCOR is bringing a range of industrial air and liquid filtration products and technologies to the table, which will significantly boost Parker-Hannifin’s filtration product suite. Moreover, this acquisition will unlock fresh recurring revenue streams for Parker-Hannifin’s Filtration Group as 80% of CLARCOR’s revenue is generated through aftermarket sales.The company is bullish on the integration of CLARCOR with its filtration business, which will help it double sales at this unit and optimize the aftermarket mix of Parker-Hannifin.Further, on Feb 1, Parker-Hannifin announced the acquisition of Helac Corporation, which specializes in the design and manufacture of helical rotary actuators. Helac also manufactures a line of attachments used in material handling and construction equipment markets.Helac will be integrated into Parker-Hannifin’s Cylinder Division within the Hydraulics Group and its sales will be reported under Parker's Diversified Industrial segment.

We believe that these acquisitions will unlock, significant synergies, and drive growth for the company in the times to come.GuidanceParker-Hannifin issued guidance for the fiscal year ending Jun 30, 2018.

217,PH,"Parker-Hannifin Corporation’s (PH  -  Free Report) operating arm, Parker Aerospace, recently entered into a contract with Oxsensis Ltd to develop a sophisticated aerospace engine sensor technology. The solution will help to boost engine capability and performance.The collaboration between these companies will develop static and dynamic pressure and temperature sensors for aerospace engine applications, supported by modern fiber optic sensor technologies.

Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company over the past couple of months. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 earnings has trended up from $8.90 to $9.05 in the last 60 days, thanks to nine upward estimate revisions versus none lower.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company benefits from its extensive distribution network, which has helped it in expanding the addressable market and reaching out to smaller OEMs. We believe that the company’s dominant foothold in the aftermarket business will boost its bottom line significantly in the upcoming quarters.In addition, Parker-Hannifin remains bullish about its revamped “WIN Strategy,” which lays the detailed blueprint for long-term growth. The strategy will help it deliver an earnings per share compound annual growth rate of 8% and segment operating margins of 17%, over the next five years.However, on the flip side, over the past few quarters, the company has been affected by an increase in prices for core materials like steel, aluminum, castings and nickel, among others.

236,PH,"Machinery companies are lining up to report their third quarter numbers, and analysts believe that most companies are primed to meet or surpass consensus expectations.  In fact, Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Obin expects top-line growth of +25% for his universe year-over-year.  The industry certainly faces challenges, but that hasnt kept general industrial machinery from registering a Zacks Industry Rank of 2.67, according to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  which places it 35th out of more than 200 industries.  Additionally, farm machinery also enjoys a ranking of 2.67.  The machinery industry seems set up for a solid third quarter, leaving investors with a good opportunity to make money with a little help from the All Stars.  
"
237,PH,"The major problem impacting machinery companies these days is high raw material costs, such as steel.  This factor has wreaked havoc across the marketplace, but machinery companies have been able to lessen the blow, and even offset its effect, with pricing increases.  The industry is able to do this because demand has been so high.  
"
238,PH,"One useful tool for measuring demand amongst machinery stocks, especially industrial machinery, is the Manufacturing ISM Report on Business®.  In September, the ISMs PMI came in at 58.5%, which marked a decrease of 0.5% from August.  However, it remains well above the magic number of 50%, which indicates expansion.  That marked the 16th consecutive month of manufacturing growth.  The September report also indicated encouraging results for production and employment, and stated that the overall economy grew for the 35th straight month.
"
239,PH,"The manufacturing industry is a very broad space, but there are two companies that garner a special amount of attention from the analysts, namely Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) and Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE: IR ), both of which are highlighted below.  These companies have a great breadth of products, but are mainly construction machinery issues.  According to data from the U.S. Census, residential construction spending rose +10.1% in August, while non-residential building has also improved.  Caterpillar and Ingersoll-Rand are looked upon by analysts as two companies positioned well to take advantage of a rather favorable environment.  
"
240,PH,"So what is the best way to harness the profit potential in machinery?  That of course depends on what kind investor you are, and which analysts you consult.  Some analysts suggest that investors stick with diversified machinery companies, since they are considered safer than sector-specific companies that could get thrown off course on one setback.  Others believe that investors need to place their closest emphasis on future outlooks stretching into 2005.  But analysts are almost in unison when it comes to predicting a strong third quarter for the industry.  So do your homework, listen to a few analysts, and read the company information below, and you may be able to turn your portfolio into a well-oiled, profit-churning machine.What Do the All Stars Recommend?

242,PH,"Below are the top stocks recommended by the most 5-Star  analysts in the machinery industry.Illinois Tool Works, Inc.  (NYSE: ITW ) is a $10 billion in revenues diversified manufacturer of highly engineered components and industrial systems.  Illinois Tool Works will report its third quarter numbers on October 19.  Its second quarter, which was announced in late July, turned out to be the companys second straight quarter of strong across-the-board results.  The company posted income from continuing operations of $360.4 million, or $1.16 per diluted share.  The result matched the consensus and improved upon the prior years $284 million, or 92 cents per diluted share.  Revenues jumped +17% in that quarter.  A continued improvement in its North American and international end markets led to the solid growth.  The recently completed quarter was gratifying as we achieved record earnings, continued on our upward march to improve operating margins and closed eight acquisitions, which will help us achieve our long-term profitability targets, said W. James Farrell, Chairman and CEO.  Illinois Tool Works revised its full year earnings per share guidance upward to between $4.21 and $4.35, and expects third quarter earnings of $1.05 to $1.11.  The company reiterated those targets in September.  Analysts are now looking optimistically toward this companys third quarter report and have cited several encouraging characteristics, including lower cyclicality, almost debt-free balance sheet,  and strong free cash flow.

Parker Hannifin aims to be the number one or two company in every market it serves, and took a step in that direction earlier this week when it completed its acquisition of Sporlan Valve Company.  Sporlan is a market leader in refrigeration and air conditioning components, controls and systems.  The acquisition enhances Parker Hannifins leadership in refrigeration and air conditioning worldwide.  
"
243,PH,"In late July, Parker Hannifin reported a fiscal fourth quarter that demonstrated the company was firing on all cylinders.  Excluding items the company earned $1.02 per diluted share on sales of $1.99 billion.  That earnings result beat the consensus by almost +11% and more than doubled the prior years performance.  Sales increased from $1.66 billion.  As for the future, Parker Hannifin believes it is positioned to gain a greater share of business in core and emerging markets.  With strong orders reported for its industrial and aerospace segments in September, its no wonder why analysts are paying attention to this company.  The company will report its fiscal first quarter numbers on October 19.  To further research Parker Hannifin Corporation, click (PH  -  Free Report) .Caterpillar, Inc.  (NYSE: CAT ) is a technology leader and the worlds leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines and industrial gas turbines.  Caterpillar eased a lot of fears in late September when the company confirmed its expectation for continued growth.  In fact, the company updated its 2004 outlook and now expects sales and revenues to rise by +25% to +30%, instead of just +25%.  Also, the company reiterated its profit per share expectation for an advance of +80% to +85%.  In 2003, Caterpillar earned $3.13 per share on sales and revenues of $22.76 billion.  Caterpillar wants to make sure it can take advantage of a favorable industry environment, and many analysts believe it will.  Our goal to continue growing the business with emphasis on improved profitability, said Chairman and CEO Jim Owens.  Sales growth by itself isnt good enough.  We want profitable growth that enables us to continually develop leading edge products, maintain world-class operations, pay highly competitive salaries and benefits to attract and retain the best people, and increase dividends for stockholders. 
"
244,PH,"In late July, Caterpillar broke a string of seven straight quarters with earnings per share above Wall Street expectations when it posted second quarter profit of $552 million, or $1.55 per share.  That result missed the consensus of $1.74, but still improved upon the year-ago performance of $399 million, or $1.15 per share, by +38%.  Sales and revenues in the quarter rose +27% to $7.56 billion.  The company said it made a strategic decision to satisfy unprecedented customer demand even though it resulted in increased operating costs, and now believes it is better positioned than competitors to serve customers because of its worldwide sourcing capability and extended dealer network.  Now, analysts are looking forward to the third quarter report on October 21 with many of them believing that Caterpillar is a good buying opportunity.

(NYSE: IR ) is a leading innovation and solutions provider for the major global markets of Security and Safety, Climate Control, Industrial Solutions and Infrastructure.  The companys diverse product portfolio encompasses such leading industrial and commercial brands as Thermo King transport temperature control equipment, Bobcat compact equipment, and Ingersoll-Rand industrial and construction equipment.  Ingersoll-Rand built momentum during its second quarter and generated double-digit revenue growth in every major business segment, except Dresser-Rand.  In late July, the company posted earnings per share of $1.42 for the quarter, excluding a Drilling Solutions gain.  That marked a significant gain over the year-ago quarter and also topped the consensus by more than +9%.  Revenues advanced about +12% to $2.71 billion vs. $2.43 billion last year.  Orders advanced +16% from last year, and the company sees a continuing recovery in most North American and European markets and continuing growth in Asia.  Ingersoll-Rand believes it is positioned to generate dramatic growth and greater returns for its shareholders as it moves through the second half, and therefore decided to raise its 2004 earnings per share guidance.  The company will report its next quarterly report on October 21.  
"
245,PH,"A more recent move of Ingersoll-Rands came in late August when the company sold its Dresser-Rand business unit to a fund managed by First Reserve Corporation.  Dresser-Rand develops, sells and services large, highly engineered centrifugal and reciprocating compressors, steam and gas turbines, and control systems.  Ingersoll-Rand called the sale an important strategic move, as it leaves the company open to focusing on its remaining business segments.  The company is confident that its strategies to develop innovative solutions for its customers and continuously improve its operations will generate dramatic growth and greater returns for shareholders.

246,PH,"There are several indicators suggesting that the rest of this year, and possibly next, will be a strong period for the machinery industry.  Of all the different segments in this vast space, farm machinery stands out as one of the biggest beneficiaries.  In fact, the farm machinery industry currently enjoys a Zacks Industry Rank of 1.50, according to Nick Raichs  Weekly Earnings and Sector Update,  placing it number one out of more than 200 industries.  The most recent Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing report showed a PMI that increased +0.4% to 62.8% in May, with the manufacturing sector growing for the 12th straight month and the overall economy moved forward for the 31st consecutive month.  Such data has many analysts optimistic on industries like machinery for the remainder of 2004 at least, which leaves investors with ample opportunity for profit. 
"
247,PH,"I expect continued expansion in the amount of industrial activity for the second half of 2004, and reasonably confident for expansion in 2005, said Charles Brady, Vice President Senior Equity Analyst at Aperion Group, LLC.  Industrial activity in the first half of 2004 rose in the double-digits from a rather lousy performance in the year-ago period, and the 5-Star analyst says 2005 activity could rise in the high-single digits from 2003.  Brady, who covers the general industrial space, says comments from companies are more positive than five to six months ago, as evidenced by signals of strong underlying data reports such as the above-mentioned ISM numbers and earnings estimates increases for issues like  3M  (NYSE:  MMM ),   Illinois Tool Works  (NYSE:  ITW ), and  Parker Hannifin  (NYSE:  PH ).     
"
248,PH,"Many of the factors helping the broader machinery space are also positively impacting farm machinery.  Higher replacement demand and stronger farm fundamentals have also aided in this industrys rise from last years malaise.  Higher commodity prices are one of the factors helping farm income, and therefore farm equipment sales, along with low interest rates, tax benefits, and income visibility.  According to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, U.S. agricultural machinery sales in May were up +3.2% for row crop tractors, up +.5% for four-wheel drive tractors, and up +50% for combines, while small tractors and utility tractors were down -2.3% and -5.1% respectively.  Some people found such numbers to be a bit disappointing, especially for row crop tractors, but it comes on the heels of an exceptionally strong April report and still marks a solid improvement year-to-date.   
"
249,PH,"However, since farms are vulnerable to uncontrollable events such as poor weather conditions, investors cannot enter the space frivolously and expect to make a profit.  Thats where the insight of analysts come into the equation.  They can help you pinpoint the trends in both the larger machinery industry, and in its more specific farm segment, while also concentrating on company-specific issues.  With a more favorable environment serving as a foundation, and the experience of analysts as a guide, investors can find plenty of opportunity in the farm machinery industry to make sure that you plant a profitable crop in your portfolio.

251,PH,"Below are the stocks recommended by the most  5-Star  analysts in the farm machinery industry.  Deere & Company  (NYSE:  DE ) is the worlds leading manufacturer of agricultural and forestry equipment; a leading supplier of equipment used in lawn, grounds and turf care; and a major manufacturer of construction equipment.  John Deere also manufacturers and markets engines used in heavy equipment and provides worldwide financial services.  Deere & Company is the most recognizable name in the farm machinery industry.  Theres probably no better indication of the strength of this industry than the fact that Deere announced very strong quarterly performance in mid-May.  For its fiscal second quarter, the company earned $1.88 per share, compared with $1.07 last year.  The consensus at the time was expecting $1.75, which marked a more than +7% advance.  Worldwide net sales and revenues reached $5.877 billion, or +34% better than last year.  Strong markets for its products, along with benefits from ongoing business-improvement initiatives, were credited for Deeres new levels of performance and financial returns.  All of Deeres equipment divisions generated higher sales for the quarter and year-to-date.  Equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada improved +39% for the quarter, while sales outside that region advanced +18%, excluding the impact of currency translation.  Robert W. Lane, Chairman and CEO of Deere, stated, We are profitably expanding our market presence throughout the world and winning new customers, with exciting new products and services.  Furthermore, aggressive asset management has resulted in lean and efficient inventory levels.  This one-two punch of expansion and asset management puts the company in a position to fully participate in the recovery now under way in its key markets.  To further research Deere & Company, click  DE .  AGCO Corporation  (NYSE:  AG ) is a global designer, manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts.  AGCO products are distributed in over 140 countries.  The company offers a full product line including tractors, combines, hay tools, sprayers, diesel engines, forage, tillage equipment and implements through more than 9,200 independent dealers and distributors around he world.  Late in April, AGCO reported first quarter adjusted net income of 27 cents per share, which excludes restructuring expenses and restricted stock compensation.  The result exceeded the year-ago total of 23 cents while also eclipsing the consensus by almost +93%.  High commodity prices and improving farm income have generated stronger retail activity in North and South America during 2004, according to the company.  Net sales jumped +47% to $1.1 billion The company attributed two factors to its better than expected performance.  The first factor was a strong performance out of its South American operations, where industry unit retail sales of tractors jumped about +25% year-over-year.  Industry retail sales for combines were up +62% in South America during the year.   
"
252,PH,"The other important factor in AGCOs results was its acquisition of Valtra from Kone Corporation, which was completed on January 5.  Valtra was a global tractor and off-road engine manufacturer.  In fact, the company was the market leader for tractors in the Nordic region of Europe and had a significant presence in the Latin America tractor market.  Under the Sisu Diesel brand, it produced off-road diesel engines.  To further research AGCO Corporation, click  AG .  Caterpillar, Inc.  (NYSE:  CAT ) operates in three principal lines of business; Machinery, Engines and Financial Products.  The Machinery segment designs, manufacturers and markets construction, mining, agricultural and forestry machinery.  It would certainly be an understatement to limit Caterpillar to farm machinery, but much like companies in that industry it put together a solid quarterly report.  Late April saw Caterpillar earn $1.16 per share for its first quarter, easily surpassing the year-ago result of 37 cents while also eclipsing the consensus by more than +68%.  Sales and revenues reached $6.47 billion, marking growth of +34% year-over-year.  Machinery sales in the quarter rose by +41% to $4.15 billion, with sales in North America up +49% year-over-year.  Sales opportunities are increasing, and we are exceptionally well-positioned to benefit with our broad product offerings and strong global dealer network, said Jim Owens, Chairman and CEO of Caterpillar.  Looking further into 2004, Caterpillar now expects sales and revenues to increase approximately +20% for the year and profit per share to rise about +65% to +70%.  Previously, it had expected a sales rise of +12% and profit rise of +40%.  Caterpillar remains focused on managing its cost structure as the economy recovers, which should ensure outstanding results over the business cycle.  To further research Caterpillar, click  CAT .

"
255,PH,"The market is barely positive this year, lacking in a clear directional move. As articulated in last weeks article (Near-term Economic Picture Less Foggy), we subscribe to the view that there is a net positive tone to the current market, but we are also cognizant of other views out there.  
"
256,PH,"In fact, there is no shortage of detractors who rely on their own set of data and related interpretations to justify their gloomy prognostications. While you know where I stand, it is useful to give both sides of this debate a good hearing. That is exactly what I plan to do here today.  
"
257,PH,"The Bull narrative dwells on a strong economic recovery, both here in the U.S. as well as worldwide, and its impact on corporate earnings and market valuation in a backdrop of exceptionally low interest rates. The Bear argument doubts the sustainability of the economic recovery, fearing another downturn, and dwells on the potential long-term weakness in the labor market. Bull CaseSustainable Economic Recovery: The US economy came out of the Great Recession in the second half of 2009, accelerating to its fastest pace in six years at the end. While fiscal stimulus and inventory restocking helped drive the initial growth spurt, the recovery is on a sustainable enough trajectory to withstand the removal of stimulus in the second half of 2010. The outlook for all the major emerging market economies and other major world economies, including the Eurozone, also remains positive.Solid Earnings Outlook: Following a solid fourth-quarter 2009 earnings season, the outlook for 2010 and beyond looks even better. The finance, basic materials and energy sectors have rebounded, and earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to jump an impressive 31.1% in 2010 and another 20% in 2011. This type of earnings growth is expected to drive the market higher.  Turnaround in the Labor Market: The unemployment rate appears to have peaked at 10% and is expected to steadily decline going forward. While the East Coast ""snowmageddon"" kept the labor market from producing positive monthly job numbers, the disappointment is expected to be short lived. The weather-related missing jobs from the February report are expected to show up in the March report. But even the negative February monthly report had plenty of positives hidden under its hood. Interest Rates Remain Accomdative: With inflation essentially way off the horizon, and with continued above average slack in the labor market, the Fed will keep interest rates at the current low levels for a very long time. There is no shortage of market bulls that see the Fed on hold through at least the middle of next year. This helps juice up the economy, sustaining the market's positive momentum.Bear CaseEconomic Recovery Unsustainable: The bulk of the GDP growth to date has been driven by inventory restocking and fiscal stimulus-related forces. These are by nature transitory and not sustainable in the long run. With investments and spending outside of the public sector still very weak due to continued access-to-credit issues and ongoing deleveraging, the economic growth momentum will lose steam in the second half of this year as the fiscal stimulus wears off. Bottom line, the economy is on a sugar high right now and is not ready to stand on its own feet. Housing on Shaky Ground: Most of the stabilization that we have seen to date in the housing market ties back directly to the temporary stimulative measures initiated by the U.S. Treasury and the Fed. As these stimulative measures are removed, the housing sector reverts back into its natural weak state, dragging everything else along with it. Case in point is the Fed's stoppage of the purchase of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the end of this month. As such, while the actual interest rate increases may be some time off, as the bulls contend, these MBS stoppages will usher in higher mortgage rates in the coming days. China's Uncertain Profile: While fears about the sovereign debt profile of Greece or any of the other so-called PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) have receded to some extent, China remains a major issue. China is trying to control some of the speculative excesses in its real estate sector  in essence it is trying to let the air out of a bubble without actually popping it. China's ability to pull that off without damaging its economy is far from certain and remains a key risk factor for the global economy. Labor Market Continues to Drag: While the labor market may start producing positive job numbers in the coming months, it will be years before we get anywhere near the pre-crisis levels in the U.S. labor market. Millions of jobs in the finance, housing and manufacturing sectors may have been permanently eliminated, making it unlikely those jobs will ever come back. How strong and sustainable can the recovery be if the labor market is in such a weak state? 
"
258,PH,"While I can see merits in both the arguments, my view is more in tune with the bull case. I expect the economic recovery to be sustainable and don't subscribe to the so-called double-dip recession view. On balance though, I see enough merit in the other side of the argument to keep the market from making a clear break out in any direction any time soon. Portfolio Update 
"
259,PH,"We added two stocks and deleted one from the Focus List last week. The Growth & Income Portfolio remained unchanged. There were also changes to the Timely Buys list.  
"
260,PH,"We added Domino's Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) and Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) to the Focus List last week. Domino's, the $800 million pizza purveyor, is getting rave reviews for its new recipe. This enthusiasm has started showing up in its estimates as well, with the current year Zacks Consensus Estimate up 17 cents in the last month to $1.10 per share. This Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy') stock is at its 52-week high, but has the wind at its back, in our view.  
"
261,PH,"Parker Hannifin is far less appetizing than Domino's in its core business, but this manufacturer of industrial components offers no less juicy returns. This cyclical leverage story offers impressive earnings momentum, with 38% earnings growth next year. 
"
262,PH,"We deleted Allied World Assurance (AWH) from the Focus List to reflect the company's recent weakening earnings estimate profile. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate dropped to $7.68 from $7.97 in the last 30 days, prompting us to exit this name despite a still attractive valuation. 
"
263,PH,"Parker Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report) is stepping up its game in the tough economy, creating a ""Win Strategy"" to increase operational efficiencies and drive profits. The company's recent Q2 results came in ahead of expectations.  
"
264,PH,"Company Description
"
265,PH,"Parker Hannifin Corp. manufactures fluid power systems and electromechanical for a number of different industries worldwide. The company was founded in 1918 and has a market cap of $9.02 billion. 
"
266,PH,"Second-Quarter Results
"
267,PH,"Sales were up 5.3% from last quarter to $2.4 billion. Earnings came in far better than expected at 64 cents, 30 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company has consistently produced exceptional results over the last three quarters, surprising by an average of 96%. 
"
268,PH,"Parker CEO Don Washkewicz noted that the company is benefiting from its ""Win Strategy,"" an initiative designed to increase operational efficiencies in response to the weak economy. The new directive helped Parker eclipse its operating margin goal of 10% during the quarter. The company also acted to strengthen its balance sheet, paying down $1 billion of debt last year to bring its debt-to-equity level below 30%. 
"
269,PH,"With a strong quarterly showing in hand and the economy on the mend, Parker was optimistic about its future, with Washkewic adding that, ""we believe there are early signs of a recovery emerging, we are anticipating a strong second half to our fiscal year."" 
"
270,PH,"The sentiment sent estimates higher, with the current year adding 67 cents to $2.66 in the last 2 weeks. The next-year estimate is up 54 cents in the same time to $3.67, a bullish 38% growth projection. 
"
271,PH,"Valuation
"
272,PH,"After the recent gains, PH trades with a forward P/E multiple of 21X, a premium to the overall market.
"
273,PH,"The Chart
"
274,PH,"Shares of PH have been on the up swing for most of the last 10 months since bottoming out with the market in early March, recently pulling back from 52-week high at $62.85 to pressure an up trend line. The stochastic is signaling that shares are trading deep in oversold territory, take a look below.

"
277,PH,"Key Points:Total earnings so far down 9.4% from last year, but up sharply from Q4
"
278,PH,"Financials much better than expected, but quality of earnings is awful
"
279,PH,"Excluding Financials, total earnings are down 22.2% from a year ago and -12.2% from Q4
"
280,PH,"Total net income is down in all sectors but Financials and Health Care
"
281,PH,"Health Care, Tech and Discretionary all showing lots of positive surprises
"
282,PH,"Full S&P 500 (SPX) total net income expected to be 25.1% lower than last year
"
283,PH,"Revisions Ratios improve but remain deep in negative territory
"
284,PH,"Bottom-up estimate for S&P 500 now $59.36 in 2009 versus $59.42 last week.
"
285,PH,"S&P 500 now expected to earn $74.21 in 2010 versus $74.01 last week
"
286,PH,"Total Net Income Growth
"
287,PH,"Earnings are coming in much better than expected.
"
288,PH,"This is particularly true in the financial sector. However, there the quality of earnings is exceptionally poor, with billions of dollars of earnings due to declines in the prices of their bonds. This is pure accounting nonsense. Mark-to-market is apparently ok for liabilities, but not for assets?  Never mind that most bonds have covenants that require that if the issuer buys back the bond they can only do so after a certain date and at a prearranged price, which is almost always above par.
"
289,PH,"If Financials are excluded, the picture is vey different, with total net income down 22.2% from a year ago, and 12.2% lower than in the 4th quarter. The 139 (27.8%) firms that have reported, collectively earned $57.5 billion versus $63.5 billion a year ago and $28.2 billion in the fourth quarter. The 112 non-financial firms have collectively earned $41.8 billion versus $53.7 billion a year ago and $47.5 billion in the fourth quarter.
"
290,PH,"Health Care is the only other sector showing year-over-year growth in total net income, and that is just 3.1%. The weakest performances so far in terms of total net income growth have been Materials, Industrials and Consumer Discretionary.
"
291,PH,"However, with less than one-third of the S&P 500 firms reporting so far, so the results could still change significantly. Also the percentage of firms reporting is far from uniform across sectors (still no utilities reports for example).
"
292,PH,"Still, many of the earnings declines have been less than expected, and the raw number of positive surprises is leading disappointments by slightly more than 2:1. The median surprise is very healthy at 5%. Despite the better than expected earnings reports, estimate cuts continue to run almost 2x the number of positive estimate revisions for 2009 and over 2:1 for 2010.
"
293,PH,"Since the first quarter is part of the full year earnings any firm that surprises positively and does not see its full year estimates raised has an implied estimate cut for the remaining quarters of the year. That being said, the current revisions ratio of 0.51 is substantially higher than it was a month ago (0.29). The 2010 revisions ratio has also improved substantially, to 0.46 from 0.27 a month ago. In other words, estimates are being cut, but at a slower pace than then were previously.

The ratio of positive surprises to disappointments stands at 2.08:1, while in recent years it has regularly been well over 3:1. The median surprise is 5.00%, which is above historical norms. These figures will be very volatile in the early going and will most likely change significantly by the time earnings season is over.

301,PH,"Tech has the best overall surprise profile so far, with 18 positive surprises and just 2 disappointments. The median surprise is a very healthy 10.4%.
"
302,PH,"Health Care and Consumer Discretionary also have shown surprisingly good results. By raw count, financials have had just as many disappointments as positive surprises, but the positive surprises have come at the bigger and more significant firms (and are of extremely poor quality). Energy has also been disappointing, but it still very early for the sector with just over 10% of the results in.

"
311,PH,"Only Telecom and Discretionary are in neutral territory. The overall pace of estimate revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is over. The revisions ratio is based on the four week moving totals of estimate changes. Thus the rise in the ratio may have more to do with old estimate cuts falling off faster than old estimate increases than it does with new estimate revisions.

312,PH,"Technology leads the pack this week. Within the sector, Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) was impressive with 12 increases and no cuts, which resulted in a 20.5% increase in its mean estimate. TXN alone was responsible for 1 out of 5 estimate increases in the sector.

"
338,PH,"The initial batch of second-quarter earnings reports will be released over the next few weeks. I expect profits to follow a similar trend to that of the first-quarter, with the quality of the results depending on the method of measurement used.
"
339,PH,"For example, the median per share growth for the S&P 500 should be about 6.4%. Aggregate profits for the index (calculated on a top-down basis), however, are likely to be down 7.5%. The difference reflects the impact of weighting, with the aggregate numbers giving more emphasis to financial companies.
"
340,PH,"Financial companies, particularly banks and thrifts, continue to be adversely affected by rising mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures. Conversely, record-setting oil prices have caused brokerage analysts to constantly revise their quarterly (and full-year) forecasts higher on multiple exploration and production (E&P) companies. These revisions have helped to offset the weakness in the financial sector in the higher median EPS figure.
"
341,PH,"Rather than focusing on financial and oil companies this week, however, I want to point out specific industries that are not garnering as many headlines, but should have notable results (either for showing good growth or for disappointing shareholders) during second-quarter earnings season.
"
342,PH,"Coal Has Some Luster
"
343,PH,"Much like oil, going long coal has been a profitable strategy for speculators. The price of coal has nearly doubled since the start of the year. As a result, brokerage analysts have found themselves continuously adjusting their models upwards.
"
344,PH,"Peabody Energy (BTU) stands out among the group. This Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stock is projected to generate 37.5% earnings growth this quarter. Per share earnings estimates are up eight cents over the past 60 days to 55 cents per share.
"
345,PH,"BTU is classified in Coal.
"
346,PH,"Mix in Chemicals
"
347,PH,"Multiple chemical companies have been able to push through price increases, allowing them to both offset higher raw material prices and grow earnings. Median projected growth for chemical-related companies within the S&P 1500 Composite could reach 12%.
"
348,PH,"Industrial gas companies Air Products (APD  -  Free Report) and Praxair (PX  -  Free Report) are two potential plays. Both Zacks #2 Rank stocks have exceeded expectations for several quarters, provided bullish guidance following their first-quarter results and are projected to have generated double-digit growth this quarter.
"
349,PH,"Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") Newmarket  offers stronger growth. This manufacturer of lubricants and other petroleum additives is projected to have increased per share profits by 26%. Earnings estimates have been revised upwards and the company exceeded first-quarter results by 30 cents per share.
"
350,PH,"APD and PX are classified in Chemicals-Diversified. NEU is classified in Chemicals-Specialty.
"
351,PH,"Machinery Working
"
352,PH,"Despite the slowing economy, many machinery companies are likely to deliver good earnings. Global economic growth abroad and exposure to growth sectors have allowed many machine manufacturers to thrive despite the weak U.S. economic backdrop.
"
353,PH,"Nordson (NDSN  -  Free Report) topped expectations last quarter by a margin of 14 cents per share thanks to its international diversification. This company realized revenue growth of 31% in Asia and 28% in Europe. Brokerage analysts believe NDSN's earnings could total 99 cents per share this quarter versus 61 cents a year ago. NDSN is Zacks #1 Rank stock.
"
354,PH,"Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) is projected to achieve 22% profit growth this quarter. The company makes motion control systems and has exposure to the aerospace, agriculture and energy sectors. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions help to make PH a Zacks #2 Rank stock.
"
355,PH,"NDSN and PH are classified in Machinery-General IndustrialRefiners Not Benefiting From Rally in Oil
"
356,PH,"Record prices at the pump are not translating into higher profits for refiners. Rather, Sunoco (SUN), Tesoro (TSO) and others are likely to report a large drop in year-over-year profits. The reason is the crack spread, or the difference between the price of  crude and oil products such as gasoline. The crack spread soared in May, hurting refining margins.
"
357,PH,"Refiners are in a tough position of having to balance rising input prices while sustaining demand. As a result, they are accepting lower levels of profitability on the hope that oil prices will fall. Furthermore, the widened spreads will result in gasoline prices staying at high levels even after the oil bubble pops.
"
358,PH,"SUN and TSO are both Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stocks. They are classified in Oil Refining & Marketing.
"
359,PH,"No Good News for Newspapers

366,PH,"Parker Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) has increased its annual dividends for 52 consecutive years, among the top five longest-running dividend-increase records in the S&P 500 index. The companys dividend yield of 1.1% is well above the industry average. Growth is also abundant. In late April, the company announced record results in several areas, which included fiscal third-quarter sales of $3.2 billion, 14.4% higher than the year-prior $2.8 billion. Wall Street forecasts are bullish. Current earnings estimates for the year ending June 2008 are at $5.51 per share, up from the two months-ago level of $5.27. The most accurate projection is even higher at $5.54 per share.   
"

"
368,PH,"Parker Hannifin manufactures motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision-engineered solutions for a wide variety of commercial, mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. The company employs more than 57,000 people in 43 countries around the world. 
"
369,PH,"A Long Record of Raising Dividends
"
370,PH,"Parker is certainly rewarding from an income perspective as it increased its annual dividends for 52 consecutive years, among the top five longest-running dividend-increase records in the S&P 500 index. The companys dividend yield stands at 1.1% right now, well above the industry average as very few of its peers pay a dividend.
"
371,PH,"Strong Growth
"
372,PH,"Growth is also abundant. The company recently announced its acquisition of Titan Industries, which manufactures industrial rubber, custom made and composite hoses for fluid and material transfer as well as related products, services, and accessories. 
"
373,PH,"Parker explained that Titan Industries racked up sales of $28 million last year, adding that this acquisition strengthens Parker's position in the industrial hose market by substantially expanding the product offering and providing entrance into the marine, aircraft, food and dock side refueling markets.
"
374,PH,"In late April, the company announced record results in several areas, which included fiscal third-quarter sales of $3.2 billion, 14.4% higher than the year-prior $2.8 billion. Third-quarter earnings per share of jumped from last years $1.19 per share to $1.49 per share. The earnings result was about 11% above the consensus estimate. 
"
375,PH,"Earnings per share are expected to grow by 16% over the next 3  5 years, compared to the industry average expectation of 15%. Parker Hannifin offers a return on equity (ROE) of 19%, which tops the industry average of 17%.
"
376,PH,"Bullish Forecasts
"
377,PH,"The company hiked its earnings outlook to a range of $5.40 to $5.60 per share. The previous guidance for earnings was $5.15 to $5.40 per share. 
"
378,PH,"""Since fiscal 2008 continues to be strong overall, we have again raised our earnings guidance,"" said Washkewicz. ""Orders are growing in Europe, Asia, Latin America and North America. Many of our key markets, including Aerospace, continue to grow. For other markets, especially those in North America which have been in recession, we are positioned to benefit when they return to more normal growth levels."" 
"
379,PH,"Wall Street forecasts are in line with PHs range. Current earnings estimates for the year ending June 2008 are at $5.51 per share, up from the two months-ago level of $5.27. The most accurate projection is even higher at $5.54 per share.
"
380,PH,"Last week, I expressed optimism about the economy and the equity markets. I also said, however, that we were not yet out of the woods.
"
381,PH,"The news over the past few days reinforced my view about being cautiously optimistic.
"
382,PH,"There continues to be good earnings from companies with exposure to economic fluctuations, such as Walt Disney (DIS) and Focus List member Priceline.com (PCLN). Productivity was better than expected in the first-quarter. Many retailers reported growth in April sales. More Americans received their stimulus checks. Finally, the aggregate trend in estimate revisions continues to suggest a declining level of pessimism on the part of brokerage analysts.
"
383,PH,"On the other hand, oil continued to hit new highs. American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) reminded investors that the credit crunch is hurting earnings. Eduardo Castro-Wright, who oversees Wal-Mart's (WMT  -  Free Report) U.S. stores, observed that ""the 'paycheck cycle' is more pronounced for customers than in past months.""
"
384,PH,"Wal-Mart's conference call on Tuesday could be interesting from a standpoint of how stimulus checks are being spent. Although it is still early, WMT could provide insight as to whether consumers are using the money to buy necessities (food, medicine, etc.), if choosing to splurge on discretionary items like flat panel televisions or saving it/paying down debt.
"
385,PH,"Keep in mind that revolving consumer debt rose at a 7.9% annual rate in March, according to the Federal Reserve. Soaring gasoline prices and rising food prices are squeezing many consumers. Falling home prices make it harder to depend on home equity lines. For some people, the rebate checks will provide a much needed infusion of cash. But, even among those who need the cash, there is no guarantee that they will make the most fiscally responsible decision on what to do with the stimulus.
"
386,PH,"From an economic standpoint, we want the rebate checks to be spent. More money tossed into the economy should help to accelerate growth. Saving the cash or using it to pay down debt would be the smarter move for many people, however. Predicting what consumers will actually do is very difficult, especially given that previous surveys have given conflicting forecasts.
"
387,PH,"Going back to the bigger picture, outside of the financial, homebuilding and retail sector, most corporations are continuing to realize growth. The economy did expand in the first-quarter and we expect the pace of growth to accelerate. It may not be the perfect environment, but there are signs that we should begin to see a gradual recovery.
"
388,PH,"The major indexes tested their 200-day moving averages, but pulled back. Blame Texas Tea for the failure to move higher.
"
389,PH,"I would caution against reading too much into the action of the past few days. Earnings season is coming to an end and the Fed is on hold, which means fewer catalysts over the short-term. I think a lot people are waiting to see if the recovery does kick in.
"
390,PH,"Plus, there the risk remains that the recent upward move was nothing more than a bear trap. I think it was signaled the start of a recovery, but in order to be pragmatic, I need to acknowledge both the good and the bad.
"

The company has a price-to-book ratio of 2.3, compared to 4.8 for the market. Its PEG ratio is 0.94.
"
433,PH,"One early trend in fourth-quarter earnings is the number of disappointments from companies within the Finance sector. Out of 26 S&P 500 companies that have issued disappointing results so far, 11 are within the financial sector. Within the broader Zacks Rank universe1, financial companies account for 67 of the 135 earnings misses.
"
434,PH,"There are two caveats to these numbers. First, finance companies, as a group, tend to report earlier than companies in other industries and therefore account for a disproportionate number of total reports. Second, the ratio of surprises to misses does not materially rise for the S&P 500 or the Zacks Rank universe when financial companies are excluded. (Excluding financial companies, the ratio of positive to negative surprises for the S&P 500 is 2.9:1. Including financial companies lowers the ratio to 2.62. As of yesterday, 24 financial companies within the S&P 500 have topped expectations, while 11 have missed and six have met.)
"
435,PH,"The story here appears to be company specific, as opposed to negative trends affecting the sector as a whole. For instance, among the larger banks Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) missed by a penny (EPS of $1.03 versus the consensus estimate of $1.04) whereas JP Morgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report) beat by five cents (EPS of 99 cents versus the consensus estimate of 94 cents). C has received criticism over its cost structure, whereas JPM offset weakness in its retail banking business with a material increase in investment-banking fees. 
"
436,PH,"Among mid-sized and smaller firms, weakness in the housing market and the inverted yield caused some to miss expectations, while others faired just fine in the current environment. For instance, First Horizon National (FHN) missed expectations by two cents with earnings of 60 cents per share. Income from mortgage banking was down considerably on a year-over-year basis. Conversely, growth in commercial loans helped KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) beat estimates by three cents with profits of 76 cents per share.
"
437,PH,"Last week, two industrial products companies provided bullish guidance. 
"
438,PH,"Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) expects fiscal 2007 earnings from continuing operations to be in a range of $6.35 to $6.75 per share, up from previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.45 per share. The raised guidance accompanied better than expected fiscal second-quarter profits of $1.55 per share. PH credited strength in its Industrial International and Aerospace segments, though profits from its North American Industrial segment also increased. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raised their earnings forecasts for both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008. The new consensus estimates are $6.61 per share and $6.98 per share, respectively.
