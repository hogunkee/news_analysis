0,PCG,"Utility stocks ran at the top and the bottom of the S&P 500 in an unusual session Monday. Sempra Energy (SRE) soared 15%, spurred by interest from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. PG&E (PCG) tanked almost 5% on liability concerns related to last year's Northern California wildfires.Both are diversified utilities, dealing with both power generation and natural gas. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Only one other utility stock in the 34-stock diversified industry group, Allete (ALE), moved more than 2%. Duluth, Minn.-based Allete dropped 2.5%. The result left the overall Utility-Diversified group up 0.4% for the day.A letter from Paul Singer's Elliott Management to Sempra's board outlined changes that the activist investor would like to see in order for the company to unlock investor value. Those changes included replacing six board members, as well as launching a strategic review of operations and assets.Elliott Management is a hedge fund with $34 billion in assets under management. The fund had played a key role in guiding Sempra, based in San Diego, to pay $9.45 billion to acquire Energy Futures Holdings. EFH held an 80% stake in Dallas-based power producer Oncor.At the time of the sale, Oncor reported more than 11 million customers. That lifted Sempra's total to more than 43 million. Elliott Associates, Elliott International and partner Bluescape Resources reportedly hold a 4.9% stake in Sempra. The letter to Sempra estimates that the utility can unlock between $11 billion and $16 billion in value. That would translate roughly to a $139 to $159 per share boost to the utility stock.In San Francisco, PG&E said Monday that it anticipates a ""significant liability"" after a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection report released Friday found PG&E equipment had caused at least 12 of the 24 blazes that tore through California's wine country in October. The fires killed 44 people and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.The state is still investigating the Tubbs Fire. The largest fire in California's history, Tubbs was part of the overall October conflagration, responsible for 24 deaths. PG&E claims that fire was started by a power line installed and owned by a private property owner.Uncertainty over liabilities led PG&E to suspend its dividend in December. On Monday, Wells Fargo kept its market perform rating on the stock, and lowered the price target to 46, from 48. Investment research firm CFRA carved its price target to 36, from 46, and downgraded the stock to strong sell, from hold.PG&E dived more than 8% in opening trade, then eased to a 4% loss. That put shares down 45% since September 15.RELATED:This Tool Is An Investor's Best Friend; Do You Know How To Use It?Mining Giant Makes These Big Moves On Car Battery MetalsThis Stock May Go Totally Bonkers When Earnings Come Out LateRussia Hacks U.S. Nuclear Plants, Infrastructure 'Hundreds Of Thousands Of Times A Day'Energy Future Holdings, One Of The Largest-Ever Energy Bankruptcies, Nears Finish

1,PCG,"Russian hackers are attacking critical U.S. infrastructure, including the energy grid, nuclear power plants, and airports, according to U.S. government officials.XWater processing plants are among the other targets being repeatedly tested by rolling attacks. Last year, more than a dozen power plants in seven states were breached due to Russia's ongoing campaign of cyberattacks.Energy Secretary Rick Perry told the House Appropriations Subcommittee Thursday cyberattacks are ""literally happening hundreds of thousands of times a day. ... The warfare that goes on in the cyberspace is real, it's serious, and we must lead the world.""Such attacks were cited as being one of the reasons the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals Thursday.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUtility giant Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) was up 2.1% on the stock market today. Duke Energy (DUK) rose 1.1%, Sempra Energy (SRE) 0.7%, Edison International (EIX) 1.8% and Southern Co. (SO) 0.6%.An alert issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI Thursday laid out in more detail what the Russians have been targeting, and how they are going about it.""Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors ... targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,"" the alert said.The techniques being employed include sending spear-phishing emails from compromised legitimate accounts, host-based exploitation and the targeting of industrial control system infrastructure.Russian operatives are also using the hacks for credentials gathering and open-source and network reconnaissance.While the alert did not disclose how successful the attacks were, it said hackers ""targeted small commercial facilities' networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks."" They also tried to hide their activities by creating new accounts on the staging targets to perform cleanup operations.While information theft was one of the goals, a key prize would have been gaining control of systems used by infrastructure. They could then launch attacks that could leave millions without water and power.An even more worrying prospect would be hackers gaining control of a nuclear power plant. A sudden shutdown can trigger safety systems designed to disperse excess heat and prevent a meltdown, though safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack. However, the operating systems used at such plants are usually decades-old legacy controls that cannot be exploited by hackers.The Department of Homeland Security previously said cyberattacks on critical infrastructure are ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:As Trump Sanctions Putin's Russia, Will Dems Revert To Their Fallback Position — Appeasement?

2,PCG,"Stocks opened to very tight gains on Monday, ahead of a heavy week of political and policy events. The world's attention is trained on Tuesday's summit between President Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, but a Wednesday press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell will be a focal point for investors.The Dow Jones industrial average managed a 0.2% gain. The S&P 500 added 0.1%, with utilities Sempra Energy (SRE) and PG&E (PCG) posting the index's largest rise and fall, respectively.The Nasdaq Composite struggled with a gain of less than 0.1%,The Dow posted a 2.8% gain last week, its best since early March. The S&P 500 climbed 1.6% and the Nasdaq notched a 1.2% gain. The result left the Nasdaq at a new high, the Dow holding comfortably above the 25,000 mark and the S&P 500 less than 1% below 2,800.On the political front, markets showed little reaction to an early U.S. exit from a fractious G7 meeting over the weekend. The result set a disappointing tone on progress toward international trade agreements, but markets settled into the quiet trade that is customary head of Federal Reserve meetings.A diplomatic summit set for Tuesday between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is historic, although it has no specific targets. The tone of the two leaders, and the tweets that follow the meeting, could have some bearing on market behavior.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Powell's press conference will be of particular interest, as investors look for clues as to whether the Fed is leaning toward one or two more rate hikes for the rest of the year.Bond markets also will be under the microscope as the ECB meets on Thursday. Few expect the bank will increase its interest rates. But expectations are high the bank will lay out an exit strategy from its massive bond-buying stimulus program begun in 2009.Sempra surged nearly 15% after a letter from activist hedge fund Elliott Management to the San Diego-based company's board outlined a strategy to unlock value in the $26.6 billion market capitalization stock. Moves included replacing six board members, and creating a Strategic Review Committee of the Board. Sempra shares are down 18% from a November 2017 high.PG&E skidded 6% lower. A report released late last week by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection determined that 12 fires in Northern California, which killed 18 people and burned 174,000 acres in October 2017, were the result of power lines or equipment owned by PG&E. PG&E shares ended Friday 42% below their September high. A note from Wells Fargo maintained the stock's Market perform rating, but lowered its price target to 46, from 48.A handful of quarterly reports will add interest during the week.

The stock ended Friday less than 6% below a buy point at 274.76. Shares are up 26% over the past 12 months, but the stock's Relative Strength line is lagging.Oil prices pulled back sharply, continuing recent volatility ahead of a June 22 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries. News reports said Saudi Arabia was increasing production ahead of the meeting. Many expect Saudi and non-OPEC member Russia to alter or remove production caps put in place in 2016. In addition, Reuters reported that the Trump administration, a day before exiting the Iran anti-nuclear deal, made a direct request for Saudi Arabia to increase production in order to offset the oil price impact of renewed sanctions against Iran.Oil traded down about 1% early Monday.

3,PCG,"An early burst of upside energy devolved into broad-based losses Tuesday, despite a positive reading on inflation, in a session at least partly upended by White House politics.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.7% and the S&P 500 took a 0.6% loss.Stocks rose for the first half-hour of trade Tuesday, then backtracked aggressively with Qualcomm (QCOM) spearheading the sell-off among tech names, as General Electric (GE) spiraled to the bottom of the Dow and as health care groups posted three of the day's five worst losses among the 197 industries tracked by IBD.February consumer price data released before the open was in line with forecasts, easing inflation concerns. The Trump Administration's order blocking an attempted takeover of Qualcomm by Singapore based Broadcom (AVGO) sent Qualcomm sprawling and Broadcom down 0.5%. The news initially sent Intel (INTC) up 4%, but gains fizzled to 0.2% by the close. News reports Friday said Intel was considering a takeover of Broadcom, in order to avert the competitive threat of a Broadcom/Qualcomm combination.It is difficult to tell how prominent other events in Washington were in investors minds Tuesday. The White House's sudden, though not unexpected, replacement of Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, the break between GOP and Democrats in the House Intelligence Panel's release of findings in its Russia probe, and the Senate's progress toward Dodd-Frank banking oversight reforms may all have weighed on the stock market today.The result showed the Dow clearly stymied at its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 again met resistance at the 2800 level and the Nasdaq pulled back to test support at the level of its recent high, from Jan. 26.On the Dow, General Electric dived more than 4% after JPMorgan slashed its price target, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) each booking losses of more than 2%.Among medical stocks, hospital operators Community Health System (CYH) and software developer Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) each skidded 7% lower. Still, insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 2% to lead the Dow after naming Andrew Witty, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) former chief executive, to head Optum health-services — the company's pharmacy benefits manager.  The positioning of a high-profile CEO to head the company stirred speculation that UntiedHealth could be considering a spin off.

Silicon Motion (SIMO) and Cavium (CAVM) dived more than 4% each.Fang stocks took one on the muzzle, with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) falling more than 2%, and Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) off more than 1% each. Apple (AAPL) briefly scored a new high during the session, only to reverse course and end with a 1.1% loss.It's often not a good sign for markets when defensive plays such as utilities show strength, and PG&E (PCG) took the top spot among S&P 500 stocks, rising more than 7% in above-average trade. Xerox (XRX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) were close behind, however, rising 6% and 4%, respectively. So the market's tone was not predominantly defensive.On the upside, IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) jumped more than 4% in soft trade.

4,PCG,"Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) plunged Thursday, as authorities try to determine responsibility for billions of dollars of wildfire damages across California.X Northern California utility PG&E said late Wednesday that it's suspending its dividend, warning it could be held liable for wildfires in October even though the cause is still under investigation.""However, California is one of the only states in the country in which courts have applied inverse condemnation to events caused by utility equipment,"" the company said in a statement. ""This means that if a utility's equipment is found to have been a substantial cause of the damage in an event such as a wildfire — even if the utility has followed established inspection and safety rules — the utility may still be liable for property damages and attorneys' fees associated with that event.""PG&E faces lawsuits tied to the wildfires in California's wine country and has lowered its earnings guidance for the year over the disaster. The stock has a $2.12 annual dividend payout.PG&E shares tanked 13% to 44.50 on the stock market today. Edison International, which has a $2.42 annual dividend, was down 7.3% to 63.32.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The October fires in Northern California caused more than $9.4 billion in residential and commercial claims, California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said earlier this month. The fires destroyed or damaged more than 21,000 homes, 2,800 businesses, and more than 6,100 private automobiles. The fire resulted in 44 deaths.Meanwhile, fires that started more than two weeks ago are still burning in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, where Edison serves customers.The utility reportedly is also being sued  over damages from regional wildfires.On Dec. 11, Edison's Southern California unit said the causes of the wildfires are being investigated by Cal Fire, other fire agencies and the California Public Utilities Commission.The company said it believes the investigations include the possible role of its facilities and is cooperating with the investigations.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere Are The Latest Stocks Joining The Bitcoin FrenzyTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info Tech

5,PCG,"Shares of electric utility Edison International (EIX) dived Tuesday as a devastating wildfire swept through Southern California, sparking fears on Wall Street that another utility could get slammed with liability for damages.X  But the company's Southern California Edison unit said in a statement that it ""has no indication"" its facilities were responsible for the fires in the Ventura and Santa Barbara areas.Officials haven't determined a cause yet; SCE's statement noted Cal Fire, the state's fire protection agency, will conduct a thorough investigation. But the stock action echoed PG&E's (PCG) plunge two months ago amid wildfires in Northern California.Downed PG&E power lines may have sparked those fires, and state officials are investigating the cause. The utility, however, has argued the blaze may have been caused by third-party equipment.Edison stock plunged 12.8% to 70 on the stock market today, hitting a 52-week low intraday. PG&E rose 0.15% but saw a nearly 30% collapse in mid-October.IBD'S TAKE: Research has shown as much as 50% of a winning stock's performance owes to the strength of its industry group and sector at the time of its breakout. You can keep track of industry group movements using IBD's Industry Sub-Group Rankings Table.In Southern California, more than 260,000 Edison customers lost power due to the massive fire, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday night, with a fire official saying Tuesday that intense winds had made the wildfire ""pretty much unstoppable.""Edison said via Twitter (TWTR) Tuesday that roughly 20,000 customers in Ventura County remain without power and warned some customers should prepare to be without power for days.Edison pays a quarterly dividend of 54.25 cents a share, which works out to an annualized yield of more than 3% after Tuesday's share-price plunge.RELATED:GOP Has Votes For Tax Bill, McConnell Says; S&P 500 Pares Flynn LossesNasdaq Leads Pack As These 3 Top Chip Stocks Rebound

7,PCG,"General Electric (GE) could be left out in the cold while other U.S. companies, including fellow industrial conglomerates, benefit from a tax windfall, according to an analyst.X The GOP tax package that President Trump signed into law Friday cuts the current corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But Deutsche Bank says GE could end up a ""significant net loser"" because the plan also calls for a 15.5% repatriation rate on earnings held offshore as cash, and 8% if overseas profits are invested in nonliquid assets, such as plants and equipment. The repatriation tax would be mandatory.As a result, GE could end up owing up to $9 billion in new taxes, or an average of $1.1 billion for the next eight years, on $82 billion in foreign earnings reinvested abroad, according to Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch.""GE's substantial tax bill would come at a difficult time for the company given GE's ongoing cash squeeze from weak cash generation that recently forced the company to cut its dividend in half,"" Inch wrote Dec. 20.GE's quarterly dividend is now 12 cents a share, a 50% cut, allowing the company to save about $4 billion a year.Additionally, Inch noted, $4.5 billion of GE's overseas cash hoard, as of Sept. 30, was held in countries that may restrict or limit the return of funds.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point may have the wind at their backs.GE has long enjoyed an ultralow tax rate, the result of ""aggressive"" tax planning that leverages both GE's position as a multinational and GE Capital's ability to move funds around the world for tax advantages, the Deutsche Bank note added.This year, the firm forecasts GE Industrial's tax rate to be less than 5%. By comparison, GE's multi-industry peers on average pay rates from the mid- to high 20s.Companies had held off on paying income taxes on foreign earnings until those funds are returned, or repatriated, to the U.S. The 35% domestic rate has led several companies to stockpile profits abroad, leading to charges of tax avoidance.Several profitable U.S. companies paid an effective tax rate far less than 35% between 2008 and 2015, due to the tax loopholes and special breaks they enjoy, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.In fact, 18 companies, including GE, Priceline (PCLN) and PG&E (PCG), paid no federal income taxes at all over that eight-year period despite consistently churning out profits, it added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere Are The Latest Stocks Joining The Bitcoin FrenzyTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info Tech

8,PCG,"Major stock indexes staged mild gains in afternoon trading Friday as the Nasdaq composite looked poised for a third up week in a row. Apple (AAPL) helped the cause, rising more than 0.5% to 156.80 and inching ever closer to its rising 50-day moving average.XApple is also trying to climb back a prior flat-base entry at 156.75. Yet given the stock's mild correction since September, it's also justified in waiting for a new base to form before executing a new purchase in the iPhone, iPad and digital services titan.At 2:15 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite, also benefiting from strength in select retail, electronics, internet and consumer-oriented shares, rallied 0.3%, just ahead of a nearly 0.2% rise for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average. Volume is rising vs. the same time on Thursday on the NYSE but down nearly 10% on the Nasdaq.The Dow and S&P 500 are gunning for their fifth straight weekly gain.The NYSE composite, reflecting a surprising rebound among commodity stocks including oil and steel, is set to rally for a seventh week in the past eight weeks and has gained 5.9% after falling to 11,670 on Aug. 18.Elsewhere, despite a small dip in the yield for the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, the Dow utility average is down more than 1.1% on another plunge by component PG&E (PCG). The northern California utility, sinking nearly 11% to 57.43 in huge volume, is suffering from the devastating wildfires that have scorched Napa, Sonoma and other counties in the wine-making region.The media is reporting speculation that PG&E-owned electrical power lines may have been a contributing cause to the fires that have killed more than 20.On Thursday, PG&E slid nearly 7% and cut right through its rising 200-day moving average.Back to Apple, the consumer tech giant continues to ride a solid uptrend ever since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.Keep watching its RS line, painted in blue in all IBD charts and MarketSmith charts.

In 2008, earnings were $5.96 a share; in 2016, Priceline grew earnings by 19% to $67.34 a share.The Street sees earnings climbing 11% to $74.79 a share this year and another 15% to $86.38 a share in 2018.Atlassian recently cleared a a new 10-week flat base that shows a 39.35 buy point.

14,PCG,"Shares of U.S. utility stocks such as Consolidated Edison (ED), Dominion (D), Duke Energy (DUK) and others are climbing as investors seek safe havens in the wake of Britain's decision last week to pull out of the European Union.Utilities were already strong as their steady dividend payments were attractive, with interest rates remaining low. The Dow Jones Utility Average had climbed 18% from the start of the year to Thursday's close, just before the results of the Brexit referendum started to come in.And while they are heavily regulated, they are also classic defensive stocks with steady, domestic demand that changes little during economic swings.Dow utilities surged 1.6% to a new intraday high Monday.Consolidated Edison, a New York-based utility with $12.1 billion in annual sales, provides electricity and natural gas to 3.4 million customers in three states.

16,PCG,"Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk is touting the electric car maker's late-Thursday-night press announcement with this tease: ""For the future to be good, we need electric transport, solar power and (of course) ... the missing piece.""Sounds like it's battery-shaped — specifically, about 3 feet tall and almost that wide — and hangs on a wall, according to one analyst's figuring.Tesla Motors (TSLA) has been working on home power storage with cousin company SolarCity (SCTY), and that Twitter (TWTR) tweet from Musk on Tuesday sets the stage for what is expected to be a big battery-related announcement — home- and utility-scale storage, for use with renewable energy sources such as solar power, but with other uses too.The company drove home that expectation Thursday in a reminder about the 8 p.m. PDT event at its Southern California design studio in Hawthorne, noting ""renewable energy storage"" as part of its business: ""Tesla Motors' goal is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable transport with a full range of increasingly affordable electric cars. California-based Tesla designs and manufactures electric vehicles as well as renewable energy storage.""Today Tesla will announce the missing piece to building a sustainable future,"" it said of the ""Energy Storage Event"" to be webcast live from the carmaker's website. ""Tune in to learn more about Tesla's solution to this critical step in the mission to enable zero emissions power generation.""Microgrids Heighten InterestA utility-scale battery array announcement could be a bigger deal than the expected home battery announcement. With several companies announcing ""microgrid"" products or projects last month, interest is mounting for power systems that can serve something the size of a corporate campus or a remote community. Stationary batteries can help smooth out the power flow at times when renewables are not producing (lack of wind, or lack of sun, for instance).Along with building the multibillion-dollar battery Gigafactory in Nevada, Tesla has teamed up with solar installer SolarCity, where Musk is chairman and the top shareholder, on battery-based storage for homes and businesses that have solar panel systems. That stored power can be used when the sun isn't shining.Tesla and SolarCity last month said they've teamed up to build entire tiny power grids using Tesla lithium-ion batteries. Samsung SDI also announced a strategic alliance along similar lines, with global automation technology firm ABB (ABB). And solar power company SunEdison (SUNE) made a key grid-related acquisition.About 230 California households in California, and 100 elsewhere, currently have a Tesla Stationary Battery installed in their homes, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said in a research note last week.""It is widely believed that Google (GOOGL) has a few Tesla Commercial Grade Stationary Batteries in a couple of their buildings,"" Chowdhry wrote. ""It is also believed that the new Apple (AAPL) campus will have Tesla Commercial Grade Stationary Batteries.""Chowdhry noted that one user whose battery he reviewed charges from his home solar energy system, ""and when the battery is fully charged, energy is sent to the PG&E (PCG) Grid for rebate on Electric bill.""Follow Donna Howell on Twitter: @IBD_DHowell.

18,PCG,"Boondoggles: A solar-power project set to open next month in Nevada has fried 130 birds during tests and will soon join another solar farm in California in avian incineration.If as many birds being burned by solar power farms built in the U.S. were to wash up on our beaches soaked in crude oil from a leaking offshore well, the outrage would be deafening.But as with the wind turbines that now cover acre upon acre of former ""pristine"" countryside, what amount to avian Cuisinarts slicing and dicing everything that flies, including endangered species, only the crickets are chirping.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is a big fan of green energy. So is her brother-in-law Ronald Pelosi. He was a senior executive with a company called Pacific Corporate Group (PCG). Among PCG's investments is SolarReserve, based in Santa Monica, Calif., which received a $737 million loan guarantee to build a 110-megawatt solar-thermal plant near Tonopah in Senate Minority Leader Sen. Harry Reid's Nevada.The aid was granted on the last day of the stimulus loan program. That was the same program that gave more than half a billion dollars to a failing but politically connected Solyndra, poster child for the Obama administration's version of crony capitalism that props up economically uncompetitive alternative energy projects.Ron Pelosi denies direct involvement with the loan, which, if true, makes another fascinating coincidence.The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project is set to begin commercial operation next month and has been doing some testing. The results have not been good for wildlife, with as many as 130 birds of various species, attracted by the glow of the project's 10,000 mirrors in the Nevada sunlight, being incinerated during tests.During one test, biologists noted the first of what they called ""streamers,"" birds that had caught fire from the focused solar energy and fell to Earth leaving a trail of smoke, a sight not unlike the scene of planes being shot down during a World War II flick.Tonopah officials claim they've put in place mitigating measures, meaning fewer birds will become crispy critters. This is what managers of the $2.2 billion Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System Project, partly owned by Google, said after reports the San Bernardino Co., Calif., plant would kill as many as 30,000 birds annually.As we've noted, it's not just solar power harming birds. Wind farms are estimated to have killed an incredible 573,000 birds in 2012, according to a report by Bloomberg News. This includes dozens of federally protected eagles.The environmentally conscious Obama administration has been issuing permits letting wind farms kill protected bald and golden eagles as long as they, like Tonopah and the Ivanpah Dry Lake projects, take steps to ""mitigate"" the slaughter. No such exemption has ever been extended to operators of oil rigs and tankers.According to the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, U.S. taxpayers have shelled out $150 billion in loans and subsidies over the last five years financing grants, tax credits and lending for solar and other renewable energy projects. Yet the Energy Department reports that wind and solar still provide little more than 7% of the nation's energy.The Institute for Energy Research reports that Ivanpah, which received $1.6 billion in taxpayer subsidies, is producing electricity at a rate of only 25% to 40% of original estimates and at a cost three times higher than traditional power sources.Thanks to an efficient and profitable technology known as fracking, we are in the midst of an oil and natural gas boom without the need for heavy subsidies or loans.Solar energy should be forced to compete in the marketplace for both investment and customers. We're spending way too much money to fry birds.

29,PCG,"Investors have long turned to the utility sector for steady returns. Rich yields in recent years also have drawn investors to master limited partnerships, which trade publicly like stocks and typically hold assets in stable businesses like energy pipelines.A different strategy might be in order for 2017 with interest rates likely to get off their historical lows and start rising. Both areas of the market will continue to attract the attention of income investors, but they do not come without risk.How fast rates rise likely will have a big impact on returns. Most analysts expect small, gradual increases. How should utilities and MLPs be played in such a scenario? What would happen if rates suddenly jump?Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingAbove-average yields have helped Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) and iShares U.S. Utilities ETF (IDU) post annual average returns of 7.2% and 7.6% over the last 15 years. These performances have outpaced ETFs tracking the S&P 500. SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) have returned annual averages of 6.5% over the same period.Rising interest rates have the potential to make these investments less attractive than fixed-income investments and eat into utility and MLP profits as borrowing costs creep up. To mitigate the risk of spikes in interest rates, investors may need to be more selective and tactical. Valuations and debt-to-equity ratios become increasingly important and dollar-cost averaging can help to tamp down portfolio volatility.Utility stocks have pulled back since a summer run-up, yet remain on track to post healthy returns for 2016. ""The fundamentals for the sector are still pretty good,"" said Ryan Hedrick, a utilities analyst for T. Rowe Price. ""Valuations for purely regulated utilities have corrected to a 7% to 8% discount to the market multiple. When we consider the total return algorithm of dividend yield plus earnings growth, the sector becomes more reasonably valued.""Over the long term, Hedrick expects utility companies to benefit from growing capital investment opportunities. ""There is room for ongoing capital investment to modernize grid infrastructure and to replace aging gas pipelines,"" he said. ""There is also a need to add transmission and distribution infrastructure to accommodate renewables while maintaining reliability.""Click Here To See A Table Of Top Yielding Utility StocksHedrick points out that utilities may face near-term resistance from higher interest rates. ""There is less to worry about, presumably today, at these prices than there was in the middle of the summer around Brexit when the 10-year Treasury was under 1.5%,"" he said. ""It is still a persistent risk for the sector however.""Dividend growth leaders may be better positioned to mitigate this risk. ""We look for very strong companies that are multiyear winners,"" Hedrick said. ""At the margin, I do have a bias for companies with strong dividend growth that tend to perform better in rising rate environments.""One dividend grower that Hedrick believes can capitalize on infrastructure upgrade efforts is PG&E Corp. (PCG) ""Substantial investments will be required to modernize their gas and electric system and ultimately help implement California's low-carbon-energy policies, which will increase renewable penetration,"" he said. ""We see a multiyear runway for attractive earnings growth and slightly faster dividend growth.""Shares of PG&E are up 10% year-to-date and carry a dividend yield of 3.3%.MLPs may have a place in the portfolios of investors with a greater appetite for risk. ""Having a small tactical allocation to MLPs probably makes sense for more aggressive income investors,"" said David Fabian, managing partner of FMD Capital Management. ""Historically, these companies have been turned to by income investors to enhance portfolio yields.""Fabian cautions investors against becoming overcommitted to MLPs. ""In my experience and in talking to various income investors, when people get into trouble is when they have too much of one thing in their portfolio,"" he said. ""When people start putting 20%, 30% or 40% of their portfolios in MLPs, they are overweighting their portfolios toward an asset class that can have a high degree of volatility.""The direction of oil and natural gas prices has been a major source of the volatility that Fabian references. ""MLPs are going to be highly correlated to what is happening in the commodity space,"" he said. ""Income investors need to be very cognizant of that risk.""Fabian emphasizes the significance of cost basis in buying MLPs. ""You have to be very tactical about when you purchase them,"" he said. ""If you want to purchase a full position in MLPs, maybe you break it up into two or three trades so you can average your way into it.""Choosing between an ETF or individual MLPs is also an important consideration. ""I typically recommend that investors purchase a diversified basket of MLPs through a vehicle like the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) or something similar,"" Fabian said. ""You get highly transparent and very liquid access to the sector. There are probably 10 ETFs or ETNs that are very viable investment vehicles to be able to play the space.""AMLP, which is up 2.2% for the year, has 27 holdings and a yield of 8.4%.

37,PCG,"Whatever Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk reveals in the coming week about building an electric-car battery factory, it's sure to fuel speculation about where Tesla can go with it, and one other thing: round-the-clock solar power.

38,PCG,"Synergies between Tesla and cousin company SolarCity (SCTY) don't end with Musk.
"
39,PCG,"Tesla already has started making some battery packs for SolarCity. More insights on synergies might come out when SolarCity reports its Q4 earnings after the close Monday. And more clues could emerge from the ""Tesla Gigafactory"" conference call that Musk plans in the coming week.
"
40,PCG,"Besides being CEO of Tesla, Musk is chairman and a major shareholder at SolarCity, where his cousin is CEO. Musk also helms privately held commercial space flight company SpaceX.
"
41,PCG,"Luxury electric-car maker Tesla needs more batteries than it can get in order to eventually build an electric car at prices that would compete with the mainstream BMW 3 Series and Audi A4, by Volkswagen (VLKAY).
"
42,PCG,"Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo bottom-lined it this way in a research note Tuesday: ""The launch of low-cost Gen III vehicles relies on the ability to reduce battery costs. If TSLA is unable to significantly reduce battery costs through economies of scale or technological advances, it may prove challenging to produce vehicles at the $35,000 price point without reductions in performance.""

46,PCG,"Storing Solar Energy
"
47,PCG,"Solar panels on home or business rooftops deliver energy while the sun is shining, but adding what's essentially a big battery can allow the excess to be stored for use during cloudy days or at night — and can also smooth solar's spiky delivery back to the electric grid. Making the battery packs affordable and small enough has proved to be a challenge.
"
48,PCG,"Utility-scale power systems don't use conventional batteries but have started to store energy using molten sand and other approaches.
"
49,PCG,"Regarding Tesla's battery factory plans and SolarCity, Kallo told IBD: ""I do think they're building out capacity with that in mind — Elon is chairman of and has sizable interest in SolarCity, so I think that will play an important part in offtake of the battery factory.""
"
50,PCG,"He says SolarCity will ultimately benefit, ""but Tesla will benefit the most.""
"
51,PCG,"""They have the technology and IP (intellectual property) around the battery chemistry,"" Kallo said. But ""we're still a couple years from it making a big difference.""
"
52,PCG,"Analysts expect Tesla's current lithium ion battery partner Panasonic will play a role in the factory. And after word about Tesla talks with Apple (AAPL) surfaced recently, analyst Kallo told IBD that Apple could conceivably be an additional user of batteries made at the plant.
"
53,PCG,"While the Tesla Gigafactory would chiefly serve Tesla, Musk clearly also is focused on supplying SolarCity.
"
54,PCG,"That company's CEO, Lyndon Rive, told IBD in September that ""a couple hundred"" Tesla-aided solar systems were being deployed — mostly in California — with what is called the DemandLogic power storage system. In December the plan went formal, as SolarCity introduced an energy storage plan for business customers.
"
55,PCG,"Besides storing energy, on a nothing-down service plan that aims to trim power bills, SolarCity touts the DemandLogic system, with Tesla battery technology, as a way to ""power IT functions, security systems, cash registers and other critical business systems during power outages."" The systems were first being made available in parts of California served by Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) and Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison.
"
56,PCG,"SolarCity, to be sure, isn't the only provider of distributed solar energy systems to get into storage. Rivals also are exploring how different battery technologies can be of use. SunPower (SPWR) CEO Tom Werner told IBD in an interview last month that energy storage ""is one of the most important components of our strategy going forward.""
"
57,PCG,"Tesla, SolarCity and SunPower are among only 15 companies with market cap of at least $1 billion that saw their stocks rise more than 300% in 2013.
"
58,PCG,"French energy company Total is solar panel maker SunPower's majority shareholder and has investments in energy storage approaches. SunPower has three storage pilot projects under way in California, Australia and Germany.

61,PCG,"""Think of combining a (solar energy system) lease with storage with one more element, energy management, and you can say to a consumer, 'You're close to controlling your own energy cost.' The short version is you can start to take control of your energy bill. You can take energy from the peak of day and use it at some other time,"" such as for maybe a four-hour stretch, not infinitely.
"
62,PCG,"Other solar firms are tinkering with storage for rooftop systems, too.
"
63,PCG,"Most are smaller outfits, and two are Sunverge Energy and Greensmith Energy Management Systems, says Haresh Kamath, program manager for energy storage at the Electric Power Research Institute. Though, he says, ""those guys — SolarCity and Tesla — account for the vast majority of applications for the (California) Self-Generation Incentive Program, which is how a lot of these systems are paid for.""
"
64,PCG,"The program cites an incentive level of $1.62 per watt for advanced energy storage projects.
"
65,PCG,"Kamath says that with economies of scale and advances along the learning curve, the pre-incentive cost of solar energy storage systems has come down.
"
66,PCG,"It varies a lot, but the cost to an installer (not a cost the end customer would see) has been cited as low as $2 a watt for a two-hour battery — so about $10,000 for a 5-kilowatt residential or small-business set-up.
"
67,PCG,"""It used to be something like $4 a watt, and in some cases $8 a watt in 2010 and 2011,"" Kamath said. ""We expect it to fall by another factor of two in the next two years ... people are learning how to make these things more inexpensively.""

71,PCG,"While Tesla explores ways to make the most of its battery expertise and plans, Musk told analysts on Wednesday that the Gigafactory ""is really there to support the volume of the third-generation car"" that Tesla plans.
"
72,PCG,"But ""applications abound"" for Tesla-produced battery technology, Dougherty & Co. analyst Andrea James said in a research note Feb. 14. Those applications include ""use in grid storage, military operations, and unmanned aerial vehicles,"" she said. ""As the biggest buyer and producer of cylindrical lithium ion battery cells, which are chemically optimized for automotive use, Tesla also gets the first shot at new technology.""
"
73,PCG,"The company also gets a chance to lower costs.
"
74,PCG,"""There should be a cost benefit for Tesla to produce its own batteries,"" James wrote. ""It is unclear to us just how much, but we estimate it could be as high as 8 cents per watt-hour, which would lower Tesla's cost per kilowatt-hour on its battery pack to about $180.""
"
75,PCG,"Tesla's agreement with Panasonic lets it take delivery of at least 1.8 billion lithium-ion cells over four years, James points out, which would allow Tesla to produce a minimum of 64,000 vehicles a year at 7,000 cells per vehicle.
"
76,PCG,"Tesla says it expects to deliver over 35,000 vehicles this year, up from 22,477 in 2013.Whatever Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk reveals in the coming week about building an electric-car battery factory, it's sure to fuel speculation about where Tesla can go with it, and one other thing: round-the-clock solar power.Synergies between Tesla and cousin company SolarCity (SCTY) don't end with Musk.Tesla already has started making some battery packs for SolarCity. More insights on synergies might come out when SolarCity reports its Q4 earnings after the close Monday. And more clues could emerge from the ""Tesla Gigafactory"" conference call that Musk plans in the coming week.Besides being CEO of Tesla, Musk is chairman and a major shareholder at SolarCity, where his cousin is CEO. Musk also helms privately held commercial space flight company SpaceX.Luxury electric-car maker Tesla needs more batteries than it can get in order to eventually build an electric car at prices that would compete with the mainstream BMW 3 Series and Audi A4, by Volkswagen (VLKAY).Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo bottom-lined it this way in a research note Tuesday: ""The launch of low-cost Gen III vehicles relies on the ability to reduce battery costs. If TSLA is unable to significantly reduce battery costs through economies of scale or technological advances, it may prove challenging to produce vehicles at the $35,000 price point without reductions in performance.""Tesla agrees. Musk closed his Q4 shareholder letter on Wednesday with a tease about the planned battery factory and its ramifications for home-and-business solar installer SolarCity.""Very shortly, we will be ready to share more information about the Tesla Gigafactory,"" he said. ""This will allow us to achieve a major reduction in the cost of our battery packs and accelerate the pace of battery innovation. Working in partnership with our suppliers, we plan to integrate precursor material, cell, module and pack production into one facility.""With this facility, we feel highly confident of being able to create a compelling and affordable electric car in approximately three years,"" he continued. ""This will also allow us to address the solar power industry's need for a massive volume of stationary battery packs.""Storing Solar EnergySolar panels on home or business rooftops deliver energy while the sun is shining, but adding what's essentially a big battery can allow the excess to be stored for use during cloudy days or at night — and can also smooth solar's spiky delivery back to the electric grid. Making the battery packs affordable and small enough has proved to be a challenge.Utility-scale power systems don't use conventional batteries but have started to store energy using molten sand and other approaches.Regarding Tesla's battery factory plans and SolarCity, Kallo told IBD: ""I do think they're building out capacity with that in mind — Elon is chairman of and has sizable interest in SolarCity, so I think that will play an important part in offtake of the battery factory.""He says SolarCity will ultimately benefit, ""but Tesla will benefit the most.""""They have the technology and IP (intellectual property) around the battery chemistry,"" Kallo said. But ""we're still a couple years from it making a big difference.""Analysts expect Tesla's current lithium ion battery partner Panasonic will play a role in the factory. And after word about Tesla talks with Apple (AAPL) surfaced recently, analyst Kallo told IBD that Apple could conceivably be an additional user of batteries made at the plant.While the Tesla Gigafactory would chiefly serve Tesla, Musk clearly also is focused on supplying SolarCity.That company's CEO, Lyndon Rive, told IBD in September that ""a couple hundred"" Tesla-aided solar systems were being deployed — mostly in California — with what is called the DemandLogic power storage system. In December the plan went formal, as SolarCity introduced an energy storage plan for business customers.Besides storing energy, on a nothing-down service plan that aims to trim power bills, SolarCity touts the DemandLogic system, with Tesla battery technology, as a way to ""power IT functions, security systems, cash registers and other critical business systems during power outages."" The systems were first being made available in parts of California served by Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) and Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison.SolarCity, to be sure, isn't the only provider of distributed solar energy systems to get into storage. Rivals also are exploring how different battery technologies can be of use. SunPower (SPWR) CEO Tom Werner told IBD in an interview last month that energy storage ""is one of the most important components of our strategy going forward.""Tesla, SolarCity and SunPower are among only 15 companies with market cap of at least $1 billion that saw their stocks rise more than 300% in 2013.French energy company Total is solar panel maker SunPower's majority shareholder and has investments in energy storage approaches. SunPower has three storage pilot projects under way in California, Australia and Germany.""It's good to have options,"" Werner said. ""We will be selling storage this year, tied to our 'energy services' offering.Controlling Your Own Cost""Think of combining a (solar energy system) lease with storage with one more element, energy management, and you can say to a consumer, 'You're close to controlling your own energy cost.' The short version is you can start to take control of your energy bill. You can take energy from the peak of day and use it at some other time,"" such as for maybe a four-hour stretch, not infinitely.Other solar firms are tinkering with storage for rooftop systems, too.Most are smaller outfits, and two are Sunverge Energy and Greensmith Energy Management Systems, says Haresh Kamath, program manager for energy storage at the Electric Power Research Institute. Though, he says, ""those guys — SolarCity and Tesla — account for the vast majority of applications for the (California) Self-Generation Incentive Program, which is how a lot of these systems are paid for.""The program cites an incentive level of $1.62 per watt for advanced energy storage projects.Kamath says that with economies of scale and advances along the learning curve, the pre-incentive cost of solar energy storage systems has come down.It varies a lot, but the cost to an installer (not a cost the end customer would see) has been cited as low as $2 a watt for a two-hour battery — so about $10,000 for a 5-kilowatt residential or small-business set-up.""It used to be something like $4 a watt, and in some cases $8 a watt in 2010 and 2011,"" Kamath said. ""We expect it to fall by another factor of two in the next two years ... people are learning how to make these things more inexpensively.""Solar Acceleration CenterXcel Energy (XEL) and the Electric Power Research Institute have teamed to research battery-based energy storage projects at the Solar Technology Acceleration Center in Aurora, Colo.The projects aim to gauge the value of the approach. One outfits a model solar neighborhood with a 25-kw/50-kilowatt-hour sodium nickel chloride system made by Fiamm SoNick. The other project for larger applications evaluates a 1.5-megawatt/1.0-megawatt-hour advanced lead-acid system made by Xtreme Power.While Tesla explores ways to make the most of its battery expertise and plans, Musk told analysts on Wednesday that the Gigafactory ""is really there to support the volume of the third-generation car"" that Tesla plans.But ""applications abound"" for Tesla-produced battery technology, Dougherty & Co. analyst Andrea James said in a research note Feb. 14.

170,PCG,"PG&E Corporation’s (PCG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), sought approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) for four energy storage projects. The projects will have a combined capacity of 567 megawatts (MW).If approved, the first one of this storage is expected to come online by end of 2019 and the rest will be operational by 2020.Importance of Battery StorageThe trend of storing energy is gradually finding recognition. Energy storage helps to increase the resilience of the grid and enable companies to cater to higher demand during lower production of electricity. Excess energy produced from renewable sources are generally stored in the battery and are used during high demand, which lessens the production of electricity from fossil fuel.  Unlike the fossil fuel, alternate energy sources are dependent on weather conditions that make storage of energy essential. Battery storage lowers emission as it cuts dependence on fossil fuel-based production.Increasing Usage of Battery Storage in Utility SpacePer the release by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), at the end of 2017, 708 MW of power capacity which represents 867 MWh of energy capacity of large-scale, battery storage capacity was in utilization. The number of large-scale batteries, based on lithium-ion chemistries, is 80%. PG&E’s three third-party owned projects are also lithium-ion battery projects.Utilities are shifting to renewables through the replacement of coal by natural gas and clean energy, realizing the need of emission less environment. Large utilities like NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and National Grid plc (NGG  -  Free Report) investing in battery storage projects. We expect more battery storage units to be installed across the United States, considering higher production of electricity from renewable sources.Zacks Rank & Price MovementPG&E carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

171,PCG,"Investors in PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 29, 2018 $42.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for PG&E shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, PG&E is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Bottom 39% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has increased from 96 cents per share to 97 cents.Given the way analysts feel about PG&E right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

174,PCG,"The Q2 earnings season is gradually unfolding. As of Jul 25, 128 S&P 500 members came up with earnings results. Total earnings for these companies are up 7.0% from the same period last year on 4.2% higher revenues. 77.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.3% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (97 members till Jul 21) with the remaining 403 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.6% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.9% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Five out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season. Read more details in our weekly Earnings Outlook.Let’s take a look at a few utilities that are scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Jul 27.FirstEnergy Corporation (FE  -  Free Report) reported a positive earnings surprise of 9.86% in the previous quarter.

177,PCG,"First Solar, Inc. (FSLR  -  Free Report) recently sold a 40 Megawatt (MW) alternative current (ac) Cuyama Solar Project to D. E. Shaw Renewable Investments, L.L.C. (DESRI) affiliate. The project, developed by First Solar is located in Santa Barbara County, CA, and currently in its construction phase.However, other terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Details of the DealThe aforementioned project, one of its first utility-scale solar project in Santa Barbara County – is expected to generate enough electricity to power over 16,000 homes in California and help reduce greenhouse gas CO2 emissions by 30,000 metric tons each year. Power from the project is to be supplied to Pacific Gas & Electric Company (PG&E), a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) expected to commence January 2019.Road to Future is through Clean EnergyFirst Solar’s product innovation efforts and PV generation solutions are attracting customers to avail cheap and affordable solar electricity to power their houses. As such, the company has to its credits two world records for cadmium telluride (“CdTe”) PV efficiency, achieving cell efficiency of 22.1% and a full area module efficiency of 18.2%. This increased efficiency of solar modules and focus on technological innovations has given the company a competitive edge over its peers.First Solar has clean energy solar installations of over 10 gigawatts (GW) globally. Notably, 40% of these installations are centered in North America, making it the largest market for its clean energy solution. However, the company is slowly diversifying its geographic mix with expansions in Middle East, Australia, Japan and India.First Solar has been trying to fortify its presence in India through an array of projects to support India’s plan of adding over 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022. Further, continual installation and development activities are the primary catalysts that provide it the edge over its peers namely ReneSola (SOL  -  Free Report), and JinkoSolar Holding Co., Ltd. (JKS  -  Free Report) that already have a strong customer base in India.However, the company continues to venture into countries like France, Israel, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Philippines through several project acquisitions and technological initiatives.Price MovementShares of First Solar have increased 27.3% year to date compared with the industry’s gain of 4%.Such outperformance was driven by a substantial rise in demand for clean and affordable solar energy. Further, it can be attributable to the company’s continuous focus on retaining its competitive edge by developing new technologies and PV Solutions.Zacks RankFirst Solar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

182,PCG,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27. Going by the positive trends, the first quarter is poised to record the strongest earnings and revenue growth in seven years. Earnings for the S&P 500 members that have already reported are up 25.1% from the same period last year on 10.0% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% beat EPS estimates and 73.8% surpassed revenue expectations.Per our latest Earnings Preview report, overall earnings in the first quarter for all the S&P 500 members are expected to be up 22.6% on 8.4% growth in revenues.Amid the positive earnings outlook for the first quarter, let’s concentrate on the domestic-focused matured Zacks Utility sector. This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Auto, Tires and Trucks sector is likely to register an earnings decline.Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generation plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and encouraging investors for efficient usage of electricity.  Rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks have also accommodated the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed has now raised rates six times (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at some Utility stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 3 and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.58% in the last reported quarter.

Earnings were also down 52.6% from $1.33 reported in the year-ago quarter.The downside in adjusted earnings was caused by the timing of the 2015 GT&S rate case, which delayed recognition of the full 2016 revenue increase until the fourth quarter of 2016.GAAP earnings during the quarter were 22 cents per share, compared with $1.36 a year ago.For 2017, the company reported adjusted operating earnings per share of $3.68 that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.69 by a penny.

185,PCG,"PG&E Corporation’s (PCG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) recently announced its five-year sustainability plan that aims at reduction of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from the company’s operations by 1 million tons, through 2022. This newly set goal promotes the company’s progress toward creating a sustainable energy future.A Brief Note on the Five-Year GoalIn particular, the five-year plan, known as the Million Ton Challenge, aims at reducing methane emissions from natural gas operations, increasing clean vehicles and fuels, adopting environmentally responsible products with focus on electric substation equipment, and making the existing facilities more energy efficient and sustainable.By a reduction of 10% in the greenhouse-gas emissions, the company successfully extends its ongoing sustainability efforts and continues to provide safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy options to its customers.Initiatives Undertaken Toward Goal AchievementCalifornia has mandated the state-based energy companies to reach 33% of retail electric deliveries from eligible renewable sources by the end of 2017 to 2020. PG&E Corporation already achieved the mandated target in 2017 when 33.1% of its electricity came from renewable resources. Furthermore, in the same year, nearly 80% of total electricity provided by the company came from carbon-free sources.Such achievements, along with the latest planned initiatives, should definitely pave the way for PG&E Corporation in reducing a million ton of greenhouse-gas emission by 2022.To further promote clean energy adoption, the company has increased its focus toward the adoption of electric vehicle (EV) to support clean transportation in California, via its targeted EV programs. In this context, PG&E Corporation plans on installing 7,500 EV chargers at various locations across Northern and Central California, through its EV Charge Network program.Looking ahead, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act has mandated electric utilities to deliver 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of 2028 to 2030, increasing the 33% mandate. Considering the new policy, we may expect to witness similar initiatives from PG&E Corporation, in terms of further reduction of its GHG emissions, over the long run.Price MovementPG&E Corporation’s shares have lost 34% in the last 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%.

192,PCG,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 9, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 19.15%. Moreover, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 14.71%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. PG&E Corp is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it has the right combination.Zacks ESP: PG&E Corp has an Earnings ESP of +0.48%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PG&E Corp currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayPG&E Corp has a solid portfolio of regulated utility assets that provide a stable earnings base and poise the company for long-term growth.During third-quarter earnings call, the company announced that it expects to gain 5 cents in rate base earnings during fourth-quarter 2017 and a total of 20 cents in the full year. However, general rate case revenues were adjusted in 2017, resulting in a loss of incremental tax repair benefits of roughly 25 cents annually. This is likely to impact PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter earnings.Moreover, the massive California wildfire that occurred last October is expected to weigh on PG&E Corp’s upcoming results. In fact, in December 2017, the company announced suspension of its dividend, citing uncertainty regarding its liability in the deadly California wildfires (per a CNBC report).To this end, almost 100 lawsuits have been filed against PG&E Corp for allegedly sparking wildfires in Northern California throughout October. With the Insurance Commission claiming damage worth $9.4 billion, there remains a fair chance that PG&E Corp might have to bear a part of that cost, if the results from the pending lawsuits go against the company.As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter earnings of 69 cents reflects a 48.1% year-over-year plunge.Earlier, PG&E Corp announced that it expects to incur insurance costs and legal expenses of $100 million in 2017, owing to the California wildfires. We may expect further updates related to this expense once the company releases fourth-quarter results.PG&E Corp’s fourth-quarter business was favorably impacted by warmer-than-average temperature which prevailed in most parts of California. This led to increased electricity demand, which in turn is expected to boost the company’s fourth-quarter revenues.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E Corp’s revenues is pegged at $4.83 billion, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year increase. Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

194,PCG,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell.The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 8.70% in the last reported quarter. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 11.76%.Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise | Pacific Gas & Electric Co. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayPG&E incurred costs of $219 million in 2017 for service restoration and repairs to its facilities due to widespread wildfires that ravaged major parts of Northern California in October. These costs are likely to weigh on the company’s first-quarter 2018 results, if the company’s requests for cost recovery are not approved.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PG&E’s first-quarter earnings of $1.03 per share reflects a year-over-year decline of 2.8%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.23 billion, reflecting a 0.8% year-over-year decrease.The company anticipates reducing revenue requirement by $500 million in 2018 stemming from the lower corporate tax rate. This is expected to effectively impact its results from this year. To that end, we may expect its first-quarter results to reflect a partial impact of the reduced revenue requirement.Warmer-than-normal winter in PG&E’s service territory is expected to reduce electricity demand which in turn is likely to hurt the company’s quarterly revenues.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that PG&E is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

202,PCG,"PG&E Corporation (PCG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 27, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 27.71%. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 3.38%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PG&E Corp is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: PG&E Corp has an Earnings ESP of +5.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 83 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents.

Price and EPS Surprise Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Price and EPS Surprise | Pacific Gas & Electric Co. QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?PG&E Corp boasts a solid portfolio of regulated utility assets that offer a stable earnings base and substantial long-term growth potential.In early 2017, the company projected to save $300 million in cost-efficiency measures for 2017. Through the year, management expects the company to remain on track for achieving the target of offering affordable service to its customers. We may expect the soon-to-be released second-quarter results to duly reflect PG&E Corp’s progress in this initiative.On the flip side, to comply with the new gas-storage regulations, the company will need to invest more capital in its system. This, in turn, may get reflected in increased expenditure for the company’s second-quarter results and beyond.Lately, PG&E Corp has been engaged in investing heftily to modernize and upgrade its electric system. As a result, in the first quarter, more than 50 million customer outage minutes could be avoided. Going ahead, its customers are expected to enjoy even greater reliability benefits, as PG&E Corp. continues to install this upgraded technology. Such initiatives may add customers to the company’s portfolio in the second quarter and beyond.The company has hiked its quarterly common stock dividend by 4 cents to 53 cents per share, beginning with the to-be-reported quarter. On an annual basis, this has led to a dividend increase of 8%, from $1.96 to $2.12 per share. It indicates a stable financial position for the company, which, in turn, allows it to pay regular dividends. The decision can also be considered as a step toward achieving its target of attaining a payout ratio of 55–65% and about 60% by 2019.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 79 cents, reflecting a 19.70% year-over-year improvement. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $4.33 billion, reflecting a 3.96% year-over-year increase.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the Utility space worth considering on the basis of our model which shows that they have the right combination to pull off a beat.The AES Corp.

203,PCG,"Sales growth is an important measure for any company, as it is vital to growth projections and strategic decision making. By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods, one can clearly understand a company’s growth trend.Sales growth is essential to justify the expenses incurred to operate a business. Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and dismal financial performance. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but cannot generate enough growth to attract new investors.Also, in a growing economy, lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors. In simple terms, without impressive sales growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term.Further, it's worth keeping in mind that when companies incur a loss, albeit transitorily, they are valued on their revenues, as sales growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company's future earnings performance.Hence, the Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation. This metric's importance lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales unlike earnings.Focusing alone on sales growth is, however, not desirable. Considering a company's cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Picking the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.
