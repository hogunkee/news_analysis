0,ALLE,"Investors looking for stocks in the Security and Safety Services sector might want to consider either Johnson Controls (JCI  -  Free Report) or Allegion (ALLE  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Johnson Controls is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Allegion has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that JCI has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.JCI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 12.33, while ALLE has a forward P/E of 17.17. We also note that JCI has a PEG ratio of 1.12. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ALLE currently has a PEG ratio of 1.34.Another notable valuation metric for JCI is its P/B ratio of 1.47. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ALLE has a P/B of 15.83.These metrics, and several others, help JCI earn a Value grade of B, while ALLE has been given a Value grade of C.JCI sticks out from ALLE in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that JCI is the better option right now.

1,ALLE,"Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) recently completed two acquisitions through its subsidiaries, including Door and Access Systems business of GWA Group Limited, and ISONAS Security Systems Inc. While the Door and Access Systems buyout is worth AUD 107 million — funded through cash in hands and funds available through revolving credit facility, the financial terms of the ISONAS buyout was not disclosed by the company.The deal to acquire GWA Group’s Door and Access Systems business was originally announced in May 2018 while that of ISONAS was communicated in June. Detail of BuyoutsThe buyout of the Door and Access Systems business of GWA Group has added two leading Australian brands — API Locksmiths and Gainsborough — to Allegion’s product portfolio. API Locksmiths branded products are used in commercial markets while Gainsborough products are meant for use in the residential market.This buyout will strengthen Allegion’s foothold in Australia, thereby expanding the company’s presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Also, it will boost the company’s revenue generation capabilities, evident from AUD 95-million sales recorded in 2017.In 2018, Allegion anticipates slight accretion to adjusted earnings per share from the acquired Door and Access Systems business.Additionally, Allegion has completed acquiring ISONAS. The edge-computing technology provided by ISONAS serves non-residential end markets by providing access control solutions. The Boulder, CO-based firm has a wide customer base, and a strong network of certified committed distributors and integrators. In 2017, ISONAS generated $6 million revenues.The ISONAS buyout will reinforce Allegion’s existing technology portfolio and go together with its channel initiatives. The acquired assets will operate as one of Allegion’s Americas businesses.Snapshot of Allegion’s Inorganic InitiativesWe believe that the above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Allegion’s policy of acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines.Prior to the above-mentioned buyouts, in March 2018, Allegion acquired the manufacturer of high-performance interior and healthcare door systems — Aurora Systems, Inc. (AD Systems). In February 2018, the company purchased Qatar Metal Industries — Middle East-based manufacturer of commercial steel, and wooden doors and frames. In January, the company acquired Technical Glass Products or TGP — North America-based manufacturer of the advanced fire-rated entrance and wall systems — as well as added Hammond Enterprises to its portfolio.It’s worth mentioning here that acquisitions/divestitures had a positive impact of 4.7% on sales growth in first-quarter 2018. On a geographical basis, acquired assets or divestitures lifted sales in the Americas and EMEIA region by 4.7% and 5.6%, respectively.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDespite efforts on improving its business portfolio via acquisitions; labor shortage and ongoing constraint across the construction supply chain are adversely influencing Allegion’s results.

In February, the company acquired one of Middle East’s largest manufacturers of commercial steel and wood doors and frames, Qatar Metal Industries. With the addition of Qatar Metal, Allegion will be able to expand its code-compliant products to include doors in the Middle Eastern market.  In January, Allegion acquired leading North American manufacturer of advanced fire-rated entrance and wall systems, Technical Glass Products or TGP, which is expected to enhance the company’s core product lines.These acquisitions are expected to prove accretive to Allegion’s earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Let us delve into other factors that might impact Q1 results.Strong Americas BusinessOut of the three reportable segments, Allegion’s Americas segment has been witnessing strong growth for quite some time. Accounting for about 73% of total revenues, the segment’s revenues increased 7.4% in 2017 driven by favorable price and strength in electronic product. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Focused investments toward channel segmentation and product innovation will continue to boost the segment. The company expects segment revenues in the 10-11% range in 2018.Innovative Products Drives DemandProduct innovation led to an increase in demand, thereby driving revenues. Allegion consistently updates its products and develops new ones to keep up with the changing market sentiment toward electronic security products and solutions. It is also trying to chalk out channel strategies and gain enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. These initiatives are expected to contribute to first quarter revenues.In spite of various investments, the company’s margins continued to increase, expanding 140 basis points (bps) in 2017. The upside was driven by solid price performance, volume leverage and productivity, which offset negative impacts from increased investments and inflation. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 84 cents, reflecting a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is estimated at $606.9 million, implying a year-over-year rise of 10.6%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts —Allegion does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Allegion is 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allegion carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, ESP of 0.00% makes earnings prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Allegion PLC Quote Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Zacks Industrial Products sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alarm.com Holdings, Inc.

11,ALLE,"Investors seeking strong returns may allocate their assets in stocks with favorable liquidity positions. Liquidity is an important yardstick that indicates a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into cash.A company with a favorable liquidity position has the potential to provide higher returns as liquidity drives growth. However, one should be cautious before investing in liquid stocks. While a high liquidity level may mean that the company is meeting its obligations at a faster rate compared to others in its domain, it may also indicate that the company is failing to use its assets efficiently.Hence, one should consider the efficiency level of a company in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners as this combination is indicative of underlying financial strength.Measures to Identify Liquid StocksCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company’s potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio — also known as working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered ideal.Quick Ratio: Unlike current ratio, quick ratio – also called “acid-test ratio"" or ""quick assets ratio"" – indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable.Cash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a high number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.So, a ratio greater than 1 is desirable at all times but may not always appropriately represent a company’s financial condition.Screening ParametersIn order to pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential, we have added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen.Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)Asset utilization greater than industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Growth Style Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 handily beat other stocks.)These criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only seven.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screen:Headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, Applied Materials Inc.

In 2017, acquisitions contributed 1.4% to revenue growth of 7.6%. The security products industry is highly fragmented, particularly in developing markets and involves the use of emerging products that employ latest technologies.

In March 2018, Allegion acquired manufacturer of high-performance interior and healthcare door systems — Aurora Systems. In February, the company acquired Qatar Metal Industries which is expected to expand its code-compliant products to include doors in the Middle Eastern market.  In January, Allegion acquired Technical Glass Products, which is expected to enhance the company’s core product lines.Also, Allegion’s unwavering focus on innovation and investments in product development has effective.

15,ALLE,"TriMas Corporation (TRS  -  Free Report) remains well poised for growth backed by its focus on leveraging the TriMas Business Model, segment restructuring and a booming Aerospace segment. A positive trend in estimate revisions also reflects optimism over the company’s prospects. However, currency volatility and escalating steel prices remain headwinds.The maker of engineered and applied products, with a market capitalization of approximately $1.13 billion, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 5%.Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring TriMasNorthbound EstimatesOver the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and the current quarter has moved up around 5.6% and 11.8%, respectively.Value Growth Momentum (VGM) ScoreTriMas currently has a Zacks VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryTriMas surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.78%Price PerformanceTriMas has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has appreciated around 18.2% while the industry has recorded growth of 0.5% during the same time frame.Return on Assets (ROA)TriMas currently has a ROA of 6.1% while the industry's ROA is 3.2%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets.Growth Drivers in PlaceTriMas will gain from its continuous focus on leveraging the TriMas Business Model. Its innovative solutions through product, process or service, as well as extensive resources will help strengthen business.Further, the company remains focused on realignment actions and improvement of cost structure. Accordingly, TriMas will combine the company’s Engineered Components and Energy segments into a single reporting segment — Specialty Products. The company will report results under the new segment structure from first-quarter 2018. TriMas expects the new segment to attain sales growth of nearly 5% in 2018.Moreover, its Aerospace segment benefitted in 2017 from increased production throughput and deliveries as well as solid order demand. Recently, TriMas’ Monogram Aerospace Fasteners business was awarded a 2017 Supply Chain & Quality Improvement award by Airbus due to its significant efforts to improve quality and on-time delivery, and commitment to deliver outstanding service to customers. Thus, the company continues to see more stable order patterns from customers, which will result in further opportunities for improved manufacturing efficiencies over time.HeadwindsA stronger dollar makes TriMas’ product exports more difficult and translation impacts also hamper the company’s packaging and energy businesses sales in Europe and the U.K. Thus, strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies will affect the company’s performance.In addition, steel being the main input material to produce high-pressure cylinders, escalation in its prices has been denting TriMas’ Norris business. Steel prices will continue flaring up through the first and second quarters of 2018 due to seasonal demand. The company expects prices to remain higher on average than the prior year.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Allegion PLC (ALLE  -  Free Report), AptarGroup, Inc.

16,ALLE,"Just before the occasion of Saint Patrick's Day, which honors Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, the country has one more reason to celebrate. The economy expanded 7.8% in 2017, up from 5.2% in 2016, according to preliminary estimates from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The figure came in stark contrast to 14.8% decline in 2010.Personal Consumption Expenditure in Ireland grew 1.9%, which alleviates worries regarding subdued inflation. Consumer spending on goods rose 4.6% while industrial output jumped 8.9%. However, growth was mainly driven by the all-important ICT sector which marked a substantial 16.8% growth. Ireland has remarkably lowered its debt-to-GDP ratio from 89.4% in 2013 to just 66% in 2016.Employment grew 3.1% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is just 12,000 jobs short of the all-time employment high. The employment rate nudged up to 68.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 67.1% in the year-ago quarter and was at the highest level since the second quarter of 2008.With this, the country became the European Union's fastest-growing economy for four successive years. Notably, the Eurozone growth rate was 2.3% last year. Several economists are bullish on the Irish economy, thanks to solid jobs data, strong consumer spending and a pickup in global growth (read: Will ECB Exit QE After September? ETFs to Gain).However, the CSO issued a warning that the headline rate was “distorted by the activities of multinationals and could not be relied upon as an accurate gauge of activity. Instead, it pointed to a 3.9 per cent increase in “modified” domestic demand, which strips out the impact of aircraft leasing and intellectual property imports, as a more reliable indicator.”Notably, gross national product (GNP), which eliminates cross-border flows by multinationals, grew 6.6%. Against this backdrop, a look at some top-ranked Irish stocks makes sense.Allegion Plc (ALLE  -  Free Report)The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company operates as a provider of security solutions for homes and businesses.

17,ALLE,"We issued an updated research report on Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) on Mar 6. Strengthening segmental business, focus on acquisition, and product development and healthy rewards to shareholders will work in its favor. However, industry competition, and rising costs and expenses remain prime concerns.The company, with a market capitalization of approximately $9.5 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below, we have briefly discussed the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring Fortune BrandsSolid Business Portfolio: A well-diversified business structure has given Fortune Brands a competitive edge over some players in the industry. The company currently operates through four business segments — Cabinets, Plumbing, Doors and Security — largely minimizing its risks of loss from the poor performance of any group. Also, a vast customer base in various end markets is a boon.In 2018, the company anticipates Cabinets sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range. Sales in the Doors segment are estimated to increase in the high-single-digit to low-double-digits on the back of new products and retail expansion. Security sales are predicted to increase in mid-single digit. Growth opportunities are bright in international and commercial markets. Plumbing segment is likely to benefit from new brand additions in the Global Plumbing Group.Impressive Top- and Bottom-Line View for 2018: Fortune Brands delivered better-than-expected results in the last quarter of 2017, pulling off a positive 1.3% earnings surprise. The outlook for 2018 also looks bright, with positive momentum in the U.S. housing market anticipated to be the prime driving catalyst. The Home products market in the country is projected to grow 5-7% in the year, while the global market is expected to be up 5-6%.Fortune Brands anticipates its sales growth to be in the band of 6-7% in 2018, while earnings (before charges/gains) are projected to be in the range of $3.54-$3.66 per share. The bottom line forecast reflects 17% mid-point growth over the year-ago figure and it includes the positive impact of lower taxes for corporates.These positive sentiments are clearly reflected in the positive revisions in earnings estimates for the stock. In the last 60 days, seven brokerage firms have raised estimates for 2018, while three firms have increased estimates for 2019. Currently, the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.63 for 2018 and $4.04 for 2019, representing growth of 4.6% and 4.7% from their respective tallies 60 days ago.Capital Allocation Strategies: Fortune Brands follows sound capital allocation strategies, under which it makes meaningful acquisitions for business expansion, invests for the development of new products and the improvement of services, and rewards shareholders handsomely.Brands like Shaws of England and Victoria + Albert were acquired by the company in 2017. These assets are anticipated to generate combined revenues of $45 million annually. Also, the company remains on track to generate roughly $2.5 billion revenues from its Plumbing business by 2020.In addition, the company is committed toward returning value to shareholders. In 2017, the company used $214.8 million to purchase treasury stocks, while paid dividends of $110.3 million. In December 2017, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 11% and also announced a $250 million share buyback program.Factors Working Against Fortune BrandsShare Price Performance and Poor Valuation: Last month, Fortune Brands’ shares have declined 0.4%, underperforming 2% growth recorded by the industry.Also, on a P/E (TTM) basis, the company’s shares look overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 20.2x and 13.7x in the last month. This makes us cautious about the stock.Rising Costs & Expenses, Huge Debts Raise Concerns: Fortune Brands is exposed to risks emanating from rise in costs and expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2017, its cost of sales before charges/gains grew 7% year over year while selling, administrative, and research and development expenses before charges/gains increased 3.1%. Also, its long-term debt was approximately $1.5 billion while exiting the quarter. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses, and huge debt levels can be detrimental to the company’s profitability in the quarters ahead.Threat From International Expansion & Industry Competition: Expansion of business in international arenas has exposed Fortune Brands to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact the company’s businesses.Moreover, the company faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services, apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market, might hurt the company’s competitive edge.Some key players in the industry are Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report), Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. (ALRM  -  Free Report) and Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report). While Allegion sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Alarm.com Holdings and Brady carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

21,ALLE,"Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) will release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after market close.Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 80%. However, in the trailing four quarters, the company recorded an average positive surprise of 15.61%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAxon Enterprise is a renowned supplier of smart weapons and body-worn video cameras in the security and public safety space. Keeping with this trend, the company won a number of orders for its smart weapons from various police departments in the fourth quarter of 2017. Some of the company’s notable buyers in the fourth quarter include Arkansas State Police, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, North Carolina State Highway Patrol, North Las Vegas Police Department and more than a dozen of State Police Departments along with a few Federal agencies. Such a massive rise in orders is expected to boost sales.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $87.9 million, reflecting 7.1% annual improvement. Moreover, during the third-quarter earnings call, management at Axon Enterprise raised its sales growth expectation for 2017 from the range of 15-20% to 25%. This indicates solid sales growth in the fourth quarter as well.On the flip side, higher operating expenses have been weighing on the bottom line. Notably, management expects Axon Enterprise to incur $1 million in costs during the fourth quarter in relation to its migration from Amazon Web services to Microsoft Azure's governing cloud. Overall, the company’s fourth-quarter operating expenses are expected to rise 5-8% sequentially.Thus, we may expect Axon Enterprise’s upcoming results to reflect signs of deterioration in its bottom line. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter loss stands at 3 cents, representing a 125% year-over-year plunge.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Axon Enterprise this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, Axon Enterprise lacks both these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Axon Enterprise carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the power of surprise prediction. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Axon Enterprise, Inc.

25,ALLE,"Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered in-line earnings. Notably, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 2.48%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming quarterly release.Factors at PlayAcquisition is an important part of the company’s growth strategy.  During the first nine months of 2017, acquisitions contributed 1.6% to revenue growth of 7%. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well. The company broadens its product portfolio and geographic footprint as well as enhances its position in strategic market segments through buyouts. The acquisition of McKenzie-based Republic Doors & Frames in January 2017 is expected to expand its product line, improve operating efficiency and expand distribution footprint.Also, product innovation has led to an increase in demand, thereby driving revenues. Allegion continuously updates its products and develops new ones to keep up with the changing market sentiment toward electronic security products and solutions. In fact, sales of such electronic security products are growing at nearly twice the rate of their traditional mechanical counterparts. Allegion continues to focus on making incremental investments in organic growth for new product development. It is also trying to chalk out channel strategies and gain enterprise excellence to accelerate core market expansion. These initiatives are expected to contribute to fourth quarter revenues.Out of the three reportable segments, Allegion’s Americas segment has been witnessing strong growth for quite some time now. Accounting for about 75% of total revenues, the segment’s revenues increased 4.4% in the prior quarter driven by favorable price and growth in electronics. Moreover, in the first nine months of 2017, the segment’s revenues increased 7.7%. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.In spite of the various investments made, the company’s margins continued to increase, expanding 60 basis points (bps) in the first nine months of 2017. Adjusted operating margin jumped 30 bps in the prior quarter owing to solid price performance, volume leverage and productivity, which offset negative impacts from unfavorable product mix, increased investments and inflation. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 94 cents, reflecting a 16.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is $609.7 million, implying a year-over-year rise of 7%.Here is what our quantitative model predicts —Allegion has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Allegion is +0.53%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allegion carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Allegion PLC QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Zacks Industrial Products sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc.

The acquisition was made by one of Allegion’s subsidiaries and TGP is expected to operate within its Americas segment. However, financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Buyout BenefitsTGP, which generated approximately $80 million in net sales in the trailing 12 months ended Sep 30, 2017, is expected to drive Allegion’s earnings in 2018.  The addition of TGP’s products along with its focus on institutional and non-residential projects will enhance Allegion’s core business.TGP is also expected to strengthen Allegion’s existing specification writing capabilities. Moreover, Allegion’s complementary solutions will expand its reach in North American and Middle Eastern markets.Meanwhile, TGP’s customers and distributors will gain access to Allegion’s specialty products, hollow metal doors along with frames and premium product offerings.The Larger PictureThe acquisition is in line with Allegion’s plan to expand and grow through buyouts. The security products industry is highly fragmented, particularly in the developing markets, and involves the use of emerging technology products that employ newer technologies. This creates opportunities to broaden the product portfolio as well as geographic footprint. During the first nine months of 2017, acquisitions contributed 1.6% to revenue growth of 7%.The company has made a number of acquisitions over the years. In January 2017, Allegion had acquired McKenzie-based Republic Doors & Frames, Inc. through one of its subsidiaries. The buyout is expected to expand Allegion’s product line, improve operating efficiency and expand distribution footprint. In June 2016, Allegion had taken over Germany-based safety and security provider, Trelock GmbH and related companies.The company will continue to focus on growing its portfolio through acquisitions in the near term.Stock Price MovementAllegion’s shares have gained 23.5% in the past year, compared to 1.2% growth of its industry. However, earnings estimates for 2017 and 2018 remained stable over the past 60 days, limiting upside potential of the stock.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAllegion carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Net 1 UEPS Technologies, Inc. , Lakeland Industries Inc.

30,ALLE,"Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company reported in-line earnings. In the trailing four quarters, the company recorded an average positive surprise of 45.61%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Axon Enterprise is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Axon Enterprise possesses both of these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Axon Enterprise has an Earnings ESP of +12.50%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 6 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Axon Enterprise currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible surprise prediction. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderAxon Enterprise continues to witness strong quarterly demand for its body-worn video cameras. In line with its trend, in the third quarter also, the company won a number of orders for its smart weapons from various police departments. Some of its notable buyers in the to-be-reported quarter include Albuquerque Police Department, California Highway Patrol as well as more than a dozen of State Police Departments. Such order growth is expected to boost the company’s quarterly sales.To that end, during the second-quarter earnings call, the company said that it expects to record 55% higher revenues year over year in the third quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $82.1 million, reflecting 14.2% annual improvement.On the other hand, operating expenses are projected to grow 4-6% sequentially, as the company continues to add customer facing roles, invest in R&D initiatives as well as expand into new international markets. Whereas, a sequential margin improvement is expected as the company projects to incur fewer nonrecurring camera hardware costs, improve hardware pricing, increase Weapons revenue and add users to the Axon platform.Per the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), third-quarter 2017’s firearm background checks dropped 6.8% from the year-ago quarter’s figure, thus indicating a decline in demand for firearms in the soon-to-be reported quarter. This could in turn hurt sales growth for publicly traded gun manufacturers like Axon Enterprise.In the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is expected to reflect a 23.8% year-over-year plunge.Axon Enterprise, Inc.

35,ALLE,"Premium consumer technology company iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017. Though quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same.  Earnings and RevenuesQuarterly adjusted earnings came in at 60 cents per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. However, the bottom line came in lower than the year-ago tally of 70 cents per share.Quarterly revenues came in at nearly $205.4 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $207 million. Nevertheless, the top line came in much ahead of the year-ago tally of $168.6 million.Domestic Consumer business sales in the quarter came in at $87.6 million, up 33.8% year over year. Also, the International Consumer business generated revenues of $117.7 million in the reported quarter, up 14.9% year over year.Total units shipped in the quarter came in at 906,000, up from 779,000 shipped in third-quarter 2016.iRobot Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  iRobot Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | iRobot Corporation QuoteCosts and MarginsCost of sales in the reported quarter was $103 million, up 17.7% year over year. Gross profit margin in the reported quarter came in at 49.8%, expanding 170 basis points (bps) year over year.Total operating expenses were $78.5 million, up 46.4% year over year.

The company also anticipates that deeper market penetration of its premium home robotic products in the U.S. households will likely drive its top-line performance. Henceforth, the company raised its revenue guidance for full-year 2017 from $815-$825 million to $870-$880 million (estimating a year-over-year increment of 33-34%).  Nonetheless, the company trimmed the lower-end of its earnings guidance for 2017, considering the impact of the latest Robopolis acquisition (Oct 2, 2017).

36,ALLE,"Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) — the leading global provider of security products and solutions for business and domestic purposes — is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, the company had delivered a positive 11% earnings surprise. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 1.95%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming quarterly release.Factors at PlayIn the first half of 2017, Allegion witnessed solid growth in its top line. Net revenues in the first half of 2017 were $1.18 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.1%. The Americas segment has been particularly driving the company’s overall revenues. Accounting for 74.5% of total revenues in the first half of 2017, the segment’s revenues increased 9.6%. On an organic basis, the Americas segment recorded first-half 2017 growth of 8% compared with 6.8% a year ago. The continued strength in revenues was driven by favorable price, low double-digit organic growth in residential markets, and solid performance in non-residential markets related to channel initiatives and new products. All these factors are expected to sustain revenue growth in the upcoming quarter as well.Again,  Allegion continues to benefit from its acquisition drive. In fact, in the second quarter of 2017, acquisitions contributed nearly 2%. The company broadens its product portfolio as well as geographic footprint and enhances its position in strategic market segments through buyouts. The acquisition of McKenzie-based Republic Doors & Frames is expected to expand its product line, improve operating efficiency and expand distribution footprint.Moreover, the company revised its 2017 guidance upward during its second-quarter earnings call. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.65-$3.80 versus the prior expectation of $3.60-$3.70. The company expects full-year 2017 revenue growth of 6.5% to 7.5% on a year-over-year basis, higher than 5.5% to 6.5% expected earlier. Organically, revenues are expected in the 6% to 7% range, compared to 5.5% to 6.5% expected earlier.However, we are concerned about economic slowdown in certain pockets of the world where Allegion has considerable presence. Moreover, owing to the company’s substantial international presence, volatile currency translations could prove to be a significant headwind. In fact, in the second quarter of 2017, the company navigated currency headwinds in the EMEIA region through significant acquisitions.Notably, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.02 per share, reflecting a 9.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is at $618.8 million, implying a year-over-year rise of 6.5%.Moving forward, here is what our quantitative model predicts —Allegion does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Allegion is -0.74%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Allegion carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Meanwhile, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Allegion PLC QuoteStocks to ConsiderListed below are a few stocks in the Industrial Products sector which have the right conditions to post an earnings beat this quarter.Briggs & Stratton Corporation (BGG  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +15.09% and a Zacks Rank #3, is slated to release quarterly results on Oct 25.Barnes Group Inc.

The security products industry is highly fragmented, particularly in developing markets, and involves the use of emerging technology products that employ newer technologies. This creates numerous opportunities to broaden the product portfolio as well as geographic footprint and enhance the position in strategic market segments through buyouts. During the first as well as the second quarter of 2017, acquisitions contributed 2% to growth.Also, Allegion’s unwavering focus on innovation and investments in product development help boost the vitality index (an overall measure of innovativeness). Notably, the index increased from single digits in 2014 to high teens in 2016. The company continuously updates its products and develops new ones to keep up with changing market sentiments toward electronic security products and solutions.  Notably, for 2017, EPS is likely to witness an increase of 14.1% while for 2018, it is expected to rise 9.8%. Its long-term projected EPS growth rate is 14.2%.Outlook UpbeatThe company updated its 2017 earnings guidance which adds to the optimism. Adjusted EPS is now projected in the range of $3.65–$3.80 versus the prior expectation of $3.60 to $3.70. The company expects full-year 2017 revenue growth of 6.5% to 7.5% on a year-over-year basis, higher than 5.5% to 6.5% expected earlier. Organically, revenues are projected in the 6% to 7% range, compared to 5.5% to 6.5% expected earlier.Also, the Zacks Security and Safety Services Industry ranks among the top 6% (16 out of 265 industries, signaling that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future.Return on EquityAllegion’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Its ROE in the trailing 12 months is 198.3%, way more than its industry’s average of 10.4%. This reflects the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.VGM ScoreAllegion has a VGM Score of B. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 make solid investment choices.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the industry include Lakeland Industries, Inc.

38,ALLE,"In a bid to strengthen its foothold in pipeline solutions for oil and gas industry, Emerson Electric (EMR  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of GeoFields, Inc.GeoFields is a global supplier of software and implementation services for the oil and gas industry and the deal will also create new opportunities for Emerson. Further, the company will be able to expand its digital portfolio with the GeoFields software and services for pipeline integrity management, which would offer asset reliability solutions for its customers. The terms of the acquisition were kept under wraps.Acquisition RationaleEmerson already enjoys a stronghold as a comprehensive pipeline solutions provider globally and believes this buyout will enable it to expand portfolio of pipeline solutions for the oil and gas industry. This acquisition will also allow Emerson to perform risk modeling and high consequence area (HCA) risk analysis, collect critical integrity data as well as prioritize pipeline integrity-related maintenance activities.Emerson’s Expansion PlansEmerson intends to pursue growth and expansion of core business through acquisition of companies or assets that aid growth of its service offerings. Some of the notable acquisitions made by the company in recent times include Pentair Valves & Controls, Locus Traxx and PakSense. While the integration of Pentair’s Valves & Controls business will allow Emerson to bolster its presence in control, isolation and actuation business lines, the Locus Traxx and PakSense buyouts are likely to help widen the scope of cargo solutions.Our TakeRecently, the company has reshuffled and streamlined business, in order to optimize operational structure as well as boost profitability. In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 8.6%, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 7.5%.For the company’s Automation Solutions segment, favorable trends in power and life sciences and improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers is anticipated to boost growth. Moreover, the company is bullish about the prospects of its Commercial & Residential Solutions segment as it is witnessing improving trends in the United States, Europe and Asian construction markets. The company believes this segment to grow in mid-single-digit growth in fiscal 2017, on the back of a favorable outlook for global demand within its served markets.In view of recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets, Emerson raised outlook for fiscal 2017 for the third consecutive time.However, macroeconomic factors like sluggish economic conditions, recession and adverse conditions in the end markets are impeding growth for the company. Further, prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets has affected both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients, consequently marring Emerson’s prospects.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Barnes Group, Inc. (B  -  Free Report), Colfax Corporation (CFX  -  Free Report) and Allegion PLC (ALLE  -  Free Report). While Barnes Group sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Colfax Corporation and Allegion PLC carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

39,ALLE,"U.S manufacturing activity, which accounts for about 12% of the economy, has been witnessing sustained expansion for 13 consecutive months. The primary gauge of manufacturing activity, Manufacturing PMI released by The Institute for Supply Management (ISM), accelerated to 60.8 in September, marking its highest level since May 2004. This upbeat reading was fueled by a rise in new orders, production and employment.Upbeat Numbers Instill OptimismThe index of national factory activity of 60.8 in September rose from 58.8 reading in August, ahead of market expectations of 58. A reading above 50 indicates increased factory activity. In September, of the 18 manufacturing industries, growth was witnessed across 17 industries, led primarily by Textile Mills; Machinery and Nonmetallic Mineral Products. Such a high number of industries reporting expansion suggest underlying economic strength.Also, industrial production — a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter. In July, industrial production grew 2.2% supported by 1.2% growth in manufacturing industry and 10.2% in mining, offset partially by 0.6% fall in utilities. However, industrial production dipped 0.9% in August due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey, which hit the Gulf Coast of Texas late in the month.U.S. GDP Tops Expectations in Q2U.S. economic output grew at a 3.1% annual rate in the second quarter, marking its quickest pace in two years. It was a substantial acceleration from 1.2% growth in the first quarter. Overall, the economy grew 2.1% in the first half of 2017. With this, the U.S. economy recorded its eighth year of growth since the Recession — the third-longest economic expansion in U.S. history.According to projections from investment banks, both Harvey and Irma have the ability to knock off between 0.6% and 0.8% from the U.S. GDP growth in the third quarter. Estimates for the quarter is just above 2.2%. However, rebuilding activity is expected to boost GDP growth in the fourth quarter and in early 2018.Manufacturing Jobs CreatedAccording to the ADP National Employment Report, private companies created 237,000 jobs in August, logging the best pace since March. The manufacturing industry, which created 16,000 jobs, produced record employment in the private sector.Additionally, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics non-firm payroll for the month of August increased by 156,000. Manufacturing employment rose by 36,000 in August, the highest monthly job addition in five years. Manufacturing has added 155,000 jobs since a recent employment low in November 2016.Growth in manufacturing sector employment is in line with President Trump’s electoral promises and immediate actions on assuming office. During his campaign, the President had promised to improve the manufacturing industry by creating jobs through a combination of higher infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and deregulation.Sector Positioning, PerformanceThe Machinery industry is broadly grouped under the industrial products sector (one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors). Year to date, the industrial products sector has clocked a gain of 16.4%, outperforming the S&P 500’s climb of 11.9%.

40,ALLE,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Sep 26. In the last reported quarter, its adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderCintas has completed the acquisition of rival, G&K Services Inc. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has over 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The successful integration of G&K Services is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. The combined company is expected to cater to over one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity.Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density. The synergies from the combined operations are expected to yield $130 million to $140 million in cost savings and the transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Cintas’ earnings in the full year of its operation.Furthermore, Cintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to reap benefits in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Over the years, the company has consistently returned significant cash to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Its investment strategy takes a holistic view of the rapidly evolving market and deploys a dynamic capital allocation approach to focus on the relative value of the various sectors within the broader industry.However, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn is likely to impact its financial results.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:  Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.23 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26, is -2.54%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Cintas Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Cintas Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: Cintas currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.  Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alcoa Corporation (AA  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +6.80% and a Zacks Rank #1.

41,ALLE,"ABB Ltd (ABB  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has secured an order from energy supplier EnBW to extend the charging column network on German motorways. However, the financial details of the deal were kept under wraps. Notably, the modern generation of charging columns is connected to the Internet through a cloud solution that facilitates cashless payments. The company is also expected to deliver an extra 117 rapid-charging columns at the locations of service station operator Tank & Rast by the end of the year.The DealPer the order, ABB will install the fast-charging stations in cooperation with EnBW that will have a charging capacity of 50 kilowatts (kW), making them appropriate for service stations, highway rest stops, business locations and car dealerships. Last year, the company had clinched a deal from EnBW for 68 such rapid-charging stations with a high-charging capacity of 50 kW. The recent contract is an extension of this work which will enable the company to expand its electric mobility fast charging infrastructure in Germany.Long-Term ProspectsAs a matter of fact, ABB anticipates gaining from high investments in ultra high voltage DC power transmission projects in mature and emerging markets as well as continuing investments in maintenance of aging electric infrastructures. Positive development in the electricity value chain, rapid progress of Internet of Things Services and People (IoTSP), rapid urbanization and a surge in energy-efficient transport & infrastructure bode well for the company in the long term.Year to date, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares returned 16.8%, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 13.2%. Considered one of the best-managed industrial infrastructure, power and automation companies in the world, ABB stands to benefit from investments made to reduce energy intensity across all end-markets. At the end of third-quarter 2016, ABB launched the third stage of the revamped version of its “Next Level Strategy”. This is expected to unlock its full digital potential, increasing momentum in operational excellence and boosting the company’s brand.HeadwindHowever, ABB’s exposure to oil and gas markets makes it susceptible to current price volatility in the market. The company’s order level in certain business segments has been hurt in recent times due on weak oil and gas demand. Further, lower capital spending for the company’s key upstream energy end-markets is likely to hurt financials.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Casella Waste Systems, Inc. (CWST  -  Free Report), Barnes Group, Inc. (B  -  Free Report) and Allegion PLC (ALLE  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, the company has outperformed the industry in each of 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames.Pointer Telocation has remarkably beaten earnings estimates in all of the trailing four quarters, recording an average beat of 59.4%.Lately, the company’s earnings estimates have been trending upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year increased 11.5% in the last 60 days. Additionally, estimates for 2018 advanced 15.9% in the same time frame, hinting at the stock’s solid prospects. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Pointer Telocation Ltd. Price and Consensus  Pointer Telocation Ltd. Price and Consensus | Pointer Telocation Ltd. QuoteThis Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company coupled with a VGM Score of B has solid prospects and should make a valuable addition to your portfolio. Let us delve deeper into the other factors which make this stock a lucrative pick.Earnings & Revenue GrowthPointer Telocation makes a great pick in terms of growth investment. Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels are often an indication of strong prospects.For 2017, the company’s earnings are estimated to grow 6.1% while sales growth is projected at 5.3%, higher than the industry’s projected rate of 1.1%.For all these reasons, the company currently has a Growth Score of B on our Style Score system that helps us identify potential outperformers.Valuation RationalPointer Telocation has a Value Style Score of B, putting it in the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this perspective.Looking at sales, the company currently trades at a Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.9, lower than the S&P 500 industry average of 3.2. Some prefer this metric over other value-focused ones because sales are harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.The company currently has a trailing 12-months Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.2, while the sector’s average stands at 22.5.An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. As this ratio doesn’t take amortization and depreciation into account, it gives a true picture of the business’ financial health. Pointer Telocation has a P/CF of 17.7, lower than its industry’s average of 29.7.All these ratios show that the company is undervalued in comparison to its industry peers and thus it is a good time to bet on the stock.Superior Return on EquityThe Return on Equity delivered in the trailing 12 months is about 17%, while the industry returned 10.1%, reflecting the company’s efficient usage of shareholders’ funds.Industry Outlook PositiveCurrently, the Zacks Security and Safety Services industry ranks among the top 23% (60 out of 265 industries). Though the industry has underperformed the broader market in the last one year, a solid industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader market trends in the immediate future.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include ASSA ABLOY AB (ASAZY  -  Free Report), Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) and Alarm.Com Holdings, Inc.

44,ALLE,"The United States was recently devastated by two back-to-back hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — one being Category 4 and the other Category 5. These deadly storms wreaked havoc across Texas and Florida causing widespread damages to life and property, once again proving the vulnerability of human life.To add to the woes, the hurricanes caused incessant rainfall, resulting in severe floods that crippled transportation facilities and inundated vast tracts of agricultural fields. All these events cumulatively eroded significant wealth from the economy and impacted near-term growth momentum of the country.Possible Economic ImpactIt is probably too early to quote the full extent of the collateral damages due to these hurricanes, as the economic costs associated with them are still rolling in and are expected to climb further. However, several experts and analysts have put forth certain estimates based on their individual calculation. According to the preliminary estimates by Moody’s Analytics, Harvey and Irma together caused between $150 billion and $200 billion in damages to homes and furnishings, vehicles, commercial real estate, and public infrastructure. This is comparable to the loss due to Hurricane Katrina — another deadly hurricane that ravaged the country in 2005.Joel Meyers, the President of AccuWeather, however, believes that the hurricanes collectively cost the public exchequer to the tune of $290 billion, which equates to about 1.5% of the gross domestic product of the country. He further opined that the catastrophic storms were likely to contract the growth momentum of the country in the third quarter as subsequent rebuilding consumes further resources.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs pegs the individual losses at $30 billion and $85 billion for Irma and Harvey, respectively. According to Goldman, Hurricane Irma was the 10th most impactful natural disaster in the United States, affecting approximately 6.1% of the populace. With pervasive devastations, the firm currently anticipates third-quarter GDP to contract 0.8 percentage points to about 2%.How to Profit During This Challenging TimeDespite the initial setbacks, the U.S. equity markets scaled near record highs in the aftermath of the hurricanes as investors regained their appetite for riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets. As the country focuses on its rebuilding efforts, the Industrial Products sector is likely to immensely benefit from continuous investments in infrastructure related assets.In addition, riding on the government’s proposed $1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement, the Industrial Products sector has gained 11.3% year to date. Other factors like the steadily improving housing, automotive and commercial construction markets as well as uptick in new job additions augur well for the industry. Consequently, investors can expect to profit by focusing on some prized stocks from this sector that are driven by solid fundamentals.4 Industrial Stocks to BenefitIn order to select the best stocks from the sector, we have screened for stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with a VGM Score of A or B and average return on equity for the trailing four quarters in excess of 20. Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Allegion is a leading global provider of security products and solutions for business and domestic purposes. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. With a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.8%, Allegion boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 198.3.Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Perrysburg, OH, Owens-Illinois offers glass containers to food and beverage manufacturers across the world. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. With a modest long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.7%, the firm boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 72.2.Avery Dennison Corp. (AVY  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Glendale, CA, Avery Dennison produces pressure-sensitive materials, and a variety of tickets, tags, labels and other converted products. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. With a decent long-term earnings growth expectation of 7%, Avery Dennison boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 39.3.Ituran Location and Control Ltd. : headquartered in Azor, Israel, Ituran Location provides location-based services and wireless communications products in Israel, Brazil, Argentina, and the United States. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. Ituran Location boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 36.1.Moving ForwardSpencer Hill, an economist at Goldman, observed, ""We believe the huge property losses and relatively broad-based societal footprints of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma suggest a relatively large impact on near-term growth."" Amid such a scenario, investors can expect to gain by investing in the above-mentioned industrial products stocks that have a healthy return on investment along with some solid fundamental strength.

45,ALLE,"We issued an updated research report on Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. (FBHS  -  Free Report) on Sep 5. Strengthening home products market as well as potential benefits from strategic initiatives and synergistic benefits from acquisitions will prove advantageous for the company. However, headwinds related to international operations, rising costs and high debt levels might restrict its growth momentum in the near term.It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the last six months, Fortune Brands’ shares have yielded a return of 8.2%, outperforming roughly 0.2% decline of the industry.Despite the outperformance, the stock looks overvalued compared with the industry on a P/E (TTM) basis, with respective tallies of 21.3x and 16.4x in the same time frame.Growth DriversStrategic Initiatives: Fortune Brands remains committed toward making investments for the development of new products and improving its services. The company formed the Global Plumbing Group, a strategic platform in 2016. The group has helped in accelerating growth opportunities in the company’s plumbing business. Also, new products launched by the company’s premium brands like MasterBrand Cabinets, Moen and Master Lock, will enable it to expand market share.Inorganic Growth: Acquiring meaningful businesses have helped Fortune Brands to expand its product offerings and in turn, its profitability. Notably, the company acquired Canada-based premium showroom brand, Riobel and California-based luxury brand, ROHL in 2016. We believe that these assets, with collective revenue generating capacity of $110 million, will prove beneficial in the quarters ahead.Shareholders’ Return and Promising ’17 Guidance: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders. Fortune Brands initiated $300 million worth share buyback program in March 2016 while in December, it hiked the quarterly dividend rate by 13%. In the first half of 2017, the company used $32.7 million to purchase treasury stocks while paid dividends of $55.3 million.For 2017, the company anticipates the U.S. home products market to grow 6-7% while predicts the global market to rise 5-6%. Sales growth is anticipated to be in a band of 6-8% in the year. Seeing positive momentum throughout the year, the company revised its earnings guidance to $3.04-$3.12 per share from the earlier projection of $3.00-$3.12, increasing the mid-point to $3.08 from $3.06 predicted earlier.Headwinds Marring Fortune Brands’ Growth ProspectsDiversification Woes: We believe Fortune Brands’ geographical expansion has exposed it to risks arising from foreign currency movements and geopolitical issues. Notably, the company derived roughly 15% of its net sales in 2016 from international operations. Uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served or weakness in housing market activities will severely impact its businesses. Additionally, due to wide diversity of its products and the vastness of the markets it serves, the company faces stiff competition.Rising Costs and Debt Levels: Over time, Fortune Brands’ profitability suffered from higher costs and expenses. For instance, in the first six months of 2017, the company’s cost of sales grew 4.4% from the year-ago period while operating expenses rose 6.1%. Another issue currently faced by the company is its huge debt level, which was approximately $1.4 billion at the end of second-quarter 2017. We believe that, if unchecked, higher costs and operating expenses as well as rising debt levels will prove detrimental to its profitability.Others: In addition to the above-mentioned headwinds, we believe that failure of new products in the market and difficulties or delays in research and development may hurt the company’s competitive position. Also, sudden inflation in the raw material prices or supply shortage can hamper the company’s production process and thus, dent its margins.Stocks to ConsiderFortune Brands currently has $9.7 billion market capitalization. We believe that the above-mentioned positives and negatives clearly justify the stock’s Zacks Rank of 3.Some stocks worth considering in the same space are Pointer Telocation Ltd. (PNTR  -  Free Report), Allegion PLC (ALLE  -  Free Report) and Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report). While Pointer Telocation sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Allegion PLC and Brady Corporation carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pointer Telocation’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 was revised upward in the last 60 days. Also, the company’s average earnings surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 59.36%.Allegion PLC’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 improved over the past 60 days. Also, the company delivered better-than-expected results in second-quarter 2017, with a positive earnings surprise of 11.00%.Brady Corporation’s average earnings surprise for the last four quarters was a positive 14.02%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

46,ALLE,"On Aug 11, we issued an updated research report on Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) – a leading global provider of security products and solutions for business and domestic purposes.The company’s share price rallied 23.9% so far this year, way higher than its industry’s 0.6%. Allegion also reported positive earnings surprises in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.95%.The company came up with a stellar show in the recently reported second quarter, with earnings and revenues surpassing analysts’ expectations by 11% and 2.2%, respectively. Earnings were also up 12.1% from the prior-year quarter. Revenues climbed 7.2% on a year-over-year basis on the back of strong organic growth and synergies from acquisitions that were slightly offset by foreign currency impact.In fact, the company’s first-half 2017 results were quite impressive, courtesy of higher earnings, margins and revenues driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Allegion reported adjusted earnings of $1.82 per share in the first half of 2017, highlighting an increase of 14.5% from the prior-year period on the back of higher revenues.Total revenues of $1.18 billion rose 8.1% from the prior-year period on the back of strong organic growth and benefits from acquisitions. Revenues were also up 7% on an organic basis.Key PositivesAcquisitions are an important part of Allegion’s growth strategy. The security products industry is highly fragmented, particularly in the developing markets, and involves the use of emerging technology products that employ newer technologies. This creates numerous opportunities to broaden the product portfolio as well as geographic footprint and enhance the position in strategic market segments through buyouts. During the first as well as the second quarter of 2017, acquisitions contributed 2% to growth.Allegion’s Americas business has been a major contributor to growth. Revenues at the Americas segment rose 9.6% year over year to $876.2 million in the first half of 2017, driven by acquisitions, favorable pricing, growth in residential markets and non-residential markets. Focused investments in channel segmentation and product innovation will continue to boost the segment.Major ConcernsGlobal currency fluctuations are a major concern for Allegion. Over 25% of the company’s 2016 net revenue is derived from outside the U.S., which is expected to increase in the days ahead. Currency headwinds are thus expected to hurt 2017 revenues as well.Allegion’s business is subject to seasonality depending on the product line. As construction and do-it-yourself projects are primarily undertaken during the second and third quarters of each calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere due to favorable weather, security product sales are higher during those quarters. So, severe rain during the second and third quarter of the year might affect this year’s sales. Also, unseasonably late warming trends in spring or early cooling trends at the year-end might impact sales.Road AheadThe company raised its adjusted earnings per share and revenues expectations for 2017 on strong first-half performance. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $3.65–$3.80 versus the prior expectation of $3.60–$3.70. Also, 2017 revenue growth expectation of 6.5% to 7.5% on a year-over-year basis is higher than 5.5% to 6.5% expected earlier.Notably, the recent earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have also been encouraging, signaling at analysts’ optimism. The current year earnings estimates moved up 1.6% in the past sixty days on the back of three upward and no downward estimate revision. Also, the estimates for next year have seen three upward and no downward revision in the same time frame, lifting the consensus estimate by 0.2%.Allegion's acquisitions, focus on innovation and strong performance of the Americas segment are likely to continue to drive performance.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include ASSA ABLOY AB (ASAZY  -  Free Report), Lakeland Industries Inc. (LAKE  -  Free Report) and Alarm.Com Holdings, Inc. (ALRM  -  Free Report). All three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2.

48,ALLE,"Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results on Aug 8, after the market closes.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 133.33%. In the trailing four quarters, the company has recorded an average positive surprise of 78.94%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAxon Enterprise’s body-worn video cameras are in strong demand with the company winning orders from domestic and international police departments during the second quarter. This quarter, the company also bagged a number of orders for its smart weapons from various police departments. Some of its notable buyers include California Highway Patrol and Alameda County Sheriff’s Office. During the first-quarter earnings call, the company said that it expects to record 25% higher revenues year over year in the second quarter. Operating expenses are projected to grow 4-6% sequentially, as the company continues to add customer facing roles, invest in R&D initiatives as well as expand into new international markets.Per the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), second-quarter 2017’s firearm background checks dropped 4.2 % from the year-ago quarter’s figure, thus indicating a decline in demand for firearms in the soon-to-be reported quarter. This could in turn hurt sales growth for publicly traded gun manufacturers like Axon Enterprise.In the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is expected to reflect a 42.9% year-over-year plunge, while sales are anticipated to surge 26.9% to $74.57 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Axon Enterprise is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

The results were affected by the year-over-year impact of non-operational and non-cash currency on the quarter.

53,ALLE,"Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report), a provider of safety and security products, is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 27.In the last reported quarter, the company had delivered a positive 5.8% earnings surprise. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 2.01%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayA look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share increased by 1 cent in the past 60 days to $1.00. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 1.3%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $613.4 million for the said quarter, reflecting a 4.9% increase from a year ago.Allegion continues to benefit from its acquisition drive. The company broadens its product portfolio as well as geographic footprint and enhances its position in strategic market segments through buyouts. Recently acquired McKenzie-based Republic Doors & Frames is expected to expand its product line, improve operating efficiency and expand its distribution footprint. This addition is expected to boost sales in the to-be-reported quarterThe company’s Americas segment has been performing well, accounting for 74.3% of total revenue in the first quarter. Overall 8% organic growth in the first quarter was driven by strong performance in the Americas segment, reflecting continued strength in the region’s channel initiatives, synergies from new product introductions, electronics growth and strong demand in both non-residential and residential businesses. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we are concerned about economic slowdown in certain pockets of the world where Allegion has considerable presence. Moreover, owing to the company’s substantial international presence, volatile currency translations could prove to be a significant headwind.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allegion is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Allegion has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.00 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Allegion PLC QuoteZacks Rank: Allegion has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies in the Industrial Products sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Eaton Corporation, plc (ETN  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #2, is slated to report its results on Aug 1.MRC Global Inc. (MRC  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +66.67% and a Zacks Rank #3, is slated to release its quarterly numbers on Aug 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and a Zacks Rank #1, is expected to report its results on Aug 18.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

54,ALLE,"A few industrial products companies are gearing up to report quarterly numbers on Jul 27. The Q1 earnings season is in full swing, with about 128 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, reconfirming broad-based expectations of better-than-expected earnings (as on Jul 25).Earnings of these companies (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) are up 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. (For more details, read our latest Earnings Outlook: Sizing Up the Q2 Earning Season). Of these companies, 77.3% have surpassed earnings estimates, with 70.3% coming ahead of revenue estimates.As per our latest Earnings Preview, dated Jul 21, data projects that the total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are now on track to grow an impressive 8.6% from the year-ago period, on 4.7% higher revenues. This is comparable to earnings growth expectations of 5.6% recorded at the beginning of the reporting season.The Industrial Products space (which accounts for about 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization) is expected to chart one of the highest earnings growth rates this quarter amongst all Zacks sectors. In fact, its earnings are on track to be up 14.2% in the quarter, on 12.9% higher sales compared with the last year.Industrial products stocks have been performing well since the beginning of second-quarter 2017, with the industry gaining roughly 4.7%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 2.7%. We believe that growth-conducive policies of the government and expectations of higher infrastructure spending drove the shares’ performance.Further, there are economic indicators which point toward a strong operating environment for the industry. Industrial production — which measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors — grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, led by robust growth in mining and utilities. Additionally, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery rose 4.6% in the first five months of 2017, largely for the construction, mining and oil and gas field machinery. These indicators bode well for the industry.Let’s have a look at how some industrial products companies are positioned, ahead of their scheduled announcements tomorrow:Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) designs, manufactures, distributes, and services industrial flow management equipment worldwide. The company has a choppy earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice over the trailing four quarters for as many misses, for an average positive surprise of 3.6%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 25%.Our quantitative model hints at an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in Q2. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% (the Most Accurate estimate of 46 cents being higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents), in addition to the favorable Zacks Rank.(For more details, read: Will Flowserve Pull Off a Surprise in Q2 Earnings?).For a possible earnings beat, the company should have the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3. Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Flowserve Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteSimilarly, we expect AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report) to outperform estimates when it reports quarterly results. The company manufactures and distributes agricultural equipment and related replacement parts. It has an impeccable earnings history, having beaten estimates strongly each time over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 40.4%. In the last reported quarter, the company exceeded earnings estimates by a whopping 88.2%.A favorable rank and positive Earnings ESP hint toward an earnings beat this season for the company.For the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 indicate that AGCO Corporation’s earnings will likely beat estimates this quarter. Its Most Accurate estimate of $1.07 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AGCO Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  AGCO Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | AGCO Corporation QuoteAllegionplc (ALLE  -  Free Report) manufactures, and sells mechanical and electronic security products and solutions worldwide. The company has a choppy earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates twice over the trailing four quarters for as many misses, for an average positive surprise of 2%. In the last reported quarter, the company surpassed estimates by 5.8%.We do not expect Allegion to beat expectations this quarter. Though the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.00.Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Allegion PLC QuoteJohnson Controls International plc (JCI  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified technology and multi industrial company. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 5.6%. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with estimates.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Johnson Controlswill likely beat on earnings this quarter as it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 and -1.41% Earnings ESP (as the Most Accurate estimate of 70 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents).
