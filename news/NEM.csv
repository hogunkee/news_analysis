12,NEM,"Japanese finance regulators cracked down on seven cryptocurrency exchanges, suspending two for a month, in the latest fallout from a $530 million hack of the Coincheck exchange in January.X Coincheck says it will return roughly $434 million to investors who were victims of the NEM token theft, Reuters reported, and the Tokyo-based exchange will lift curbs on certain cryptocurrencies imposed after the theft.Japan's Financial Services Agency on Thursday ordered the FSHO and Bit Station exchanges to halt activities for 30 days. It also demanded that several others, including Coincheck, beef up security and report on how they plan to improve by March 22.Coincheck CEO Koichiro Wada may resign over the hack. The news of Coincheck's compensation to investors comes a day after Binance, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange, temporarily halted withdrawals amid a trade execution snafu.Financial watchdogs around the world are taking steps to protect consumers as largely unregulated digital assets, including coins and tokens, explode in popularity. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday reaffirmed that online trading platforms for digital assets that are considered securities must register as exchanges at the national level.NEM's token surged 10% vs. 24 hours ago to more than 33 cents late Thursday, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

13,NEM,"Among Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund's (UMBMX) holdings, such stocks as Abiomed (ABMD), Arista Networks (ANET) and Comerica (CMA) are providing enough lift to keep the fund ahead of its midcap blend fund peers and within shouting distance of the S&P 500.X The fund is down 0.37% this year as of Feb. 28 vs. a 0.87% decline by its midcap blend peers tracked by Morningstar Direct and a 1.83% gain by the S&P 500.But it's the fund's longer-term performance that catches the eye. It's outperformed both its peers the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31. It rose 24.02%, and an average annual 14.17%, 16.35% and 11.13% in the past three, five and 10 years.Former Air Force B-52 bomber crew member Patrick Dunkerley and his co-managers oversee the top performing mutual fund. In an interview with IBD, Dunkerley credited the strong showing to his investment team, their disciplined investment process that combines fundamental, marco economic and technical analysis, as well as a flexible valuation approach.IBD: You not only beat peer midcap funds in the past 1, 3, 5 and 10 years, but you also beat the S&P 500 in that period, one of only 16 mid cap funds to do so. What's behind the strong performance in both short term and long term?Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersPatrick Dunkerley: We are fortunate to have performed well over many years and different time periods. We seek to generate good risk-adjusted returns as measured against our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index.  I credit our team members, including our team chemistry plus our disciplined investment process for this sustained performance.Co-managers Derek Smashey and John Indellicate have been with us since inception in 2006, and co-manager Jason Votruba joined us in 2013, along with senior analysts Craig West following health care and Eric Chenoweth following energy and utilities, who joined us in 2016 and 2017 respectively.Our investment process is unique because we incorporate both top-down macroeconomic and company specific analysis, with an emphasis on quality stocks, and a flexible valuation approach, which changes depending if market conditions are bullish or bearish.IBD: The biggest exposure has been to tech, consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials. What do you see the source of performance in the balance of this year? What macro trends are affecting your decisions?Dunkerley: Healthy leading indicators, good credit availability, adequate money supply growth, and an upward slope to the U.S. Treasury yield curve all support our bullish equity view at the moment, but increased volatility seems likely given the market sentiment is adjusting to higher interest rates.  From a sector point of view, we are sticking with investments in cyclical companies for now, with an emphasis on technology, financials — including banks and insurance companies that benefit from higher interest rates, industrials, materials, and energy as strong U.S. and global growth is lifting earnings.The consumer discretionary sector is enjoying a new tailwind, with retail sales coming in stronger than expected, and more earnings performance likely as the U.S. tax cuts and wage increases stimulate growth.  We believe stock selection is important so we own deep discounters such as Ross Stores (ROST), or other retailers than can blunt the effect of online competition.  In addition, consumer companies offering unique experiences such as Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) benefit as millennial consumers seek entertainment, such as live concerts.We believe U.S. inflation will increase and the dollar should continue to be soft if risk-on investor sentiment prevails in 2018.Our position in gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) helps to insulate the portfolio from a gradually declining U.S. dollar, and should capture benefits from an improving gold price due to curtailed capital spending in the gold mining industry. The company pays a 1.4% cash dividend yield, and has unhedged exposure to the gold price.Stronger defense spending funded by the recent federal budget should help companies like Harris (HRS), a leader in military radios. In addition, companies like Hexcel (HXL) and Xylem (XYL) are profiting from global growth in aircraft demand and the need for better water treatment, respectively.We expect equity markets to rise further, but, if credit conditions turn bearish due to an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, then we would become more defensively positioned.  This will eventually happen, but it's not happening at the moment and we believe bullish conditions for U.S. equities are intact, despite the recent volatility in the markets.IBD: Where are we in the small cap, mid cap and large cap cycle of outperformance/underperformance?Dunkerley: We think mid caps are set up for competitive performance with the other capitalization categories. For the trailing 10 years ended Dec. 31, 2017, U.S. midcaps and small caps have outperformed their large-cap cousins, as measured by the various Russell indexes, with midcaps generating the best returns over that time period.  This midcap outperformance is consistent with longer-term historical data dating back to 1979, although we would caution that mid caps do not outperform in every time period.For example, last year, the large caps outperformed.  But, given the long-term historical outperformance of U.S. midcaps, they deserve a premium valuation and currently they do trade at a slight premium to large caps, based on forward looking (estimated) price-to-earnings ratios.  We believe the recent outperformance of large caps was driven by a valuation discount that was too wide.  But that discount has narrowed.IBD: Do you buy only midcap companies or will you buy large caps and small caps as long as they don't lift or lower the average market cap above or below midcap?Dunkerley: We seek to buy stocks within the market capitalization range of our benchmark, the Russell Midcap Index, with particular emphasis on companies with greater than a $2 billion market capitalization as they are often more liquid.IBD: What's your process for buying stocks? Do you start with screening for fundamentals?Dunkerley: We believe an active approach can outperform the benchmark by choosing higher-quality stocks, and by employing both top-down and bottom-up portions of our research process.  We follow over 150 economic indicators on a weekly basis, and we employ a toolbox approach to valuation, utilizing different tools during a bull market cycle to measure upside potential of a stock, while paying more attention to downside valuation risk during bear markets.We believe a good understanding of the macroeconomic picture helps us to more effectively position the portfolio sector weights, which are important.In addition, our bottom up research checklist helps us to identify the fundamentally strong companies with favorable financial characteristics, undervaluation, good business models, effective management, and that are free from serious litigation risks.IBD: How big a role does technical analysis play in your selection process?Dunkerley:  We do look at charts, particularly as an aid for timing of trades, or to help better understand the fundamental picture at a company.  Some of the ""cheapest"" stocks in the long run, in other words the best long-term investments from my experience, are found making new highs.We don't have to be the first to buy or sell a stock in order to be successful, as significant moves up or down can often be long lasting.  So quite often, the market will ""discover"" a stock as evidenced by strong price action seen in the chart. We just have to do the fundamental work to make sure the investment is sustainable. We also buy stocks that are experiencing price corrections if we think they have the quality characteristics we seek, so we are not exclusively buying stocks near highs.IBD's TAKE: Many of the top performing stocks in the past were trading at new price highs and above-average P-Es before they made the biggest gains of their run-ups. IBD: What are your sell rules?Dunkerley: Our process is to sell a stock due to a negative change in the fundamentals, problematic valuation, if we find a better investment alternative, or to manage our portfolio characteristics. One advantage of active management is the ability to seek to sell stocks with weakening fundamentals before the bad news is fully reflected in the stock price, so we strive to act decisively when our thesis changes.IBD: Do you spend much time talking with company management or do balance sheet and earnings report tell you what you need to know?Dunkerley: We believe the numbers reported by companies are one of the most important clues in securities analysis, determining the quality of the business, spotting trends, and evaluating the effectiveness of management. Good investment practice involves a thorough understanding of the cash flow statement and balance sheet, in addition to the income statement. We believe too many investors ignore the former and emphasize the latter, and this causes problems particularly during bear markets.However, we also like to invest with good management teams, and our investment team meets with various company managements nearly every week, or sees them at conferences in order to better size up their strategies and abilities.We also read conference call transcripts to deepen our understanding of the businesses and better understand the strategy of management, in addition to face-to-face meetings.Finally, competitive dynamics are always important and we seek to own companies we perceive as having a sustainable advantage so they can better protect profits and grow, such as a unique products or strong industry position, new product cycle, or management skill.  But we don't exclude commodity businesses that we think are experiencing an upcycle in fundamentals.IBD: Do you have a standard size, steps or range for beginning positions?Dunkerley: We often ramp a new position to at least 50 basis points (half of 1%) of the portfolio fairly quickly.IBD: Your portfolio is quite diversified with 154 stocks and 18% in the top 10 and no stock account for more than a little above 3%. How do you manage your winners?Dunkerley: We let winners run when it seems prudent to do so, although we often trim the position if we think the upside move is overdone. Our forward-looking valuation tool, the discounted earnings model helps us to gauge upside potential in a stock, primarily during bull markets.We build these for each stock we invest in, it's part of our fundamental analysis. So if we notice a stock discounting too much of its future potential, we will often trim it down or swap into another stock. This is another advantage of active management over passive, when properly executed.IBD: What strategy do you have for lagging stocks that were put into the portfolio with expectations of superior gains but become a drag on portfolio performance?Dunkerley: Our sell discipline is well defined, and has helped us to outperform our Russell Midcap benchmark by controlling downside risk. We will sell or trim a stock when we detect fundamental deterioration in the business outlook, or if we determine that high valuation is an outsized risk. Each of our team members covers one or more sectors of the market, and we emphasize looking at the downside risks all of the time, but especially prior to each quarterly earnings report.So we do a lot of work detecting and analyzing downside risk factors in the stocks we own. It's an ongoing project, and we seek to avoid complacency regarding the fundamentals or the valuation. Keeping tabs on stocks we already own is the majority of the work we do typically.IBD: Turning to a few of your top holdings, DXC (DXC) has run up 50% since last April and is trading at all-time highs near 103, with a market cap of $29 billion. What do you like about the Hewlett Packard Enterprise spinoff? Sales are down and it's expected to post its first profit in five years. And does the stock have more room to run, or is it getting too rich — and its market cap too big?Dunkerley: A clearer picture of the earnings history can be found under the former ticker CSC. On a GAAP basis, the company was profitable four out of the past five years.  The top end of the market capitalization range of the Russell Midcap Index is currently near $40 billion, so a $29 billion market cap company is a midcap company as currently defined by Russell.We think the stock is cheap at under 7X total enterprise value to EBITDA if you look two years out, and Mike Lawrie, the CEO there has a great track record of delivering earnings progress, and positive shareholder actions such as special dividends and spinoffs.  If they successfully spinoff the government technology services business, that will be the second time he has accomplished a spinoff since 2015, back when it was named Computer Sciences and they spun off CSRA, another government services technology business.They also paid a $10.50 per share special dividend that year, so a repeat in 2018 of a special dividend would be sweet, but we can't forecast that.This is not a rapid top-line growth situation, it is more about rationalizing the business and managing it more efficiently, so margins can expand.  The recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Services gives Lawrie a bigger platform to work with. This is one of the best CEOs in America today, we think. So this is an investment in good management execution in what is a competitive technology services industry. We have owned this stock for many years and it has performed terrifically for shareholders.IBD: Abiomed has also run up, but it continues to post big earnings increases. What's the potential for this stock and what are the risks?Dunkerley: For the long term, we think Abiomed has great prospects.  They have a strong competitive position in small heart pumps for cardiac surgeries. We think the available possible total market (TAM) for these pumps could be as much as an estimated 500 thousand units globally over time, although we don't expect Abiomed to capture all of that market, as few companies ever do that and competition almost always surfaces at some point.We estimate their unit volumes just passed the 24,000 annualized run rate, so there is a long potential runway to this story. Their products are life savers in the hands of a well-trained cardiac surgeon, and they are expanding overseas.The risks in a stock like this are usually competition, which is developing slowly, high statistical valuation that can lead to a correction in the stock, or some type of unexpected flaw in the technology, or poor execution. Since their devices are approved and used in the U.S., Japan, and Germany, among others, and they have great sales and profit momentum, we view the latter risk as low. The stock has had a great run so it could be a better one to buy on pullbacks.IBD:  Atmos Energy (ATO) is 12% off its high and looking for a bottom. What's your thinking on this stock's prospects at this point?Dunkerley: This is a quality utility company, serving the lower-risk market of regulated gas utility service, with a service footprint in eight states including a large presence in Texas.  Regulated utilities offer a better safety profile in our opinion than many industries, so we have owned them in size from time to time when the cycle is right, such as when we expect interest rates to be stable or falling.Atmos has an excellent safety record, which helps them to gain favor with state regulators, and that has driven better than average earnings growth. They also maintain a conservative balance sheet, which we like.Atmos may be one of the few utilities that keeps a chunk of their tax savings from the recent corporate tax cuts, due to potential favorable treatment in Texas, where 70% of their assets are located. However, that is a developing situation and will depend on political outcomes, never a certainty.The main concern with the stock now is the direction of interest rates, which have moved higher.  So Atmos has moved down with the utility sector. Our weighting in utilities is underweight currently vs. the benchmark due to our outlook for higher interest rates.IBD: What happened to Arista Networks that it's 22% off its all-time high after beating earnings estimates? How do you handle a stock like this?Dunkerley: Arista is a share taker in the fast-growing switch market for cloud infrastructure. However after a big run-up, the stock has pulled back, possibly due to what we perceive as conservative guidance by management. We think Arista's advantages are in their software and management expertise, so we are confident in their long-term outlook. Enterprises are rapidly shifting workloads to the cloud and Arista's networking software was built for this environment.IBD: What's your favorite stock at this point, the one with potential to deliver the strongest performance?Dunkerley: For the near to intermediate term, I would have to go with DXC Technologies, our largest holding due to its low valuation and potential operating margin improvement, the potential for a spinoff, and or another special dividend. The global macroeconomic background is favorable for technology companies at the moment, with decent economic growth in many areas of the world, a change from a few years back.Finally, technology spending is a capital expenditure which we think can do well in the middle to late part of an economic cycle, since we believe companies are more likely to spend on technology systems when they feel better about their financial prospects. The recent corporate tax cut in the U.S. helps reinforce our point of view on this, we believe.  However, for the long-term, Abiomed may have the greatest upside potential due to reasons previously mentioned.IBD: Where did you serve in the Air Force, and are there any aspects of serving in the military that translate well to money management?Dunkerley: I served in B-52 bomber units, and was stationed in Maine and California. Military service is good at fostering teamwork and communications skills, and the ability to perform under stress. I enjoyed my time of service and learned a great deal.RELATED:Look Who's Replacing This Top Fidelity Manager During His LeaveWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

15,NEM,"Japanese regulators will investigate all the nation's cryptocurrency exchanges for security shortfalls after hackers stole $530 million of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck.X Japan's Financial Services Agency on Monday demanded that Coincheck improve operations, Reuters reported. The exchange on Friday halted trading in all virtual currencies except Bitcoin after hackers stole 58 billion yen ($534 million) of NEM, a less well-known digital coin. On Sunday, Coincheck said in a blog post that it would offer reparations to approximately 260,000 affected users on its platform, but it hasn't yet figured out exactly when.""We realize that this illicit transfer of funds from our platform and the resulting suspension in services has caused immense distress to our customers, other exchanges, and people throughout the cryptocurrency industry,"" Coincheck said, promising to overhaul security measures.Last year, Japan became the first country to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges at the national level, winning praise for protecting the interests of consumers, Reuters said. The FSA has ordered Coincheck to submit a report on the hack and measures to prevent a recurrence by Feb. 13.Japan's measured stance stands in contrast to neighboring China and South Korea, which have cracked down on cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin fell 4.5% to $11,170.33 in Monday trade, according to CoinDesk. Alt-currencies Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple also booked losses ranging from 4% to 7% intraday.Among Bitcoin-related stocks, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), which tries to track Bitcoin, added 5.9% to 19.14 on the stock market today. Overstock.com (OSTK) advanced 4.2%, but Marathon Patent Group (MARA) gave up 5.15% and Riot Blockchain (RIOT) lost 11.1%.IBD'S TAKE: Bitcoin's meteoric rise made some daredevil investors rich overnight.

16,NEM,"Coincheck, a large cryptocurrency exchange in Japan, said it has halted trading of digital assets other than Bitcoin and stopped all withdrawals from the platform after what some reports are describing as a massive theft, sending cryptocurrencies lower on Friday and once again stoking concerns about security.X The exchange platform reportedly told authorities that tens of billions in yen worth of NEM, whose market value sits at nearly $7 billion, could have been stolen, according to a report from Nikkei cited by Bloomberg. Lon Wong, president of the NEM.io Foundation, told Cryptonews.com the breach was ""the biggest theft in the history of the world.""Coincheck also said it had halted deposits of NEM, whose market cap is the 10th highest of any cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap. NEM tumbled 13.7% vs. 24 hours earlier.Bitcoin, meanwhile, was down 2.5% to $10,856.46 on CoinDesk, paring steeper, earlier losses. Ethereum was down 1.4% at $1,040.70. Bitcoin Cash fell  more than 4% to $1,569.22.Coincheck's troubles come as research from Ernst & Young found that more than 10% of the funds raised by initial coin offerings get stolen. Chainalysis has found that millions in Bitcoin have been stolen through scams and security breaches.Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea has barred anonymous bank accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges. Earlier this week, reports said South Korea had considered taxing the market and taking steps to make it more transparent.The payment processing company Stripe this week also said it would stop processing Bitcoin transactions on April 23. The company cited higher fees and slower transaction speeds.""By the time the transaction is confirmed, fluctuations in Bitcoin price mean that it's for the 'wrong' amount,"" Stripe product manager Tom Karlo said in a statement. However, he added that ""we remain very optimistic about cryptocurrencies overall.""IBD'S TAKE: Bitcoin's meteoric rise has done more than make some daredevil investors rich overnight. It's also put blockchain — the software technology enabling Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — on a trajectory of its own.Meanwhile, the SEC this week also said it was ""looking closely"" at disclosures of public companies that have shifted their focus abruptly to blockchain, the record-keeping technology that underpins Bitcoin transactions.Chairman Jay Clayton, in opening remarks for a conference that were posted online, also said: ""I doubt anyone in this audience thinks it would be acceptable for a public company with no meaningful track record in pursuing the commercialization of distributed ledger or blockchain technology to (1) start to dabble in blockchain activities, (2) change its name to something like 'Blockchain-R-Us,' and (3) immediately offer securities, without providing adequate disclosure to Main Street investors about those changes and the risks involved.""Long Blockchain (LBCC), which before its pivot to blockchain was known as Long Island Iced Tea Corp., fell 9.1% to 3.36 in the stock market today, heading toward its pre-blockchain level.

28,NEM,"Investors dumped gold stocks in a very big way in April, but some investing pros smell opportunity in the continuing bloodbath for gold-mining companies.The losses for gold miners in April came as quarterly reports from the likes of Barrick Gold (ABX), Newmont Mining (NEM) and Goldcorp (G) disappointed; worries over Europe eased, denting demand for safe-haven gold; and a major index overhaul for the small-cap gold ETF came under intense scrutiny.That index change will entail massive selling of small-cap gold stocks in the VanEck Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) exchange traded fund, according to Ralph Aldis, co-portfolio manager of the U.S. Global Investors Gold & Precious Metals Fund (USERX). The sales will fund the purchase of new, more midtier names.""Some distortions have been created (as a result), and there will be a good opportunity over the next few weeks in stocks that have been whipped around on the index rebalancing,"" Aldis told IBD in a phone call, while cautioning that ""some names are more liquid than others"" among small-cap gold stocks.Two names owned by GDXJ that he likes are Wesdome Gold Mines and Klondex Mines (KLDX), Canadian gold miners that are among the top three stocks out of 32 in Aldis' $96.1 million gold mutual fund.Klondex stock tanked after the company's last earnings report ""on what was perceived as an earnings miss,"" Aldis said.In his view, a change in accounting obscured the company's true performance. Klondex saw sales accelerate over the past three quarters, even as earnings slumped.Aldis describes Klondex as a well-managed company with high-grade projects in Nevada and Canada. It has solid return on capital and low debt on the balance sheet, unlike most gold miners and producers.Shares are approaching a 52-week low of 3.10 ahead of the company's report on Thursday.U.S. Global's gold mutual fund has been bruised this year in the gold stocks' beating, but it has delivered consistently strong risk-adjusted performance relative to peers over the past three, five and 10 years, according to Morningstar Inc.It focuses on small- and microcap gold stocks.Aldis likes this segment because senior gold companies outsource exploration and production to the smaller names — and monitor the space for takeovers.The $9.74 billion VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and its $4.01 billion small-cap sibling, two of the biggest ETFs that invest in gold-mining companies, saw a combined $1.60 billion in net outflow in April.They sold off 3% and 10% last month, respectively, and fell more than 1% apiece on the stock market Wednesday. The Dow and S&P 500 were flat to fractionally lower on Wednesday.A 73% gain for GDXJ in 2016 followed five consecutive years of double-digit losses.RELATED:Gold Road Map: Investing Pros Make Bull And Bear Case Small-Cap Gold Mining ETF Streaks Lower

29,NEM,"When the stock market tumbles, investors typically seek cover in areas they feel are safe havens.The past week has been no exception. When the major market indexes sold off 2% to 3% on Wednesday amid mounting concerns from the White House's FBI debacle, gold and silver futures got an extra boost to their recent rally.Though they gave back some of those gains Thursday, the recent rally has lifted year-to-date returns for precious metal ETFs.Global X Silver Miners (SIL) is tops by that measure, with a 9.3% one-week return through Wednesday for a year-to-date return of 14.8%.  Before Thursday's dip, the $349 million ETF boasted a seven-session win streak and remains above its 50-day moving average. It's down 34% from a mid-August high.ETFS Physical Palladium (PALL) tied SIL with a 14.8% return through May 17. But it's down 2.1% for the week.IShares MSCI Global Silver Miners (SLVP), also about 30% off an August peak, posted an 8.5% one-week return to bring its gain this year to 13.2%. Silver prices on Thursday dipped 2% to $16.59 an ounce.Turning to gold, futures for June delivery slipped 0.8% Thursday to $1,248.70 an ounce. PowerShares Global Gold & Precious Metals (PSAU) advanced 7.1% for the one-week period as it extended its gains for a ninth straight session. Its YTD return is 14.3%. At 28% off its 52-week high, it has yet to set up an entry. PSAU is seeking support at its 50-day line.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), also looking for support at the 50-day average, is up 6.6% for the week and has returned 11.7% YTD. The $10 billion fund counts Barrick Gold (ABX) and Newmont Mining (NEM) among its top holdings. The U.S. accounts for roughly 15% of net assets.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which fell 0.8% Thursday after rising 1.8% in the prior session, is near the bottom of the list. Wednesday's move sent shares back above the 50-day and 200-day lines. The $34 billion ETF is forming a long cup-with-handle base with a 123.17 buy point. It's currently working on the handle. GLD's one-week return was 3.2%; YTD was 9.3%.RELATED:Gold ETFs Break Above Key Chart Level On Haven Demand; Gold Stocks PopWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

30,NEM,"Gold stocks are suffering deeper losses Tuesday than they did Monday, as investors continue to unload their safe-haven positions after the first round of France's presidential election eased concerns about the European Union's future, followed by generally strong earnings from corporate America. But Barrick Gold (ABX) plunged on its earnings woes.The price of gold closed down 0.8% at $1,267.20 an ounce, hitting a new two-week low. Gold fell 0.9% on Monday, its biggest one-day loss since March 10. While the latest drop is less steep, shares of gold mining companies are moving more as their profit margins see an outsize impact.Barrick Gold plunged 11.3%, cutting through its 200-day line, following the prior day's 1% loss. Barrick reported weaker-than-expected earnings late Monday and cut its full-year gold production target as it sells half of its Veladero mine in Argentina. The mine's costs soared, pushing Barrick's overall cost per ounce far above analyst expectations.Newmont Mining (NEM) was down 2.7% in the stock market today, hitting a 2017 low intraday after losing 1.2% Monday. Newmont reported better-than-expected earnings late Monday.Goldcorp (GG) fell 3.2%, compounding a 2.1% drop Monday. Goldcorp hit its lowest levels since early January.The gold-tracking ETF SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) edged down 1%.Silver Wheaton (SLW) gapped down 3.9%.

Amazon's relative strength has been lagging for months now and the stock met resistance at the 50-day moving average this week.Tesla Motors (TSLA), which has seen a dramatic improvement in its relative strength over the last month as it retook its 200-day line, fell 2.3%, closing just above that support area. Since hitting its lows in November, the stock has risen 20% and continues to work on a long pattern.Gold stocks gained ground as the price of gold rose 1.5%.

Gold stocks have been consolidating since August after having a big move early in the year.After significant moves over the last two months, financial stocks — both big and regional banks — underperformed today, as 10-year Treasury yield fell again.Goldman Sachs (GS) created an add-on formation last week after trading tightly for three weeks, but has yet to break out of it.

32,NEM,"Major stock-index ETFs closed lower Wednesday after the Fed's decision to raise interest rates for the first time in 2016. The Federal Reserve sees three more rate hikes in 2017, but signaled the future hikes will be gradual.A rate hike tends to mean the economy is improving.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) dropped 0.8% on the stock market today. This exchange traded fund, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, notched a fresh high of 228.34 the previous session.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) reversed lower following the Fed's move. It fell 1.9%, giving back early gains of nearly 2%.The gold mining ETF sits 35% below its August high of 31.79.The prospect of higher interest rates generally hurts gold, a nonyielding haven asset.Analysts at Kitco News saw the rate-hike news as a downer for gold bugs. They wrote: ""Markets are looking past the latest rate hike, which was 100% priced in, and are looking to the committee's expectations of where interest rates will be by the end of next year. The Federal Reserve's projections indicate a possible of three rate hikes next year. Markets have only been pricing in two.""SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) surrendered early gains, slipping 1.5%.The ETF is trading near an 11-month low after crumbling in the stock rally that followed President-elect Donald Trump's shock election win.But the global outlook for gold in 2017 remains bright, according to a Schroders metals fund manager.Schroders' James Luke wrote in a Dec. 8 note: ""Prospects of a hike in interest rates have been rising faster than inflation expectations, which is bad for gold in the short term but we doubt this will continue for long. With energy prices rising, the U.S. labor market tightening, and building expectations of hawkish U.S. trade policy, inflation expectations could build rapidly, supporting gold. The potentially positive economic elements of a Trump presidency have been priced in by markets. The potentially negative elements, including higher inflation, higher geopolitical risks and increased protectionism have been largely ignored. And as we've said many times before, gold remains an underowned hedge against global central bank credibility and underappreciated global risks.""Rate-sensitive equity sectors, such as utilities and REITs, stumbled after the hike.

33,NEM,"U.S. stocks were mostly flat in afternoon trade Friday, as big-money investors apparently decided to skip out early for the three-day weekend.The Nasdaq added almost 0.1%, but the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were flat. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply lower on both major exchanges. The market will be closed Monday in a nod to Christmas. Trade will resume Tuesday.In the IBD 50, a list of top-rated stocks in fundamentals and technicals, most stocks were up. Four stocks posted gains of 1% or more: savings and loan BofI Holding (BOFI), up 2%; chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), 1%; health savings account provider HealthEquity (HQY), 1%; and cloud-based communications and storage provider J2 Global (JCOM), 1%.Savings and loans and chip stocks are leading sectors in the current stock market. Meanwhile, HealthEquity is expected to benefit from a repeal of ObamaCare. HealthEquity surged 12% the day after the presidential election, en route to a 44% gain in the so-called Trump rally, before stepping back to a 31% gain.On the weekly chart, HealthEquity is consolidating. The stock is above its 50-day line and could form a flat base.Hospitals, an industry group benefiting from ObamaCare, lost as much as 16% after the election before trimming the loss to 7%. Under ObamaCare, hospitals are able to shift at least some of the costs of caring for nonpaying patients onto the government.Biotech stocks, a group that could suffer if President-elect Trump follows through on his threat to knock down drug prices, were the top-performing industry group Friday, up 2%. The worst performer of the day was stock in foreign banks.Incyte (INCY) popped 1% in slow turnover. The biotech is consolidating within a flat base.Blue chip stocks were not moving much Friday, and the day's losers in the Dow only narrowly outnumbered gainers.In the S&P 500, gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) was one of the day's better performers.

34,NEM,"Despite the many gilt flourishes on Donald Trump's buildings, the market rotation since he was elected president has pushed stock ETFs to all-time highs and the gold ETF to a nine-month low.Some technical analysts believe SDPR Gold Shares' (GLD) trend is under pressure following the breach of its 200-day moving average on Nov. 8 and further breakdown in price since then. They suggest looking for the gold exchange traded fund to stabilize before venturing back in.The yellow metal's loss of momentum has not deterred everyone. Some ETF investing pros even see a potential opportunity to buy on the 13% pullback from the gold ETF's early July high.""Investors need to take a step back and ask what are the real drivers of gold,"" said Rob Lutts, CIO of Cabot Wealth Management. The precious metal diversifies portfolios, dampens market volatility and acts as an inflation hedge, he notes.For Lutts, inflation is of utmost concern against a backdrop of continuing global debt expansion. Debt-burdened nations tend to debase their currencies and stir inflationary pressures, he pointed out.""In the whole election cycle, I only heard the words deficit and budget deficit in one debate, for half a minute,"" Lutts added. ""We're still in a bullish phase for gold.""David Mazza, head of research for SDPR ETFs, sees another reason to allocate to ETFs that invest in physical gold.While investors responded enthusiastically to Trump's tax and regulation proposals, his campaign promises are light on specifics. There are still questions and uncertainty about his presidency, Mazza pointed out.That could mean choppy markets ahead.""Gold tends to do best when other markets are doing poorly,"" Mazza added. ""I wouldn't be too quick to sell it.""Many ETF investors have dumped gold.GLD, a commodity ETF that tracks the spot price of gold, has seen roughly $1.79 billion in net outflow since the election, according to industry watcher ETF.com.It topped ETF redemptions in the week ended Nov. 22.In terms of performance, GLD is holding on to a sizable 13.9% year-to-date gain despite its postelection swoon.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the U.S. stock market, is up 9.9% over the same period.The gold team at Sprott Asset Management says the precious metal was caught in the massive market rotation that followed Trump's surprise election victory.""The issue for gold is that the sell-off in bonds and the rise in nominal yields are outstripping the rise in inflation expectations, causing real rates to rise,"" they wrote in a Nov. 15 note.They added: ""We think the bond sell-off was predominantly flow driven. The rise in the U.S. dollar is also likely driven by the expectations of better relative growth due to Trump's plans for tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The market is pricing in the known outlines of Trump's policies as highly inflationary.""But looking ahead, the team sees the potential for gold to regain its footing above $1,300 and move higher in 2017.""Investors will likely be looking for uncorrelated, safe-haven assets as they search for ways to insulate their portfolios from possible tail risks related to a Trump presidency,"" said Shree Kargutkar, an associate portfolio manager at Sprott.Lutts of Cabot Wealth recommends a 5% to 7% allocation to gold, mostly in bullion, but also in gold mining stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX) as well as ETFs such as Van Eck Gold Miners (GDX).""Gold is a great way to preserve wealth,"" he said. ""It doesn't pay dividends, but it has shown the ability to keep up purchasing power over thousands of years.""RELATED:Troubled Gold ETF Seems Poised To Halt Its Slide But Caution Is Advised

35,NEM,"Gold prices tumbled Wednesday to their lowest levels since February as upbeat economic data sent the dollar to a new 13-year high. Barrick Gold (ABX), Newmont Mining (NEM), Goldcorp (GG) and other precious metal stocks also tumbled.The dollar index climbed 0.6% as October durable goods orders increased 4.8%, the best gain in a year. The dollar has rising on expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike in December, with perhaps more hikes in 2017. Gold and the dollar move in opposite directions most of the time.The news sent gold down 1.8% to $1,189.30 per ounce, hitting its lowest levels in more than nine months.Barrick shares tumbled 4.7% to 14.63 on the stock market today, its worst close since early April. Newmont Mining plunged 5.1% to 31.50, also a multi-month closing low. Goldcorp dived 4.4% to 12.91, falling intraday to its worst point since Feb. 3. Silver Wheaton (SLW), which owns rights to production from various silver and gold mines, fell 4.2% to 18.32.The SPDR Gold ETF (GLD), a commodity ETF that tracks gold prices, fell 2% to 113.25, the lowest since early February.IBD'S TAKE: The SPDR Gold ETF is a downturn, but investors can find top ETFs with IBD's ETF Leaders Index. Not all that glitters is gold.Copper and industrial metals have been rising on stronger economic growth and President-elect Donald Trump's promise to spend $500 billion rebuilding U.S. infrastructure. Mining giant BHP Billiton (BHP) rose 1.1%, trading near a 1-year high. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) leapt 7.2%, hitting a 16-month best intraday.RELATED:Health Care ETFs Fall As Eli Lilly, Juno Add To Troubled Sector's WoesStock ETFs Rise Further With Five S&P 500 Sectors Hitting New Highs

36,NEM,"Gold stocks initially jumped Wednesday in the wake of Donald Trump's stunning presidential victory. But with broader markets reversing higher and Fed rate hike odds shoring up, gold prices and mining stocks have erased their daily gains.SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), an ETF which tracks the price of gold bullion, fell 0.1% to 121.56 in the stock market today, off intraday highs for 124.35.Gold miner Barrick Gold (ABX) spiked at the open, briefly retaking its 50-day and 200-day lines, reversed lower for much of the day before settling for a 0.6% gain.Newmont Mining (NEM) climbed 2.7% but well off morning highs that included a short trip above the 50-day line. Gold-mine operator Iamgold (IAG) erased solid early gains to trade lower, but closed up 1.2% at 4.35.Gold stocks are taking their cue from gold prices. Gold futures rose as much as 5% overnight, and traded as high as $1,338 an ounce intraday Wednesday. But they closed down $1 to $1,273 an ounce.IBD'S TAKE: Along with gold stocks, drugmakers, a lightning rod for Clinton's criticism during the campaign, as well as some companies that could benefit from infrastructure spending. Markets appeared to have largely priced in a Clinton victory, and she was seen as less likely than Trump to upend the economic status quo, meaning less of a need for investors to guard against market volatility.But after a brief period overnight where December Fed rate hike odds fell below 50%, investors now see a 76% chance.RELATED: Trump Wins, But Fed Hike Still On: Treasury Yields, Bank Stocks Soar
"
37,NEM,"Gold futures were up early Wednesday, but halved prior gains, as Donald Trump's victory rocked stock indexes, put a Fed rate hike next month in doubt, and slammed the dollar.Gold investors had been bracing for a big swing — a drop in the event of a Hillary Clinton win, as many had expected, or a flight to safety in a Trump win.After surging nearly 5% late Tuesday, gold futures were up 2% to above $1,302 an ounce. Mining stocks could boom when trading begins Wednesday. Miners tend to rise or fall more than the price of gold, because small price changes can have an outsized impact on their profits.The price of gold, which investors use as a shelter when they see greater chances of a market storm, closed down 0.6% at $1,274 an ounce in the U.S.SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), an ETF that tracks the price of gold bullion, slipped 0.4% during the regular session in the stock market today, with IBD's gold-mining industry group down 0.5%.After dropping on Oct. 4 following increased expectations of a Fed rate hike, SPDR Gold Trust and the gold-mining industry group had both found support at their 200-day lines through much of last month. Similar patterns could be found elsewhere in IBD's Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems group.Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 1.2% to 36.06 after falling harder a day earlier. The gold miner's stock rallied last Monday after finding 200-day support through much of October. Barrick Gold (ABX) also was off 1.2%, clinging to its 50-day line, after jumping above it last week. Royal Gold (RGLD) edged 0.7% lower to 74.92, but still above its 50-day line. But Iamgold (IAG) jumped 8.3% to 4.30 on a strong earnings report out late Monday.IBD'S TAKE: With Trump leading in several key swing states S&P 500 futures plunged Tuesday night.Gold has risen or fallen with the candidates' election prospects, with the markets apparently viewing Clinton as less likely to disrupt the financial status quo, in turn reducing the need for safer investments.Observers also say a Fed rate hike is more likely if Clinton wins, a move that would strengthen the dollar and, in turn, weaken gold prices.Gold rallied at the end of last month as FBI Director James Comey said Oct. 28 that the bureau planned to examine emails it discovered which appeared to be related to its investigation of Clinton's use of a private email server and handling of classified information while secretary of state. That announcement dragged an issue back into the spotlight that Clinton has struggled to move beyond, and appeared to reignite Trump's chances for the White House after he'd been lagging in the polls.However, gold tumbled once again Monday after the FBI, which in July said ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would press charges against Clinton, said on Sunday afternoon that it had not changed that decision after completing its examination of the newly uncovered emails.RELATED:Trump Holds 2-Point Lead Over Clinton As Election Day Arrives: Final IBD/TIPP Poll ResultsObamaCare After The Election: Clinton And Trump Prepare For SurgeryHomebuilder ETFs Fall Hard On Election Day; TIPS See Record Inflow
"
38,NEM,"There's a decent case to be made that investors' fear of Donald Trump winning the White House may turn out to be a good deal worse than the reality, at least in the intermediate term.Stock indexes crashed 5% overnight with odds for a December Federal Reserve hike tumbling. But after an initial modest sell-off at the open, the major averages have reversed for solid gains, with soaring bond yields.The overnight reaction to Trump looked like it may vindicate economists who predicted the market would fall up to 12% if Trump won. But once you consider Trump's near-term priorities and the challenges of working with Congress — even a GOP Congress restrained by a filibuster in the Senate — the agenda looks more market friendly than unfriendly.Priority one for Trump on the domestic front is likely to be revving up growth via infrastructure spending, cutting the corporate tax rate and offering multinationals the chance to repatriate overseas profits at a lower tax rate.He's talked about spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, double what Hillary Clinton proposed to spend, with both candidates talking up the potential of public-private partnerships.""With the focus on infrastructure, the basic resources sector is one of the best performers today,"" wrote Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research in London.Both Nucor (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) surged on the stock market today, suring 12% and 9%, respectively. Shares of gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) initially spiked as Trump's victory fueled a safe-haven bid with the dollar plunging. But as stocks and the dollar rebound, gold erased its big gains and Newmont traded 2% higher.IBD'S TAKE: Gold prices are rising sharply Wednesday. That will give a big boost to Newmont and other gold mining stocks, which are technical turning points.Biotech and drug stocks such as Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) rallied on relief that Hillary Clinton will not be president and the Senate will remain in GOP hands. Clinton had vowed to crack on ""excessive"" price increases, notably on older treatments. She also likely would have pushed for the government to negotiate drug prices lower.Trump's victory means that regulatory relief for super-regional banks from Dodd-Frank regulations may go a step further than expected, paving the way for a round of acquisitions. It also may ease pressures on too-big-to-fail banks, which explains why Wells Fargo (WFC) popped 6% intraday, recovering from an overnight sell-off. Wells Fargo also may see less political pressure over its fradualent account scandal.""We expect a positive snapback move once investors digest the results and factor in a more favorable regulatory environment for the financial sector,"" wrote Brian Gardner, head of Washington research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.Banks have been rising in part due to expectations for a Fed hike amid stronger wage growth and tighter labor markets. While the Fed may decide to pause before hiking if Trump's election does send financial shock waves around the globe, that's far from clear.""Expect an immediate market pullback, on fear, and then a pause,"" said Brad McMillan, Chief Investment Officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""Should Mr. Trump be able to reduce the uncertainty around what policies he intends to pursue, it is quite possible markets will recover as the economic fundamentals in the U.S. remain sound.""Trump is likely to kill President Obama's overtime rule that's due to take effect in December that guarantees time-and-a-half pay for salaried workers earning up to $47,476 — about twice the current level. Wal-Mart (WMT) already raised pay for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective September, to avoid being liable for overtime, but many employers have been slower to adopt the change as Congress aims to delay it. Some, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), whose 717 Burger King locations make it the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) chain's largest franchisee, have said they'll effectively demote their managers and make them punch the clock.The ObamaCare employer mandate is likely history, meaning modest-wage employers would no longer be fined if they fail to offer health insurance to workers clocking at least 30 hours per week. Along with retailers, Trump may bring relief to restaurant chains like McDonald's (MCD) that are being squeezed by competition and compensation hikes, contributing to a record gap between the cost of fast food and eating in.What are markets scared about? Trump's threats to impose tariffs on companies like Ford Motor (F) that send cars to the U.S. from Mexico, to walk away from Nafta and to crack down on unauthorized immigrants are why economists have said his agenda could hurt the economy.If Trump were to start his presidency by labeling China a currency manipulator and imposing tariffs, that could start a trade war, with China reciprocating by targeting the sales of Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Microsoft (MSFT). China, facing slower growth and an unsustainable build up in debt, could easily spark another bout of financial market turmoil as was seen this past January.How Trump proceeds on trade will be one of his most important early decisions. The good news is that Trump isn't campaigning anymore — and his was an especially insular campaign. Surrounded by pro-growth economic advisors and now in direct contact with top business leaders, Trump is likely to act deliberately, not rashly. That may mean opening up talks with both countries about how to move trade relations forward and setting out intermediate term goals to measure progress.This seems consistent with Trump's victory speech words: ""I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.""Trump seems unlikely to back down from his pledge to build a wall on the border with Mexico, but that, in and of itself, would have more of a symbolic than an economic effect. His rhetoric has shifted to cracking down on unauthorized immigrants who are violent criminals, and there may be fewer of those than he implies.RELATED:Drug Stocks Rally On Relief Clinton Didn't Win White HouseTrump Wins, But Fed Hike Still On: Treasury Yields, Bank Stocks SoarAT&T, Time Warner Fall After Trump Victory; Is Merger In Doubt?Overtime Rule Fallout: Fast Food Managers Told To Punch ClockFBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump Wins

39,NEM,"Gold prices rebounded Tuesday to four-week highs as the dollar weakens and Donald Trump's recent rebound in the presidential polls creates market uncertainty. A large number of gold and silver stocks are flashing buy signals for aggressive traders, rebounding from oversold positions.Gold futures rose 1.2% to $1288 per ounce, the best close since Oct. 3. Gold fell sharply in early October but recouped some losses by month's end. The U.S. dollar index retreated even as the Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting. Policymakers are expected to take no action on Wednesday, but may offer fresh hints of a hike next month.Gold and silver stocks are not at traditional buy points. But many are flashing positive technical action, retaking key moving averages and other moves.Barrick Gold (ABX) rose 4.7% to 18.41 on the stock market today, closing off session highs as broader stock market indexes rallied off lows. That follows Barrick Gold's 3% rise on Monday, rebounding off its 50-day line and pushing the stock above its 50-day line for the first time since mid-August.Newmont Mining (NEM) jumped 2.5% to 37.95, just above its 50-day line. Newmont had been consolidating comfortably above its 200-day for several weeks, but advanced 3.6% on Monday.Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) rose 1.6% to 51.62, back above its 50-day line for the first time since the end of September. Agnico Eagle has climbed 18% since finding support at its 200-day line on Oct. 11, including a 2.8% gain Monday.IBD'S TAKE: With the presidential election creating market uncertainty, you want to know which way the race is going. The IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll has the best record of any survey over the past three presidential elections.Silver Wheaton (SLW) climbed 1% to 24.35, hitting a four-week high intraday. The stock is closing in on its 50-day line after consolidating above its 200-day for several weeks. Silver Wheaton is not a miner but owns rights to precious-metal production at various mines.Silver Standard Resources (SSRI) shot up 6.6% to 11.68, moving to just below its 50-day line. Like Silver Wheaton and Newmont Mining, shares had been trading sideways, above their 200-day moving averages.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the best-known gold ETF, advanced 0.65% Tuesday, rebounding off its 200-day line and closing in on its 50-day.RELATED:Gold ETF Rises To Best Level In A Month Amid Bump For Trump In Polls

40,NEM,"Silver slid out of gold's shadow in 2016 on the way to impressive gains. Some ETF investors want to know if this is still a good time to invest in precious metals or if the moment has slipped quite away.Both gold and silver are likely to rally again after coming well off their peaks, with the white metal holding more potential upside in 2017, according to ETF Securities. The $22 billion firm offers a suite of five exchange traded funds investing in gold, silver and diversified precious metals.Not everyone is bullish on precious metals — or the materials sector to which gold mining companies such as Newmont Mining (NEM) belong.""The dollar and a run-up in material prices — gold particularly — have skewed that sector, and I'd be very, very cautious in materials going forward,"" Rob Stein of Astor Investment said in a recent interview with ETF.com.However, Maxwell Gold, director of investment strategy at ETF Securities, expects gold to rally to $1,400 an ounce in 2017 on the back of continued demand from investors and speculators.Not even a stronger dollar — if policymakers move to raise interest rates — may dent that rally.""While U.S. dollar appreciation is usually negative for gold, we see a synchronization occurring between gold and the dollar, which have the potential to rally simultaneously, as the Federal Reserve chases inflation higher against a backdrop of global monetary stimulus,"" he writes in a new report. In other words, real interest rates — interest rates minus inflation — are likely to stay low or negative.IBD'S TAKE: Gold and silver are among the many ETF tools to safeguard portfolios in rough or uncertain markets. Investors would do well to familiarize themselves with other options.Gold and silver prices are 80% correlated, but there are key differences between the two metals, according to ETF Securities.In contrast to gold, supply levels have a very big influence on silver prices. Gold is closely tied to investment demand as a hedge against inflation or volatility.More than half of silver's annual demand stems from industrial applications. It's used in the photovoltaic cells of solar panels, for example. Gold sees ""constructive fundamentals for silver"" against a backdrop of increasing demand and decreasing supplies.Silver has been finding support at the $17.50 per ounce level. In Gold's view, silver could rise between $22 and $24 per ounce in 2017. That's a 26% jump at the low end.After a sterling show earlier this year, silver stock and commodity ETFs have fallen as much as 29% under their August highs.The $6.47 billion iShares Silver Trust (SLV) sat 15% below its high of 19.71 on the stock market today. Year to date through Oct. 26, SLV is up nearly 27% vs. a 19.1% gain for SPDR Gold Shares (GLD).Investors cooled on precious metals recently as the odds of a rate hike in the near term rose. Gold sees the pullback as an attractive entry point for investors who have stayed on the sidelines.ETFs backed by physical silver are a pure play on the white metal. They also act as key portfolio diversifiers relative to silver mining funds, which hold equity risk.Here are the five main ways that ETF investors bullish on silver can play a potential rally:Investors considering an ETF that invests in commodity silver should look at the tax implications of their investment. Some precious metal ETFs are considered collectibles and don't qualify for the 15% or 20% tax rate on long-term capital gains.RELATED:Seize ETF Tools To Position Your Portfolio For Uncertainty

41,NEM,"The world's best-performing major gold miner has some soothing words for investors battered by hawkish Federal Reserve comments: The metal bull run is intact.Bullion prices are supported on the physical side by environmental and social restrictions to supply and strong demand led by India and China, and on the financial side by the United States' limited scope to increase interest rates, according to an executive at Buenaventura (BVN).The New York-listed shares in Latin America's biggest homegrown gold miner have tripled this year, outperforming all members of an index of large producers in the same span.""In the long-term I have no doubt that the gold price will continue rising,"" Chief Financial Officer Carlos Galvez said in an interview in New York on Monday. ""It's increasingly hard to replace reserves. There haven't been any world-class discoveries over the past 10 years.""The BI Global Senior Gold Valuation Peer Group is having its worst day in more than two months as gold plunges below $1,300 an ounce for the first time since June. The rally in bullion has faltered, after the best first half in almost four decades, amid mounting concern that an improving U.S. economy will spur rate increases that would reduce its competitiveness against interest-bearing assets.Echoing comments by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers before the last Fed meeting, Galvez said the U.S. economy is too weak to start increasing rates. That creates an opportunity for gold, he said. Even a 25 basis-point hike later this year would amount to ""a joke"" after so much debate on the subject, Galvez said.Buenaventura is planning to start developing the San Gabriel mine in Peru next year, and may also start the Trapiche project if it gets the necessary social guarantees. Both projects look technically and economically ""good,"" Galvez said.The Lima-based miner and its partner Newmont Mining (NEM) are seeking to replace reserves at Yanacocha, South America's biggest gold mine, where production fell 20% last year to 512,000 ounces.
"
42,NEM,"Brexit is back in the news, but this time it's weighing on gold prices and gold mining stocks. The difference: Unlike in June, there's no real panic, just a vague sense of foreboding, but nothing bad enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates.December gold closed down 3.3% to $1,269.70 an ounce on Tuesday, the biggest one-day decline since December 2013. It was the sixth straight losing session as gold undercut a key technical level.Gold price moves have a big impact on the profitability of gold miners, which tumbled on the stock market today. Royal Gold (RGLD) fell more than 9% to close at 68.64 Tuesday, hitting its lowest level since June 29. Newmont Mining (NEM) shares plunged 10.1% to 34.25, the lowest since June 22 — the day before the U.K. voted to leave the European Union.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), one of the most popular gold ETFs, fell 3.5% to 120.97, its lowest level since June 23.A stronger dollar and tighter Fed also can be a negative for emerging markets and industrial metals. Shares of diversified miners BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RIO) fell modestly. BHP fell 0.6% to 34.65, still extended from a recent buy range. Rio Tinto sank 1.4% to 33.10 after briefly rising above a 33.87 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: The industrial metals sector finally hit bottom early this year after years of falling commodity prices due to overcapacity and the slowdown in China. Here's how the mining industry has been restructuring. Keep an eye on Rio Tinto, which is near a buy point. For a primer on timing stock purchases, visit IBD University.The sense of panic after the U.K. Brexit vote initially sent gold prices surging 8% to a two-year high of $1,366 on July 6. That panic quickly dissipated as Britain's economy showed little immediate evidence of trouble.But British Prime Minister Theresa May has committed to officially launch the two-year process for exiting the EU by the end of March and has reportedly signaled a ""hard Brexit."" Now markets are beginning to brace for somewhat negative economic news coming out of Europe.Incremental economic weakness in Europe is bound to keep the Bank of England, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan on a course of easier policy even as the Fed gets set to tighten, albeit at a snail's pace.That central bank divergence is a recipe for a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of developed market currencies rose 0.5% on Tuesday to 96.14, hitting its highest level since early August. Meanwhile, the British pound fell to $1.27, its lowest level since 1985, down from $1.48 before the Brexit vote.On Tuesday, markets were still pricing in 63% odds of a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed's Dec. 14 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.A stronger dollar tends to make gold less essential as a store of value — at least in the absence of a global panic. Despite the higher dollar, which is a negative for the dollar-based earnings of U.S. multinationals, major stock indexes were mixed in early afternoon trade on Tuesday, meaning that most investors are taking the latest Brexit news in stride for now.RELATED:Do Gold And Silver Have Anything Left In The Tank?Easy Fed Policy Gives Boost To Gold Stocks, Mining GiantsSmall Caps And Tech Funds Set Records As Investors Cheer A Dovish Fed

43,NEM,"Year to date, gold mining stocks still look shiny. But in recent weeks, they're showing a bit of tarnish.IBD's Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems industry group sat atop the table of 197 industry groups for months. But it's fallen off that vaunted perch and slipped to 26th in terms of six-month relative price performance, as of Monday's market close.The group slid 1.6% on Tuesday for its fourth-straight drop, even as the Nasdaq composite rose 0.9%; the S&P 500 still punched up 0.6% despite the broad decline in commodity-related equities.While there may be plenty of explanations for why gold stocks took a back seat in Tuesday's growth-stock rally, two reasons are indisputable.One, gold prices have cooled off. Mining companies' fortunes depend heavily on the day-to-day price of the commodities they sell.London PM Fixing gold prices have shot up 30% from a December 2015 low near $1,049 an ounce to as high as $1,366 on July 6. Since that peak, prices have gone sideways for more than two months, losing no more than 4%. However, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite have gone on to notch all-time highs.Why have gold prices slumped lately? While the forces of supply and demand are ultimately the reason, some market observers are quick to note factors such as the increased prospect of higher interest rates in the U.S., which would reflect increased confidence in the economy. Higher interest rates would also likely boost the U.S. dollar and hence make gold more expensive to buy.Here's another viable reason: Gold bugs simply need a break.Consider Newmont Mining (NEM), one of the industry's giants ($20 billion market cap, $7.7 billion in sales last year). The big cap rumbled out of a 10-month bottoming-style cup-with-handle base in the week ended April 8. That week, the Greenwood Village, Colo., firm not only rallied 9%, but it also jumped past a 28.49 buy point (10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 28.39). Even with commodity plays, the cup with handle can serve as a useful timing tool to generate profits in equities quickly.Indeed, the gains came quickly.Newmont surged for four weeks in a row, then went sideways for four weeks while touching its 10-week moving average. That action offered a follow-on entry point near 25.29. By August, Newmont cruised to a 52-week high of 46.09, up 62% from the original 28.49 pivot.Few stocks in IBD's entire database can match that kind of advance so far in 2016. So, today's action in Newmont is perfectly normal. An 18% slide over three weeks is perfectly normal as the stock works on a new cuplike base.A good cup with handle can feature a decline of as much as 33%. Any more than that, though, and the risk of a failed breakout goes up fast.Spy the charts of Yamana Gold (AUY), AngloGold Ashanti (AU) and Randgold Resources (GOLD), all of which fall within the small-to-midcap range, and you see larger corrections in the works. The three have fallen 33%, 35% and 26% from their 52-week highs, respectively. Meanwhile, the S&P SmallCap 600 is less than 2% below its 765.55 peak.Remember that when the economy is buzzing, gold loses its luster as a hedge. While the shares of high-growth companies reflect the opportunity to receive dividends or strong increases in earnings per share, gold bullion lacks these qualities. On Tuesday, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index rose sharply in September to 104.1, crushing the Econoday consensus forecast of 98.8 and well above the 101.1 August reading.RELATED:What Does A Great Cup-With-Handle Base Look Like?Some Cup Bases Are Flawed: How Can You Spot Them?

44,NEM,"Stocks fell mildly Monday in the first trading session of the final quarter of the year. Gains by auto, airline, RV maker, gaming and movie-related stocks helped blunt the market's decline.The decline was also handled well by most leading stocks. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) slipped nearly 0.5% to 44.10, holding above a 43.15 flat-base buy point and remaining in buy range. Yet fellow IBD 50 name NetEase (NTES) bucked the decline with a nearly 2% gain to 244.86 and is now up 37% from a June 29 breakout past a 179.20 cup-with-handle buy point.The Nasdaq composite fell just 0.2% following three straight weeks of gains totaling more than 3.5%. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.3%. Volume dropped sharply on both exchanges, according to preliminary figures.On both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, losing issues led winners by a roughly 17-11 margin. Small caps surrendered more ground; the Russell 2000 was off almost 0.5%. The popular index, however, continues to ride support near its rising 10-week moving average.On Sept. 6, IBD switched the current outlook to ""Uptrend resumes"" from ""Uptrend under pressure"" after the Nasdaq notched an all-time high. Read the Big Picture column each day to know the general trend of the market. Roughly three out of every four stocks follow the general direction of the Nasdaq and the S&P 500.In the IBD 50, Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT), which provides internet and data-networking gear, and MaxLinear (MXL), which supplies chips for broadband-cable modems, rose more than 0.5% each. The latter is trying to recover and build a new base after plunging 21% on Aug. 9. Bases form the launching pad for new breakouts, giving savvy investors a ripe opportunity to quickly make gains in growth stocks.Activision is among a large handful of stocks in the IBD 50 that are quietly forming bases or still within proper buy range following a breakout. This means that potential new breakouts could emerge, especially if the market uptrend firms up even more.The market's decline perhaps reflected a need for the bulls to take a break from buying, even though the ISM survey showed a rebound in U.S. manufacturing activity in September. The reading of 51.5, up from 49.4 in August, gave relief to economists; a figure above 50 means factory activity is expanding.The decline failed to prevent Tesla Motors (TSLA) from making its biggest gain since June. The stock surged more than 4% in nearly double the average turnover to close at 213.70; now the large-cap auto play is just shy of rebounding back above the 50- and 200-day moving averages.All of its poor ratings from IBD, including an 8 for Composite Rating and a 12 for Relative Strength, reflect the stock's long digestion phase after breaking out of a first-stage base at 40.10 in the week ended April 5, 2013, and rallying as much as 627%.Gold stocks cooled off further after sliding hard last week. The price of gold futures edged only 0.2% lower, yet has failed to make any upward price progress since early July. The SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) ETF, at 125.32, is 4% below its July 131.15 peak.Randgold (GOLD) edged 0.8% lower to 99.25 in below-average turnover. The stock has been basing for nearly three months since peaking at 126.55 on July 6. The decline from that peak is so far 27%, within the normal range.Newmont Mining (NEM) is also probing the lows of its current cup-shaped base, down more than 3% to 38.10 in thin turnover. This is the stock's first serious correction since the gold play jumped out of a long base at 26.20 in March.Later in the week, watch for fiscal fourth quarter results from Acuity Brands (AYI) early Wednesday. The former Leaderboard stock, first added to the stock of top leaders on Jan. 9, 2015, when the stock finished the session at 151.50. Lately, it's having some trouble climbing back above the 50-day moving average, yet shares are mildly above a former flat-base buy point at 260.93.Acuity, a leading installer of LED lighting systems, boasts a 95 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99. Wall Street sees profit climbing 46% to $2.39 a share on a 25% rise in sales to $948 million.RELATED:Why Gold Shares Are Cooling OffIs It Possible To Make A Million By Trading ETFs? IBD Says Yes

45,NEM,"Gold and silver had quite a run this year. The price of gold is up 18.6%, while silver has jumped 34.7% so far. Along with that, gold and silver ETFs amassed stellar returns in 2016, while other asset classes experienced greater volatility.Can gold and silver ETFs repeat as top-performing ETFs in Q4 and beyond? What options do investors have for investing in gold and silver ETFs? And can we expect the prices to keep rising?SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest gold-backed ETF in the world, has earned investors about 25% this year. The nearly $40 billion fund held 950 metric tons of gold at the end of June, up from 642 tons at the end of 2015, according to the World Gold Council.To put this in perspective, total holdings in gold-backed ETFs at the end of last year stood at 1,611 tons. By June 30, this number soared to 2,190 tons.And while total demand for gold had been steadily declining since its peak in 2011, investment demand jumped to a record 1,064 tons in the first half of this year, surpassing the previous high of 917 tons that took place in the first half of 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis.""Investors really came into 2016 with a significant amount of uncertainty on their mind and looked out for the potential for volatility,"" said Dave Mazza, head of research for SPDR ETFs and State Street Global Advisor Funds.Investors flocked into GLD, said Mazza, ""as a result of volatility driven by the macroeconomic picture in the U.S., in Europe and especially in China, coupled with the fact that now there's significant amount of political uncertainty.""The $9.5 billion iShares Gold Trust (IAU) and $6.9 billion iShares Silver Trust (SLV) are also physically backed precious-metals ETFs. Their respective expense ratios are 0.25% and 0.50%. They're each up 25% and 38% this year.""What's good about both of those is you actually hold the physical metal and you can track it down to the very specific bar in vaults,"" said Tushar Yadava, investment strategist in the iShares U.S. Investment Strategy team at BlackRock (BLK).Another option? ETFs that invest in gold and silver futures instead of the physical asset. Here, however, investors need to deal with issues related to futures such as market structure, points out Rob Haworth, investment strategist, commodities research, at U.S. Bank.Examples of futures-based ETFs are PowerShares DB Precious Metals (DBP) and PowerShares Global Gold & Precious Metals (PSAU). Expense ratios are higher at 0.75% for both funds. They're each up 26% and 95%.In addition to the pure-play precious-metal ETFs, investors can put money into funds that track miners.""What's different about miner ETFs in general is that they're an equity play on the commodities themselves,"" said BlackRock's Yadava. ""So what you end up getting is one of these traditional 1940-act funds that owns a portfolio of equity positions.""IShares MSCI Global Silver Miners (SLVP) and iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners (RING) are two such examples. They're up a staggering 158% and 107% year to date. The biggest of the mining ETFs, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), has $10 billion in assets and is up 96% this year.Top five holdings in the $89 million SLVP are Canadian Silver Wheaton (SLW), Mexican Fresnillo, Canadian Tahoe Resources (TAHO), Mexican Industrias Penoles and Peruvian Buenaventura Mining (BVN).The $279 million RING holds U.S.-based Newmont Mining (NEM), Canadian Barrick Gold (ABX), Canadian Goldcorp (GG), Australian Newcrest Mining and Canadian Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM).Other mining ETFs include $432 million Global X Silver Miners (SIL), Global X Gold Explorers (GOEX) and Sprott Gold Miners (SGDM), which have returned, respectively, a whopping 146%, 137% and 94% in 2016.For a more diversified approach, the $199 million iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers (PICK) gives investors an opportunity to invest in a basket of large global metal and mining companies such as BHP Billiton (BHP) (BBL), Rio Tinto (RIO), Glencore, and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.39% and is up 26% this year.When comparing pure metal plays vs. miners, the latter ones will usually do better when gold or silver do well, which explains their huge returns this year.""They will exhibit bigger downswings and more rapid upswings,"" said BlackRock's Yadava. ""So they're able to ramp up production rapidly when the price is high and cut things down operationally when the price is low.""Volatility and uncertainty in global markets should continue to drive gold and silver prices up.""If interest rates are low or falling and inflation is not contributing to that, so real rates themselves (are low), you tend to see gold do quite well,"" Yadava said. ""When real rates are rising, that's obviously a tougher time to hold gold because its value is a little more eroded by the interest-rate and the inflationary regime.""State Street's Mazza suggests holding gold and cash as strategic diversifiers as he expects more volatility in the equity markets. ""I want assets in my portfolio that will behave differently when traditional assets may do poorly. That's why gold, even if it's not as strong as this year, should still be in a portfolio.""RELATED:Which ETF Strategy Is Right For You

46,NEM,"Stocks rushed higher out of the gate and held strong throughout morning trades Thursday, as tech and commodity-related names led the upside.The Nasdaq composite, helped by decent gains by megacap companies including Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC), rose around 0.6%, giving back a small portion of the 0.7% opening gain. The S&P 500 added 0.5% to Wednesday's nearly 1.1% bulge higher on the back of a decision by the Federal Reserve to push back any potential move to raise the cost of money, though it also gave back some initial gains.The Dow Jones industrials tacked on 0.6%, also down slightly from an early rally. Oil, metal ores, steel and gold and silver mining shares dominated the market's upside. WTI near-term crude oil futures jumped more than 2% to $46.44 a barrel.With the U.S. dollar falling in value Thursday, dollar-based commodities such as gold and silver flourished. Hence, gold mining stocks maintained their upward trajectory. However, a few of the leaders continue to bump their head against a ceiling of upside resistance near their 50-day moving averages, an important chart tool.Newmont Mining (NEM) first rallied, then reversed course and was down 0.4% in late-morning trades. Since crossing below its 50-day line on Aug. 24 in heavy volume, the multinational miner of gold and copper has had trouble returning back above this intermediate support level.The stock has gained more than 130% since Jan. 1. Wall Street is bullish on Newmont's earnings prospects, which were up 85% to $1.81 a share this year, and up 9% the next.Apple continues to march higher since moving past a 110.33 long cup-with-handle entry last week. Investors have dismissed concerns by some equity sell-side analysts saying that strong preorders for the iPhone 7 at carriers such as Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS) do not give the complete picture.Notice how on a daily chart, Apple shares pulled back four sessions in a row in an orderly fashion. The biggest decline within the pullback was all of 1.1%, and volume declined vs. the actual Sept. 14 breakout in which the largest company on the U.S. market throttled 3.5% higher in more than triple its average volume.Volume is now averaging 37.2 million shares a day over the past 50 sessions. IBD charts draw a 50-day average line across the volume bars, making it super easy to see if volume is heavy or light.The 5% chase zone in Apple goes up to 115.85; buying shares at a higher price is buying ""extended,"" which raises the risk of taking a quick loss if the stock makes a normal, temporary pullback.Apple's relative strength rating continues to be so-so at 67 as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, but that is actually natural in the case of a big cap that has wound its way through a long basing period. Keep in mind, the rating tracks relative price strength over the past 12 months, but the prior 3 months do get an extra weighting.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now solid at an A-. A letter grade of C+ or higher implies heavy institutional buying vs. selling over the past 13 weeks of trading.Elsewhere in the stock market today, IBD 50 stocks continued to rally firmly. Global wireless networking play Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) stretched to a new high, rising more than 2% to 54.67 in heavy trading. The stock has rallied more than 32% past a 41.31 buy point following a late-July breakout.Ubiquiti is No. 2 in the IBD 50. Wall Street sees fiscal first-quarter earnings rising 35% to 69 cents a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of 30%-plus profit increases.Meanwhile, Leaderboard name Domino's Pizza (DPZ) rose nearly 1% to 153.89, gaining further ground above its rising 50-day moving average. The global consumer service play first joined Leaderboard's Leaders List on Feb. 25 as it showed a combination of savory fundamentals (EPS Rating currently at 93) and technical action.RELATED:When Did Apple Shares Break Out?What Baseball Slugger Ted Williams Can Teach Investors About Nailing Big Stock Winners

The metal's importance in industry, power transmission, electronics and construction gave ""Dr. Copper"" the gift to predict turning points in the economy.

48,NEM,"Gold stocks and gold exchange traded funds fell on Tuesday, pressured by a stronger dollar and data showing American consumer confidence hit a 12-month high in August.Additionally, a Fed official added to a recent chorus of hawkish remarks from policymakers. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said in an interview Tuesday that the U.S. job market is nearly at full strength, and that the pace of interest rate hikes will depend on the strength of the economy, according to news reports.Gold bugs await payrolls data later this week for further clues on the path of monetary tightening.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) slid 1% to 125.03 on the stock market today, approaching the July 25 consolidation low of 125.11. This commodity ETF sold off Friday in big volume after Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the case for raising interest rates has ""strengthened"" in recent months.GLD has fallen in six of the past 10 sessions and now sits nearly 5% below its early July high of 131.15.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) slumped 4.85% on Tuesday alone. Among its top 10 holdings, several stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) and Randgold (GOLD) fell 5.65% and 4.7%, respectively. Newmont crashed through its 50-day line last week. So did Randgold, which has now lost all its winnings from a late June breakout.GDX is one of the most popular ways to play a rally among 29 gold and precious metal stocks. Silver-backed exchange traded funds show a similar overall trend, including iShares Silver Trust (SLV), which lost 1.2%.IBD'S TAKE: To find sector equity ETFs from the best industry groups, check out ETF Center.""The price of gold (reflected in GLD) appears at risk to correct over the near-term following the strong year-to-date gains and breach of its 50-day moving average,"" Ari Wald, a senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer told IBD in an email Tuesday.Wald noted that this is GLD's first drop below its 50-day line -- a critical line of institutional support -- since the start of the latest leg of its rally. ""Many protective stops were likely placed here and triggered simultaneously given the rise in volume during the drop,"" he said. The 50-day at $127 now indicates near-term resistance.Wald does not believe the yellow metal's long-term bullish reversal is at risk ""because the drop wasn't confirmed with a simultaneous breakout in the U.S. dollar.""Due to the inverse correlation between gold and the dollar, Wald said he would be more concerned if there were significant signs of renewed strength in the greenback.He added: ""The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has instead been range bound between 92-100 over the last year (between $24-$26 for the PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish ETF (UUP)), and the recent rally over the last week hasn't altered this range. In addition, recent weakness for GLD is occurring following a strong uptrend rather than coming out of a major topping pattern. We'd be more concerned if GLD's breakdown was preceded by several months of distribution.""

51,NEM,"The market rally in the weeks after the election of Donald Trump is being buffeted by volatility, uncertainty and global crosscurrents — trends that are now playing out in the gold market.Prices, which had been going nowhere but down, surged 1.5% on Thursday, part of a rally since Dec. 27 that has erased more than one third of the metal's 14% postelection plunge.Shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX), big losers in the weeks after Trump's win, were up 4.8% and 6.3%, respectively, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, hitting levels not seen since before voters went to the polls.Treasury yields had been a one-way bet higher, with the 10-year yield rising 100 basis points to 2.62% Dec. 16 from 1.62% Nov. 8. Yet despite solid economic readings and the Federal Reserve's surprise signal that there might be three rate hikes in 2017, the 10-year yield's slide took it all the way down to 2.37% on Thursday.Higher interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar have been talked up by various macroeconomic strategists as near sure things in 2017, but the dollar's rise also has suddenly hit resistance. The U.S. dollar index slid 1% vs. a basket of other advanced economy currencies on Thursday and has now given up more than one-third of its postelection rise.So why is the Trump rally suddenly facing turbulence?Thursday's moves appeared to be at least partly tied to a sudden reversal of China's currency, which had been a one-way bet lower vs. the dollar. Market players speculated that the People's Bank of China may have intervened to prop up the sagging currency in an effort to stem capital outflows.The Chinese government has been instituting capital controls, which has fueled a surge in prices of  bitcoin, as the digital currency can be sold on bitcoin exchanges outside of China. Bitcoin prices in China plunged more than 20% overnight as the yuan suddenly reversed higher, potentially a sign that the crackdown on capital leaving the country could intensify.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve, long worried about paltry growth, has shifted to the role of traffic cop. Now the key question is whether Donald Trump's fiscal fuel will raise the economy's speed limit, allowing for faster growth without pushing inflation much above the Fed's comfort zone.The market action in China is a reminder that if the U.S. is winning all the time, as Trump intends, the global economic backdrop could deliver some surprises from the countries that are losing. On Thursday, Mexico's central bank intervened to prop up the sagging peso, which has been battered by concern over Trump's policies.Ford (F) said on Tuesday that it's canceling plans for a new car factory in Mexico. On Thursday, Trump tweeted a warning to Toyota (TM) that it will pay ""a big border tax"" if it builds a plant in Mexico to ship Corollas to the U.S., echoing a threat aimed at General Motors (GM) days earlier.The volatility in interest rates, the dollar and gold also reflect uncertainty about the economic and political outlook. The Trump rally has been built on big expectations set by the president-elect and encouraged by his party's control of Congress.Those expectations haven't been dashed, by any means. Investors are still expecting big corporate tax cuts to lift earnings growth as well as infrastructure spending and individual tax cuts to boost the economy.But there may be a creeping sense of uncertainty about just how much Trump can get done, how fast it will happen, and whether some of his moves may backfire.RELATED:Ford Cancels Mexico Plant; Trump Threatens GM With 'Big Border Tax'

52,NEM,"U.S. stock indexes sagged midday Thursday, and moderately higher volume added some concern.The Nasdaq trimmed 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000, which has been leading the market, dropped 1.3%. Volume was running modestly higher on both major exchanges in the stock market today.Blue chips were mostly down in the Dow. The two banks in the Dow — Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) — fell more than 1.5% each. Payment processor Visa (V) scored the best gain, rising 1.2%. Visa is consolidating, but recently retook its 50-day moving average line. In the S&P 500, one of the day's best gainers was gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM). The big-cap stock gapped up almost 6% as it reclaimed its 200-day line. Newmont remains beaten down, 19% off its high even with the day's gap up. The biggest loser in the S&P 500 was retailer Kohl's (KSS), down 19%.The retail sector has done little in the so-called Trump rally. Just before the election, retail was No. 26 of 33 sectors. Going into Thursday's session, retail was No. 25.In the Nasdaq 100, retailer Urban Outfitters (URBN) was the worst performer, down 5% in heavy volume.In economic news, payroll firm ADP reported that businesses added 153,000 jobs in December, which was 11% fewer than the Street expected. First-time jobless claims rolled in at 235,000, which was almost 10% fewer than expected.Internationally, services gauges tilted toward the bullish side. China's services sector picked up to a 17-month high. The United Kingdom reported the fastest growth in the services sector since July 2015. Japan's services sector grew at the fastest pace in 11 months. Ireland's services index popped to a five-month high in December.But in India, the services gauge for December contracted for a second straight month. About a third of India's economy is informal, which makes official statistics and economic gauges imperfect.RELATED:Microsoft Price Target Raise; Surface Booms Vs.

55,NEM,"Newmont Mining (NEM), Buenaventura (BVN), Silver Wheaton (SLW), Coeur Mining (CDE) and other gold stocks rose Thursday after a sell-off Wednesday as investors await comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen Friday.After a steady climb from the start of the year, the sector began to slide earlier this month as bullish jobs data lifted prospects for the central bank to tighten monetary policy again. Spot gold closed 0.4% lower Thursday at $1,324.60 an ounce, the lowest in about a month.Newmont Mining edged up 0.8% in the stock market today after losing 7.7% Wednesday. Buenaventura rose 1.8% Thursday. Both stocks closed near their 50-day moving averages, where they now seek support.Silver Wheaton, a Canadian buyer of purchase agreements for gold and silver, rose 2%. Coeur Mining added 3.25%. Both close above the 50-day line, as they try to rebound from that key level. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) dipped 0.1%.IBD's TAKE: Gold stocks are the No. 1 rated group on IBD's list of 197 industries.

South Africa's Sibanye Gold (SBGL) was one of the few gold stocks that stayed above its 50-day line during this month's downturn.

Wells Fargo's Global Real Asset Strategy head John LaForge said in a report Thursday he sees a long-term bear cycle for gold and recommended against buying it.""The reason is that gold is susceptible to how other commodities behave over long price cycles, or what we call supercycles. As of August 2016, commodities are knee deep in a long-term bear supercycle, which began in 2011,"" LaForge said.RELATED:Gold Stocks Sell Off On Rising Fed Rate-Hike OddsGold, Silver Stocks Still Retreat Despite Fed-Minutes CautionMining Sector Leads As Profit Growth Returns

56,NEM,"Major stock market index ETFs broke lower Friday amid renewed concerns that the Fed will raise interests rates soon.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) plunged 1.4%, slicing under its 50-day moving average for the first time since late June.All stock market sectors were lower near midday, with SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) down the least by 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) was down the most, by 2.8%.Comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, traditionally seen as a dovish policymaker, fueled negative sentiment. He didn't really say anything earth-shattering, other than to say he backs gradual interest-rate hikes. The Fed has three meetings left this year: Sept. 20-21, Nov. 1-2 and Dec. 13-14. Futures traders think there's a 30% chance the Fed will hike at the September meeting, but the chances rise to around 60% in December.XLFS holdings Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and US Bancorp (USB) were up as much as 0.7%. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) was off 0.5% on an analyst downgrade. Top holding Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) was down 1.9%.

It's 2% off its 52-week high.

57,NEM,"Mining stock exchange traded funds cooled like a newly cast gold ingot dropped into a bath of fresh cold water until Friday's jobs report set them sizzling again.""Gold historically has a big rally going into the final quarter,"" benefiting in part from the Indian wedding season as well as general holiday buying, said Frank Holmes, portfolio manager at U.S. Global Funds. ""And negative interest rates globally are a very strong support mechanism for the price of gold.""Gold unexpectedly soared 25% in the first half of 2016 after three troubled years, gaining amid volatile stock markets and a shaky global outlook. The precious metal saw red-hot global demand in this period — 2,335 tons, the second-highest on record, with investment demand surpassing levels during the 2009 financial crisis.On Friday, the flagship SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rallied for a second day, reversing from a recent pullback, after underwhelming jobs data was seen to put the Fed's plan to raise rates on hold. The $39.69 billion GLD ETF has found support at the $125 level and could be poised to climb again. Gold mining stocks, a spring-loaded play on the price of gold, also rallied on the news.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) are among the best-performing ETFs of 2016 and have seen net inflow of more than $3 billion combined.GLD has gathered a hefty $11.82 billion in fresh assets this year through August. With rates likely to stay lower for longer after slack jobs growth in August, gold's bullish streak in 2016 may not be over.IBD'S TAKE: The path of rate hikes is the big issue for investors, but mixed messages from Fed officials underscore just how unsure policymakers are about the future.It's the fear of the Fed raising interest rates that spooked gold bugs in late August. Higher rates increase the opportunity cost of holding the nonyielding safe-haven asset, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.But real interest rates — the federal funds rate minus inflation — have gone to zero this year, Holmes told IBD in a phone call. And with global bond yields continuing to drop below zero, investors are more likely to turn to gold.As one of the brains behind U.S. Global Investors World Precious Minerals Fund (UNWPX) and Gold & Precious Metals Fund (USERX), Holmes' outlook on gold tends to be sunshine-y, in a measured way. He recommends an allocation to gold in good times, as well as bad, to anchor portfolios: at a 10% weighting, with half in gold bullion and half in gold stocks.Holmes believes one of the best ways to play gold on the stock market today is royalty and streaming companies. With much of the gold mining industry sunk in debt, royalty businesses are seen to offer a superior and less risky business model.In a sense, they don't ""dirty their hands"" in the mining trade. Instead, they provide upfront capital to gold and silver miners and producers, receiving in return either a percentage of future sales as royalty or a stream of precious metals at discounted prices.Unburdened with buying machinery or maintaining mines, these outfits enjoy a far lower operating cost per ounce of gold than miners do. Their overheads are minimal, revenue per employee is extremely high and debt per share is much less than the broader mining industry, Holmes told IBD.The fat margins have allowed them to rake in profits even in gold bear markets.Holmes' favorites in this space include Franco-Nevada Mining (FNV), Silver Wheaton (SLW), Royal Gold (RGLD) and Sandstorm Gold (SAND). Each has outperformed underlying gold over the last 12 months and earned an exceptional IBD Composite Rating of 84 and above.Royal Gold's total debt per share is roughly one-eighth that of mining giant Barrick Gold (ABX). Silver Wheaton's sales per employee are more than 20 times higher than those of another senior miner, Newmont Mining (NEM). While Barrick and Newmont are down over the last five years, Franco-Nevada has doubled in share price.Royalty companies get less beaten up than gold miners and producers in tough times for the industry. As a result, they tend to underperform their nonroyalty sector peers in a strong bull market for gold. They're less-volatile companies in this industry, ""investments you can sleep with at night,"" according to U.S. Global. Investing in royalty companies comes with the risk that their mining partners may fail to meet production goals and that the underlying precious metals may fall in price.For successful investing, Holmes' precious metal mutual funds pick mining companies based on fundamental factors such as gross profit margin, cash flow and return on invested capital.USERX is described as investing in large-cap or ""senior"" miners; UNWPX in smaller and ""junior"" companies.The large-cap mining mutual fund has outperformed its ETF peer — GDX — over the past three, five and 10 years.GDX tracks a cap-weighted index of large-cap miners, giving it a hefty 20% portfolio weight in Barrick Gold and Newmont. The average market cap in this gold mining ETF is $7.62 billion vs. $1.14 billion for its mutual fund peer.Year to date through August's end, USERX and GDX have vaulted a respective 85% and 93%.U.S. Global's small-cap mining fund has outpaced its ETF counterpart, GDXJ, over both the shorter and longer terms.Of note, UNWPX has a $231 million average market cap. For GDXJ, it's $1.42 billion — similar to Holmes' large-cap mining fund.U.S. Global said its precious metal mining funds skew overall toward smaller and midtier caps. These less-researched names fly under the radar of many investors and are often the target of acquisitions.All four funds invest globally in companies mining gold as well as other precious metals.RELATED:Gold ETFs Risk MeltdownGold ETF Demand Soars3 Ways To Play Another Gold Rally

58,NEM,"Corporate earnings results grabbed front and center stage and are helping to propel U.S. equities higher in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, as the major indexes are padding last week's nice gains.The Dow Jones industrial average, boosted by better than expected results in several of its 30 components including Caterpillar (CAT) (Q1 EPS up 100%) and DuPont (DD) (EPS up 30%), rose more than 1.2%. That's better than gains of 0.7% to 0.8% for the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials, at 21,002, are now up nearly 6.3% since Jan. 1, but the Nasdaq composite, breaking 6000 for the first time, is ahead with a nearly 12% gain. Big-cap techs and select consumer-oriented stocks have helped the Nasdaq's cause. But keep monitoring earnings results and see if more money flows into blue-chip-type large caps outside the tech realm.Caterpillar also notched a surprise 4% gain in revenue, its first year-over-year increase in 10 quarters. The last time the construction and mining gear titan saw a top-line lift came in the third quarter of 2014 (up 1%).Cat shares vaulted past a 99.56 flat-base buy point with a gap up at the open, and it's enjoying heavy institutional buying with shares seeing triple normal turnover. The stock opened the day at 102.80, within the 5% proper buy zone following Tuesday's breakout.The Russell 2000 rallied more than 1.2%. Volume is running firmly higher vs. the same time Monday on both main exchanges, a sign of heavy institutional demand for equities.Crude oil futures, meanwhile, rebounded after getting hammered Monday. WTI futures rose 0.9% to $49.67 a barrel but are still down more than 7% year to date.Gold mining stocks and other defensive plays led the market's downside. Newmont Mining (NEM) sank nearly 3% to 32.91 in heavy volume. The mining giant grew first-quarter profit 4% to 25 cents a share on a 13% pickup in revenue.Four months into 2017, it's clear that institutional investors are favoring certain industrial sectors over others. That's good news for stock pickers. Here are five stocks that, in addition to high-growth names in the IBD 50 and Sector Leaders, show more mature fundamentals or are turnaround situations but have the potential to beat the S&P 500. Nvidia (NVDA), $63 billion market value: The leader in graphics processors has stepped nicely into new growth markets including self-driving automobiles, datacenter and AI (artificial intelligence). Nvidia, up nearly 2% to 104.71, is trying to retake its key 50-day moving average near 103 after getting slammed below it on bearish analysts comments on April 1.The stock was a huge leader in 2016, rising 261% from a cup-with-handle breakout at 33.16 back in March that year.Nvidia sports a solid 98 Earnings Per Share Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 and earnings in the April-ending fiscal first quarter are seen rising an impressive 46% to 67 cents a share, on top of the 39% gain in the year-ago quarter. But keep in mind that in the next three quarters, Nvidia faces absolutely steep year-over-year comps, as Q2, Q3, and Q4 profit rose 56%, 104% and 117%, respectively.Given the giant gains in 2016, Nvidia's current correction is very respectable, falling no more than 21% from its all-time high of 120.92.Celgene (CELG), $98 billion market value: The highly respected biotech pioneers treatments for chronic and difficult diseases including multiple myeloma. The stock jumped 2% to 125.87 after finding vital support at the 50-day line. It's up slightly from an earlier 122.49 cup-with-handle entry.The Street sees full-year earnings rising 22% to $7.22 a share in 2017 and up 21% in 2018. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), $13 billion: The former large cap and burrito and taco chain reports Q1 results after the close Tuesday. Watch for an expected positive change in both comparable restaurant sales and see if restaurant-level operating margins show stability or improve.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), $31 billion: The robotic surgery firm, which recently posted double-digit top and bottom-line growth in Q1, is up more than 31% since Jan. 1. It bolted out of a saucerlike base at 727.23 in late February.Intuitive gets a rock-solid 96 Composite Rating in IBD Stock Checkup, among the top 5 in IBD's Medical-Systems/Equipment industry group. That group is ranked No. 1 among 197 industry groups and subgroups for six-month relative price performance.Watch for potential new buy points to emerge, in the form of a new base or a gentle pullback to the 10-week moving average, as seen on a weekly chart.In some cases, a stock may not fall back to the 50-day line but find support at the 10-week line. So it's crucial to study a stock's price action on both the daily and weekly charts.RELATED:The Case For A Future New Bull Market In GoldEarnings Results Today: Chipotle Leads 5 Big Reports After The CloseStock Market Today: Is It Time To Buy Hasbro Now?

Amid a 1.7% rebound in WTI crude oil futures, oil exploration firms helped lead the upside, and a 1-point gain by Dow 30 component Chevron (CVX) is helping the Dow Jones industrial average keep its head above the important 50-day moving average.WTI futures, helped by news about further trouble at Libya's oil-shipping ports, are currently near $48.45 a barrel, still down nearly 11% off their Feb. 23 peak of $54.45.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average accelerated gains to nearly 0.9%, practically equaling the gain by the S&P 100 index, which tracks the largest 100 companies in U.S. equity markets by market cap.The S&P 500 was also up around 0.9% amid reports that Republican leaders have vowed they will not quit at passing reforms to the Affordable Care Act, perhaps the biggest legacy from the President Obama administration. The Nasdaq composite slightly trailed with a nearly 0.7% lift. The Russell 2000 is catching up, rising more than 0.7%.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility index, a key measure of fear among index options traders, dropped nearly 6% to 11.65. On Monday, the VIX hit as high as 15.11, marking the highest level since Nov. 14.Among those giant companies, at least five names are showing excellent action after breaking out over the past five months. They deserve a close look. Home Depot (HD), a member of the Dow industrial average, sports the highest EPS Rating within the 30 components at 97. The stock, which earns a 95 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, broke out past a 137.42 saucer-with-handle entry.Home Depot may benefit from the reported rebound in demand for single-family homes among the large millennial generation, in addition to ongoing strength in the do-it-yourself home-improvement market.Home Depot is No. 14 in the IBD Big Cap 20 in the latest IBD Weekly.Please see the top of page A2 in the current IBD Weekly print edition. The ""Vital Signs"" economic shapshot of three housing industry-related graphs showed that the supply of existing homes for sale in February dropped 6.4% vs. a year ago. ""Tight supply is limiting choices and boosting prices. That's good news for new-home sales, which jumped last month to their second-best reading of the current recovery,"" IBD noted in the commentary adjacent to the charts. Visa (V) is second best in the Dow with a 96 EPS Rating, meaning that its long- and short-term earnings growth is superior to 96% of all publicly traded companies. The megacap firm is acting well following its Jan. 24 breakout past a shallow cup-with-handle-like base at 82.59.Wall Street expects Visa to post a 16% jump in fiscal second-quarter profit to 79 cents a share on an 18% bump up in revenue to $4.29 billion. For FY 2017, ending in September, analysts currently forecast EPS up 17% to $3.32 a share and revenue up 18% to $17.73 billion.Boeing (BA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also deserve close watch as all three have decent dividend yields that are higher than the 1.95% yield for the S&P 500 itself. Plus, all three stocks have shown nice advances following their own breakouts.Cisco sports the highest annualized yield among the three at 3.4%, followed by Boeing at 3.2% and JPMorgan at 2.3%.Solid earnings prospects are likely one key driver of these three stocks' current moves up.The Street sees earnings in FY 2017 rising 29% to $9.31 a share for Boeing, 4% to $6.57 for JPMorgan (followed by a 15% jump in FY 2018), and 1% to $2.38 for Cisco, which would mark the eighth straight year of increasing profits.Gold miners fell sharply and were the biggest decliners among 197 industry groups and subgroups covered by IBD. Greenwood Village, Colo.-based heavyweight Newmont Mining (NEM) slid more than 3% to 32.91 and continues to struggle since falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages on Feb. 22 and 27, respectively.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of Newmont is positive at a B-, but that's more than offset by a poor Relative Price Strength Rating of 39 on a scale of 1 to 99. In general, focus on those companies with excellent growth in sales, profits and an RS Rating of 80 or higher. Snap (SNAP) sank nearly 4% to 22.95, which is a natural pullback following strong gains in the prior six sessions.A key technical line of support and resistance for Snap may in fact be the 10-day moving average, which responds more quickly than the traditional 50-day line. For now, Snap showed bullish action when the stock burst back above the 10-day line on March 22 in the sixth highest volume in a single session since its March 2 debut.If Snap holds its recent gains, expect the 10-day line to keep rising and catch up with the stock itself. The 50-day moving average won't show up on a Snap daily chart until late May.You can see the 10-day moving average in green in all Leaderboard charts. In Leaderboard, markets writers and editors note when a sharp decline below the 10-day line following a strong breakout and gains of 10% to 15% or more can provide a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The highly popular social media firm will clearly need plenty of time and a strong rebound in order to fashion the possibility of a good breakout.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should Snap Stay On Your Watch List?Stock Market Today II: Is It Time To Add These 7 Chip Industry Leaders To Your Portfolio?Stock Market Today III: Why You Could Hold These 7 Dow-30 Stocks Longer For NowHow To Invest: First, Know The General Market Direction Via The Big PictureWhat To Buy: These Stocks Are Near The Proper Buy Zone

60,NEM,"Gold prices slid 2.9% on Thursday to a 10-month low while silver prices crashed 7% as markets continued to react to the Federal Reserve's more hawkish policy outlook for 2017 amid President-elect Donald Trump's plan to step on the fiscal accelerator.While hiking its key interest rate a quarter-point on Wednesday, as expected, Fed policymakers signaled a likelihood of three more rate hikes in coming year vs. the two 2017 hikes telegraphed in September.Fed intentions helped lift the U.S. dollar index to the highest level since January 2003, a negative for gold, which is priced in dollars and whose safe-haven demand as a store of value is being tarnished by a stronger dollar and improving growth. The Spdr Gold Trust ETF (GLD) fell 1%, setting a 10-month low.Shares of gold miners including Barrick Gold (ABX), Royal Gold (RGLD) and Newmont Mining (NEM) have been among the biggest laggards in the Trump rally. The IBD Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems group is rated 194 out of 197 industry groups based on stock price performance.On the stock market today, Barrick lost 5%, hitting a multimonth low intraday after sliding 6.4% on Wednesday. Royal Gold gave up 6%, on the heels of Wednesday's 4.0% decline. Newmont shares sank 2.4% on Thursday after skidding 6.5% a day earlier.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Freeport McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper mining companies and among the best ways to play the copper rally, cleared a buy point at 13.69 on Nov. 10 and quickly became extended, surging 21% in two weeks. The stock has pulled back, but is worth keeping on your watch list. Visit IBD Leaderboard to keep track of leading stocks like Freeport and others nearing a buy point.Silver Wheaton (SLW), which owns rights to gold and silver production at various mines, tumbled 8.8% after Wednesday's 3% skid.""Investors might conclude that even with higher rates looming for 2017, U.S. equities will remain the asset class of choice for most,"" wrote INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.Investors looking for a safe store of value in this climate may have reason to turn to other metals — those with more industrial applications. IBD's Mining-Metal Ores group has been among the biggest winners of the Trump rally, helped in part by his agenda for an infrastructure-spending binge.Since Nov. 8, gold prices have fallen close to 12%, while copper is up about 9%, though copper prices had been firming before the election on a more favorable supple-demand balance.Freeport McMoRan (FCX), a leading stock in the group, is also a gold miner, but it derived 67% of revenue in 2015 from sale of copper and 10% from gold, with oil and molybdenum accounting for most of the balance. Shares of Freeport rose as high as 14.97 but reversed lower to trade down 4 cents at 14.61.Mining giants Rio Tinto (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP) fell 2% and 1.4%, respectively.RELATED:Fed Sees 3 More Hikes In 2017; 'Fiscal Boost Not Needed,' Yellen SaysWhy Some Strategists Still Like Gold Despite Its Recent WeaknessProfit Recession Is Over, Here Comes The Best Earnings Growth Since 2014

61,NEM,"FBI Director James Comey may or may not have bungled the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email, depending on one's point of view, but his October surprise on Friday did bolster the argument that stocks are in for a bout of selling if Donald Trump is elected.Just how much major stock indexes would fall is unclear, with various estimates ranging from about 5% to 12%. But those estimates came before the S&P sank 0.7% on Tuesday to a near-four-month low amid Trump's continued rise in the polls. The size of a Clinton relief rally is likely to be much smaller because markets have priced in the likelihood — though a diminishing one — of a Clinton victory.The PredictIt prediction market shows that Trump's odds of victory jumped from 22% on Thursday to 30% on Friday after news that the FBI had reopened its investigation in Clinton's use of personal email to send classified materials. On Tuesday, Trump's chances were up to 34%. The IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll on Tuesday showed Clinton hanging onto a 1-point edge over Trump, down from 4 points a few days earlier. Some other polls showed Trump with a slight edge.For the third time this election cycle, a political bombshell dropped that swiftly changed the state of the race and rippled through financial markets while there were no other major market-moving events. In each of those cases — Trump's stumble during the first presidential debate, the release of a tape with Trump talking about women in a crude, explicit way, and now the Comey reversal — the stock market clearly revealed its anti-Trump bias.Those financial market ripples have been modest because Trump has remained a significant underdog throughout the campaign, with markets pricing in more or less tail risk of a Trump presidency as his prospects rise and fall.The latest turn hit markets at 1 p.m. ET on Friday, sending the S&P 500 down 1% over the next hour. Ford Motor (F), one of Trump's campaign punching bags for its plans to shift small car production to Mexico, quickly lost about 1.9% of its value before recovering somewhat. Meanwhile, the Mexican peso sank by more than 1% in dollar terms, a large swing for a currency, on the rising odds of a Trump presidency that could bring a border wall, tariffs and the end of Nafta.The drop in the peso came even as the dollar was falling against other major currencies. Gold shares were the rare beneficiaries of Trump's revived hopes, with Newmont Mining (NEM) shares jumping 3.5% in little over an hour. Gold stocks have continued to rally.IBD'S TAKE: Divided government, still the election's most likely outcome, was good for the stock market under President Obama and Bill Clinton, but will it be again? Quite possibly, but don't take it for granted. For a primer on how to know if the market is ripe for gains and it's a favorable time to establish new positions, visit IBD University. Then read The Big Picture each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend.After the first debate, University of Michigan economics professor Justin Wolfers asserted that the scale of both the drop in Trump's odds of victory and the simultaneous rise in the S&P sent a very precise message about investor expectations: ""Stocks may lose 10% to 12% of their value if he wins the November election.""Macroeconomic Advisers said in early October that a Trump win would cause stocks to fall 8%, while a Clinton victory would lead to a 2% rise.Yet such predictions carry a high degree of uncertainty and depend on other electoral outcomes. For example, markets may be more happy with Clinton as president if Republicans control the House and can stymie her plans to raise taxes. On the other hand, markets may not be too happy to see Clinton take office under such a cloud of ethics problems that may exacerbate the toxic relationship between Congress and the White House.RELATED:These Gold, Silver Stocks Are Flashing Buy Signals On Trump, DollarAre Markets Voting For Clinton — Or For Divided Government?

62,NEM,"Donald Trump's unexpected presidential win shook up global markets, triggering a major sector rotation. Alibaba (BABA) reported solid sales for Singles Day. Walt Disney sees better growth, but not until 2018, while most department stores generally see a positive holiday season while Nvidia (NVDA) led strong chip results.Stock futures crashed Tuesday night as Donald Trump won the presidential election, but rallied Wednesday as investors saw upside to his tax and infrastructure plans. Investors rushed into banks, drugs, materials-related stocks and out of big-name techs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), as well as defensive consumer staples and gunmakers. The Dow soared 5.4% for the week, its best since December 2011, hitting a record high Thursday. The S&P 500 jumped 3.8%, its best week in two years, rebounding above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq also rose 3.8% but ended the week below its 50-day. Gold prices initially jumped on Trump's win but crashed  as stocks rallied, Treasury yields skyrocketed and Fed rate-hike expectations firmed. Copper prices boomed. Nvidia and Priceline (PCLN) were among leading stocks reporting strong results.Top chip companies Nvidia, Microchip Technology (MCHP), MaxLinear (MXL) and Microsemi (MSCC) saw their stocks rise after posting better-than-expected quarterly results. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia earned 84 cents a share, up 91% year over year, on sales of $2 billion, up 54%. Wall Street expected 57 cents and $1.69 billion. Nvidia also raised its Q4 sales target above views. Microchip EPS rose 42% and sales 56%. MaxLinear also topped views, though guidance was weak due to legacy-product declines. Nvidia shares skyrocketed 30% on Friday to a new high. For the week so far, Microchip rose 4.8%, MaxLinear 12% and Microsemi 9.7%.Walt Disney (DIS) missed fiscal Q4 estimates and warned that 2017 would be ""an anomaly"" in its growth arc, with the box-office-melting success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" making for a tough year-over-year comparison. But investors may already be looking to fiscal 2018, when Disney will release four Marvel movies and two more ""Star Wars"" films. Disney also said that the factors that have caused ESPN to lose subscribers ""have abated,"" and that the sports network would likely continue to grow as ESPN adapts to more digital platforms. Disney shares rose nearly 6% for the week so far.Macy's (M) missed Q3 estimates but cited strong results from Apple and Michael Kors (KORS) products that should continue in the current holiday quarter. (But luxury apparel maker Kors itself warned on its holiday sales). Macy's raised its full-year same-store sales forecast. Kohl's (KSS) reported Q3 EPS and revenue above expectations, with strong back-to-school and October sales that should continue into the holiday season. Nordstrom (JWN) crushed EPS growth estimates. The upscale department store operator raised its full year EPS guidance to $2.85-$2.95, well above Wall Street estimates. However, J.C. Penney (JCP) sales missed expectations and cut its sales forecast.But shares of all four retailers enjoyed double-digit percentage gains for the week.Priceline reported Q3 earnings and revenue that topped estimates, sending its shares to an all-time high. Priceline also said interim CEO Brett Keller is taking over as permanent chief executive, effective immediately. TripAdvisor (TRIP), a Priceline rival, reported weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue, sending shares falling.E-commerce giant Alibaba Group processed $17.8 billion worth of sales on China's biggest online shopping day of the year, known as Singles Day. That busted last year's record of $14.3 billion. But growth slowed to 24% from 60% last year. Alibaba takes a small percentage of sales for managing the transaction for vendors. Alibaba shares fell 1.4% Friday, extending a slide since late September.The Singles Day event towers over the U.S. shopping events known as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Black Friday last year had total sales of $4.5 billion, and Cyber Monday had $3 billion.Chinese online game maker and portal NetEase (NTES) earned $3.42 per U.S. share excluding items in the third quarter, up 47%. Sales rose 38% to $1.38 billion in Q3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected NetEase to earn $2.89 per share excluding items on sales of $1.43 billion. Online games accounted for 71% of revenue. NetEase tumbled 3.6% for the week afternoon, falling significantly below its 50-day line for the first time since April.Gold prices skyrocketed Tuesday night as stock futures and the dollar initially tumbled on fears that a Trump win would spur massive selling and put the Fed on ice. But with stocks actually faring well and bond yields spiking, gold prices quickly reversed for a weekly loss of more than 6%, the worst since 2013. Gold mining stocks that retook some key technical levels went back down. Newmont Mining (NEM) fell 16%, Barrick Gold (ABX) 19%. Meanwhile, industrial miners rallied as Trump infrastructure plans lifted copper, other industrial metals and materials.China-based Momo (MOMO) reported Q3 earnings that beat estimates, which the company credited to its success with live video. The provider of a video streaming website and mobile social platform said revenue surged 319% to $157 million, soaring past estimates of $130.5 million. Momo sees Q4 revenue of $185 million-$190 million, above forecasts for $140.2 million.But Momo's stock, which initially rose to a new high, reversed sharply lower to trade down more than 8%.Acacia Communications (ACIA) late Thursday reported Q3 earnings minus items that rose 240% to $1.01, as revenue jumped 107% to $135.3 million. Analysts had modeled non-GAAP EPS of 81 cents and revenue of $130.8 million after Acacia revised guidance twice during the quarter. The maker of high-speed optical devices for communications networks sees adjusted EPS of 85-92 cents vs. views of 78 cents. But revenue of $138.5 million at the midpoint of its guidance is just above the consensus for $137.2 million. Acacia fell 1% Friday but rose 12.8% for the week.Fabrinet (FN) late Monday said fiscal Q1 EPS leapt 78% to 80 cents while revenue was up 53% to $332 million, its fourth straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat analyst estimates. Fabrinet also gave upbeat EPS and sales guidance for the current Q2. Fabrinet shares rose 8.9% for the week.Oil prices initially rose but closed down 1.5% to $43.41 a barrel — the third straight weekly slide — amid concerns about rising supply and weak demand. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has called for less regulation and more drilling for the U.S. industry, which could ultimately boost supply further. Weekly U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.43 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, an increase that was above analyst expectations. OPEC said its October production hit a record high, adding doubts that it will finalize and implement a production-cut agreement. The International Energy Agency warned that sluggish economic growth will continue to weigh on oil demand, and ConocoPhillips (COP) cut its capital spending for next year.

64,NEM,"U.S. stock indexes suffered their worst losses in about five weeks in Tuesday afternoon trade.The Nasdaq severed 1.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average slashed off 1% and 0.8%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 led the losers with a 1.5% drop. Volume in the stock market today was emphatically higher on both major exchanges.Utilities provided no shelter, as the Dow Jones utility average pulled back 0.6%. Gold, though, was a different story. The iShares Gold Trust (IAU) exchange traded fund gapped up 0.9%, and IBD's gold-mining industry group surged 0.8%.Newmont Mining (NEM) raced more than 3% higher, as it scored a new high.Finding winners among top-rated stocks was a hard task. In the IBD 50, only three stocks rose, and only one showed strong volume. GrubHub (GRUB), a provider of online takeout orders for restaurants, grabbed a 1% gain in volume 50% above average.Among lower-rated stocks, freight logistics provider Expeditors International (EXPD) broke out of a base dating to October. The stock jumped 4% in volume 140% above average. Expeditors beat Wall Street's consensus number on earnings but fell a bit shy on revenue. The Seattle-based company's EPS Rating is 69, which means about 30% of the companies in IBD's database are growing earnings faster.West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures slid 2%, falling below $40 a barrel.

65,NEM,"Gold prices slid further Wednesday as investors awaited clues on the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate decision later this week. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other central bankers are set to meet in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this weekend for their annual symposium.The precious metal came under pressure last week when a slew of hawkish comments from policymakers following bullish jobs data raised the odds of monetary tightening.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), a commodity ETF, slipped 1.1% on the stock market today, closing below the 50-day moving average as it fell to its lowest level since July 27.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), which invests in gold stocks, tumbled 7.1% as it fell solidly under that 50-day key line of technical strength. Top holdings like Barrick Gold (ABX) and Newmont Mining (NEM) were gouged as much as 10%. (IBD)Gold prices hit a four-week low in early Wednesday trading, pressured by bearish outside markets, wrote Jim Wyckoff, a Kitco senior technical analyst.""Some sell-stop orders were triggered in the futures market after key near-term technical support levels were breached,"" Wyckoff said. ""Also, the outside markets are in a bearish posture for the precious metals on this day, as crude oil prices are lower, and the U.S. dollar index is higher.""In an email to IBD, Wyckoff noted that while gold prices are in a near-term downtrend, the trend over the past year ""suggests the path of least resistance will remain up, until a bearish technical signal occurs."" The close below the 50-day Wednesday for GLD and GDX could be interpreted by some investors as bearish.However, an Oppenheimer analyst believes the long-term turnaround for the precious metal commodity should stay in play.""Recent weakness is occurring following a strong uptrend rather than coming out of a major topping pattern,"" Ari Wald, an Oppenheimer senior technical analyst, told IBD in an e-mail. Wald said he would be more concerned if the weakness was preceded by a lengthy period of distribution. He also noted that the U.S. dollar was not breaking higher.""Due to their inverse correlation, I'd be more concerned that renewed strength in the dollar would derail this year's reversal in commodities priced in dollars. (The U.S. Dollar Index) has instead been more range-bound and is showing signs of continued long-term moderation, which is a positive for the price of gold rather than a negative.""Wald added: ""We would view any weakness over the coming weeks as healthy consolidation ahead of gold's next leg higher.""VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), investing in small-cap mining stocks, dropped roughly 8% Wednesday and also lost support at the 50-day.Silver commodity and mining ETFs also carved out losses, including a 1.7% fall for iShares Silver Trust (SLV).SLV fell below its 50-day Monday and remains stuck below that level. It has given up most of its gains since its late June breakout from a cup-with-handle base.Global X Silver Miners (SIL) fell 8% and also cut through its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: The gold, silver and gem mining industry group has outpaced 196 peers this year.

68,NEM,"Stocks bets against a successful Trump presidency did nicely on Monday after his first big legislative initiative ended in massive failure.After the flop of RyanCare, which died on Friday before it even came to the House floor for a vote, hospital operators HCA Holdings (HCA) and Universal Health Services (UHS) were the best-performing S&P 500 issues.Shares of HCA jumped 5.2% and Universal Health surged 3.35% on the stock market today, while Tenet Healthcare (THC) closed up 1.4%, amid relief that House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to slash Medicaid spending has been tabled. Centene (CNC), a Medicaid-focused insurer with a big presence on the ObamaCare exchanges, gained 2.2%, and rival Molina Healthcare (MOH) rose 2.75%, as it continued to recover from a 30-month low hit early last week.But health care stocks weren't the only group expected to suffer under Trump's policies that were shining on Monday.Gold miners also rose as the precious metal appreciated to a one-month high on Monday. Newmont Mining (NEM) gained 1.3% and Royal Gold (RGLD) 2.4%. Gold prices perked up as the dollar and 10-year Treasury yield extended their recent declines amid doubts about President Trump's ability to deliver the promised fiscal fuel of tax cuts and infrastructure spending. IBD'S TAKE: The quick and sudden flop of RyanCare proved that President Trump knows how to cut losses. Expect him to do the same with deficit-neutral tax reform and quickly shift to old-fashioned, deficit-increasing tax cuts.Meanwhile, industrial commodity stocks were among the bigger losers amid concerns that faster growth might not materialize to improve the supply-demand balance.Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) fell 4.7%, while oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) lost 3.3%. Morgan Stanley (MS) shed 2.1% as falling market interest rates weighed on the entire financial sector.Most big health insurer stocks were lower on Monday, which might seem surprising after the demise of Ryan's plan that was estimated to shrink the ranks of the insured by 24 million.Dow component UnitedHealth (UNH) slipped 0.2%, while Anthem (ANTM) lost 0.3%. The investor reaction may be because health insurers would have benefited from the repeal of ObamaCare's health insurance tax and a further delay of its 40% tax on employer sponsored insurance plans that exceed a so-called ""Cadillac"" threshold. Further, health insurers pay tend to pay high tax rates and stand to benefit from a big cut in the corporate income-tax rate.RELATED:Stocks End Off Lows: ObamaCare Repeal Dead, Long Live Tax Cuts?Health Care Stocks Socked Again After CBO RyanCare ScoreFreeport-McMoRan Restarts Huge Mine; Rival Miners DiveThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

70,NEM,"The Federal Reserve hiked its key interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday, signaling that two more rate hikes are likely this year, just as financial markets were expecting.After a hawkish shift that had taken markets by surprise a few weeks back, it seems that the Fed and investors are on the same page, at least for now.With the Fed still projecting three rate hikes in 2018, Fed chief Janet Yellen said in her post-meeting press conference that policymakers' projections of future interest-rate policy were ""essentially unchanged"" since December.That signals the Fed isn't worried about being behind the curve, even as Yellen expressed her ""confidence in the path the economy's on,"" noting a somewhat firmer pace of business investment and acceleration in jobs gains to an average of about 200,000 per month added over the past three months.After the Fed's announcement, broad market indexes added to gains on the stock market today, and kept rising following Yellen's comments. The Dow industrials rose 0.5%, the S&P 500 index 0.8% and the Nasdaq composite 0.7%. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hit an all-time high, with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) all reaching record levels intraday.The 10-year Treasury yield fell nine basis points to 2.50%, after running up to its best levels in more than two years as markets priced in a March rate hike.Higher rates are generally a positive for financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Dow Jones industrial average components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which can reap higher net interest margins from a steeper yield curve. But with the Fed sticking to its rate hike schedule, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs turned slightly negative while JPMorgan Chase clung to a 0.2% gain.Faster monetary policy tightening could put further upward pressure on mortgage rates and might be a negative for shares of homebuilders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI). Still, even amid rising rates in recent weeks, the homebuilder group has been on fire, with Toll and Lennar among a raft of stocks breaking out of bases amid strong earnings and expectations for what is expected to be a strong spring selling season.The National Association of Home Builders said Wednesday that its Housing Market Index for March jumped to its best level in nearly 12 years.Toll, Lennar and D.R. Horton rallied about 1% after the Fed signaled just two more hikes in 2017.A proactive Fed also could continue to drag down gold miners like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX). The price of gold has slumped close to 5% since late February as the market priced in a faster pace of rate hikes and the dollar has strengthened. But gold prices firmed after the Fed release while the dollar retreated.IBD'S TAKE: Just three weeks ago, odds of a rate hike at the March meeting looked slim. Yet Fed policymakers have recently signaled impatience to keep raising interest rates, even as the prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.Markets had been anticipating a rate hike since a series of hawkish Fed policymaker comments on Feb. 28 turned expectations for the March meeting upside down. Fed Chair Janet Yellen, widely seen as among the more dovish members of the rate-setting committee, sealed expectations with her March 3 speech saying a rate hike this month would likely be appropriate. She also endorsed Fed members' December projection of three rate hikes in 2017 as likely to be appropriate.President Trump still has three Fed governor openings to fill, so it's very possible that the makeup of the committee will get more hawkish as the year progresses. Still, economic data will be the biggest factor. Yellen noted in her recent speech, which came before March's 235,000 job gain, that recent job growth of around 180,000 per month is ""notably above the level estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth — between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.""In December, Yellen was widely believed to be among the doves projecting just two rates hikes in 2017. With Yellen having moved to the center, the big question going into the meeting was whether the center itself would move in a more hawkish direction. That could happen if the job market stays as hot as it has been the past couple of months, but the new Fed projections should give markets some comfort. Here's why: Back in December, there were 5 Fed committee members expecting four or more rate hikes in 2017. The new statement shows that there are still only five hawks, while nine members projected a total of three hikes in 2017 and three members saw even slower tightening.Yellen noted that expectations for future rate hikes were based on incoming economic information, rather than seen as a preemptive way to combat inflation that might percolate if Trump and Congress pass an economic stimulus program. She added that the rate-setting committee will have plenty of time to respond once the fiscal policy outlook becomes clear.RELATED:Oil Up, Metals Stocks Jump; These 5 Sectors Are Rising After Fed Rate HikeJPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Pare Gains After Fed Rate HikeFebruary Jobs Growth Strong, But Not Too Strong To Unnerve Investors, FedYellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017Fed March Rate Hike Odds Double As Dudley Says Move 'CompellingS'

74,NEM,"Oil's decline and China's woes have pushed the equities market into a deep freeze.Hardly a day passes without negative stock market news that adds ice to the market chill. The S&P 500 is down nearly 8% so far this year. Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index -- a widely followed cross-section of the U.S. investment grade bond market -- is up about 1.6%.Investors fear for the health of their investment strategies in general and their retirement planning in particular.But stock investors should take heart in history. Stocks rarely lag bonds for a full calendar year.In the 25 years since 1990, stocks in the form of the S&P 500 have outperformed the Barclays Agg, as it's often referred to, in 19 calendar years prior to 2016.In those 25 year plus the beginning of this year through Feb. 1, the S&P 500 has enjoyed a 9.56% average annual gain vs. only 6.18% for the Barclays Agg, according to T. Rowe Price.If you had invested $10,000 in the S&P 500 on Dec. 31, 1990, by Feb. 2 it would have ballooned into nearly $100,000. In the Barclays Agg it would have grown less than half as much, to less than $45,000.Still, when stocks lagged during that quarter century, they tended to underperform for more than a year at a time.They lagged the Barclays Agg in the years 2000 through 2002, then again in 2007 and 2008. The also underperformed in the single calendar year of 2011.Yet even this year, while the S&P 500 is trailing the Barclays Agg, some stocks in the index are outperforming. Several are decent -- not dramatic -- dividend yielders.Newmont Mining (NEM) is up 40% for the year. Gold is serving its traditional role as a safe haven from equities while stocks are down.Newmont has a robust 89 Composite Rating from IBD. It also pays a 0.4% dividend yield. Earnings per share grew 109% and 30% for two quarters before declining 54% in the third quarter.The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Telecom giant AT&T (T), which sports a 99 Comp Rating, is up 7% this year. Its dividend yield is 5.2%.EPS grew 11%, 14% and 25% the past three stanzas.WEC Energy Group (WEC), a utility, is up nearly 11% this year.

75,NEM,"Gold stocks such as Barrick Gold (ABX) and Newmont Mining (NEM) finished lower Wednesday, despite minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting showing policymakers were in no rush to act.Gold and silver mining stocks briefly rallied after the 2 p.m. Fed minutes release, but ended down, though still above intraday lows. Barrick Gold closed 2% lower on the stock market today. Newmont Mining dipped 0.65%.However, the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) ended virtually flat. Gold futures finished 0.6% lower at $1,348.80 per ounce, before the minutes came out, then regained some ground later to about $1,351.50. Silver settled down 1.1% at $19.648 an ounce but ticked up in late trade.The Fed minutes said that central bankers were divided on the labor market's trajectory but saw minimal risks to inflation. In general, they agreed that more data are needed before taking the next step.It's not clear how much investors should read into the July meeting minutes. Since then, we've gotten economic reports on Q2 GDP, as well as July jobs, manufacturing and retail data, as well as some early August figures.Still, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said Tuesday that a September rate hike was possible and that markets were underpricing the possibility of Fed action. Dudley, who's not seen as a policy hawk, may simply want to keep the Fed's options open, but his comments did grab investors attention.IBD'S TAKE: The Mining-Gold/Silver/Gems group is rated No. 1 out of IBD's 197 industries.

Some backed off after edging to the new highs, while others made clean thrusts.Silver Wheaton reports after the market close.A few other gold miners didn't make new highs but are showing strength in other ways.Randgold Resources (GOLD) bounced off its 10-week moving average line, potentially offering an entry. Barrick Gold (ABX) recently bounced off its 10-week line, but the stock could be forming a base. The pattern is in its fifth week and is about 17% deep.Blue chip stocks were mostly down.

78,NEM,"The Federal Reserve has been full of surprises lately, and there's good reason to expect another on Wednesday.Back in December, 11 of 17 members of the Fed's policy committee were expecting at least three rate hikes in 2017, and 5 members were expecting at least four hikes.Earlier this month, Fed Chair Janet Yellen, undoubtedly among those December doves penciling in two rate hikes, made clear that she now sees three hikes as appropriate. As Yellen moved to the center, the big question is whether the center itself moved. It wouldn't take much — perhaps only half of the six members who expected exactly three hikes in December to up their expectation by one notch.With the 10-year Treasury yield just below its highest levels since the spring of 2014, a shift in Fed expectations to four rate hikes this year might be the catalyst for a breakout to the upside. That might be good news for financials like Bank of America (BAC) and Dow Jones industrial average components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which can reap higher net interest margins from rising interest rates and a steeper yield curve. But it might be a negative for shares of homebuilders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Lennar (LEN) and D.R. Horton (DHI).In the past few weeks, BofA, JPMorgan and Goldman have consolidated as Treasury yields have soared. Meanwhile, the homebuilder group has been on fire, with Toll and Lennar among a raft of stocks breaking out of bases amid strong earnings and expectations for what is expected to be a strong spring selling season. But a further jump in market rates may begin to dampen the outlook.A more proactive Fed also could continue to drag down gold miners like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX). The price of gold has slumped close to 5% over the past two weeks as the market has priced in a faster pace of rate hikes and the dollar has strengthened.IBD'S TAKE: The Federal Reserve is getting impatient to raise interest rates even though prospects for a near-term economic stimulus from President Trump are diminishing.Already, the Fed's hawkish turn has been both sudden and pretty dramatic. After Yellen spent most of 2016 worrying aloud that the Fed was low on ammunition to combat a downturn, the first surprise came in December. While hiking rates a quarter-point as expected, Fed members' own projections indicated a likelihood of three rate hikes in 2017 — one more than projected in September.Yet markets didn't begin buying into the three rate-hike outlook until a series of hawkish Fed policymaker comments two weeks ago turned expectations for the March meeting upside down. Yellen sealed the rate hike with her March 3 speech saying a rate hike this month would likely be appropriate. She also endorsed the December projection of three rate hikes in 2017 as likely to be appropriate, assuming that the economy doesn't flash unexpected weakness.While Fed members' individual projections are anonymous, Fed watchers assumed in December that Yellen was among the doves. One fewer Fed member will make projections this month, with the retirement of Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart. He was probably among the doves, though that's not quite as clear.President Trump still has three Fed governor openings to fill, so it's very possible that the makeup of the committee will get more hawkish as the year progresses. Still, economic data will be the biggest factor. If the outlook doesn't shift to four 2017 rate hikes this month, more employment reports with 200,000-plus jobs added would certainly move the Fed in that direction by June.Currently, markets see a 56% chance of a second rate hike by the June meeting, with a third move likely but by no means assured as of December.RELATED:Yellen: March Rate Hike 'Appropriate,' Sees Three Hikes In 2017Fed March Rate Hike Odds Double As Dudley Says Move 'Compelling' ISM Manufacturing Index Surges To 30-Month High, Fueling Fed Hawks

79,NEM,"Strength in construction, financial and most technology shares helped the major indexes hold robust gains on the first day of March, noted by some analysts as one of the best performing months for equities over the past 10 years.The Nasdaq composite rallied 1.3%, helped by a more than 1% gain in Apple (AAPL) and strength in some semiconductor names. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.5% as of 1:50 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 up 1.4% and the small cap S&P 600 up 1.9%. Homebuilders such as Pulte Group (PHM) exemplified the continued strength in the cyclical construction industry. The major builder of entry-level homes and developer of retirement community housing jumped past a 22.08 cup-with-handle buy point, rising nearly 3% to 22.66.Volume is brisk, running 54% above normal levels. Pulte's 50-day average turnover is 5 million shares.Pulte's strong move follows the nice rally in 2017 by peer NVR Inc. (NVR), up 2% to 1,978.35. The stock on Jan. 25 blasted past a 1,845.47 cup entry and has so far risen more than 7%.In tech land, memory chip firm Micron Technology (MU), benefiting from positive analyst comments at Goldman Sachs, surged more than 5% to 24.54. Volume is running more than 30% above typical levels. Micron is acting like a true market leader, bouncing sharply off a test of the 50-day moving average last week. The stock is now up 33% past a recent flat-base breakout past 18.43.That base is part of a very long bottoming base pattern going back to Micron's 2014 peak of 36.59.Apple, rising 2% to 139.98, is getting close to nailing a 20% gain from a Jan. 6 breakout from a cup with handle at 118.12. The largest stock on the U.S. financial markets has also expanded its gain from a 110.33 bottoming base breakout to more than 26%, so investors may decide to take at least partial gains.Confidence is building in Apple's ability to maintain fast growth in its services businesses and confidence that the upcoming iPhone 8 model will be a big hit. Also, the stock is getting extra attention from news of Warren Buffett's big bet on the company.Not all techs were thriving. Data networking technology expert Inphi (IPHI) slumped for a sixth straight session, slipping more than 2% to 45.76 and piercing through its 50-day moving average in fast turnover. The Santa Clara, Calif., small cap has a tendency to shake investors out who buy at traditional base breakouts, such as its early October breakout past a 44.64 flat-base buy point. Yet the stock has also shown resilience after spending some time below the 50-day line.Plus, Inphi's uptrend since breaking out of a three-month double bottom at 33.69 in the summer of last year remains intact.Amid the continued strong U.S. dollar, gold shares have struggled as a group, and the gold and silver mining industry group has been laggard for months, ranking in the bottom quartile of IBD's 197 group rankings in terms of six-month relative performance.Goldcorp (GG) gapped down at the open and fell 1.3% to 15.74, marking what could be its eighth straight decline.

80,NEM,"If gold stocks are doing well, then investor doubts must be creeping in over all of those things that seemed like sure bets to tarnish gold's future after Donald Trump's election: corporate tax cuts, a big fiscal stimulus, and faster U.S. and global growth.On Monday, shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) rose 3.2% to finish at 37.94 on the stock market today, their highest close since the election. Newmont has bounced 23% from its post-election low as gold prices have now erased more than two-thirds of their losses, with prices for the precious metal rising 0.9% to $1,232.10 an ounce on Monday, the highest close since Nov. 10.The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD) rose 1.35% to 117.70, while the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were all modestly lower.What's amazing about gold's comeback is that it's happened even as the Dow finally crested 20,000 and was managing to hold that level Monday afternoon. Investors clearly haven't thrown in the towel on the President Trump reflation trade that initially killed gold stocks, but they may be hedging their bets somewhat. A potentially volatile period for European politics also is providing more reason to worry about downside risk.IBD'S TAKE: President Trump's agenda faces a large degree of uncertainty. If the WTO found the border tax backed by House Republicans — and increasingly by the White House — to be illegal, the GOP would face three difficult choices that could throw the ruling party into crisis.""The recent difficulty congressional Republicans have had in moving forward on Obamacare repeal does not bode well for reaching a quick agreement on tax reform or infrastructure funding, and reinforces our view that a fiscal boost, if it happens, is mostly a 2018 story,"" Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips wrote late last week.Goldman cut the odds to just 20% that Congress will pass a border tax adjustment, which would tax imports but not exports, as part of corporate tax reform. The controversial proposal is under attack from big importers like Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), while big exporters like Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE) rally in support.Here's the real concern for investors, says Brian Gardner, Washington analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods: The border tax ""is the linchpin for the GOP plan, and without it, the tax reform effort could collapse.""The postelection rally was based on expectations that Trump would push hard on the pro-growth aspects of his agenda and de-emphasize other key campaign themes about restricting trade and immigration, Goldman says. But now Goldman sees increasing odds that tax cuts will get bogged down in the legislative process as the populist aspects of Trump's agenda come  to the fore.Rising populism may have been the primary driver of gold prices on Monday, as investors weighed a more uncertain future for the eurozone.In France, a financial scandal threatened to sink the candidacy of center-right front-runner Francois Fillon, suddenly boosting the chances of Marine Le Pen, who wants to break from the euro.Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's re-election contest suddenly looks like it could be a dogfight. Reflecting greater uncertainty about the future of the euro, government bond yields in France and Italy jumped to the highest levels since mid-2015.Gold prices ended last week on a positive note after the Labor Department reported unexpectedly soft wage gains to start the year, while the Federal Reserved signaled that it was in no rush to hike rates as it awaits evidence that a surge in economic confidence after Trump's election actually translates into a pickup in growth.RELATED:Strong Job Growth, Sad Wage Gains For U.S. In JanuaryWhy Trump Immigration Order May Weigh On Stocks

The price of gold is a key driver of gold mining companies' profits, and their stock prices. Typically, an increase in gold's price has a bullish impact on these businesses' profitability. A decrease works the other way, of course.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the $29.74 billion exchange traded fund that tracks the performance of the price of physical bullion, has jumped 16% year to date through Feb. 24.Mining stocks have exploded in popularity as gold has risen.

It dribbled away $1.43 billion in June, $3.77 billion in Q2 and $6.31 billion since the start of 2016.Assets in QQQ have shrunk this year to $34.59 billion.Its woes hardly mean all its stock holdings have been duds.

100,NEM,"Gold's spike to a one-year high Thursday has gold bugs asking: Could the metal's glory days be here again? It's a remarkable turnaround for what was the worst-performing broad asset class last year.ETF investors have scurried to shelter in the safe-haven asset as stocks plunge, the dollar tumbles, yields trend lower, and Japan follows Europe down the uncertain path of negative interest rates. The overarching worry is a slowdown in world economies, with China at the epicenter.Gold's bullish momentum is a testament to its role in investment portfolios for managing and mitigating risk, said Juan Carlos Artigas, director of investment research at World Gold Council.""In the world we live in, we do not know when we will experience a huge pullback in the equity markets,"" Artigas said. ""But what we do know is, the magnitude and frequency of these events have increased over time.""SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest exchange traded fund backed by physical bullion, gapped up nearly 5% Thursday to a 52-week intraday high of 120.84. The massive volume that accompanied the move testifies to institutional demand for yellow metal.Investors of all stripes have poured $1.98 billion of fresh money into the $26.86 billion ETF, year to date. Last year, it leaked $2.23 billion, according to etf.com data.Year to date through Feb. 10, GLD vaulted 13% vs. a 9% dive for the market-proxy SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).After a decade-long bull market that peaked in late 2011, gold shuffled along as stocks shone.Now, the metal appears ready to leave the sloth behind.GLD is trading above its 200-day moving average for only the third time in the past year and for the first time since October. Its bolting Relative Strength line shows it's outperforming the S&P 500 index.Frank Holmes, co-portfolio manager of U.S. Global Investors Gold & Precious Metals Fund (USERX), believes this gold rally could be the real deal for three reasons.The stock market plunge in the U.S. is mirrored in China and India -- two nations with ravenous gold appetites, he noted. Plus, real interest rates are falling, and the Federal Reserve has signaled banks should prepare for the possibility of negative nominal rates.And he describes ""smart money"" -- U.S. money managers and hedge funds -- as increasing their long bets on gold.According to a new World Gold Council report released Thursday, gold demand rebounded in the second half of 2015 after a turbulent first half.Global central bank demand jumped 25% in Q4 over the year-earlier quarter to 167 metric tons. Policymakers intensified their gold purchasing programs to diversify foreign reserves, the report said.China and India dominated the consumer market for gold jewelry, bars and coins, according to the report. The Asian nations accounted for 45% of total global demand last year.Investment demand grew 8% in 2015 over the previous year, the report said. Outflow from gold-backed ETFs persisted, but slowed, over the same period.Mine production fell 3% in Q4, as companies focused on cost-cutting and scaled back on exploration and project development.""It's clear that the mining industry faces a number of challenges as it continues to recalibrate, and it is likely gold production will see declines over the coming quarters,"" the study said.Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), the largest ETF holding gold mining stocks, broke out a long consolidation Monday. Its smaller-cap sibling Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) followed suit Thursday.GDX gained more than 7% Thursday in heavy trading volume. Investors who bought it at the breakout are looking at an 8% gain in four days.Miners aren't simply basking in higher gold prices, says Brandon Rakszawski, a product manager at Van Eck Global, the firm behind GDX and GDXJ. They're looking more profitable too, after years of indebtedness.""The gold mining industry has, over the last three to four years, undergone significant fundamental and structural improvements,"" he said.Larger companies have fared better than smaller peers, which tend to be more speculative and exploratory, he added.McEwen Mining (MUX), Klondex Mines (KLDX), Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) and Newmont Mining (NEM) have IBD Composite Ratings of more than 90 each.Gold and silver miners rank No. 6 among 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, up from 38 four week ago.Not everyone is bullish on gold or mining stocks, however.Investment firm Broadmeadow Capital has de-risked portfolios by allocating to defensive utilities and short-term Treasuries.""Currently, our models find commodities collectively unattractive, and our AlphaSector real assets model maintains no exposure to gold,"" said Chief Investment Officer Eric Biegeleisen.

102,NEM,"Major stock ETFs rose on Wednesday as oil topped $51 a barrel for the first time since July. Gold also spiked to a two-week-plus high.The S&P 500 is on a tear, notching a series of new highs for 2016 as investors cheer the commodity bull market and signs that major central banks will persist with market-friendly policies. The European Central Bank formally kicked off its corporate bond-buying program, aiming to boost inflation.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) forged a 3.3% gain on the stock market today.Royal Gold (RGLD) and Newmont Mining (NEM) shone among S&P 500 peers.Mining stocks are a spring-loaded play on gold. Receding odds of a rate hike this summer have boosted the precious metal, while weighing on the dollar. The greenback has slumped to its lowest level in more than a month. That is a positive for gold, which becomes more expensive for non-U.S. buyers when the greenback appreciates.The dollar's dive is also helping another key commodity -- crude oil. U.S. crude oil futures added 87 cents to $51.23 a barrel. Supply disruptions in Nigeria and signs of an easing in U.S. stockpiles are also propping up prices.SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) popped more than 1% in morning trade but closed down 0.8%. Signs of growing gasoline stockpiles caused the energy sector to reverse lower.Pioneer Energy Services (PES) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) were among stocks that advanced in the S&P 500.Strength in the commodities market helped industrials top advancing S&P 500 sectors.Commodity-backed emerging market ETFs led international peers.IShares MSCI Brazil Capped (EWZ) climbed 5.1%, for a six consecutive session of gains.Stock indexes closed near session highs. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is within striking distance of its 52-week high of 213.34.Here's a look at how major exchange traded funds, tracking various asset classes, performed today.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.3%, RS 57PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.2%, RS 49SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), +0.4%, RS 57IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.5%, RS 65IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +0.7%, RS 57IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), +0.2%, RS 40Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +0.8%, RS 49SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), +1.5%, RS 68United States Oil (USO), +1.7%, RS 36IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), 0%, RS 44PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), -0.3%, RS 27IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +0.5%, RS 3

"
104,NEM,"U.S. stocks showed reluctance to move much in either direction Monday afternoon, and stock breakouts remain razor-thin. Gold stocks, meanwhile, appear poised for further decline as the underlying commodity is facing some headwinds.Those headwinds could get stronger if investors' consensus builds that the Federal Reserve shows more a willingness to raise short-term interest rates more quickly than originally thought. A hike in the fed funds rate at the U.S. central bank's June 14-15 meeting would indicate its belief that some belt-tightening is in order following stronger than expected increases in consumer-level prices and workers' wages lately.The S&P 500 was virtually flat in mid-afternoon trade, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite lifted 0.2%, helped by a strong Monday start by Apple (AAPL), still one of the largest companies in the U.S. market. Apple gained nearly 2% to 96.86 on news indicating that the tech giant sees robust sales of future iPhone 7 models.In the stock market today, leading gold stocks weren't making much of a move, but they are clearly losing some momentum with near-term gold commodity futures down more than 3% since the end of April. Spot prices for gold were at $1,248 an ounce, down 0.3%. Gold maintains strong year-to-date gains, up nearly 18% since Jan. 1.However, some of the largest gold miners by market cap took a beating last week and are not showing much strength today. Goldcorp (GG) is vying for a third straight gain, but has recouped only a small fraction of last Wednesday's 7.7% drubbing in heavy trade. It's trying to stay above its rising 50-day moving average. Wall Street has recently shaved its full-year profit estimates, but earnings are still seen rebounding 329% to 30 cents a share. In 2011, Goldcorp earned $2.21 a share.Goldcorp currently shows a solid 88 Relative Strength Rating. How do other gold miners fare? Compare them with IBD's proprietary research tool, Stock Checkup.South African miner Anglogold Ashanti (AU) is showing similar action, up slightly on Monday but still struggling to claw back above its 50-day line. Healthy leading stocks often trade so strong that they don't touch their 50-day moving averages for many weeks following a good breakout. Anglogold has posted a nice run since clearing a bottoming base at 10.05 in heavy trade on Feb. 4. Randgold (GOLD), down 1% in lackluster volume so far, has been subdued beneath its 50-day line since an 11% gap down May 4 following Q1 results the same day. Randgold posted a 12% rise in earnings per share on a 16% revenue boost, but net margin fell.Newmont Mining (NEM) continues to outperform the bunch, rising nearly 1%. The global gold producer has a relatively light debt load; its long-term debt to equity ratio of 54% at the end of 2015 compares favorably with that of Anglogold Ashanti (109%). Goldcorp boasts an LTD-to-equity ratio of just 21%.Following a mini-rebound in biotech shares last week, as seen in a 4% gain last week by the iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) ETF, the medical sector continues to gain headway on Monday. Edwards Lifesciences (EW), member of IBD Leaderboard and up 27% year-to-date, reclaimed its 50-day moving average with a 1.5% gain in nearly flat trading.WellCare Health Plans (WCG) burst 3% higher to 98.36 in volume running 27% higher than usual. The managed health insurer has an average daily volume of 436,000 shares. The stock has retaken a 94.31 buy point in a long cup with handle. Earlier breakouts on March 29 and April 30 failed to stick, reflecting the challenging environment for breakout traders. Plus, the stock has had trouble cracking through the 96-98 price level since March 2015.However, one good sign for WellCare is that recent movement had quieted down, showing less willingness among institutions to dump shares. The RS line is also moving sharply higher. WellCare recently reported a 100% jump in Q1 profit, following gains of 69% and 46% in the two prior quarters, on revenue increases of 1%-2%. While the Composite Rating is not hot at 81, the Street sees 2016 profit rising 34% to $4.65 a share.

105,NEM,"What seemed like a sprint for precious-metal mining ETFs now has the makings of a marathon.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) surged early in 2016, a solid comeback after three consecutive years of losses. The bellwether commodity ETF then took a breather in March, but saw another burst of energy in April, pumping up 5%.A standout season bodes well for this asset class, according to VanEck, a provider of innovative fund investments.CEO Jan van Eck believes commodities have bottomed, as global demand -- whether it's for natural gas, oil or metals -- has at long last caught up to oversupplied conditions.As a provider of commodity-related exchange traded funds, VanEck may seem to have an obvious ax to grind. But he buttresses his view of a bright outlook with this reasoning:The bottom line for van Eck: ""This is a great longer-term opportunity. Don't obsess about the correct entry point.""VanEck on Monday announced a new branding name, renaming its Market Vectors ETFs as VanEck Vectors ETFs. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) was up 88% this year through Friday.Commodities can help to cushion portfolios in periods of stock market volatility, as 2016 has shown.IShares MSCI Global Gold Miners (RING) made a 52-week high Thursday. RING soared 56.2% in Q1, and an additional 30.4% in April.Last month, it saw $8.5 million in net inflow, growing assets to $133.1 million.The ETF's largest country exposure is Canada at 55%, followed by the U.S. at 17% and South Africa at 13%, according to industry monitor Xtf.com. The top three stocks out of 29 holdings are Barrick Gold (ABX), Newmont Mining (NEM) and Goldcorp.The ETF has a Relative Strength Rating of 98, which means it is outperforming 98% of all stocks and exchange traded funds tracked by IBD.It has a strong Accumulation/Distribution of A-, a sign of institutional backing.IShares MSCI Global Silver (SLVP) also made a new high Friday. SLVP vaulted 48.2% in Q1 and 40% in April.Last month, the ETF absorbed $11.7 million. Assets under management now total $43.2 million.Few of its 29 stock holdings are pure-play silver mining companies. The index merely requires holdings to earn a majority of their revenue from silver mining. Silver Wheaton (SLW) is the portfolio's largest stock.The RS line bolted higher on Friday, a sign of outperformance vs. the S&P 500.PowerShares DWA Basic Materials (PYZ) allocates 31.5% of portfolio assets to metals and mining stocks.The ETF made a 52-week high of 55.40 on the stock market today.Meanwhile, RING and SLVP pulled back in heavy volume Monday.Mining stocks tend to reflect the price moves in the underlying commodity.Gold futures prices scored a 15-month high of $1,306 in morning trade Monday, before backing off as investors booked some profits, according to Kitco News.

The health insurer raised its full-year forecast on strong organic growth and good customer-retention levels.XLV sliced above its 200-day moving average Monday for the first time in 2016. The health care sector is an S&P 500 laggard this year, trailed only by financials.UnitedHealth, the first health insurer to report for the first quarter, is now having its report scrutinized for clues as to how the health care industry is faring. The company announced that it would remain in only a “handful” of ObamaCare public exchanges next year, down from 34 state exchanges currently.UnitedHealth stock jumped more than 2% in strong volume.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) also beat earnings estimates Tuesday, while revenue matched forecasts.

108,NEM,"Gold mining stocks have had a big week so far and retain their status as No. 1 in IBD's database of 197 industry groups.Mining is also the No. 1 sector out of 33, with a 50.74% gain year to date as of Tuesday's IBD. It was up 4.2% on Monday.The catalyst seems to be a falling dollar. Gold made a heroic rise from a 1999 low to a peak in September 2011. Then the collapse came: The gold and silver mining industry group lost 77% of its value going into a low in January.During the later part of that move, the dollar rose sharply as oil and other commodity prices fell. The recovery gold and silver miners enjoy now is a bounce off the bottom. So, the CAN SLIM investor won't find many bases setting up and won't find the type of fundamentals sought in a growth stock.For example, Royal Gold (RGLD) has an EPS Rating of 27. That means 73% of the stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster.Denver-based Royal has 38 producing and 24 development-stage royalties. It boasts of a portfolio in large, long-lived mines in politically stable countries.It's also made money every year since 1999, but it suffered earnings declines in 2013 and 2014 before pulling in profit of $1.14 a share in 2015, a 21% increase from a year earlier.Earnings are forecast to fall 13% this year, but who knows what gold prices will do.Another big player in the group is Newmont Mining (NEM). The company reported gold reserves of 73.7 million ounces and copper reserves of 5.7 billion pounds for 2015. It has attributable proven and probable silver reserves of 113 million ounces. It owns mines in North and South America, Africa, Indonesia and Australia. Its jointly owned Kalgoorlie mine was added last year with 1.1 million ounces of gold reserves.U.K.-based Randgold Resources (GOLD) operates five gold mines in Africa.A lesser known name is Canada-based Franco Nevada (FNV), which doesn't own mines but has a portfolio of royalties and streams. It didn't drop as much during gold's bear market and is now trading at an all-time high.Image provided by Shutterstock.

110,NEM,"Mining companies that have been pummeled by faltering Chinese demand surged Wednesday by the most in five months, as metals prices rallied in a sign that production cuts are starting to pay off.First Quantum Minerals Ltd., Newmont Mining (NEM) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) led gains in the Bloomberg Americas Mining Index, which added 7% in the biggest increase since Aug. 27. Zinc rose for a fourth straight session as copper, aluminum, nickel, lead and tin advanced in London, helped by the outlook for tighter supplies and a plunge in the dollar, which bolsters the appeal of metals as alternative investments.“It’s strength across the board,” Garrett Nelson, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said by telephone from Richmond, Virginia. “The dollar’s down a lot, and commodity prices are up, so the equities are up also.”Industrial metals slumped 27% last year as China’s economic slowdown heightened demand concerns, prompting mining companies, including Freeport, to shutter output. Shares of Phoenix-based Freeport, the biggest publicly traded copper producer, gained 11% at 4:03 p.m. ET. Vancouver-based First Quantum advanced 14% in Toronto.Newmont climbed 11% in New York, the biggest gain since November 2008. Greenwood Village, Colorado-based Newmont, the biggest U.S. gold producer, was helped by bullion prices that jumped to a three-month high on Wednesday.Gold futures broke above the 200-day moving average for the first time since October, a level considered bullish by traders who follow chart patterns, Barry Allan, an analyst with Mackie Research Capital Corp. in Toronto, said by e-mail.Image provided by Shutterstock.

IBM (IBM) slumped 6% as its adjusted Q4 EPS topped consensus expectations.

Earnings topped consensus views, revenue came up short. Subscriber growth, a closely watched metric for the company, grew by a better-than-expected 5.59 million users overall.

That's a sign of weakness.""The fact that a gold ETF and big-cap dividend stocks like Reynolds American (RAI) and AT&T (T) remain on Leaderboard suggests the market remains in a defensive posture,"" the IBD markets team wrote early Tuesday, before Yellen made her remarks. ""More importantly, it is a market that is not warming up to growth companies.""IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB), on Leaderboard's Cut List, reversed from a loss of more than 1% earlier Tuesday to finish up 1.8%.IBB is now back within range from a short-sale entry at 269, but just barely. The ETF has been running into resistance at its 50-day moving average, which still favors a short sale.“The downward-sloping 50-day and 200-day moving averages also suggest the stock has further downside,” according to IBD.Here's a look at how the major exchange traded funds tracking various asset classes performed today.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.9%, RS 65PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +1.6%, RS 65SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), +0.5%, RS 69IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +1.9%, RS 62IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +2.8%, RS 42IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), +1.1%, RS 46Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +1.0%, RS 48SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), +1.9%, RS 86IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), +0.3%, RS 65PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), -0.9%, RS 51IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), -5.8%, RS 22

Russian officials reportedly denied the account, saying the warplane had not violated protocol, was flying at 6,000 meters and was shot down from the ground.The State Department's travel alert advised Americans to be wary while traveling. ""The likelihood of terror attacks will continue,"" the alert said, ""as members of ISIL/Da'esh return from Syria and Iraq."" The alert cautioned travelers to ""be aware of immediate surroundings and avoid large crowds or crowded places.""The result sent airlines and travel-booking stocks to some of the mornings worst losses. Oil prices surged, lifting oil-related groups to 8 of the 10 best gains among industry groups in early trade.The conflict and warnings overpowered an as-expected revision to Q3 GDP growth from the Commerce Department, lifting the economy's performance to a 2.1% gain vs. an initial estimate of 1.5% growth.Case-Shiller's 20-City Home Price Index for September was also mildly positive, showing a 5.5% year-over-year gain — above consensus views for a 5.3% increase. Prices advanced 0.6% vs. August, better than projections for a 0.3% improvement.Consumers' outlook fell hard in November, with the Conference Board reporting its Consumer Confidence Index pulled back to 90.4, far below October's 97.6 tally and an optimistic consensus view for an upshift to 99.6.At the top of the S&P 500, Campbell Soup (CPB) ladled up a 5% advance at the start of trade. The Camden, N.J.-based soup, sauce and broth maker reported a strong fiscal-first-quarter earnings beat and revenue in line with consensus expectations. Management projected lower sales but EPS above consensus expectations.Chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) popped 4%, boosted by a 49% surge in fiscal Q3 EPS, vs. consensus views for a 20% gain. Revenue also topped forecasts, and first-quarter sales and earnings guidance was in line with expectations.At the low end of the S&P 500, weaker-than-forecast quarterly reports sent X-ray and veterinary supplies firm Patterson (PDCO) and retail chain Signet Jewelers (SIG) each down 5%. The loss left Signet, an IBD 50 stock, just above its 200-day moving average and down 13% from an Oct. 13 high. GameStop (GME) dropped 3% as Oppenheimer added its name to the list of brokerages downgrading the video game retailer after reporting a Q3 sales and earnings miss on Monday.About 80% of the IBD 50 list traded lower in early action, but Dycom (DY) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) chalked out the high end, up nearly 2% each. The gain put Dycom out of buy range, nearly 9% past a flat base buy point of 80.95.Skyworks continues to feel its way along the underside of its 50-day moving average, bound up in a five-month consolidation.Among leaders on IBD's Your Weekly Review list, Maxlinear (MXL) surged 5%, taking out a new high. The Carlsbad, Cal.-based chipmaker is 33% past a 13.06 buy point after an early October breakout.

177,NEM,"U.S. stock indexes kept their losses moderate, as the market headed toward the day's last hour of trading.The Nasdaq fell 0.6%, the S&P 500 dropped 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly flat. The Dow Jones utility average was one of the few gainers, up 1.8%. Volume in the stock market today remained far below the previous session's pace.Low volume made the losses less of a concern. Institutional buying and selling shape the stock market, and there were not many signs of buying or selling in heavy volume.Among widely held shares, AT&T (T) tacked on 0.7%, but volume was about 40% below average. In Q4, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) sold 21% of its position in AT&T. Buffett's famous fund, though, still has more than 46 million AT&T shares.The stock of AT&T has risen about 7% since the end of the fourth quarter. Buffett's lightening isn't necessarily a bad sign for AT&T. Sometimes the famous value investor simply finds something he likes better. Recently, Berkshire has been buying oil stocks.Gold miners were among the day's leaders, as the group popped 5% higher. The trouble with gold-mining stocks is that few have quality fundamentals. Newmont Mining (NEM) has a Composite Rating of 90, making it the only sizable stock in the group with a rating that high.The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.

179,NEM,"The world looked a bit flat from a market standpoint early Tuesday, with global markets and commodities largely unmoved and stock futures steering the U.S. market toward a mixed open.Dow futures were down 65.4 points, with IBM (IBM) pulling hard to the downside. S&P 500 futures were off a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 5.4 points.The focal point of the stock market today. Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo (YHOO) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also report after the close, as do a number of leading stocks, including Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Illumina (ILMN) and GoPro (GPRO).The economic calendar is blank Tuesday, but big names in motion after early earnings reports included Verizon (VZ) (down 2%), Travelers (TRV) (up 2%), Lockheed Martin (LMT) (unchanged) and United Technologies (UTX) (down 4%).IBM dragged 5% lower after reporting its Q2 earnings beat but revenue fell slightly more than analysts had expected. It was the tech giant's 13th straight quarter of declining revenue, and profit margins in its software division — the source of about half the company's profit — narrowed during the quarter. IBM shares have been in a gradual uptrend since January, fighting to climb out of a 10-month consolidation.Tesla Motors (TSLA) slumped nearly 4% ahead of the open. The stock may have been nicked by a UBS downgrade to sell, in a note that reportedly questioned the company's battery storage and auto delivery targets. Shares rose almost 3% in strong trade Monday. The stock is extended after a rebound from 10-week support and above a 258.85 cup-with-handle buy point.India-based software engineer Infosys (INFY) surged 12%. The country's second largest software developer reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year revenue guidance above consensus expectations.Management said the company signed six contracts during the quarter with a total value of $688 million. Infosys has been consolidating sine February and battling to retake its 10-week line of support for the past five weeks.The dollar was mixed and commodities were generally flat. Mining stocks, which had dragged hard on the S&P 500 on Monday, were rebounding, with Agnico Eagle (AEM), Barrick Gold (ABX), Yamana Gold (AUY) and Newmont Mining (NEM) posting solid premarket gains.

202,NEM,"Despite a dip Thursday morning following a disappointing earnings announcement, shares of Newmont Mining (NEM) have been on a sharp rise over the last month amid a rebound in the price of gold, with the gold and copper producer also announcing a change in its executive ranks.Late Wednesday, Newmont Mining fell short of Q4 earnings estimates but beat revenue views. The company reported its fourth straight year of lower EPS. However, its top line improved for the first time since 2011.Also Wednesday, the Colorado-based company announced that Tom Palmer will succeed Chris Robison as executive vice president and chief operating officer on May 1. Robison is retiring after a 36-year career in the mining industry. Palmer joined Newmont in March 2014 after two decades with U.K.-based Rio Tinto (RIO), where he helped oversee the bauxite and alumina, coal, copper and iron ore businesses.Meanwhile, the entire mining sector has benefited from a recent uptick in gold prices. Those prices are up 15% since mid-December, when they hit their lowest point since October 2009.The metal has benefited from unsteady stock markets, which often cause investors to flock to gold and cash. Gold miners have also gotten a boost from the dollar’s strength in key gold producing countries such as Australia and Canada. This gives miners a relative boost for each dollar of gold sold and earnings booked.The upshot for Newmont is a share price that has risen more than 45% since Jan. 19 in heavier-than-normal volume — an indication that a lot of smart money is moving into the stock. Fellow gold producers Randgold Resources (GOLD), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and Anglogold Ashanti (AU) have seen similarly robust spikes, though the latter firm has done so off of a much smaller base. Freeport-McMoRan and Anglogold are losing money.Newmont shares closed up 0.9% on the stock market today. Randgold rose 3.6%, while Freeport-McMoRan dipped 0.1% and Anglogold climbed 5.2%.

However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.5%, or 115.95 points, to close at 24,873.66. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,747.33. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,481.74, losing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 3.3% to close at 16.67. A total of 6.65 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.08 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.31-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Trade War Fears, Mueller’s Subpoena Drag IndexesLate on Tuesday, Trump reportedly said that the U.S. is looking to impose “tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports.” Further on Thursday, he stated that the U.S. is thinking of imposing tariffs of more than $30 billion on Chinese imports“as part of a package of anti-China measures,” per a Wall Street Journal report. Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries including China.Additionally, The New York Times reported that special counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed the Trump Organization for documents relating to Trump’s businesses. This subpoena was issued in connection with an inquiry into Russian involvement in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Following this development, two key indexes, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted losses for the fourth consecutive session.The Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3%, becoming the worst performing sector among the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, Monsanto Company , CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) fell 4.8%, 3.3% and 2.3%, respectively.Investors’ Bargain Hunting Boost the DowRecent uncertainty resulted in decline in stock prices, which encouraged investors to buy on the dip and focus on blue-chip stocks. Following this development, the Dow was the only key index that managed to end in the green. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day. UnitedHealth Group has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Record fall in jobless claims indicated a tighter labor market.According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, manufacturing activity in some of the eastern U.S. states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware continued to expand in March. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index slipped to 22.3 in March from 25.8 in February.

(CAT  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) rose 1.3%, 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.Stocks That Made HeadlinesDollar General Q4 Earnings Miss, Stock Up on Upbeat ViewDollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

248,NEM,"On Mar 6, we issued an updated research report on gold mining giant, Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report).Newmont recorded wider year-over-year loss in fourth-quarter 2017. Its adjusted earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate while sales trailed.  The company expects attributable gold production in the range of 4.9-5.4 million ounces for 2018 and 2019 factoring in full potential mine plan, recovery improvements and throughput.  Newmont’s shares have gained 9.8% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 3.9% decline.Investment in Growth Projects & Debt Reduction to Drive ResultsNewmont is making notable progress with its growth projects. The company continues to invest in growth projects in a calculated manner. It is pursuing a number of projects including Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa and Twin Underground in North America.In fourth-quarter 2017, Newmont successfully started commercial production at its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine. The Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion projects represent additional upside. Commercial production at Subika is expected in the second half of 2018 while the same for the Ahafo expansion is expected in the second half of 2019. Commercial production from the Twin Underground expansion is also expected in mid-2018.We are also impressed with the company’s efforts to reduce debt and improve efficiency. Newmont reduced its net debt to $0.8 billion at the end of 2017. Since 2013, the company has been streamlining its balance sheet and has lowered its net debt by more than 83%.Rising Production Costs Pose Headwind  Rising production cost is a concern for the company. Newmont’s all-in sustaining costs (AISC) rose 5% to $968 in last reported quarter, mainly due to higher per unit cost applicable to sales (CAS), higher exploration costs and increased sustaining capital.  Increased project spending is expected to keep AISC at elevated levels moving ahead.Newmont expects its AISC to be between $965 and $1,025 per ounce in 2018, higher than $924 recorded for full-year 2017.Newmont Mining Corporation Price and Consensus Newmont Mining Corporation Price and Consensus | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNewmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are Steel Dynamics, Inc.

251,NEM,"Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) said that its Twin Creeks Underground expansion project has achieved commercial production and the project was completed on schedule for $42 million (below initial guidance of $45-$55 million).The project enables the company to add higher-grade, lower-cost gold production at its Twin Creeks operation in Nevada. The mine will add 30,000-40,000 ounces of gold per annum at all-in sustaining costs of $650-$750 per ounce for the initial five years of production. Moreover, the new ore will enable the company to process stockpiled ore, which was earlier classified as waste, and extend processing life to 2030. The project also has an internal rate of return of roughly 20%.Per the company, this expansion improves recoveries at Twin Creeks and extends profitable production, serving as a platform to further explore the deposit. Notably, this is the sixth time that the company has completed a project on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget over the last five years.Earlier this year, Newmont and Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) gave approval for the Turquoise Ridge Mine Optimization project involving sinking of a new production shaft to access the richest part of the deposit. It is expected to lower unit costs by more than 20%, increase ventilation capacity and boost ore production rates to roughly 1.1 million tons per year when it comes on line in 2022.Over the last five years, Newmont has developed six new mines and expanded into four continents including Tanami in 2017 and Merian and Long Canyon in 2016. In 2015, Newmont completed value-accretive acquisition of Cripple Creek and Victor, and delivered profitable growth at the mine in 2016.Newmont’s shares have gained 16.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rise of roughly 1.5%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNewmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) and Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

252,NEM,"The historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years.This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Investors are also a bit wary ahead of the two-day Fed meeting, slated to start today. While the central bank is highly anticipated to raise interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps, investors are also keenly waiting for the Fed’s guidance on the future rate trajectory. Per CME group, the odds of a June rate hike are 96%. This would also mark the seventh rate hike since December 2015.Currently, the Fed forecasts a total of three rates hike for this year. Growing inflationary pressures and an improving economy could compel the Fed to add one more rate hike in its forecast for this year. Notably, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2% in April, bringing the annual inflation (12 months through April) to 2.5% -- the biggest gain since February 2017 and well above the Fed’s 2% target. Unemployment also dropped to 3.8%, the lowest level since 2000.The economic expansion has survived for nine years and the United States has now entered its second-longest expansion phase since 1785. However, many experts caution the fourth rate hike and expect the Fed to leave its future rate forecast unchanged thanks to tariff and trade threats that could hamper global growth.Given the mixed outcome of the Singapore summit and the upcoming Fed decision, several corners of the equity space are in focus. Some of these are likely to gain, while some will be hurt by these events.  GoldWhile gold often carries a safe-haven status in times of economic or political turbulence, it will likely hit hard as higher interest rates would diminish the yellow metal’s attractiveness since it does not pay interest like fixed-income assets. Acting as leveraged plays on underlying metal prices, metal miners generally witnessed more gains or losses than their bullion cousins. As such, the largest gold mining stocks - Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) and Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) are on investors’ radar. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).BanksA rising interest rate scenario would be highly profitable for the banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates. With the rise in short-term interest rates, banks would be able to earn more on lending and pay less on deposits. This would expand net margins and bolster banks’ profits. Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is poised to surge the most from the Fed’s hawkish outlook. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.High DividendWhile faster-than-expected tightening policy would hurt demand for high dividend stocks, any negative talks in the negotiation of Trump-Kim deal would drive investors’ attention to this corner of the space. This is because companies that pay higher dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. Summit Midstream Partners LP (SMLP  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #1, has a higher upside potential.Consumer DiscretionaryThough higher rates would raise the borrowing cost, an improving domestic economy and a Trump-Kim deal would continue to boost confidence, leading to higher spending power. While most of the stocks in the space are top ranked, lululemon athletica inc. (LULU  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 and a Momentum Score of A could outperform.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

253,NEM,"Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) has entered into a deal to sell its royalty portfolio to an emerging precious metals royalty and streaming company, Maverix Metals Inc. The strategic partnership will provide Newmont an ongoing exposure to Maverix’s growing portfolio of 27 high-quality royalties and streams, out of which 10 are on producing mines.Per the agreement, Newmont will receive $17 million in cash, 60 million common shares of Maverix (representing roughly 28% ownership interest) and warrants for an additional 10 million common shares. The transaction is expected to close in second-quarter 2018.Notably, Newmont’s royalty portfolio consists of 54 precious metals and industrial minerals royalties, including royalties at Premier Gold’s McCoy Cove project in Nevada and TMAC Resources’ Hope Bay mine in Canada.With regards to this transaction, both parties will ink a shareholder agreement that will entitle Newmont to have a seat on Maverix’s board and pre-emptive rights to take part in future financings of the company to maintain its ownership stake.Newmont’s shares have moved up 4.6% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s 3.5% decline. During first-quarter 2018 earnings call, Newmont stated that it continues to expect attributable gold production in the range of 4.9-5.4 million ounces for 2018 and 2019. The company also kept its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) and costs applicable to sales (CAS) for gold unchanged for 2018 in the range of $965-$1,025 per ounce and $700-$750 per ounce, respectively.Notably, the company’s projected AISC for 2018 is higher than $924 recorded for full-year 2017. Newmont’s AISC rose 8% to $973 in the first quarter, mainly due to higher per unit CAS, higher exploration costs and increased spending on advanced projects. Increased project spending is expected to keep AISC at elevated levels. As such, the company’s high production costs remain a concern for 2018.However, Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects as it continues to invest in growth projects in a calculated manner, including Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa and Twin Underground in North America.Last year, the company successfully started commercial production at its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine. Moreover, the Long Canyon mine in Nevada and Merian gold mine in Suriname have also reached commercial production.Newmont Mining Corporation Price and Consensus Newmont Mining Corporation Price and Consensus | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNewmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks worth considering in the basic materials space include The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report), FMC Corporation (FMC  -  Free Report) and Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

254,NEM,"Gold miner Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, Newmont has surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 21.5%.Moreover, revenues for the fourth quarter went up around 8.2% year over year to $1,935 million, but trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,957.6 million.Can the company surprise investors this quarter or is it heading for a possible pullback? Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderNewmont expects attributable gold production in the range of 4.9-5.4 million ounces for 2018, primarily driven by factors including full potential mine plan, recovery and throughput improvements. Newmont's attributable gold production increased roughly 1% year over year to 1.34 million ounces in the fourth quarter on the back of a full quarter of production at Long Canyon, higher throughput and grade at Merian and Tanami, which offset lower grade at Boddington, harder ore at Akyem and lower grade and recovery at CC&V.The company’s all-in sustaining costs (AISC) guidance for 2018 is between $965 and $1,025 per ounce, as increases in exploration and advanced projects spending is offset by improved cost applicable to sales (CAS).Total revenues for the first quarter are projected to decrease roughly 4.5% sequentially, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at $1,847 million. Notably, the projected figure marks a 11.3% year-over-year increase from $1,659 million recorded a year ago.Strong production performance (driven by sustained project investments) in the company’s Americas operations is expected to continue in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2017, North America’s attributable gold production rose 1% year over year while gold CAS remained almost flat at $720 per ounce. The company expects North American operations to produce 2.0-2.2 million ounces for 2018.  Attributable gold production in South America went up 13% year over year in the last reported quarter while gold CAS fell 9% to $577 per ounce. The company expects the region to produce 615,000-675,000 ounces this year on the back of mill productivity improvements, which partly offsets recoveries from deep transitional ore and Yanacocha’s lower production resulting from lower grades.Attributable gold and copper production in the Australia went up around 3% year over year in the fourth quarter. Newmont expects Australia production between 1.5 and 1.7 million ounces in 2018 as higher grade, recovery and throughput improvements at Tanami and KCGM are likely to offset increased stripping at Boddington.Attributable gold production from Africa went down by down 9% year over year in the fourth quarter and CAS decreased 2% to $755 per ounce. The company expects Africa production between 815,000 and 875,000 ounces this year.Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects as it continues to invest in growth projects in a calculated manner, including Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa and Twin Underground in North America.In fourth-quarter 2017, Newmont successfully started commercial production at its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine. Moreover, the Long Canyon mine in Nevada and Merian gold mine in Suriname have also reached commercial production.However, Newmont faces headwinds from high production costs in 2018. The company’s projected AISC for 2018 is higher than $924 recorded for full-year 2017. Newmont’s AISC rose 5% year over year to $968 in the fourth quarter, mainly due to higher per unit CAS, higher exploration costs and increased sustaining capital. Increased project spending is expected to keep AISC at elevated levels.Shares of Newmont have lost 0.5% in the past three months, outperforming the 9.5% decline recorded by its industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Newmont is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below: Zacks ESP : Earnings ESP for Newmont for the first quarter is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both currently pegged at 33 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Newmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.  Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat EstimatesHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.63% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

255,NEM,"The Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (RTM  -  Free Report) made its debut on 11/01/2006, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Materials ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by Invesco Powershares. RTM has been able to amass assets over $250.55 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Materials ETFs. RTM seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials Index before fees and expenses.The S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials Index is an unmanaged equal weighted version of the S&P 500 Materials Index that consists of the common stocks of the following industries: chemicals, construction materials, containers and packaging, metals and mining, and paper and forest products that comprise the Materials sector of the S&P 500 Index.Cost & Other ExpensesExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.40%, making it on par with most peer products in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.39%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For RTM, it has heaviest allocation in the Materials sector --about 100% of the portfolio.Taking into account individual holdings, Ecolab Inc (ECL  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.41% of the fund's total assets, followed by Newmont Mining Corp (NEM  -  Free Report) and Monsanto Co .Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 41.67% of RTM's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -3.18%, and is up roughly 18.15% in the last one year (as of 04/17/2018). RTM has traded between $94.10 and $118.23 in the past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 1.22 and standard deviation of 17.30% for the trailing three-year period, which makes RTM a medium choice in this particular space. With about 25 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesGuggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Materials ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB  -  Free Report) tracks Materials Select Sector Index and the FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index Fund (GUNR  -  Free Report) tracks Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index. Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund has $4.96 B in assets, FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index Fund has $5.49 B. XLB has an expense ratio of 0.13% and GUNR charges 0.46%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Materials ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

259,NEM,"Westlake Chemical Corporation (WLK  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Feb 20.Last quarter, the company’s profits surged more than three-folds to $210.8 million or $1.61 per share, mainly driven by earnings contribution of Axiall, lower transaction and integration-related costs related to the buyout and higher sales price of major products. Barring one-time items, adjusted earnings came in at $1.65 per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39.Net sales also went up around 65% year over year to $2,108.9 million. The figure however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,123 million.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 23.5%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up for the forthcoming announcement.Westlake Chemical Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Westlake Chemical Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Westlake Chemical Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayWestlake Chemical is gaining from contributions of the Axiall acquisition, improved demand and higher selling prices for major products. The company, in its third-quarter call, said that it benefited from increased demand for all major products in both Vinyls and Olefins segments along with higher prices in the Vinyls segment. The company believes that the Axiall buyout, continued investments to improve the reliability and operational efficiency of its assets will enable it to fully leverage the improving Vinyls market.Westlake Chemical’s revenues for the fourth quarter are projected to decline roughly 1.7% from the third, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2,073 million.In the third quarter, the company’s Olefins segment sales witnessed a modest increase of roughly 0.1% year over year and 2.7% on a sequential basis. Although, higher sales prices and higher overall operating rates drove the segment’s operating income, these increases were partly offset by higher energy and feedstock costs.On the other hand, the company’s Vinyls segment sales went up roughly 105.5% year over year and 7.8% sequentially. Operating income surged roughly ten-fold year-over-year, mainly driven by the Axiall buyout and higher selling prices for major products, which were partly offset by higher energy prices.Westlake Chemical, in its third-quarter call, said that it expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be impacted by roughly $25 million due to its current maintenance plan that includes several planned outages during the quarter. The forecast reflects increased maintenance expenses associated with these outages and related lost sales margins.For full-year 2017, Westlake Chemical anticipates to realize around $120 million in synergies and cost savings related to the Axiall acquisition.Shares of Westlake Chemical have moved up 21.5% in the last three months, outperforming the 11.2% growth recorded by its industry. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Westlake Chemical is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Westlake Chemical for the fourth quarter is -1.38%.

263,NEM,"The year 2017 has not been a smooth ride for Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) – the biggest producer of gold on the planet. The mining giant has seen its shares skid roughly 10% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Gold Mining industry’s gain of around 6% in the same time frame.The under-performance, in part, is due to the disputes surrounding Acacia Mining (the largest gold producer in Tanzania in which Barrick holds a 64% stake) that have sparked concerns among investors. Tanzania Troubles Weigh On BarrickThe government of Tanzania imposed a gold and copper concentrate export ban in March 2017 after accusing Acacia of understating its metal shipments. The government also hit Acacia with a massive $190 billion bill in July for allegedly unpaid taxes, interests and fines.Export ban on concentrates hurt operations of Acacia in Tanzania. Barrick's share of production from Acacia fell roughly 7% year over year to 122,000 ounces in the third quarter. The company’s overall gold production also went down around 10% in the quarter.Barrick also narrowed its production outlook for 2017 to 5.3-5.5 million ounces from previous view of 5.3-5.6 million ounces. The export ban has some negative bearings on Barrick’s 2017 production. The affected Acacia operations account for roughly 6% of Barrick’s production guidance for 2017. In total, Acacia accounts for around 10% of Barrick's overall production.The impact of Tanzania's concentrate export ban on Acacia and lower production also weighed on Barrick’s bottom line in the third quarter. The company swung to a loss in the quarter, dragged down by a hefty tax provision of $172 million related to the proposed framework for Acacia. Its adjusted earnings also fell short of expectations. Barrick’s shares cratered around 8% a day after the earnings release, reflecting the earnings miss, downbeat production guidance and investors’ concerns surrounding Acacia.  Barrick and the government of Tanzania, in October, established a framework for a new partnership between Acacia Mining and the Tanzanian government. Per the framework, economic benefits generated by Acacia’s operations will be shared with Tanzania on a 50/50 basis, moving forward. The Tanzanian government’s share of benefits would be delivered in the form of royalties, taxes and a 16% free carry interest in Acacia’s operations in Tanzania.The government of Tanzania and Barrick also agreed to create a working group, which will focus on the resolution of outstanding tax claims relating to Acacia. Acacia will pay $300 million to the government of Tanzania to resolve outstanding tax claims, with payment terms to be settled by the working group.All proposals are subject to review and approval by Acacia shareholders and the Independent Committee of Acacia’s board of directors. Barrick aims to finalize the proposal in first-half 2018.While the proposed framework is a progress towards ending the long-running dispute, it remains uncertain if an export ban that has hurt Acacia's Tanzanian operations will be lifted and whether Barrick will have to make further payments (on account of allegedly unpaid taxes) to the east African nation.Will 2018 Bring Better Tidings?While troubles associated with Acacia and decreasing production profile weighed on Barrick’s stock this year, the company is expected to gain from its operational and cost-improvement initiatives, de-leveraging actions and efforts to maximize cash flows in 2018.Barrick remains the world’s most efficient gold miner. Its all-in sustaining cost (AISC) is among the lowest in the gold mining industry. While the company’s AISC increased in the third quarter, it was still lower than its major peers. It also sees lower costs in the fourth quarter. Barrick remains committed to manage its costs (through reduction in cost of sustaining capital as well as developing and internal operational costs), which should aid to its results in 2018.Barrick also remains actively focused on de-leveraging its balance sheet. The company cut its total debt by roughly $1 billion in the third quarter using cash flows and proceeds from the sale of a 50% interest in Veladero mine Argentina to Shandong Gold Mining Co. It reduced total debt by roughly $1.5 billion year to date, and exceeded the initial target to reduce debt by $1.45 billion for 2017.Barrick looks to reduce its total debt by $2.9 billion to $5 billion by the end of 2018 using cash flows from operations. The company’s aggressive debt reduction action should further lower its interest expenses in 2018. Improving balance sheet is also expected to allow the company to look for acquisition opportunities for growth next year.Moreover, Barrick has a strong liquidity position (with cash and cash equivalents of around $2 billion at the end of the third quarter) and also generates healthy cash flows, which positions it well to take advantage of attractive development and exploration opportunities. It generated operating cash flows of nearly $1.5 billion during the first three quarters of 2017.The company also generated free cash flow of $225 million in the third quarter, marking the tenth straight quarter of positive free cash flow. This testifies Barrick’s focus on boosting free cash flow through capital discipline, improved operational efficiency and productivity, and stronger cost management.Barrick also continues to make high return investments in its businesses leveraging cash flows and should benefit from major exploration programs. The company maintains a significant focus on Nevada for growth opportunities. A significant portion of its exploration budget has been allocated to the Americas.Positive outlook for gold will also act as a tailwind. Gold has managed to rack up a roughly 9% gain so far this year, despite the prospects of the U.S. Federal Reserve hiking interest rates looming large and favorable equity markets.Particularly, the yellow metal’s prices were buoyed by its safe haven appeal this year owing to geopolitical tensions. Further, frequent terrorist attacks in UK and escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea fueled the price rise this year. In fact, the precious metal broke the threshold limit of $1,300 an ounce this year triggered by the United States-North Korea imbroglio.Spot gold headed for the biggest gain in three weeks after the Fed hiked interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its December policy meeting. This was because the market had already factored in the possibility of a rate hike given the upbeat economic data. Gold prices trended upward interpreting the Fed’s statement as dovish considering that it is planning only three rate hikes in 2018 and not four.Per the World Gold Council, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold’s performance, entering 2018. A number of new mines are projected to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2017, which might support mine production till 2018.On the demand side, major markets, India and China will continue to be growth drivers. Further, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Demand from central banks is also expected to remain strong. As such, a favorable outlook for gold augurs well for Barrick.Barrick is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus  Barrick Gold Corporation Price and Consensus | Barrick Gold Corporation QuoteGold Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the gold mining space can consider top-ranked stocks such as Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report), Sandstorm Gold Ltd.

264,NEM,"Gold enjoyed a positive run in 2017, surging more than 12%, its strongest gain since 2010. The performance is particularly noteworthy in a year when the U.S. Federal Reserve has been hiking rates and equity markets remained strong.Spot gold headed for the biggest gain in three weeks after the Fed hiked interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its December policy meeting. This was because the market had already factored in the possibility of a rate hike given the upbeat economic data. Gold prices trended upward interpreting the Fed’s statement as dovish considering that it is planning only three rate hikes in 2018 and not four.The bullish momentum for the yellow metal has continued in 2018 so far, with gold currently trending above the psychological level of $1,300 an ounce. The rally can be attributed to weaker dollar and renewed safe-haven buying prompted by heightened geopolitical tensions.According to the World Gold Council, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold’s performance in 2018. A number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018.On the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Further, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Demand from central banks is also expected to remain strong.As per the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector, which is among those Zacks sectors that are expected to rack up the strongest gains in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to climb 43.5% while revenues are expected to spike 20.7%, per the latest Earnings Preview.In this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two major gold mining stocks – Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report) – to figure out which of these stocks is better placed ahead of their fourth-quarter earnings report.Barrick – the biggest producer of gold on the planet – is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter numbers on Feb 14, while Newmont will post its fourth-quarter results on Feb 22. Both Barrick and Newmont carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major gold stocks reporting earnings this week and the next include Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report), Kinross Gold Corp. (KGC  -  Free Report), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report), Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY  -  Free Report) and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU  -  Free Report).Let's take a closer look at how Barrick and Newmont are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.ESP and Earnings HistoryEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. Newmont is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.49% and a Zacks Rank #3. However, the picture is different for Barrick with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, a combination which makes surprise prediction difficult.With respect to surprise, Barrick beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters while missed twice. In this timeframe, it came up with an average negative surprise of 8.2%. On the other hand, Newmont has a fairly impressive surprise history, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 17.6%.Growth ExpectationsIn terms of earnings growth expectations, Newmont scores way above Barrick. The expected earnings per share growth rate for Newmont for the fourth quarter currently stands at 21.2% compared with an expected decline of 4.6% for Barrick.Price PerformanceNewmont clearly outpaced Barrick in terms of price performance in 2017. Newmont’s shares rallied 10.1% for the year while Barrick lost 9.4%. Newmont also outperformed the broader industry’s gain of 9.2%.While Newmont’s stock performance is partly supported by its forecast-topping earnings performance, efforts to improve its production profile and strengthen its balance sheet, Barrick’s shares were hit by the disputes surrounding Acacia Mining (the largest gold producer in Tanzania, in which Barrick holds a 64% stake) that had sparked concerns among investors. Dividend YieldIn the past year, the dividend yield for both Newmont and Barrick was higher than the broader industry. The industry has an average dividend yield of 8%, lower than 65.7% for Barrick and 36.2% for Newmont. Hence, on a comparable basis, Barrick shareholders earned a better dividend yield than Newmont. Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. Barrick has a debt-to-equity ratio of 55.5, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 33.4. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 33.1 Newmont wins this round.Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, Newmont is a clear winner with a current ratio of 4.18, which is superior to Barrick’s reading of 2.73.ValuationGoing by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, which is often used to value mining stocks, Barrick looks cheaper compared with Newmont.In case of Newmont, the trailing 12-months EV/EBITDA ratio is 8.1, which is above its own average of 7.9 in the past one year and also near the high level of 8.3 it scaled over that period. Moreover, it is overvalued than the industry that has a reading of 7.5. On the other hand, Barrick is cheaper with a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 4.5.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12-months for Barrick and Newmont is 7.7% and 6.2%, respectively. While both stocks have scored above the industry’s level of 4.7%, Barrick holds an edge here. The VerdictNewmont scores higher in terms of price performance, earnings surprise history, growth expectations, current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio. On top of that, the company has higher ESP reading vis-à-vis Barrick.However, Barrick holds an advantage when it comes to valuation, dividend yield and ROE measures. Overall, our comparative analysis shows that Newmont has an edge over Barrick on most of the parameters.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

266,NEM,"Despite the popular notion that interest rate hikes have a bearish impact on gold prices, spot gold headed for the biggest gain in three weeks after the rate hike. Gold prices moved up 0.58% to $1,255.90 an ounce on Dec 14. This was because the market had already factored in the possibility of a rate hike given the upbeat economic data. Gold prices trended upward interpreting the Fed’s statement as dovish considering that it is planning only three rate hikes in 2018 and not four.As widely anticipated, the Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point for the third time this year, pushing the target range to 1.25-1.5%, following a 7-2 vote. The Fed eyes three more hikes in 2018 and two in 2019, acknowledging the fact that inflation continues to its fall behind its 2% target. The inflation forecast for 2018 got a modest bump, from 1.6% to 1.7%. The Fed's preferred gauge showed an annualized growth of 1.6% in the latest reading.The committee strengthened some of the wording regarding the economy in its post-meeting statement. The Fed stated that “economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong”. The Fed now envisions economy to grow at a rate of 2.5% in both 2017 and 2018, up from previous forecast of 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in September. In another move that could tighten monetary conditions, the Fed confirmed that it would step up the monthly pace of shrinking balance sheet, as scheduled, to $20 billion from $10 billion beginning in January.Gold’s Run So Far in 2017So far this year, despite the prospects of the Fed hiking rates looming large and favorable equity markets, gold has managed to notch a gain of 9%. Particularly, the yellow metal’s prices were buoyed by its safe haven appeal this year owing to geopolitical tensions. Further, frequent terrorist attacks in UK and escalating tensions between the United States and North Korea fueled the price rise this year. In fact, the precious metal broke the threshold limit of $1,300 an ounce this year triggered by the United States-North Korea imbroglio.Gold Industry Performance, PositioningThe Gold Mining industry has gained 3.7% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 18.9%, year to date.Going by the EV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures), the gold mining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.02, much lower than the S&P 500’s EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.74. The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for some more improvement in the near term.The Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks. The way to look at the complete list of industries is that, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).In the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). The gold mining industry currently occupies a space in the top half of the Zacks classified industries with a Rank of #113.What’s in the Cards in 2018?Per the World Gold Council CEO, Aram Shishmanian, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold’s performance, entering 2018. He noted “U.S interest rates may be rising but a lot is priced into the curve already and the direction of the dollar remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the long bull market in equities raises serious questions about prospects for stock prices.”A number of new mines are projected to enter production in the fourth quarter of 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. Noteworthy mines include The Natalka project in Russia, Canada’s Rainy River project and Houndé in Burkino Faso.On the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Though this year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (“GST”) and anti-money laundering legislation (“AML”) around jewelry retail transactions, we expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST. Also, pent-up demand and removal from the scope of PMLA legislation as well as festive buying are anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country. Even though the impact of uneven monsoon rainfall distribution on rural population remains a concern, measures taken by the government to deal with the scenario might be a savior.It is believed that the government measures like mandatory hallmarking next year, will be a positive move for the industry, could impact the trade in 2018. Given the insatiable appetite for gold and the rising wealth of Indian consumers, demand is projected to remain strong in the long run.Notably, in the third quarter of 2017, China witnessed a boost of 13% in festive buying after 10 consecutive quarters of decline. Retail demand remains high around the Chinese New Year. China is likely to experience solid demand in the future. This is because the people consider gold as a natural medium for savings and diversification in the form of bars, coins or jewelry.Further, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Elsewhere, Germany’s economy is expected to maintain momentum and unemployment is anticipated to continue falling, providing support for the world’s third-largest bar and coin market. Demands from central banks also remain strong with Turkish and Russian central banks adding to their gold reserves. Further, gold is witnessing increased demand in technology, bolstered by demand for high-end smartphones after years of declines.Stocks Set to Shine in 2018Investors interested in this space can consider the following gold stocks that have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with price movement ahead of the industry.

267,NEM,"Gold prices have been volatile but range-bound so far this year. Prices of the metal are up more than 2% in 2018 after racking up a healthy 12% gain last year. Spot gold touched 2018 high of $1,366 an ounce on Jan 25 and the yellow metal is currently trending above the psychological level of $1,300 an ounce.Prices of gold hit a 5-week high in March 2018 as a “less hawkish” Fed stance and threat of a fierce trade war between the United States and China weighed on the dollar and equities.Moreover, gold prices reached their highest level since Jan 25 yesterday as concerns over a possible U.S. military action against Syria sparked demand for the safe-haven asset. The increasing geopolitical tensions add to the investors uncertainty while gold is sought as a store of value in these times. This provides a boost to gold prices.Factors that Aid Gold’s CauseThe U.S. Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.50%-1.75% in its March meeting citing a brighter economic outlook. The Fed also maintained the number of expected rate hikes for 2018 at three, sticking to a gradual path of increases. The speculation of four hikes this year led to a plunge in dollar and provided a lift to gold prices. A slower pace of increases to interest rates augur well for gold prices.Moreover, fears of an intense trade war between Washington and Beijing have gripped the equity market, weakened the dollar and worked in favor of gold in the process. Stock markets have been skittish in recent weeks over the prospects of a full-blown U.S.-China trade war.China, earlier this month, declared plans of imposing tariffs of 25% on more than 100 American products with shipment values worth as much as $50 billion. The Trump administration responded with a proposed $100 billion in additional tariffs on China, further intensifying the trade tussle between the two countries. The U.S. had earlier announced sweeping tariffs on $50 billion of imports from China.Nevertheless, Chinese President Xi Jinping recently said that Beijing would lower tariffs on imported cars, thereby easing trade tensions for now. However, the Chinese commerce ministry has reportedly said that China will not hesitate to fight back should the United States takes any action to escalate the situation.Gold prices are also finding support of late from geopolitical tensions. President Donald Trump, yesterday, warned Russia of an imminent military action in Syria following a suspected chemical attack by the Assad Regime in the rebel-held suburb of Douma, east of Damascus, that claimed several lives. Concerns over escalating tensions in Syria lead to a spurt in gold prices.What’s in the Cards for Bullion?Uncertainties in the markets triggered by the developments over the past month are expected to continue to be supportive for gold prices as investors will shun risk assets such as equities and instead turn to gold.The developments over the past month have led to a spike in shares of several gold miner including NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG  -  Free Report), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report), Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) that saw roughly 16%, 8%, 8% and 7% gains, respectively, over a month.There are a number of reasons to be optimistic about gold’s performance in 2018. A number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. On the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers.Last year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (“GST”) and anti-money laundering legislation (“AML”) around jewelry retail transactions. We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018, will be a positive move for the industry.Further, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Demand from central banks is also expected to remain strong.Market-Beating Returns, Attractive ValuationThe Zacks Gold Mining industry has advanced roughly 5.5% compared with the S&P 500’s dip of 4.7% in a month’s time. Going by the EV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures), the gold mining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 8, lower than the S&P 500 EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.4. The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside moving ahead.2 Gold Stocks Worth a LookGeopolitical tensions and lingering concerns over a trade war might reduce investors’ appetite for riskier assets and fuel demand for safe-haven gold. This may trigger more upside for the bullion in the near term.  Below we have highlighted a couple of gold stocks that are good buys right now, backed by a strong Zacks Rank and upward estimate revisions.Asanko Gold Inc.

273,NEM,"Gold prices were supported by a weaker U.S dollar and inflation in first-quarter 2018. The Fed’s rate hikes also aided gold prices which declined prior to its implementation in March but experienced gains thereafter. Further, Trump administration slapped a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports which triggered fears of a trade war and in turn helped gold prices prop up. Another development that rattled global markets was Trump’s appointment of John Bolton, who is considered a foreign policy “hawk”, as National Security Advisor. Bolton had previously advocated using military force against both North Korea and Iran. In fact, Bolton’s appointment is a clear indication of the United States’ aggressive stance toward its adversaries. The increasing geopolitical tensions added to the uncertainty increasing the safe haven appeal of gold. This bolstered the gold prices in the quarter under review. All these recent developments and resulting volatility will continue to fuel gold prices as investors will shun risk assets such as equities and instead turn to gold. There are also plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold’s performance this earnings season and the rest of 2018. A number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. On the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Last year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (“GST”) and anti-money laundering legislation (“AML”) around jewelry retail transactions. We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST. Pent-up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018 is likely to be a positive for the industry. Further, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Overall Earnings Picture Looks Good Per the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the Basic Material sector — one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector is currently placed at the top 19% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, and one of the sectors which is expected to record double-digit earnings growth. According to our latest projections, the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth of 41.0% in first-quarter 2018 on the back of 19.8% rise in revenues. The overall earnings picture for all the S&P500 members is encouraging this quarter. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 18.3% for this earnings season on the back of a 7.7% rise in revenues. If this materializes, it would surpass fourth-quarter 2017 results where the S&P 500 recorded 13.4% earnings growth on 8.6% revenue growth — the best quarterly performance in more than six years. Let’s see what’s in store for the gold miners that are set to report quarterly numbers on Apr 26. Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) is one of the world's largest producers of gold with several active mines in Nevada, Peru, Australia/New Zealand and Ghana.

The average net realized copper price improved to $3.06 per pound from $2.04 per pound a year ago.Newmont's attributable gold production increased 7% year over year to 1.3 million ounces in the quarter.

Copper CAS in the reported quarter was $1.38 per pound, an increase of 36% year over year.AISC of $943 per ounce for gold rose roughly 2% year over year on higher exploration and advanced projects spending and increased CAS per ounce, which was partly offset by lower sustaining capital.

283,NEM,"Investors generally believe only risky stocks could garner better returns than the market. The strategy works only when the market remains bullish. In a bearish market, the scenario, however, will be opposite.  In this article, we have proven that less risky stocks can also reward investors with handsome returns if some specific parameters are considered while building an investment strategy.Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market (we are considering the S&P 500 here). That is, beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market.If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market. So, a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1.For example, if the beta is 1.8 then the stock will witness 80% more movement than the market.  Hence, we can say that if the market goes up, the stock will outperform by 80%.

284,NEM,"The third-quarter earnings season has gathered steam with 87 members of the S&P 500 Index having reported their quarterly numbers, which make up 24.7% of the Index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest status as of Oct 20, these companies have put a 9.4% increase in earnings on the back of 7.3% higher sales on the scoreboard. Around 71.3% of these companies delivered positive earnings surprises while 70.1% surpassed revenue expectations. (Read more: Three Takeaways from the Q3 Earnings Season)Taking into account all the S&P members that are yet to disclose their numbers, total earnings for the index are expected to be up 2.6% year over year on a 5% increase in revenues in the third quarter. Though this is a deceleration from an 11.2% increase in earnings in the second quarter and 13.6% in the first, growth graph will pick up from the fourth quarter onwards. Per projections, earnings growth will be 9.3% in fourth-quarter 2017, 9.3% in first-quarter 2018, 9.1% in the second and 12.6% in third-quarter 2018.The Basic Materials sector, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is expected to log decline of 9.3% in third-quarter earnings while revenues will rise 9.1%. The mining stocks fall under the Basic Material sector.Gold gained 5% in the third quarter. Gains from a weaker US dollar and geopolitical tensions between the United States and North Korea were the main highlights. The Fed also drove gold prices during the quarter. Copper has also been on a high as supply disruptions at some of the key copper mines including BHP Billiton Limited’s (BHP  -  Free Report) Escondida mine (the world's biggest copper mine) in Chile earlier this year and a strike at Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg operations in Indonesia led to a decline in mined copper production and provided a thrust to prices.Further, reports of a potential Chinese ban on certain imports of copper scrap by the end of 2018 as part of the country’s move to reduce waste helped prop prices. This would lead to higher demand for refined copper and copper concentrate. While China’s imports of copper scrap improved this year, the country’s demand for refined copper remains depressed. As such, a ban on scrap would result in increased imports of refined copper. In fact, the non-ferrous metal is among the best performing commodities this year.In this write-up, we take a sneak peek into four mining stocks that are slated to report their third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26.Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report), which is engaged in the production of gold, silver and copper, will report financial results before the market opens.

The increase was due to production from Long Canyon and Merian, offsetting lower grades at Yanacocha and Tanami.Moreover, attributable gold production for North America, South America and Africa increased year over year while the same declined for Australia.Newmont is making notable progress with its Tanami expansion project in Australia, which is expected to improve gold production at the mine. Tanami expansion project achieved commercial production in August.

288,NEM,"Gold prices are soaring above the $1,300 threshold for the first time in 2017, at same levels last witnessed in September last year. North Korea firing a ballistic missile over Japan sent the stock market in a tizzy and investors scurrying to safe haven asset like gold. Spot gold shot up 1% to trade around $1,322 an ounce in the immediate aftermath of the missile launch.So far this year, the bullion has gained 14% aided by a weak dollar and geopolitical tensions. The dollar has been under strong selling pressure this year amid ongoing uncertainty over the economic agenda of U.S. President Donald Trump and mounting speculation on whether the Fed will implement a third rate hike this year.Gold miners have also experienced a surge this year in tandem with gold prices. To name a few companies, IAMGOLD Corporation (IAG  -  Free Report), Seabridge Gold Inc. , Gold Fields Limited (GFI  -  Free Report) Royal Gold, Inc. (RGLD  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) witnessed price rise of 66.49%, 52.15%, 47.18%, 45.98% and 41.80%, respectively year to date. Let us delve deep in to the factors and find out what is fueling the rise in the bullion this year.U.S-North Korea ImbroglioThe relationship between the United States and North Korea has deteriorated significantly recently. Global investors have dumped stocks and flocked to safe haven assets as a result of the deteriorating ties. Earlier this month after President Trump warned North Korea would be met with ""fire and fury"" if the isolated nation continued to make threats against the United States. On Aug 29, North Korea stoked the fire further by launching a missile that passed over Hokkaido, the second largest island of Japan before crashing in the sea. Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stated that it was an unprecedented, serious and grave threat to Japan. Abe added that he will ask the United Nations to increase the pressure on North Korea. U.S. President Trump responded by saying 'all options on table’ when it comes to dealing with Pyongyang. This situation works in favor of gold which is considered a good store of value during volatility in other markets.Jackson Hole Meeting Quells hope of an Interest HikeThe dollar index hit a new low for 2017 following Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen’s speech at the long awaited annual central banking conference in Jackson Hole, WY on Aug 25. The speech made no reference to U.S. monetary policy and was completely devoted to financial regulatory reforms. The lack of signals about the announcement of the next rate hike was interpreted as ‘dovish’ by the markets. European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi stated that global economy was firming up. Draghi also noted that in Europe and Japan, the consolidation of the recovery is at an earlier stage compared with that of the United States. This led the euro surge to its highest since January 2015 against the U.S. dollar. Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies.Subdued U.S. Inflation Raises Cloud over Rate HikeThe Fed had earlier indicated of three interest rate hikes in 2017, of which, two have already been made by the first half of 2017. In July, U.S. consumer prices rose 1.7% year over year, a bit improvement from 1.6% gain in June, but fell short of expectations of 1.8%. Inflation has continued to lag the Fed’s target of 2%. This estimate could lead a cautious Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until December.Seasonal Demand in Asia Will drive PricesIn the later part of this year, gold prices will get support from retail demand for the yellow metal, which is seasonally strong for India and China due to festival and wedding related buying activities. The World Gold Council anticipates demand from China to grow at least another 20% by 2017. Till July 2017, imports more than doubled to 550 ton as customers built up inventories before the implementation of the Goods & Services Tax (GST). Though the imposition of GST poses a short-term challenge, a more transparent economy, expectations of bumper crop following a good monsoon will boost gold demand consequently. The World Gold Council anticipates consumers to buy between 650 tons and 750 tons of gold during the year. Thus year to date, the mining-Gold industry has outperformed the S&P 500. The industry has gained 15.3% in contrast with the S&P 500’s increase of 9.2% in the same time frame. Valuation looks attractive for industry going by the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) multiple, a preferred valuation metric for cyclical industries. The industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.36 lower than the S&P 500 EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.81. The industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside moving ahead. How to play the Industry Improved performance compared with the S&P 500, low valuation makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry. Backed by a solid Zacks Rank and healthy growth projections, Golden Star Resources Ltd. (GSS  -  Free Report) and Randgold Resources Limited (GOLD  -  Free Report) can be a solid addition to one’s portfolio. Golden Star Resources sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Randgold Resources carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Randgold has a projected earnings growth of 26.31% for 2017 and 27.40% for 2018. Randgold’s estimates have also moved upwards in the past 30 days, depicting the optimistic outlook of analysts. We suggest investors to add Alamos Gold Inc. (AGI  -  Free Report), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report), Kinross Gold  and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) to their watch list. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and their estimates have moved north recently.

Kinross Gold’s estimates have gone up 30.61% for fiscal 2017 and 24.69% for fiscal 2018.  Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking Secret Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Dollar weakness usually benefits gold, as it boosts the metal's appeal as an alternative asset and makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies. Subdued U.S. Inflation Raises Cloud Over Rate Hike The Fed had earlier indicated of three interest rate hikes in 2017, of which, two have already been made by the first half of 2017. In July, U.S. consumer prices rose 1.7% year over year, a bit improvement from 1.6% gain in June, but fell short of expectations of 1.8%. Inflation has continued to lag the Fed’s target of 2%. This estimate could lead a cautious Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until December. Seasonal Demand in Asia Will Drive Prices In the later part of this year, gold prices will get support from retail demand for the yellow metal, which is seasonally strong for India and China due to festival and wedding related buying activities. The World Gold Council anticipates demand from China to grow at least another 20% by 2017.  Through July 2017, imports more than doubled to 550 ton as customers built up inventories before the implementation of the Goods & Services Tax (GST). Though the imposition of GST poses a short-term challenge, a more transparent economy, expectations of bumper crop following a good monsoon will boost gold demand consequently. The World Gold Council anticipates consumers to buy between 650 tons and 750 tons of gold during the year. How to Play the Industry Improved performance compared with the S&P 500, low valuation makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry.

289,NEM,"Throughout the financial analysis and investment world one can find a considerable number of triangles. Up and down arrows are represented as equilateral or isosceles triangles. ""Wedge"" chart patterns are designated by triangles. Theirs is also the pyramid with the triangular all-seeing eye on the back of a one-dollar bill. One of the most interesting triangles, though, is the relationship between gold, interest rates and the dollar. In this week's column, two Experts square off on the future of all three, and weigh in with very different opinions on the attractiveness of the shares of gold-mining companies. Interest Rate & Dollar Rhetoric and Policy
"
290,NEM,"Dennis Slothower, editor of Stealth Stocks would not touch gold shares with a ten-foot pole at the moment. Slothower feels that some recent machinations of the Federal Reserve and the government represent a ""weak dollar policy"" that is partly retribution for diplomatic squabbles with Europe and the Middle East. When the Federal Reserve stated in the 4th quarter that it expected to keep interest rates low ""for a considerable period of time, it relieved some upward pressure on interest rates. Strong economic growth in the third and fourth quarter had seemingly stoked the furnaces of a self-sustaining American economic recovery, which would push interest rates higher.
"
291,NEM,"Yet, inflation remains under wraps and job creation is somewhat tepid. As a result, the Fed was able to use the ""considerable time"" rhetoric in order to send messages to the stock and bond markets alike that interest rates would not need to rise for some time. When the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at the January 28th meeting, it abandoned the crucial rhetoric and communicated that an interest rate increase during 2004 is likely. That activity created strength in the dollar and sent interest rates higher to around 4.20%, though they dropped again on Friday to around 4.06% on the 10-year Note due to a jobs report that disappointed. 
"
292,NEM,"The Federal Reserve's policy of weakening the dollar through lower interest rates and loose monetary policy did provide a jolt to the economy in 2003. Combined with the tax cuts and a cyclical upturn, the economy returned north of 8% GDP growth in the third quarter and 4% in the 4th. The weak dollar provided the dual stimuli of making US goods more competitive in foreign markets, and by making revenues earned in those countries translate into more American dollars.
"
293,NEM,"Aside from the spark to the economy, Slothower also thinks the weak dollar policy of the American government was a dig at a couple of nations. Vis-à-vis Europe, Slothower feels that the weakening of the dollar represents payback at some level for a lack of support regarding Iraq. The effect of a weaker dollar is a much stronger Euro, which puts pressure on European manufacturers for the same reason it helps American ones. 
"
294,NEM,"Slothower also thinks the dollar's slide was partly manufactured as a payback for OPEC's oil production cutbacks. Slothower sees some collusion or back-door negotiations as the source for the compromise that yielded Rafael Ramirez's comments that OPEC would not cut production in February. Venezuela's oil minister went on to express consensus of oil ministers on the issue, and Slothower believes it was a deal orchestrated to persuade the United States to move toward higher interest rates, and thereby a stronger dollar.Gold Turns Green?
"
295,NEM,"Slothower is of the opinion that the dollar rebound is in its infancy and will continue as the economy gets all of its ducks in a row. OPEC's statement allowed oil to drop a bit from its recent highs, which will be a boon to the economy. Slothower believes in the economic recovery story, and cites as evidence gold's $16 drop after OPEC's announcement. Slothower currently counsels selling both gold and the shares of gold mining companies, and he believes that the price of the metal is only likely to decline in the near to intermediate term. Gold and the dollar tend to move inversely. Gold is perceived as a safe haven, and when the dollar loses its role as a store of value, investors move money into the metal.
"
296,NEM,"Ed Bugos, editor of the Goldenbar Report disagrees severely with Slothower's assessment of the plight of gold and the companies that mine the metal. Bugos continues to think that the Dow is over-valued relative to the growth prospects for 2004. In fact, while he agrees that much of the profit boom was related to an inflated money supply, low interest rates and a weak dollar, Bugos feels that both are artificial and not reassuring boosts. Bugos sees a relatively weak labor market, and profits that improve only due to a debasement of the currency. Bugos thinks that dollar bulls are excited by the recent bounce and will walk right into a gold run. 
"
297,NEM,"Bugos thinks that several gold shares are very undervalued right now. He uses the industry's long term cash flow multiple of 12-15x and the stock's price to determine the implied price of gold. Certainly, there are factors, such as hedge books that can alter this relationship. Hedge books are when a company sells future gold production forward and stores the cash in interest-bearing securities. Bugos has little interest in companies with significant hedge books because a) he thinks the price of gold is only going higher and they are locking themselves in at lower prices; b) interest rates are so incredibly low that the company is not creating any value for share-holders by storing it in the form of paper money; and c) Bugos thinks gold companies who do hedge are in collusion with central banks that have an interest in keeping the value of gold low to boost the value of their currencies.
"
298,NEM,"According to Bugos' research, Newmont Mining (NYSE: (NEM  -  Free Report) ) tracks the real price of gold more closely than any of the other companies he follows. It has a very minimal hedge book of .3 years. Newmont has a total cash production cost of $205/oz and Bugos expects the company to continue to grow earnings about 10% a year for the next several years. The company surpassed its full-year production (gold sales) target slightly by booking 7.38 million ounces in gold sales during 2003. Basic and diluted earnings per share came in at 36 cents (7 cents better than expected in the fourth quarter), and $1.15 per share for the full year - compared to 19 cents in the year ago quarter, and $0.41 for 2002. 
"
299,NEM,"The company with the deepest discount based upon a comparison of actual and implied prices of gold is RandGold (NASDAQ: RANGY ), which trades at .4x the price of gold given its cash flow. The company has a minimal hedge book of .1 years and a 5-year earnings growth rate of 37.8%. It produces gold for a very reasonable $97/oz. It's weakness is a shorter mine life than some of the other companies Bugos follows.

309,NEM,"Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results ahead of the bell on Jul 25.Last quarter, the mining company reported a negative earnings surprise of 11.76%. Freeport missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 41.30%.Freeport’s shares have declined 17.1% in the last six months versus the 0.9% growth of its industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayFreepost, in last earnings call, revised its annual guidance and the company now anticipates sales volumes for 2017 to be roughly 3.9 billion pounds of copper (down from 4.1 billion pounds expected earlier), and1.9 million ounces of gold (down from 2.2 million ounces expected earlier). Freeport expects to produce 93 million pounds of molybdenum, including 1 billion pounds of copper, 440,000 ounces of gold and 24 million pounds of molybdenum in second-quarter 2017. Estimated sales volumes assumed normal operating rates at PT-FI beginning mid-Apr 2017.The company assumes that the average prices of gold and molybdenum to be $1,250 per ounce and $9 per pound for the balance of 2017.Lingering uncertainties surrounding the Grasberg mine in Indonesia is weighing on the company's stock. Freeport’s copper sales volumes in Indonesia slid 28% in the first quarter, hurt by regulatory restrictions on PT Freeport Indonesia’s (PT-FI) concentrate exports since mid-Jan 2017. Gold sales volumes also fell in the quarter. Although PT-FI has resumed exports, Freeport cut its copper and gold sales volume guidance for 2017, partly due to the impact of the suspension of exports in Indonesia. Freeport has also reduced its Indonesia workforce by 10% and cut investments in the Grasberg underground expansion.The uncertain copper pricing environment represents another concern. Freeport’s average realized copper prices fell roughly 6% in 2016. While copper prices have enjoyed a healthy run so far in 2017, prices are expected to remain under pressure in the second half of the year on concerns over an economic slowdown in China. Moreover, uncertainty regarding inventory levels may also cause fluctuations in copper pricing.Concerns over a possible economic slowdown in China (a major market for copper) add to the woes. China’s move to tighten credit growth could hurt demand for copper in its property and infrastructure sectors. Chinese copper demand growth is expected to moderate on a year over year basis in 2017.Freeport-McMoran, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Freeport-McMoran, Inc.

311,NEM,"21,000 jobs were added to the economy in February, ALL of which were in the public sector. Economists expected a much stronger number, with estimates at 130,000 and the whisper number much higher. The dollar firmed in the weeks leading up to the unemployment report as global investors were willing to increase their bet on the American economy and Central Banks sought to make their goods cheaper in dollar terms. The Experts are split as to whether the unexpected weakness just extends the time horizon before the full recovery comes to fruition or whether the perceived recovery is really a sham, artificially inflated by loose monetary policy. Get the arguments on both sides of this debate and recommended equities to buy now for whichever side you decide is more compelling.Solid Dollar
"
312,NEM,"The dollar began a several week rally in mid-February that extended through last Friday and the disappointing jobs report. All indications, including the Business Roundtable survey of CEOs of the nations largest company and the Institute for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index pointed to strength in the employment arena. Further, impressive retail numbers, which sent those stocks soaring, indicated that the American consumer was not feeling the sting of a weak labor market. The dollar would have slid further on Friday, but there was evidence that the Japanese Ministry of Finance stepped in to stem the slide and preserve the yens relative value to the American currency. 
"
313,NEM,"Strength in the dollar sent money flowing away from the blue-chip multi-national corporations to more domestic names, according to Ben Zacks, editor of the Zacks Advisor . If the dollar rises relative to other currencies, it will have two negative effects on the bottom lines of the companies that benefited from its slide over the last several quarters. First, exports will become more expensive in foreign markets, making them less competitive to domestically manufactured goods. Second, revenues earned in other currencies would translate into relatively less dollars when the company calculated its earnings per share.
"
314,NEM,"Zacks feels that the economic growth expected this year does warrant strength in the dollar beyond its performance in 2003. In spite of slightly slowing, the ISMs indices on business in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing remain above 60, which indicates a solid pace of economic expansion. Zacks is of the opinion that the US economy will continue to pull those around the globe along, though counsels investors to be aware of the currency dynamics in their investments. 
"
315,NEM,"Ed Bugos, editor of the Goldenbar Report thinks the Japanese have themselves in a pretty pickle with their consistent interventions to avoid rising value of Yen against the dollar. Essentially, the market has come to expect consistent interventions on the part of the Japanese monetary authority, and if that country stops the strategy, the dollar would likely plunge against the Yen. Japans foreign reserves hit a new high of $776.857

318,NEM,"Ed Bugos does not buy into the theory that productivity is to blame for the lack of job creation in this economy. According to Bugos, the improvement in corporate profits and business outlooks is solely related to growth in the money supply, which he sees as merely shifting money around. The 21,000 jobs that were entirely accounted for in the public sector do not, in his opinion amount to a sign of any improvement in the economic growth outlook. Rather, it is merely the further shifting of private dollars to the public sector and is part and parcel of the fiscal deficit that contributes to higher interest rates. Aside from monetary policy, the other earnings improvements are related to a debased currency, which also does not offer a picture of an improving economy.
"
319,NEM,"From Bugos point of view, Productivity doesnt just produce more goods; it produces more jobs, period.
"
320,NEM,"The meaning of the fact that jobs havent picked up is lost on most people that have become convinced that the US economy is recovering. The meaning is that the recovery is not real. In all likelihood, neither is the data the government reports as productivity. This is what gold is telling you, and its what the jobs data are telling you. It means that the profit recovery is not real. And businesses know it! They know the stimulus is temporary. Its not a jobless recovery; its an ephemeral one.
"
321,NEM,"Bugos feels that the negatives: the longest average unemployment period since 1984; average job creation that is less than one third the number of jobs needed to keep pace with the number of new workers entering the labor market due to population growth; and the falling market participation as the only reason the unemployment rate dropped, all point to a nonexistent recovery.Gold Shares with Shine
"
322,NEM,"Bugos expects a new bull move in the gold mining shares that will take out their January highs. On the AMEX Gold Bugs Index (AMEX: HUI ), Bugos notes an alleged double top, but says that the chart belies another story. Since February 6th, the HUI has only closed below the neck line of that double top, and he expects that the North American, unhedged gold producers have support against any further declines. He feels most gold mining companies have support against price declines, but does see some weakness among South African names due to the recovery of the Rand, that countrys currency.
"
323,NEM,"Kinross (NYSE: KGC) currently has the strongest momentum in operating profits. The company showed after tax operating profits for the first time since 1997. The company has a solid grip on the costs associated with its business model. Costs rose 8% compared to the year ago quarter, and by 10% over the whole year. Kinross increased its proven reserves, reduced its long term debt and improved its cash position in 2003. Bugos feels that the stock trades at a discount to fair value, which he calculates based on the implied price of gold associated with the companys reserves and the price of an oz of the commodity. The company is a top-rates buy for Bugos, and he expects the market to catch on to its turn to an operating profit. The other stocks in the Bugos Gold Index are Randgold (NASDAQ: GOLD ), Newmont Mining (NYSE: (NEM  -  Free Report) ) and GoldFields (NYSE: (GFI  -  Free Report) ).Proper Sector Allocation is the Key
"
324,NEM,"Zacks feels that proper sector allocation is at the core of any portfolio strategies. Beyond that, stock picking becomes relatively easy. He remains overweight in the medical sector and recently added Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ: (HSIC  -  Free Report) ), the stock that makes your smile brighter. The company is a leading distributor of dental supplies and equipment. The stock offers Zacks some nice diversification within the Medical arena. HSIC just reported solid sales growth in all of its divisions; 16.8% for dental sales and 34.7% for the medical sector. Schein is also buying growth through a number of recent acquisitions, and analysts are rewarding the company with stronger earnings estimates for the year. 
"
325,NEM,"He also added Open Text Corp. (NASDAQ: (OTEX  -  Free Report) ), which specializes in corporate intranets. The company develops software to search corporate intranets, manage documents and workflows and allow collaboration. The company raised guidance in late February and analysts followed suit with higher earnings estimates. Open Text completed its acquisition of Germany's Ixos Software AG (XETRA: IXSG.DE) ahead of schedule. The acquisition is supposed to double Open Texts revenue and make it a leader within enterprise content management software. Within the technology sector, Zacks likes the software industry, and this is a very unique company in a growing niche. Would the Real Recovery Scenario Please Stand Up?
"
326,NEM,"If the recovery is a sham, then corporate profits, employment and the dollar will likely fail to demonstrate much growth, and will drag the indices down on disappointing reports. In such a scenario, gold will probably represent an attractive safe haven. Zacks does not expect an economic or market rally to rival last year, and has become decidedly more defensive in his posture. Unless the recovery encounters serious road bumps, he expects his portfolio to produce positive returns.

330,NEM,"The gold mining space has been a moderate performer in recent times. While rising rate speculation dulled the safe-haven demand for the yellow metal, some downbeat U.S. economic data points and the resultant dovishness in the Fed’s stance helped the space to hang on to decent gains in the year-to-date frame. This makes it more important to look at how the key companies in this field fared last quarter (read: Gold ETFs Awaiting Bullish Reversals in Second Half of 2017?).Two gold mining companies Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report) reported on July 26, after market close. While ABX came up with upbeat results, Goldcorp dampened investors’ mood by missing on the top line. However, Newmont Mining Corp (NEM  -  Free Report), which reported on July 25 before market open, was the star as it breezed past estimates on both counts by a wide margin. Let’s dig a little deeper (read: Gold Mining ETF Investing Guide).Barrick Gold Q2 Earnings in FocusBarrick Gold’s Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.22 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20 and grew from the year-ago quarter figure of $0.14 per share.Revenues rose 7.4% year over year to $2.160 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.155 billion by a sliver. Average realized price of gold was almost flat in the quarter but copper prices rose 21.5%.The company also reduced its gold production target, though the copper output guidance was maintained. The stock has gained about 3.1% since the release of earnings (as of July 27, 2017).Goldcorp Q2 Earnings in Focus The company’s Q2 adjusted earnings per share were $0.12 compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.10. Revenues of $822 million, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $863 million. Production at several sites fell short of expectations, as per the source. The stock lost about 4.5% since the release of earnings (as of July 27, 2017).Newmont Q2 Earnings in FocusAnother gold mining giant, Newmont Mining reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $0.46 per share, up from $0.29 a year ago. Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.28.Newmont's revenues of $1.875 billion increased 12% from $1.787 billion in the year-ago quarter owing to higher sales volumes and copper pricing. Revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.787 billion. Since the earnings release, the stock has gained about 7.5% (as of July 27, 2017).ETF Impact  The aforementioned companies have considerable exposure in large-cap funds like VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX  -  Free Report), iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners (RING  -  Free Report), PowerShares Global Gold & Precious Metals (PSAU  -  Free Report) and Sprott Gold Miners Exchange Traded Fund (SGDM  -  Free Report) (see all precious metal ETFs here). In PSAU, NEM (8.57%), ABX (7.71%) and GG (6.73%) take the top three positions. RING invests over 14% each in NEM and ABX, while GG takes 8.54%. In GDX also, ABX, NEM and GG take 10.22%, 9.47% and 6.07% share, respectively. SGDM puts about 13.53% and 4.44% in ABX.Bottom LineWith mixed-to-upbeat earnings, now it remains to be seen if gold mining companies and the related ETFs can continue to tack on gains. The Fed was dovish in its July meet too but kept the doors open for asset rollback in the near term, given that the economy has started taking root. Then again, a lower inflationary outlook makes any aggressive policy tightening dicey (read: Gold Surges on Weak U.S. Inflation: ETFs in Focus).Overall, though some glitches have started to appear lately in the gold mining space, the growth story is not over in our opinion. Investors can easily mitigate the weakness in GG by the strength in other mining stocks like NEM and ABX by investing in the afore-mentioned mining ETFs.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

331,NEM,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Newmont Mining Corporation is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NEM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 30 cents per share for NEM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NEM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 7.14% heading into earnings season. Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

"
332,NEM,"Gold miner Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 25.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.70%. Its adjusted earnings of 25 cents per share for the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Newmont has surpassed expectations in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 12.62%.Shares of Newmont have inched up 0.6% in the past three months versus the 4% decline of its industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Newmont is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Newmont is currently pegged at +21.43%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 34 cents and 28 cents, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Newmont currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderNewmont, in its first-quarter call, said that it anticipates attributable gold production in the range of 4.9–5.4 million ounces for 2017. Production at Merian and Long Canyon is anticipated to compensate the impact of declines at Twin Creeks and Yanacocha. The company has kept attributable copper production forecast for 2017 unchanged from the previous guidance of 40,000–60,000 tons.Newmont remains focused on investing in projects, explorations and transactions which can improve the company’s resources, reserves and margin. Its effort to reduce debt will also increase efficiency and cash flows. It will also provide the company with financial flexibility to fund high margin projects. The company is making a notable progress with its growth projects including the Tanami Expansion in Australia, and Subika Underground and Ahafo mill expansion in Africa.Newmont should also gain from its acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor (CC&V) gold mine, which provides an opportunity for it to improve mine life. Also, the company believes that with this buyout it can add profitable gold production and save direct mining costs by up to 10% through enhanced productivity and optimization. Newmont expects gold production from CC&V to be between 400,000 and 450,000 ounces in 2017, at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) in the range of $730–$780.Newmont is also making notable progress with its cost and efficiency improvement programs, which should lend support to its June quarter results. Strong operational performance is also allowing the company to generate positive free cash flow.However, Newmont is exposed to a volatile gold price environment. An expected increase in unit costs in 2017 as reflected by the company’s guidance is also a concern. While Newmont reduced its gold AISC by 2% year over year to $912 per ounce in 2016, the company expects AISC to increase this year to between $940 and $1,000 per ounce. The increase is partly due to a shift in the allocation of cost between copper and gold production and higher investment in advanced project and exploration.Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Newmont Mining Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Newmont Mining Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.  Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +13.33% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.Iamgold Corporation (IAG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +300.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

333,NEM,"Gold is sparkling at the moment and hit a 7 and a half year high at $399/oz on Friday, November 14. Gold bulls perceive the metal and shares of the producers as attractive hedges against inflation, a falling dollar and geopolitical instability. On the day that the Producers Price Index increase was 60% larger than expected, we turn to Zacks resident gold expert for an explanation of why Midas metal is an undervalued asset and the best investment right now.Prices, Money Supply and Inflation
"
334,NEM,"Ed Bugos, editor of the Goldenbar Report , takes issue with the supposition that the Consumer Price Index and Producers Price Index are the best measurements for inflation in the economy. In fact, he feels that it is a shell game being played by the fiscal and monetary authorities in this country to allow them to inflate the money supply in order to make earnings and the economy appear better than they really are. 
"
335,NEM,"At a base level, i.e. the definition of money, Bugos feels there is a large misunderstanding. It is true that currency is an economic good. Dollar bills obviously have utility beyond the paper and ink they are comprised of. As opposed to production and consumption goods, moneys value depends SOLELY on its price. Or, to put it differently, without knowing how much money costs, or is worth, it has no real value. A car or a cotton gin have value in a strictly exchange economy where there is no money. A person can use the car for transportation and the cotton gin to harvest and refine cotton, producing a stream of income in the form of a consumption good. However, in a strictly barter economy, money has no value.
"
336,NEM,"As economies evolved beyond strict barter/exchange scenarios and trade began to extend, gold arose as a standard medium. It was rare; there was a concrete amount; and it tended to have basically the same properties. Governments would stamp gold coins in order to give them more validity, and exchange rates mostly swung on the idea of the purity of the gold used in each coin. Explorers couldnt necessarily bring all the goods with them to purchase supplies and goods from other countries, but gold was accepted in most places. Unlike money, gold also had the dual value of being able to be melted down to make jewelry, crowns, talismans and other valuable symbols of wealth. 
"
337,NEM,"Ever since gold was de-linked from the dollar in 1971, though, there is no physical commodity that has a limited existence and keeps the Fed and the US Treasury from creating a limitless amount of money. The Fed has been increasing the money supply at an astounding rate over the last couple of years in conjunction with lowering interest rates in order to provide stimulus to the economy. Ostensibly, it has worked without creating runaway inflation, at least as far as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producers Price Index (PPI) are concerned. Bugos would argue otherwise. He would say that the stimulus in the form of creating more money did not create any economic value and cites an Austrian economist by the name of Ludwig von Mises in saying, once the market has chosen its money, any change in its quantity confers no additional economic benefit.
"
338,NEM,"In other words, rather than merely increasing the amount of money in circulation, and thereby more economic activity, Bugos believes the stimulus is an unattainable illusion. In order to create an accommodative policy, the Fed cut interest rates significantly in 2001 and 2002 as well as opening up the money supply. Yet, his argument is that the underlying value of the currency is critical in those supply and demand equations, and thereby the price levels. Rhetoric of concerns over deflation came in every Fed policy statement. Deflation is a scenario in which prices in the economy are decreasing due to complete lack of demand. Bugos theory is that the Fed continued to express these fears in order to convince the bond market to keep interest rates low. If more money is being added to the economy and rates are being cut, there is upward pressure on long-term interest rates that are determined by the market. In other words, the Fed had created a rhetorical yield cap.
"
339,NEM,"Now, inflation is showing signs of rearing its head in the economy in the form of the most recent Producers Price Index reading. The Producers Price Index increased 0.8% in October, after increasing 0.3% in September. Economists were forecasting a 0.5% increase. Prices in October were 3.4% higher in October than they were a year ago. Car prices were up 1.6% in October after falling in September, though some of this was attributed to seasonal volatility associated with the launch of new car models. 
"
340,NEM,"This inflation will create pressure on both the market and the Fed to raise interest rates, especially if it accelerates. Yet, if the Fed raises interest rates, the dollar will appreciate, which will be damning for the earnings of many multi-national companies that have seen substantial earnings improvement from a weak dollar making their goods cheaper in foreign markets. The Administration continues to pressure China and Japan to let the market determine the values of their currencies. The irony of it is such a move would amount to a weak dollar policy, but manufacturing and labor interests continue to pressure the Administration in this direction.
"
341,NEM,"Further, rising interest rates would increase pressure on consumer debt loads. Already, the consumer is more leveraged than at any point in its history. Higher rates would take up more disposable income in debt-servicing payments each month. Inflation only exacerbates this scenario because consumer staples become more expensive, especially when inflation is outpacing income growth, as it is in the status quo.Gold Stocks to Buy Now
"
342,NEM,"Bugos very fervently believes that gold will bust through $400, which it has been challenging recently, and thinks it could go to the mid to high $400s before year-end. Bugos compares the moves in gold to other currencies, indices, and metals. His research points to an improvement in golds premium, whether due to the drop in the value of the dollar, higher perceived geopolitical instability, or just that the metal is undervalued. He believes that the market will re-monetize gold as global inflation sets in (all the central banks pursued strategies similar to the one we pursued here, including the European Central Bank, which has explicit inflation-targeting as part of its mandate). However, not all gold stocks are created equally. 
"
343,NEM,"Bugos sold Agnico Eagle (NYSE: AEM ) from his portfolio on October 30th, at $12. He believes the companys cash flow will be hampered due to its low production levels. The company has strong gold and cash reserves, but the market values its in-ground reserves at around the levels of hedged players like Barrick (NYSE: (ABX  -  Free Report) ) around $132/oz vs. $275/oz for the unhedged players.
"
344,NEM,"Bugos two favorite gold stocks right now are Gold Fields Ltd. (NYSE: (GFI  -  Free Report) ) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: (NEM  -  Free Report) ). Bugos recent Gold Fields purchase was a value play when South Africas largest investment house sold a significant share taking the stock from 36% of its invested assets to just 21%. The fund manager invested the funds, 77 million Rand, into Anglogold (NYSE: (AU  -  Free Report) ) and a deal that company is expected to complete with Gold Fields.
"
345,NEM,"Bugos believes that Newmont, which recently announced a $1 billion financing offer, is attempting to build a war chest to dislodge Anglogold from its recently acquired #1 gold producing spot. There is further speculation that the company could be in the process of buying foreign gold shares at relatively cheap prices with what Bugos believes is inflated paper. He says such a move would confirm his theory that foreign gold shares offer a compelling value relative to domestic ones, and he argues that Newmont would be better served committing those funds to exploration. Bugos feels that both Gold Fields and Harmony Gold (NYSE: (HMY  -  Free Report) ) could be attractive takeover targets.Golden Exposure
"
346,NEM,"The recent strength in the price of gold merits more than merely a quick glance into the area. The dollars downward trend, obstinately high oil prices, and the entire interest rate scenario do provide a compelling case for having exposure to gold. Bugos portfolio includes futures on gold itself, shorts of the dollar against other currencies AND gold shares. The equities are a good place to start educating yourself and could pave the way to a Midas touch for you.

"
348,NEM,"Lots of noise has been made about a resilient stock market this year. But the big winner in 2003 is Gold. In fact, since March the Gold stock index is up 46%. Gold marches to the beat of different drummer than the stock market. Today we get insight from gold expert, Ed Bugos, who helps us listen closely to what the drumbeats are telling us for the future prospects of this precious metal. Cheap Money Stimuli
"
349,NEM,"A prolonged bear market and September 11th set both the fiscal and monetary authorities in the United States on a path of creating cheap money. Alan Greenspan led the Federal Reserve Board to cut interest rates upwards of a dozen times. He also opened the monetary spigot zooming the money supply. Fears of deflation percolated throughout the United States when the country turned into a recession and economists further analyzed the Japanese experience. Ed Bugos is editor of the Goldenbar Report . Bugos, along with many others who closely follow the gold industry and markets, believes that the specter of deflation was seized and popularized in order to create leeway for the Fed to pump money into the economy without setting off inflation warning bells. 
"
350,NEM,"As the economy stubbornly resisted both the interest rate cuts and the money supply pump, fears of deflation spread. Deflation is an economic environment in which prices are sinking due to a lack of demand. The Fed responded by assuaging investors and politicians alike that, in the event of an intense deflationary slump, the central bank could always move out on the yield curve and buy longer term securities. The result would be to keep interest rates low, providing more stimulus.
"
351,NEM,"Simultaneously, the budget surplus of the Clinton years has evaporated. The two largest tax cuts in history combined with a conflict in Iraq could put the US in serious hock. Funding for terrorist preparedness and the ongoing war in Afghanistan are also helping deficits to grow very quickly. The effect of the deficit is to require substantially higher dollar values of T-Bills to be auctioned. This supply of fixed income instruments drives interest rates still higher and the price of fixed income to go lower. (Interest rates and bond prices are inversely related.)
"
352,NEM,"All of these factors, and weak earnings contributed to a run in gold. The dollar slipped significantly, which ultimately helped earnings through currency benefits. But, as the dollar falls, gold rises. Some have argued that the dollar has stabilized, and that higher interest rates will help the American currency. The dollar recently broke just above its 200-day moving average after a rather precipitous fall that began in April. Ostensibly, that could spell an end to golds recent run, yet Bugos doesnt think so.Diminishing Outlook for Returns
"
353,NEM,"For Bugos, the significant slide in the dollar is truly evidence of inflation that has been running under the radar. While inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is showing little signs of resurgence, the commodities show Bugos another picture. Natural gas and oil prices are still refusing to drop as the ever-shifting supply picture is made murkier by continued conflict in the Middle East and the tendency of the lights to go out. Bugos also sees recent strength in the precious metals, silver and platinum as signs that golds heydays are not over. Further, copper, a commodity that tends to respond to presage an inflation, has been rising in price. He also mentions moves in lumber and wheat as evidence of this inflation, which hurts fixed income more.
"
354,NEM,"Bugos believes that the move in the precious metals portends negative things for the dollar and US equities, as they tend to move inversely with one another. The underperformance of American equities, compared with those in other countries increases the likelihood that foreign money will not be chasing American returns. The higher interest rates are not because economic growth is demanding a cool-down, but rather bond market investors are rushing for the door. The Fed has calmed the bond market by counseling that they can continue to lower rates, a bullish move for gold. Yet, this did not come before US bonds significantly underperformed fixed income in other countries for a month and a half.
"
355,NEM,"Trade deficits, too, continue to worsen. The US demand for foreign goods, and thus the outflow of dollars, will continue to put upward pressure on rates. This is the second head of the double-headed deficit monster. Treasury Secretary John Snow just approached the Chinese government to attempt to negotiate a floating of the yuan. The Chinese currency is currently pegged to the dollar, making Chinese goods artificially cheap compared to ours, and worsening the trade deficit. Yet, the Chinese are also trading a great deal more with their Asian partners, as discussed last week, and are in the process of opening a Shanghai gold exchange and allowing their citizens to own the metal privately.
"
356,NEM,"Bugos also sees one of the primary sources of strength, and a prime beneficiary of lower rates, as beginning to deflate. The rate of appreciation of home prices has slowed significantly to a rate of 3% over the last three months down from 8.5% per year just 24 months ago. As such, a source of wealth, and cash, is disappearing for the consumer.Adding Golden Shine to your Portfolio
"
357,NEM,"Bugos is skeptical of earnings and any bullish case for investing in equities. He estimates that the structural factors represented by the twin deficits and the endless creation of new dollars justify gold moving higher. Bugos also insists that gold is undervalued due to some activity in the transaction of gold investing. Bugos recommends buying gold bullion and has shorts on the dollar against the Yen. Above all else, he thinks the price of gold is going to $475/oz. and recently published a Special Report seeking to find the equities that will most benefit from what he sees as the inevitable $100 move in gold.
"
358,NEM,"Bugos created a comparative analysis using estimated cash costs, production and values of hedge books to find the companies that would experience the best cash flow benefits from the positive move in gold. On a cash flow basis at $475, Bugos finds Gold Fields Limited (NYSE: (GFI  -  Free Report) ), Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE: (KGC  -  Free Report) ) and Anglogold (NYSE: AU) attractively valued. In other words, the companies are trading at less than 8x what their cash flow would be were gold to go $475/oz.
"
359,NEM,"Bugos also conducted a comparison of the gold equities based on their valuations relative to cash and gold reserves and the expected lives of their mines. Most companies valuations tend to closely follow the expected lives of their mines, which makes sense given that mines are the basis for their products. Harmony Gold Mining Corp. (NASDAQ: HGMCY ) and Gold Fields Limited (NYSE: GFI) are cheap on this basis; Newmont Mining (NYSE: (NEM  -  Free Report) ) and Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE: (AEM  -  Free Report) ) are expensive on this basis.
"
360,NEM,"Bugos feels that Randgold (NASDAQ: GOLD ), Kinross (NYSE: (KGC  -  Free Report) ) and Gold Fields Limited (NYSE: (GFI  -  Free Report) ) are among the companies with the most attractive valuations and largest potential upside if gold goes to $475/oz.The Neverending Search for Value
"
361,NEM,"Many market analysts would argue that the bullish outlook for the broad equity indices in the US mean that gold will not likely be an attractive investment. Bugos would argue that the recent strength in gold is a warning that equities will probably not be such hot investments. Certainly it is possible that both stocks and gold could go up, at which point taking a look into Bugos extensive gold-mining research is probably not such a bad idea.

363,NEM,"The interrelationship of the financial markets is so vast and complex it would take a lifetime to studyand still probably not understand all aspects. We often hear of the affects of the Feds targeting of interest rates and the projected aftermath for the stock market and bond market and economy. Read on to find out why the recent surge in interest rates, particularly in the bond market, may halt the recovery in its tracks and cause money to flow out of markets simultaneously.Yield Bounceback
"
364,NEM,"Interest rates on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 3.1% in June, and have since risen to 4.2%. According to Ed Bugos, editor of the Goldenbar Report , it was the massive lower of rates heading that contributed to the stock market rally post-March. Much of this drop was due to increased interest in bonds from the perception, created by the Federal Reserve, that deflation was a huge concern. It justified zooming the money supply and lowering interest rates further. Yet, when Greenspan recently quashed the expectation that the Federal Reserve Board would move out on the yield curve by buying longer term securities, interest rates made a sharp turnaround. Investors began dumping them, sending interest rates higher. Combined with G-Spans upbeat outlook on the economy, IN-flation, not deflation, became the markets focus. Since inflation erodes the real returns on bonds (Real Return=Nominal Return - Inflation), investors trampled over themselves selling out of the bond market.
"
365,NEM,"The lower interest rates that we enjoyed for a spell had the dual effects of lowering borrowing costs for companies, thus increasing their earnings, and forcing money into equities for lack of any other securities offering real returns. Dividend-yielding stocks, propelled by the tax cut on dividends, became much more attractive and the equity markets had a collective cocktail party. However, Bugos believes that now that rates are rising, stocks have been hoisted on their own petards and most deliver earnings themselves. What he saw as an artificially low interest rate environment was driving valuations up and money toward equities. Now the rose-colored glasses have been removed and stocks are left to fend for themselves.
"
366,NEM,"The bond selloff has been accelerated by positive economic news, according to Gregory Spear, editor of The Spear Report: Professional Edition . Spear describes the trading on July 31 and August 1 as interesting given that the response to strong employment numbers, GDP numbers and construction/manufacturing numbers prompted a selloff in bonds. The bond price drop wasnt what was interesting, rather the response of the stock market provided a view of what could happen if interest rates continue to rise.
"
367,NEM,"Finally, long-term interest rates will continue to face pressure as unprecedented amounts of securities are brought to the market by the US government. With the twin trade and budget deficits, Uncle Sam may begin to crowd out corporations from the credit markets. Basic supply and demand says increasing the supply lowers the price. In the case of bonds, interest rates go up. Companies would have to offer ever higher interest rates on their bonds to make them competitive with the ones with full faith and credit of the US government. This should continue to push rates up.Obstacles to Economic, Market Growth
"
368,NEM,"Higher interest rates create a couple of obstacles to an expanding equity market and economy. First, higher interest rates increase the cost of capital for many companies. As I discussed in my July 21st column, higher interest rates could spell trouble for finance companies, especially those with exposure to the mortgage markets. It will be harder to continue securitizing mortgages and offering the low rates that have lured so many Americans into the home-buying market. Not to mention that higher interest rates could increase the burden on ordinary Americans, as adjustable rate mortgage payments begin to rise. They could default or decrease the revenue paid to major financial institutions.
"
369,NEM,"If companies are forced to borrow money at higher rates, it creates a squeeze on their net interest margins. The refinancing activity that has gone on in corporate America, in the same way that low mortgage rates allowed consumers to refinance their mortgages, will cease. This is problematic because the lower rates had opened up the corporate credit markets such that companies could begin borrowing again at lower rates and were cleaning up their balance sheets. This activity to shore up balance sheets was seen as a precursor to expanded investment spending, the end of which could be troublesome for a fragile recovery. 
"
370,NEM,"As far as the market itself goes, higher interest rates, i.e. lower bond prices, could also reverse the equity allocation trade that has been made. Because bond yields/interest rates are inversely related to the prices of bonds, when interest rates go up, prices go down. Given that bonds are now offering higher yields and are at lower prices, some of the money that went chasing dividends may move back into bonds on an equity allocation play. Bonds remain the most conservative security, and, especially if the economy begins to falter, could lure conservative funds. A falling equity market, in conjunction with economic activity choked off by higher interest rates could spell much trouble for the recovery.Gold is the Inflation Antidote
"
371,NEM,"Ed Bugos has long contended that gold is seriously under-valued and that the multi-year focus on deflation was a red herring. It was used in order to keep a cap on bond yields such that the Federal Reserve Board could continue growing the money supply and lower interest rates while driving stocks up. This money would be absorbed by the bond market who saw the securities as insulation against negative inflation per the equation discussed above. Bugos contended that the recipe for serious inflation was brewing as could be seen in strength in commodity prices. Bugos feels that gold and gold equities remain the best investments in this environment. Interestingly, Gregory Spear, who called Newmont the Microsoft of Gold agrees.
"
372,NEM,"Newmont Mining (NYSE: (NEM  -  Free Report) ) has equity reserves of 89 million oz of gold, which translates into $23 billion in cash according to Spear. Thus the Microsoft comparison is rather simple. Newmont reported better than expected second quarter profits of $.22/share vs. $.18/share expected by Wall Street. While gross operating profits slipped slightly, that is primarily due to rising cash costs across the industry. The company realized an average gold price of $353/oz vs. $314 in the second quarter of 2002. Most significantly, however, was that the company improved its hedge book to -$19 million from -$224 million in the first quarter and -$433 million at year end 2002. The hemorrhaging hedge book had earned the company a risk premium that was a serious onus on a rising stock price. Bugos is ecstatic and has a screaming buy on the company that has eliminated virtually all of its hedge book.Correction or Not
"
373,NEM,"Rising interest rates are certainly not comforting at this point in the game, unless they are evidence of a serious economic recovery. Yet a quick glimpse at a chart of the yield on the 10-year note reveals a spike that is not born out by the economic data. Likely, some of the stimulus created by 12 interest rate cuts and zooming money supply created upward pressure on interest rates. You simply cant push down on a spring forever without it bouncing back. The question is whether this rise in rates will be sustained and damaging to the stock market, or whether equities will continue higher after a brief respite. In either scenario, owning some gold, or gold equity proxies cant be a bad idea.

376,NEM,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals. These include aluminum and gold, other precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output.
"
377,NEM,"Iron and steel commands the largest segment of the global metals market. They comprise more than half the metals industry in terms of volume, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products. These include pipe and tube, wire and spring, rolls and bars.
"
378,NEM,"The precious metal and minerals industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.
"
379,NEM,"The global metal industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Historically it has suffered from overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. The recent focus on the weakening outlook for global economic growth has emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry. These near-term challenges aside, the group’s long-term dynamics appear attractive.A Detailed Look into Metals: Performance and Outlook 
"
380,NEM,"Steel
"
381,NEM,"As the major stakeholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. Recovery, however, has been swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production reached a record level of 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump. This trend has largely remained in place this year, though the emerging growth worries will likely force some producers to take production off-line.
"
382,NEM,"China remains the largest steel-producing country, accounting for roughly half of all global production at 46%, though its first quarter 2012 volumes were barely up from the year-earlier level. Japan, the second largest producer, posted a 4.1% decline.  The U.S. is in the third position, though its first quarter production was 9.2% higher year over year. North American crude steel production was up 7.7% in the first quarter, Asia was flat, while Europe dipped 3.8%. In April 2012, world crude steel production was down 3% from March, but up 1% from the April 2011 levels.
"
383,NEM,"As we look into the first quarter results of the steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) -- we find revenues benefitted from higher average steel prices. On the volume front, ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel saw a rise, while Nucor and AK Steel suffered declines. Revenues increased at all the companies except AK Steel. However, we note margin compression across the board.
"
384,NEM,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has shown significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached their highest level since February 2008 at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first five months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.4 million SAAR. Many auto manufacturers made their best Memorial Day sales in over five years. Motor vehicle sales were at 13.8 million in May, declining from 14.4 million in April. Even though sales slid to the lowest level so far in 2012, it is still better than consensus expectations from the beginning of the year. On a year-over-year basis, sales increased 26% in May.
"
385,NEM,"The construction sector has been a drag on steel companies’ earnings. According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 48.4 in April 2012. This followed a 50.4 reading in March, and of significance since any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings. After remaining at a level over 50 for five consecutive months, the index has slipped into negative territory. Given the continued uncertainty in the market, we do not expect any immediate recovery in this sector.
"
386,NEM,"The residential construction market has improved in recent months, but the pace of improvement has been very slow and halting. This means that this end market is unlikely to emerge as a key growth driver for steel producers any time soon.
"
387,NEM,"The World Steel Association projects global steel usage to rise 3.6% in 2012, a sharp deceleration from 2011’s 5.6% growth. This reflects continuing slowdown of Chinese steel demand and Eurozone debt crisis uncertainties. Questions about the U.S. growth outlook make another cloud on the horizon.
"
388,NEM,"China’s steel use in 2012 is estimated to grow 4% to 648.8 million tons, following 6.2% growth in 2011. The slackening is due to the economy entering a less steel-intensive growth phase as a result of the government’s efforts to rebalance the economy and restrain the real estate bubble. After a weak performance in 2011, India is expected to grow by 6.9% to reach 72.5 Mt.
"
389,NEM,"Apparent steel use in the U.S. is forecast to grow 5.7% in 2012. In Central and South America, apparent steel use will attain a historical high of 49.1 Mt, up 6.8% in 2012. Brazil is expected to return to positive growth. Japan’s steel use is expected to drop 0.6% to 63.7 Mt in 2012 due to the impact of exchange rate appreciation, despite the reconstruction efforts following the March 2011 earthquake.
"
390,NEM,"Steel usage in the European Union is expected to decline by 1.2% to 150.9 Mt in 2012 as  sovereign debt problems persist. Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker by volume and Europe's largest steelmaker, had earlier decided to idle five of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe and announced the extended idling of a number of facilities. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations.
"
391,NEM,"Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred. To reduce its exposure to Europe, the company recently sold its 24% share in European energy company Enovos International.
"
392,NEM,"To sum it up, despite relatively over-supplied conditions and softening prices, the outlook for the sector is not that bad. Prices could potentially stabilize, as visibility on the economic growth questions of countries like China, India and South Korea improves. The outlook for key end-markets in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors remains favorable. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the industry.
"
393,NEM," Gold
"
394,NEM,"As per the World Gold Council, last year was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
395,NEM,"In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, gold demand was at 1097.6 tons, a 5% year over year decline. Increase in investment demand was offset by declines in demand for jewelry and in the technology sectors, due to higher prices. Central banks continued to be purchasers of gold, accounting for around 7% of total gold demand, at 80.8 tons.
"
396,NEM,"However, in absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $59.7 billion, a 16% jump compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the first quarter stood at $1,690.57. This was 22% above the prior fiscal’s quarter. In value terms, all the sectors of gold demand posted growth, barring physical bars and the official sector.
"
397,NEM,"Investment demand posted robust growth in the quarter, particularly led by ETFs and similar products. Gold demand in the technology sector was at 107.7 tons, a 7% decline year-over-year due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, higher inventories and the uncertainty in Europe.
"
398,NEM,"Jewelry demand dipped 6% to 519.8 tons due to higher price levels. The 22% higher quarterly average price suggests that jewelry demand is not directly related to price. Value of jewelry demand grew 14% to a record $28.3 billion. China, Russia and Egypt recorded growth, while weakness was witnessed in India, a number of Middle Eastern markets and in Europe.
"
399,NEM,"Jewelry demand in India, otherwise a major consumer of gold, was down 19% and investment demand declined 46%. This was mainly due to a sharp decline in the rupee, which led to higher local prices, rise in import taxes on gold and imposition of excise duty on jewelry in that country. However the excise duty was later withdrawn by the government. Gold in India is currently at an all-time high in rupee terms.
"
400,NEM,"In China, demand for gold increased 10% to a record high of 255.5 tons. China remained the largest jewelry market for the third consecutive quarter. Boosted by the local New Year holiday earlier this year, jewelry demand was at 156.6 tons, up 8% year over year, and accounting for 30% of global jewelry demand. Even though the pace of growth is slowing, gold demand remains high due to rising income levels, urbanization, economic growth and inflation.
"
401,NEM,"Mine production increased to 673.8 tons, up 3% year over year. The additional supply came from new projects coming on stream and the continued ramping up of projects that entered into production two to three years ago across the globe. Recycling activity increased 11% to 391.5 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,070.3 tons, up 5% year over year.
"
402,NEM,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce in 2011. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,781 per ounce, with an average of $1,657 per ounce. Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect this year to be stellar for gold.
"
403,NEM,"It also remains a coveted asset, given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis promoted gold as a currency hedge for European investors. Lingering economic concerns, higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, the relentless Euro-zone debt crisis and a still-high American unemployment rate will continue to support gold prices this year, as well.
"
404,NEM,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers, and is considered a safe-haven investment. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continue to rebound, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
405,NEM,"Analyzing the results of the gold companies in our coverage -- Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report) and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM  -  Free Report) -- we find that first-quarter profits were driven by higher average realized gold prices. As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as these will benefit. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross are slated to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
406,NEM,"Ironically, rallying gold prices have not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. This is reflected in our overall long-term Neutral view on the space. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold, rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may have labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.Aluminum
"
407,NEM,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.
"
408,NEM,"In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Alcoa, Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, reported better-than-expected results on the back of growth in the aerospace and automobile sectors.
"
409,NEM,"The company anticipates that global aluminum demand will go up by 7% this year. It also expects that burgeoning demand for aluminum along with market-related production cutbacks will lead to a global aluminum industry deficit of 600,000 metric tons in 2012. Region-wise, in 2012, China and India are expected to lead with double-digit growth. Russia and Brazil are projected to have 4% to 5% increases in aluminum consumption rates. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
410,NEM,"Alcoa’s positive outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Rio Tinto (RIO) plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs. Alcoa plans to close or curtail 390,000 metric tons, or approximately 12% of its global smelting capacity, in 2012. This will lower the company’s cost position by 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining, by 2015 and improve its competitiveness.
"
411,NEM,"This trend will continue until aluminum prices recover.  Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been trending down lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up action to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
412,NEM,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve globally. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets.
"
413,NEM,"The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and its light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
414,NEM,"Further, the surge in copper prices this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on the more economical metal. In response to the spurt in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
415,NEM,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
416,NEM,"Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, or Chalco  should benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
417,NEM,"Copper is a major industrial metal, with its price strongly correlated with the outlook for economic growth. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
418,NEM,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage reflects its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper ranks third after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
419,NEM,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies resulted in high copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008 copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound, due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
420,NEM,"However, copper prices have since improved, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. During 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.39 per pound to $3.93 per pound, averaging $3.77. This rising trend has benefited copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report).
"
421,NEM,"Notwithstanding the volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper prices. Prices will be influenced by demand from China, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
422,NEM,"Despite near-term challenges, the outlook for the copper remains positive, supported by widespread use of copper, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
423,NEM," Overall Industry Outlook
"
424,NEM,"Growth in the emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. In the developed world, Europe’s problems have likely pushed it into a recession already, which will have residual effects elsewhere in the world. The U.S. economy, which looked very promising earlier this year, no longer offers a robust picture.
"
425,NEM,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.
"
426,NEM,"The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the economy’s momentum. But the Fed’s ability to make a meaningful change may be limited in the absence of fiscal measures that are unlikely to come through in this election year.
"
427,NEM,"About the Industry
"
428,NEM,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output.
"
429,NEM,"The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars.
"
430,NEM,"The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.Overall Industry Outlook
"
431,NEM,"The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange (LME) prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets.
"
432,NEM,"Profitability at the individual company level depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover and develop new deposits, thereby boosting reserves, while the smaller ones own fewer mines.
"
433,NEM,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have historically been a critically important growth strategy for mining companies. The year 2009 experienced a lull in M&A activity under the impact of the global economic downturn and the focus shifted from business growth to business survival, as companies looked to safeguard their teetering balance sheets rather than seeking expansion.
"
434,NEM,"However, reversing the trend, 2010 witnessed a surge in mining deals as the rise in commodity prices, economic recovery, demand in developing markets, growing scarcity of resources and refreshed balance sheets spurred merger activity.
"
435,NEM,"2011 was a busy year in terms of M&A activity despite the European debt crisis, earthquake in Japan, social unrest in the Middle East, and downgrade of the U.S. government’s debt rating. We expect the momentum in M&A to sustain in 2012 as well. Armed with healthy balance sheets, reduced economic uncertainty and a pent-up demand for new projects, we expect the companies in the industry to accelerate deal activity with a re-focus on consolidation.
"
436,NEM,"In an industry plagued with rising energy and raw material costs, increasing productivity and reducing costs are the keys to success. Given the cyclical nature of the metals industry, low-volume, high-cost producers need to generate sufficient cash or ensure a strong borrowing position during market peaks to survive the market troughs.
"
437,NEM,"Continuing consolidation supports the sector’s ability to influence the price of input costs and companies can also obtain synergies and economies of scale through the operation of vertically integrated raw materials sources. Expansion in low-cost countries will ensure lower labor costs and also help tap their growth potential.
"
438,NEM,"The Glencore-Xstrata merger currently in the offing is one of the biggest ever in the mining sector. If it materializes, it would result in a combined new business of $90 billion and will be the world's biggest exporter of coal for power plants and the largest producer of zinc. This will be the largest mining transaction in history, dwarfing the earlier major deals like Rio Tinto-Alcan in 2007 and Vale-Inco in 2006.
"
439,NEM,"Demand in the metals and mining industry has benefitted from the strong growth in emerging markets. China and India in particular, are witnessing higher production and consumption of metals. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S levels, which could, theoretically at least, double metal demand in the longer term.
"
440,NEM,"China is the world’s largest consumer of metals and is expected to remain so in the future. Overall, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries.
"
441,NEM,"Demand as well as production for industrial metals in Japan had been recently affected, as factories were shut down in the aftermath of the country’s strongest earthquake and tsunami. Japan is the biggest buyer of aluminum and the second largest buyer of copper ore.
"
442,NEM,"We believe the industry will continue to benefit from the metal demand generated from the country’s rebuilding activity. Sovereign debt issues and sluggish growth in Europe however remain lingering concerns.A Detailed Look into Metals
"
443,NEM,"Steel
"
444,NEM,"As the major shareholder (about 60%) of the metals market, the steel industry was severely bruised by the global economic downturn. But the recovery has been swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 million tons (Mt) in 2011, outperforming the 2010 record of 1,414 Mt, a 6.8% jump.
"
445,NEM,"China continues to retain its status as the largest steel producing country, yielding almost half of the global output at 46%, and growing 8.9% year over year. Japan, the second largest producer country, however posted a 1.8% decline due to the earthquake.  The United States remained in the third position, producing 86.2 Mt of crude steel, 7.1% higher than 2010 and comprising 6% of the total global output.
"
446,NEM,"North America’s crude steel production was 118.9 Mt, an increase of 6.8% on 2010.  In Asia, overall growth was noted at 7.9% and Europe rose 4.6%. As per January figures, in the current fiscal, world crude steel production was 117 Mt, a 7.8% dip from January 2011 but flat with  December 2011 levels.
"
447,NEM,"Reflecting on the 2011 results of the steel companies in our coverage - ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) and Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) -- revenues increased across the board due to higher average steel prices and increase in shipments.
"
448,NEM,"ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 91.9 million tons in fiscal 2011, representing 6% of the world's steel output. ArcelorMittal’s 2011 sales increased 10% to $94 billion and for AK Steel sales climbed 8% to $6.5 billion. Nucor recorded sales increase of 21% to reach $20 billion.
"
449,NEM,"In terms of profitability, Nucor stood tall with its fiscal 2011 EPS of $2.45, almost six fold the 42 cents earned in 2010. ArcelorMittal’s EPS in fiscal 2011 plummeted 31% to $1.19. AK Steel reversed its year-ago loss to earn 9 cents (excluding special items) in 2011. U.S. Steel Corp (X  -  Free Report), though still in red, narrowed its fiscal 2011 loss per share to 47 cents from the year-ago loss of $3.36.
"
450,NEM,"Currently, Nucor, United Steel and AK Steel retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term (1 to 3 months) that corresponds with our Neutral recommendations in the long term. ArcelorMittal retains a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and we have recently downgraded our long-term recommendation from Neutral to Underperform.
"
451,NEM,"The steel industry had been severely affected by the global economic crisis. However, there were signs of a turnaround from the second half of 2009 which continued into 2010 and 2011 at tandem with global economic activity. Demand for steel products nonetheless remains below pre-recession levels. We expect the recovery to be slow and steady in 2012.
"
452,NEM,"The steel companies expect volumes to improve in 2012 on recovering demand from improving end-markets, backed by a recuperating global economy. They expect operating results to significantly improve from 2011 levels mainly driven by improved average realized prices and higher shipments. Steel consumption is expected to grow in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial, and the agricultural sectors.
"
453,NEM,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector is showing significant promise. In February 2012, total motor vehicle sales reached the highest level since February 2008 at 15.1 million SAAR (Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate). For the first two months of 2012, sales have averaged 14.6 million SAAR, outperforming the Street expectations.
"
454,NEM,"The construction sector has been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, we see some early signs of recovery in non-residential construction.
"
455,NEM,"According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index, an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to twelve month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 50.9 in January 2012. The index has remained over 50 for the third consecutive month, a sure indicator of an overall rise in demand.
"
456,NEM,"The optimism is seen across most regions of the country and the major construction sectors. However, given the continued uncertainty in the market, we expect soft to very moderate near-term growth in demand in this sector.
"
457,NEM,"According to the data released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing starts increased 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 699,000 in January 2012 from December 2011 and 9.9% above January 2011.
"
458,NEM,"Building permits in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000, 0.7% above the December figure of 671,000 and 19% above the January 2011 number. These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally on a road to recovery.
"
459,NEM,"Based on expected economic growth from developing countries like China, India and South Korea, steel prices will be pushed up higher in the future. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the steel industry.
"
460,NEM,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal has idled 5 of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. Furthermore, the company’s focus on its mining business given its more attractive returns has resulted in some planned steel investments being deferred.Gold
"
461,NEM,"As per the World Gold Council reports, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
462,NEM,"Mine production increased 4% year over year to a record level of 2809.5 tons. However, there was a decline noted in recycling activity as consumers held on to their gold in the expectation of even higher prices. Central banks purchases rose significantly to 440 tons from 77 tons in the prior year reflecting the need to diversify assets, reduce reliance on one or two foreign currencies and rebalance reserves. Central banks have been net buyers for three straight years, the longest stretch since 1973.
"
463,NEM,"Demand for gold bars and coins were robust due to the concerns raging in Europe, inflation in some countries and the unsatisfactory performance of a range of alternative instruments. The ongoing crisis in Europe has positively affected the demand for gold given the need for asset protection.
"
464,NEM,"Jewelry demand was particularly strong in the first half of 2011 driven by the two major markets, China and India, due to the timing of local festivals. China and India remain the major consumers of gold, generating 55% of global jewelry demand and 49% of global demand. However, record prices in September combined with price volatility deviated customers towards other investment products.
"
465,NEM,"On the whole, a 28% increase in average annual price led to an annual decline of 3% in tonnage demand in fiscal 2011. Notwithstanding this, annual demand was a record $99.2 billion.
"
466,NEM,"Gold demand in the technology sector was at 463.5 tons worth $23.4 billion, a 28% increase year over year. Particular strength was noted in automotive electronics, industrial electronics and wireless equipment segments. However, the memory sector weakened considerably and is expected to remain so in 2012 as well. Severe flooding in Thailand which affected hard disk drive shipments, ongoing turmoil in Europe, and shift toward other non-precious metals also contributed to the weakness.
"
467,NEM,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. Average gold price was $1,572 per ounce in 2011 compared with the prior year average of $1,223 per ounce.  
"
468,NEM,"So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,598 per ounce to $1,781 per ounce, with an average of $1,698 per ounce. Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect his year to be stellar for the yellow metal.
"
469,NEM,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries made gold an attractive and safe investment option. The European sovereign debt crisis made European investors use gold as a currency hedge. Pressure on the US dollar against various currencies coupled with higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, pushed up gold prices.
"
470,NEM,"The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.
"
471,NEM,"Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report). However, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
472,NEM,"Ironically, rallying gold prices are not having the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. This is reflected in our overall long-term neutral view on the space. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold rather than investing in gold companies per se that are grappling with labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
473,NEM,"As the major economies continue to recover, investor confidence in the stock markets will be restored, causing gold prices to fall. In reality this is not going to happen anytime soon. The stocks of Barrick Gold, Newmont Mining, Goldcorp and Kinross Gold Corporation retain a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold). However, Agnico Eagle holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell).Aluminum
"
474,NEM,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. The global economic downturn had a drastically negative impact on the aluminum industry, leading to an unprecedented decline in LME-based aluminum prices, weak end markets, fall in demand, increased global inventories, and higher costs of borrowing and diminished credit availability. The sector has however recovered from recessionary lows.Alcoa Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum, in response to the global economic downturn implemented a number of operational and financial actions to improve its cost structure and liquidity, including curtailing production, halting non-critical capital expenditures, accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials, divesting non-core assets, reducing global headcount, suspending its share repurchase program, reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and resorting to other liquidity enhancements.
"
475,NEM,"For fiscal 2011, Alcoa reported adjusted earnings of 72 cents per share, reversing the year-ago loss of 3 cents per share. The company anticipates that global aluminum demand will go up 7% and burgeoning demand for aluminum along with market-related production cutbacks will lead to a global aluminum industry deficit of 600,000 metric tons in 2012.
"
476,NEM,"Aluminium demand started on a strong note in 2011 but weakened in the second half. Overall, aluminium demand grew 10% in the year after 13% growth witnessed in 2010. Overall, Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
477,NEM,"Market conditions for aluminum products are expected to improve globally, particularly in aerospace (10–11%), driven by rising demand for large commercial aircraft. The strong performance at the automotive sector in the fourth quarter is expected to sustain in 2012, growing at en estimated clip of 3–5%. Commercial transportation is expected to grow 2–5%, packaging in the range of 2–3% and building and construction markets in the band of 4–5%.
"
478,NEM,"Region-wise, in 2012, China is expected to lead the pack with a growth of 12% followed shortly by India with a 10% rise. Asia (excluding China) is expected to record a growth of 9% and North America 3%. Russia and Brazil are expected to increase 4% and 3%, respectively. Europe, besieged by sovereign debt problems, is expected to remain flat year over year.
"
479,NEM,"Since the sudden decline from peak prices in mid-2008, aluminum prices have subsequently increased. In 2010, global aluminum prices rose 13%. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, aluminum prices plunged 27% from peak levels in April 2011. This was perpetrated by market concerns that the eurozone debt crisis could affect the global manufacturing industry and would lead to a huge downside in metals demand.
"
480,NEM,"Consequently, profits for the mining companies took a blow compelling them to cut back on production. Rio Tinto announced plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs.
"
481,NEM,"Alcoa plans to close or curtail 531,000 metric tons, or approximately 12% of its global smelting capacity, in the first half of 2012. This will lower the company’s cost position by 10 percentage points and improve its competitiveness. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up actions to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
482,NEM,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption will improve globally with revival palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products.
"
483,NEM,"The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal. Further, the surge in copper price this year is triggering a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on the more economical aluminum.
"
484,NEM,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to see deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
485,NEM,"Both these factors are positive for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China  should benefit from the improving demand outlook.
"
486,NEM,"Currently, both Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by our long-term Neutral recommendation.Copper
"
487,NEM,"Copper has become a major industrial metal given its properties of high ductility, malleability, and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, it ranks third after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
488,NEM,"Copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges – the London Metal Exchange (LME), New York Mercantile Exchange (COMEX) and Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). Prices on these exchanges reflect the global balance of copper supply and demand, which can be volatile and cyclical.
"
489,NEM,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, combined with growing demand from China and other emerging economies, resulted in high copper prices and low levels of inventories.
"
490,NEM,"In December 2008 copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy. However, copper prices have since improved from the 2008 lows, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply.
"
491,NEM,"During the past three years, copper prices have fluctuated with LME spot copper prices ranging from $1.38 to $4.60 per pound. During 2011, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. This rising trend has benefited copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO  -  Free Report).
"
492,NEM,"Not denying volatility in prices, which would always be there, we have a bullish stance on copper prices, long term. Prices will be influenced by demand from China, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
493,NEM,"The outlook for the copper business remains positive, supported by widespread use of copper, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
494,NEM,"Freeport and Southern Copper retain a Zacks #3 Rank in agreement with our Neutral recommendation on the shares.                    
"
495,NEM,"Liquidity: Virtue or Vice?
"
496,NEM,"The Fed's recent interest rate cut will certainly affect investments, corporate financings, the consumer and the economy as a whole. Many believe that this monetary stimulus, combined with the fiscal stimulus offered in Bush's tax cut, will stimulate the economy. However, questions remain as to the tenor of the ultimate effects. There is little question as to whether the two stimuli will boost the stock market in the short term, as there is nowhere else to put money-seeking returns. Yet, some experts fear extremely low interest rates and easy money will contribute to speculative buying and nominal (vs. real) profits to show up. Read on to find out what this means for your investments and how to align your portfolio to profit in this environment.Forcing Money into Equities
"
497,NEM,"According to Dennis Slothower, editor of Stealth Stocks , one of the key ingredients missing to create a new bull market has been further stimulus by the Fed. While Slothower was taking heart in the Fed's aggressive rate cutting, he was waiting for the Fed to begin growing the M2 money supply. Finally, it has been doing so, presently at around 12.9%, though the growth rate has been accelerating. Combined with a global shift toward reflation, to fight off the economic demon known as deflation, Slothower expects strength to make itself known relatively soon. He notes that there is usually a two to three month time lag before the liquidity injection makes itself known in the form of an improving economy, but he has faith it is coming.
"
498,NEM,"Slothower expects the market to firm up again as investors come back into the stock market. He thinks their focus will be toward second quarter earnings, but expects several other factors to drive money toward stocks. First, the end of the second quarter will result in institutional rebalancing that will likely shift money from low-yielding longer term bonds into equities. Combined with a long-term technical top he sees forming in the bond market, the equity allocation move will prefer stocks to bonds. Further, the interest rate cuts have driven the yields of money market accounts virtually to zero. This provides yet another reason to turn to stocks to create positive returns. 
"
499,NEM,"Slothower feels that a new bull market is emerging and will only accelerate as the liquidity percolates throughout the market. The major indices are above their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Trading is also above the major bear market downtrend lines and at the middle or top BollingerBands for all major indices.Stock for the 21st Century
"
500,NEM,"Slothower recommended New Century Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: NCEN ) as his Stock of the Month for June. The mortgage company, which focuses primarily on first mortgages of single-family homes, has been growing at a breakneck speed. The company mostly offers mortgages to higher credit risk clients, and almost quadrupled net income between 2001 and 2002. New Century's profit margins are north of 50%. The company's return on equity is currently around 46.5% and has a P/E in the mid SINGLE digits.Growth, Investment and Lower Standards
"
501,NEM,"When the Fed cut rates on June 25th, Bill Martin, editor of FindProfit made an argument very similar to that of Dennis Slothower that amounts to: fiscal plus monetary stimulus have laid the groundwork for a sustained economic recovery where corporate profits are key. Martin goes on to explain that he expects ""business investment"" to rebound significantly in this new economic climate. This, indeed, would be a welcome site to the US economy that has seen weak business investment since the burst of the market bubble.  
"
502,NEM,"In Martin's estimation, low interest rates allowed consumers to re-finance their mortgages and draw equity out of their homes to ""shore up their balance sheets"" by paying off credit card debt and reinvesting money in their homes improving the value of that asset. At the same time, though, access to credit for Fortune 500 companies was very slim as the peak of corporate scandals almost completely dried up the corporate credit markets. He says ""in the summer of 2002, it was easier for a first time home buyer with bad credit to get a mortgage than it was for a Fortune 500 company to rollover its existing debts. Rates were low, but no one was lending to businesses.
"
503,NEM,"The end of the conflict with Iraq, though, and increased liquidity have thawed those markets and businesses will be shoring up their balance sheets by taking advantage of lower costs of capital. After that occurs, Martin argues, there will be a pickup in business investment that will have very positive ripple effects throughout the economy and markets. 
"
504,NEM,"Martin maintains a level head, though, and notes that there will be some companies that receive access to Wall Street's cash spigot without deserving it. He cites Sirius (NASDAQ: (SIRI  -  Free Report) ), TiVo (NASDAQ: TIVO ), and At Road (NASDAQ: ARDI ) as examples of companies without proven business models, with rich valuations that will get funded by Wall Street. The speculative nature of these three companies is much to close to an echo of the '97-'99 speculative bubble in which companies receive much too much consideration due to their ""potential"" rather than their track record. Martin sees this creating a degradation in the quality of lending standards.Find Profit in this Contrarian Play
"
505,NEM,"Bill Martin, and co-editor Matt Ragas specialize in stocks that are out of favor on Wall Street, but have attractive growth opportunities. In this case, as opposed to a speculative play in a stock with a fresh supply of shares, Martin and Ragas have their highest ratings on XO Communications (NASDAQ: XOCM ). The company quietly emerged from bankruptcy in January of 2003 with $500 million in cash and $507 million in long term debt. XOCM has a very legitimate shot at ending up with Global Crossing's assets, which would further enhance their bullishness. Some of Global Crossing's financiers have gotten cold feet and the Asian companies considering buying the company out continue to delay. ""It would be a homerun if they got it, combining undersea cables with local and long distance,"" says Matt Ragas. The company is now 80% owned by financier Carl Icahn. Martin and Ragas believe the restructured, leaner company can reach profitability in the next few quarters.Liquidity Mask
"
506,NEM,"For Ed Bugos, editor of the Goldenbar Report , Slothower and Martin may both be partially correct, though each with caveats. Bugos agrees that a huge liquidity injection and extremely low interest rates can boost the stock market in the near term. Both make corporate earnings look higher than they are and artificially drive money into equities. He says that the post-Iraq conflict rally would not likely have been as powerful as it has been were it not for the market driving down the yield curve 100 basis points, or 1%, during May and June. If bonds recover this drop, Bugos would expect the Dow to quickly retest its recent lows.
"
507,NEM,"The Fed's focus on fighting deflation is basically a red herring to mask a policy of inflation, according to Bugos. The expansion in M2 money supply has devalued the dollar relative to other currencies creating earnings based on currency benefits. (NOTE: M2 money supply is defined as currency, demand deposits at banks, traveler's checks, other checkable deposits, and savings accounts) Further, by reducing the rates on competing asset classes (bonds, money markets, etc.) equities have been preferred creating the illusion of a new bull market. Yet, declining yields have not increased profit outlooks, which combined with high Equity Risk Premiums, demonstrates the market does not think the profit increase will be sustainable. Bugos agrees with Martin that standards for financing will be lowered as companies survive on injections of paper liquidity. He sees this as the basis of the bullish speculation right now, in spite of his core belief that we remain in a bear market. 
"
508,NEM,"Bugos is waiting for the bear market to reassert itself, and believes it is being telegraphed by the extremely low reading on the Volatility Index. He feels the bear has been silenced by falling long term yields, the prospect of a Presidential cycle and a modest recovery in profits. While profits are up 25% year over year, gold is up 23% over that period and the dollar is down 19%. He sees the 10 year US bond rising to close to 6% by the end of the year as the dollar plunges and gold breaks out. For Bugos, rising profit outlooks, and even reports, do not mean real earnings have improved. He thinks the Dow will hit 6,000 before the year is out as reality sets in.Bugos Gold Play
"
509,NEM,"Bugos continues to like Newmont Mining (NYSE: (NEM  -  Free Report) ), which is still being somewhat beaten up over its hedge book, which has been unwound. sing the latest quarter's cost and production data, Newmont could produce anywhere from $3 to $5 per share in 
"
510,NEM,"cashflow per share - using the $400 to $500 gold price outlook, and the company's method of calculating cash costs. Moreover, the company's reserve values per share would increase to the $80 to $100 range from about $70 yesterday. Most non-hedgers are trading at around what we would call full or fair value - on par with our estimate of fair market value (based on 12x CFPS), or on par with their reserve valuations per share. So applying the industry parameters with a degree of conservatism, the gold price outlook above means Newmont could be worth $40 to $60 per share based on its cashflow potential, and perhaps up to $80 if we think its shares could discount at least 80% of the value of its proven reserves.Ready, Steady, Go?Or Go Splat?
"
511,NEM,"This liquidity driven market should feel support in the near term. There is little argument against that. However, is the Fed's accommodative stance forcing us to forget the lessons of the last couple of years and participate in speculative buying that is being driven through a reflationary position? Or, is this stimulus simply what is needed to create a virtuous cycle and a new bull? Only time will tell. The important thing to know is what YOUR assumptions are for the market and the economy, and find a specialist with a similar outlook. Only then can you successfully create and execute and investment/trading strategies.DISCLOSURE NOTE: The author of this article has a long position in XO Communications on FindProfit's recommendation.

516,NEM,"The rise in global population, growth in the Chinese economy, urbanization of the Asian countries and the increasing requirements in the developed countries have created an unprecedented demand for minerals and metals. The metals & mining industry caters to this ever-rising demand through extraction (mining) and primary and secondary processing of these metals. However, of late the tepid global economic growth emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry.
"
517,NEM," Mining - Ferrous: Iron
"
518,NEM," Iron Ore Price Trends
"
519,NEM,"Iron ore prices had an overall good run in 2013, compared to other base metals. Price peaked to a high of $154 per ton in February, due to the restocking carried out by Chinese steel mills and heightened demand from steel end-consumers, particularly the Chinese construction sector.
"
520,NEM,"However, prices dipped to a low of $114.8 per ton in June due to the growing apprehension over China's economic outlook. The situation soon improved as price regained ground supported by increased imports into China as Chinese infrastructure spending boosted demand, averaging $136.32 in November.
"
521,NEM," Iron Ore Industry Performance
"
522,NEM,"Demand for iron ore remained relatively strong in 2013. Domestic supply in China was insufficient to meet the demand triggered by the steel industry and the housing market. Chinese imports thus rose during the year, significantly impacting the demand for the metal worldwide.
"
523,NEM,"To capitalize on the rising prices and elevated demand in China, iron mining majors BHP Billiton Limited (BHP  -  Free Report), Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report) and Fortescue Metals Group Limited (FMG.AX) have invested heavily in projects in the iron-ore rich Pilbara region in Western Australia to augment their annual iron ore production capacity.
"
524,NEM,"Separately, Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) was recently granted an environmental license for its $20 billion investment in new iron ore production capacity at its Carajas mining complex in northern Brazil. This will help Vale to scale up its iron ore production and will be the largest project in Vale’s history as well as in the iron ore industry.
"
525,NEM," Iron Industry: Outlook
"
526,NEM,"The major iron ore producers Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals ramped up production in the later part of 2013, which will lead to a glut in supply in 2014. Furthermore, the world's top exporter Australia will increase its shipment as the abovementioned projects commence. Brazil and India will also hike their exports. In case this excess supply is not matched by adequate demand, it will expose the market to the risk of a decline in prices.
"
527,NEM,"We believe the fate of iron ore prices now mainly hinges on Chinese demand.  The emergence of Chinese industrial demand has facilitated a paradigm shift in the iron ore market over the last two decades.
"
528,NEM,"China is currently the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market. China’s economy has risen 7.8% in the third quarter of 2013 compared with 7.5% in the second quarter. Iron-ore imports rose to a record 74.6 million tons in September triggered by an increase in demand for steel.
"
529,NEM,"Thus, a rebound in China’s metal imports along with improvement in global manufacturing will push iron ore prices upward. Furthermore, iron ore prices will be supported by increased demand from steel markets in India, Japan and South Korea.
"
530,NEM," Mining - Non-Ferrous: Aluminium
"
531,NEM,"Price Trends
"
532,NEM,"Since Jan 2013, aluminium prices have slid downhill and recorded the lowest in November 2013 at $1740.8 per ton -- the first time the metal has traded below $1,750 since July 2009. Supply outpacing demand led to the dismal performance, which was aggravated by rising inventories. Industry results suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices.
"
533,NEM," Adaptive Measures to Combat Falling Prices
"
534,NEM,"In the wake of falling prices, companies decided to cut back on production. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer, reduced production by 9% in 2013 compared with 2012. Rusal continued to implement its inefficient capacity mothballing program and is focusing on cost reduction. Rusal has effectively attained almost a 3-year low cash cost within the aluminium segment.
"
535,NEM,"In May, Alcoa Inc. (AA) announced its plans to curtail 460,000 million tons (or 11%) over a 15-month period and has since then closed or curtailed 274,000 metric tons or 60% of the capacity under review. Alcoa is also aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve by 10 percentage points in smelting and by 7 percentage points in refining by 2015.
"
536,NEM,"The Ma’aden-Alcoa joint venture project that will create the world’s lowest-cost integrated aluminum facility with full annual operating capacity of 740,000 metric tons is 99% complete. It will contribute an estimated two percentage points towards Alcoa’s goal of lowering its position on the cost curve.
"
537,NEM," Aluminium Industry: Outlook
"
538,NEM,"Until the market can work its way out of the oversupply, aluminum producers will continue to face the brunt in the form of low prices. Furthermore, energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the industry. In addition to the curtailments, the companies will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
539,NEM,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, given the metal’s recyclability and light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. The airline industry is also expected to boost demand for the metal.
"
540,NEM,"Following China, which accounts for over 40% of global aluminum consumption, India appears promising as its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth make a favorable combination. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period which creates a supportive backdrop of high alumina and aluminum prices.
"
541,NEM," Mining - Non-Ferrous: Copper
"
542,NEM,"Movement in Copper Price & Performance
"
543,NEM,"For most part of 2013, oversupply and lack of demand kept copper prices in check. LME spot copper prices averaged $3.60 per pound in the first quarter, $3.24 per pound in the second and $3.21 per pound in the third quarter, well below the record high of $4.60 per pound in 2011.  
"
544,NEM,"Lower prices hurt the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report). Demand from key end-markets, including construction materials and electronics, remained weak due to the overall economic softness.
"
545,NEM," Diverse Reactions
"
546,NEM,"In the wake of the recent decline in metal prices, Freeport has reduced budgeted future capital expenditures, exploration and other costs by a total of $1.9 billion in 2013 and 2014. Freeport is reviewing its portfolio of assets for opportunities of potential asset sales.
"
547,NEM,"Freeport has recently taken a major step to venture into the U.S. energy space with the acquisition of Plains Exploration & Production Company and McMoRan Exploration Co. as part of the company’s strategy to diversify from its bread-and-butter copper mining business. The merger positions the combined entity as a leading natural resource conglomerate in the U.S.
"
548,NEM,"On the contrary, banking on strong long term returns from the copper business, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are jointly investing $3 billion in a sea desalination plant that will supply water to Chile’s Escondida copper mine. BHP Billiton expects global demand for copper to rise by 3% annually.
"
549,NEM," Copper Industry: Outlook
"
550,NEM,"The scenario in 2014 will be similar to 2013 with demand and supply imbalances. Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects.
"
551,NEM,"Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.
"
552,NEM," Overall Industry Ranking
"
553,NEM,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the Mining – Iron and Mining – Non-Ferrous industries are broadly grouped in the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of 258 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
554,NEM,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 258+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #86 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #172 and higher) is negative.
"
555,NEM,"The Iron Mining industry features in the top 1/3rd with its Zacks Industry Rank #12 indicating a positive outlook, while the Mining- Non-Ferrous  features in the bottom 1/3rd at Zacks Industry Rank with a Zacks Rank of #222 indicating that the outlook is on the negative side. One could say that the near-term outlook for the group as a whole depicts a Neutral outlook.

"
557,NEM," Sector Level Performance in Q3
"
558,NEM,"In the Basic Material Sector, earnings increased 3.6% in the third quarter of 2013, faring better than the 9.9% decline in earnings witnessed in the second quarter of 2013. The Basic Material sector had a beat ratio (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 62.5%, higher than the 54.2% noted in the second quarter.
"
559,NEM," Q4 & Beyond: What Zacks Predicts
"
560,NEM,"In the fourth quarter of 2013, earnings of the Basic Material sector is expected to grow 5%. However, in fiscal 2013, earnings is expected to decline 0.2% mainly due to the decline in earnings in the first half.
"
561,NEM,"In fiscal 2014, earnings in the Basic Material sector is expected to improve gradually in the first half with 8% growth projected in the first quarter and 18% in the second quarter. In fiscal 2014, the sector’s earnings is projected to grow 17.6%.
"
562,NEM," Overall Industry Outlook
"
563,NEM,"Overall in the metals market, increased supply and insufficient demand exerted a downward pricing pressure on commodities and this trend is expected to continue over the short term. Additionally, cost inflation is expected to be a headwind for metal and mining companies over the next several years, driven by a number of factors: labor, energy, ore grades, currencies, supply constraints and taxes. Global economic uncertainties, softening commodity prices, higher input costs are increasing the pressure on company margins.
"
564,NEM,"To combat this, mining and metals companies are reviewing their portfolios to identify underperforming assets and shut down or divest these high cost and non-core assets. Industry consolidation, automation technology, owner-operated mines and investment in energy assets are some of the steps that companies are taking to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
"
565,NEM,"Growth in the U.S. and an improving global macroeconomic scenario in tandem will boost demand in the industry. The long-term story for the industry remains intact as growth in the emerging markets, particularly in China and India, will be a major driver of metals demand.
"
566,NEM,"“Nothing Gold Can Stay”
"
567,NEM,"Though Robert Frost’s poem Nothing Gold Can Stay has a deeper meaning in the context of nature and life, it has never been more apt than now for the yellow metal. Frost writes that the golden hue lasts “only so an hour.” Historically, gold has been the most desired metal given its sheen and value, but it seems to have lost its lustre in recent times as an investment option.
"
568,NEM,"Gold’s attributes including malleability, resistance to corrosion and tarnishing, and glitter makes it ideal for many jewelry purposes. But there is more to gold; and that is the opportunity that the metal provides for investors. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins as a hedge against inflation or a safeguard against the collapse of paper assets such as stocks, bonds and other financial instruments.
"
569,NEM,"Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) have also become very popular as an investment option. Gold ETFs are units representing physical gold, which may be in paper or dematerialized form and are traded on the exchange like a single stock of any company. Governments, central banks and other official institutions hold significant quantities of gold as a component of exchange reserves.
"
570,NEM," Gold Mining Industry – A Brief Overview
"
571,NEM,"Gold exploration and mining is a time consuming and expensive endeavor. Given its scarcity and remote location of deposits, exploration for new gold deposits is difficult. Once an economically viable deposit is identified, bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more, and it requires substantial capital investment.
"
572,NEM,"Moreover, the mining industry is subject to several risks and hazards such as political conflicts, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unexpected geological conditions, labour disruptions, unavailability of materials and equipment, weather conditions, pit wall failures, rock bursts, cave-ins, flooding, seismic activity and water conditions. However, once the mine development project is successful, returns can be enormously high, which more than offsets the risks and the capital invested.

"
577,NEM,"There is a lot of buzz in recent days surrounding gold prices. Let's look at the driving factors, recent trends and the road ahead:
"
578,NEM," What Affects Gold Prices?
"
579,NEM,"Gold prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are influenced by industrial and jewelry demand, demand for gold as an investment, central bank lending, sales and purchase of gold, volume of recycled material available in the market, speculative trading; and costs and levels of global gold production by gold producers.
"
580,NEM,"There are a number of economic factors as well that influence gold prices. Over the past few years, the price of gold has shown a high inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar. In the wake of dollar weakness, investors opt for gold as a safe haven. Other factors include expectations of the future rate of inflation, interest rates; and global or regional, and political or economic uncertainties.The Gold Price Drama: Behind the ScenesHighlights/Major Upheavals: Alarming Drop Witnessed in April; Lowest Price in Three Years in June.
"
581,NEM,"Drivers: Taper or No Taper, U.S.-Syrian crisis, U.S. Government Partial Shutdown
"
582,NEM,"In 2012, gold’s average market price of $1,669 per ounce was an all-time record high, representing a 6% annual increase. A weak dollar, lingering concerns about Europe’s financial problems, China’s reduced economic growth and announcement of the third round of quantitative easing (QE3) led to a surge in gold prices.
"
583,NEM,"In 2013, it was not one event that affected the gold market. A combination of factors contributed -- the Federal Reserve’s taper or no taper confusion, conflict in Syria, mine supply, Indian and Chinese demand and the latest U.S. government imbroglio -- to affecting gold prices. Let us have a look at the dramatic events in detail that pushed the gold prices chart downhill through the year.
"
584,NEM,"Gold prices started slipping in the first quarter of 2013 as the U.S economy started showing signs of a revival. As mentioned earlier, the strengthening of the US dollar has an inverse relationship with gold prices. Monetary easing in Japan led to dollar’s strength.
"
585,NEM,"A decline in inflation level across the globe also reduced gold’s value as a hedge against rising prices. Furthermore, anticipation that Fed’s QE3 could end soon also influenced the fall. In the first quarter of 2013, gold prices ranged from $1,574 per ounce to $1693.75 per ounce, with average gold price at $1,631.8 per ounce.
"
586,NEM,"The blow came in April with the news that Cyprus will sell gold from its reserves as part of a European Union (EU) bailout package. This led investors to offload their positions in gold, leading to the 9% drop in one day to $1,395 per ounce on Apr 12 -- the biggest loss in a day since 1983.
"
587,NEM,"In June, reports that the Fed was contemplating “tapering” its $85 billion of bond purchases every month, which would begin toward the end of this year, sent gold prices to the nadir in 2013 of $1,192 per ounce on Jun 28. This level was last seen in Aug 2010. Overall, in the second quarter, gold prices displayed volatility and swayed between $1,192 and $1,583.5 per ounce with an average of $1,414.8 per ounce.
"
588,NEM,"In the third quarter, gold prices have remained in the range of $1,212.7 to $1,419.5 per ounce. In July, gold prices remained range bound within $1212 to $1,335, supported by a surge in demand for jewellery, bars and coins in India and China due to lower prices. In late August, gold prices trended higher as gold regained its status as a safe investment hedge amid fears and uncertainty surrounding a possible US-led military attack on Syria.
"
589,NEM,"However, the sheen was short-lived as prices soon reversed its course, dipping in September as gold’s safe-haven demand waned on expectations that military intervention in Syria could be avoided. With Syria agreeing to hand over its chemical weapons to international control at Russia's request, the prospects of U.S. military attack faded. Traders who took long positions in gold on hopes that the U.S. would attack Syria, continued to offload their positions.
"
590,NEM,"Gold’s losing streak continued on speculations of the outcome of the FOMC meeting with increased bets on Fed tapering. The Federal Reserve turned the tables on Sep 18 at its FOMC meeting by announcing that it will not taper the easy monetary policy. This gave the yellow metal a fresh lease of life, leading to a buying spree and surging $64.50 or 5% in a day on Sep 19. This marked the maximum gain in the year so far.
"
591,NEM,"Gold prices also found support on the news that former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has pulled out of the race to fill the Fed chair after Bernanke steps down in Jan 2014. Summers was seen as being in favor of scaling back the $85 billion bond buyback program more quickly than the other candidates. With Summers out of contention, as per latest reports, President Obama will nominate current Federal Reserve vice-chairman Janet Yellen as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
"
592,NEM,"However, more than half of the gains were eroded as James Bullard, chief executive officer and president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said that the Fed could consider a small taper at its next meeting in October if it is backed with strong economic data. This prompted a wave of selling in gold.
"
593,NEM,"Amid all this, the most dramatic development was the U.S government’s partial shutdown from Oct 1. The shutdown, the first one in 17 years, resulted from the Congress failing to pass a budget before the start of the financial year on Oct 1 due to an intense power struggle over President Obama’s health care law aimed at extending insurance to millions without coverage.
"
594,NEM,"Gold incurred a significant loss to close at below $1,300 per ounce, a seven-week low based on the expectation that it will be a temporary disruption. This confused gold traders as the shutdown did not drive safe-haven bids for the metal as normally expected.  
"
595,NEM,"The tussle between the U.S. political parties over the budget raises concerns that the government may default on its debt. Possibilities to increase the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling would be discussed on Oct 17.
"
596,NEM,"However, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew warned that the United States will run out of its ability to borrow money on Oct 17, and with a cash position of only $30 billion and obligations that can run to $60 billion a day, it will put the nation at a risk of sovereign debt default. This unprecedented event is most likely to have catastrophic consequences on the U.S. economy and other parts of the world.
"
597,NEM,"Gold prices firmed higher the next day as uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling lured traders back to the metal. Furthermore, lower-than-expected private-sector job report drove the gold prices higher as the dollar slumped against rival currencies amid budget woes. However, gold ended in red last week as the U.S. dollar bounced from an eight-month low logged a day earlier.
"
598,NEM,"The U.S. Labor Department delayed its jobs report for the last month, originally scheduled for release on Friday, as the shutdown entered its fourth day. Furthermore, gold demand was affected during the week due to week-long national holiday in China.
"
599,NEM,"All eyes will now be on Oct 17, the crucial day for lifting the U.S. debt ceiling. Focus will also be on the FOMC meeting, scheduled for Oct 29-30, on whether Fed would consider a small taper.
"
600,NEM," What Lies Ahead
"
601,NEM,"To date gold has dipped 24% from its all-time high in Sept 2011 when it touched $1,921 per ounce. This drop has technically put the yellow metal into the quagmire of a bear market.
"
602,NEM,"Analysts continue to see rough days ahead for gold. They have cut down their estimates for 2013 as well as for 2014, and their price expectation ranges from as low as $1,000 per ounce to $1446 in 2013. For 2014, the scenario is not expected to improve much with price expectations lying between $1050 and $1435.
"
603,NEM,"The U.S. government was last shutdown 17 years ago from Dec 16, 1995 to Jan 6, 1996. A look at the then price chart reveals a rise in gold prices from about $387 to $396 during the closure period. However, this might not be the case this time as the other factors influencing the gold price are different.
"
604,NEM,"The recent decline in prices has dealt a severe blow to investors’ confidence for the yellow metal and it may take many months to restore. Even though it has resulted in major losses in the paper gold market, it has otherwise triggered a gold rush for the actual physical metal in the form of bullion, jewelry, bars and coins. Thus, gold prices will get support from retail demand for gold, particularly in India and China. Gold traders are eyeing an increase in physical demand from Asia, particularly from India due to the upcoming festive demand.
"
605,NEM,"The stalemate situation in Washington with no immediate solution in sight, delay in U.S. economic data due to the suspension of Federal government services and debt woes will impact gold prices.  A prolonged shutdown (already entered the ninth day) will have a negative effect on the U.S. GDP and may delay Fed’s tapering decision, which will act in favor of gold.
"
606,NEM,"Furthermore, the nomination of Janet Yellen, the key architect of the stimulus program along with Bernanke, will bring back confidence in the market, if confirmed by the Senate. Yellen has been a strong supporter of easy monetary policy and it is expected that she will not bring major changes to Fed’s policies in this turbulent times. This will improve investor sentiment and might support gold prices.
"
607,NEM," Demand Dynamics
"
608,NEM,"Total gold demand stood at 856 tons in the second quarter of 2013, down 12% as substantial net outflow from gold ETFs offset record investment in gold bars and coins.
"
609,NEM,"Jewelry demand soared to 575 tons in the quarter, the highest level for five years and up 37% year over year catapulted by lower price levels. Despite the lower prices, demand in value terms surged 20% to $21.8 billion, which is the fourth highest on record. The trend had picked up from the first quarter of 2013 and India and China (60% of the global jewelry demand) continued to be at the forefront with respective annual growth of 51% and 54%, respectively.
"
610,NEM,"In India and China, a growing middle class, inflation expectations triggered the demand in order to capitalize on the low prices and expectations of an increase in the future. Particularly, in China, the poorly performing stock market, concerns over the possibility of a domestic credit crisis and economic slowdown also helped the cause.
"
611,NEM,"Markets improved in other parts of the world as well, particularly in the U.S. U.S. delivered yet another quarter of growth. In the first quarter, jewellery demand has increased after a hiatus of seven years, fueled by positive signs of the U.S recovery and lower prices. Demand had been low due to weak consumer sentiment against a backdrop of high unemployment, falling real wages and rising gold prices. However, Europe was the only exception – not a surprise given the uncertain economic scenario in the region.
"
612,NEM,"Demand for gold bars and coins stood at 508 tons, up 78% year over year. Demand topped the 500 ton benchmark in a quarter for the first time driven by China and India. Overall, global consumer demand for gold (jewelry and bar and coin) surged 53% year over year to 1,083 tons in the quarter.
"
613,NEM,"Technology demand was stable at 104 tons, edging up 1% year over year. Growth in electronics and other industrial and decorative purpose was partially offset by continued decline in dental demand due to shift toward more affordable alternatives.
"
614,NEM,"Central banks remained the primary purchasers of gold, completing their tenth consecutive quarter of net purchases, accounting for around 8% of total gold demand at 71 tons. The purchasing has, however, declined from 109.7 tons in the first quarter and 164.5 tons in the prior-year quarter; reflecting the volatile price movements during the quarter, weakness in emerging market currencies and the declining rate of growth in foreign exchange reserves among some banks.
"
615,NEM,"On the contrary, the quarter witnessed a record 402.2 tons net outflow from gold ETFs. This led to overall investment demand decline of 63%. The bridge between investors at the retail level and the investment level was never so apparent. Retail investors (in gold bars and coins) view gold for preserving wealth and hedging against inflation over the long term. Thus, in the second quarter, demand from retail investors leaped to unprecedented levels as they saw an opportunity to add to their holdings as gold prices dipped.
"
616,NEM,"On the other hand, the institutional investors have a different perception with a short-term, speculative approach. Expectations of the US government tapering quantitative easing by the end of 2013 led to ETF investors losing confidence in gold as a safe haven. The price drop in the quarter prompted these opportunistic investors to sell their ETF holdings and shift to other investment options.
"
617,NEM,"The official sector and emerging markets remain the long-term drivers of demand for gold. Following the recession in 2008, gold investment in Europe and the US was reinvigorated. However, the two Asian giants -- China and India -- will dominate the consumer demand for gold over the next few quarters. This marks a geographical shift from West to East.
"
618,NEM," Supply
"
619,NEM,"A combination of current mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals constitute the annual gold supply.
"
620,NEM,"In the second quarter, mine production was at 732 tons, up 4% year over year led by expansion in a number of small- to medium-sized operations in China. Production increased in the Dominican Republic fuelled by Barrick Gold Corp’s (ABX  -  Free Report) Pueblo Viejo mine and in Brazil.
"
621,NEM,"Indonesia, Peru and Ghana were the regions that witnessed decline in mine production. Even though the impact of price changes on mine production has been slow historically, the steep drop in the second quarter has led to knee-jerk reactions among gold producers. Spending cuts and the closure of cost-intensive operations may impact the supply pipeline by the end of this year.
"
622,NEM,"Over the last five years, recycling has generated around 40% of total supply. Supply from this sector is highly price sensitive. Drop in gold prices led to a decline in recycling activity as consumers are less inclined to part with their stocks at lower prices.
"
623,NEM,"Recycling of gold contributed 308.3 tons to total supply in the second quarter, 21% lower year over year, the fifth consecutive quarter of annual decline. Overall, gold supply dipped 6% to 1,025.5 tons, dragged down by lower recycling activity. 
"
624,NEM,"Performance of Gold Companies
"
625,NEM,"As we delve into the June-end quarterly numbers of the gold companies in our coverage – Barrick Gold Corporation, Harmony Gold Mining Co.Ltd (HMY  -  Free Report), Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report), Kinross Gold Corp. (KGC  -  Free Report), Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report), we see earnings have taken a beating across the board due to the decline in average realized gold prices.
"
626,NEM,"Shares of Newmont, Barrick Gold, Kinross, Goldcorp, Agnico Eagle and Harmony Gold hit their 52-week lows in the Jun-Aug 2013 timeframe driven by the low gold prices, second quarter results and trimmed guidance.
"
627,NEM,"Furthermore, the companies are also riddled with their individual operational issues. Barrick’s stock had fallen under pressure following the announcement that the company is suspending construction at its Pascua-Lama mine in Chile, in response to a court order from a Chilean court citing environmental concerns. However, in September, the Supreme Court of Chile issued a ruling which upheld the environmental approval for the Pascua-Lama project in Chile.
"
628,NEM,"The Pascua-Lama mine, located at the Chile–Argentina border, is one of the world’s largest gold and silver resources with nearly 18 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, and an anticipated mine life of 25 years. Barrick incurred $5.1 billion in asset impairment charges against the carrying value of the Pascua-Lama project in the second quarter.
"
629,NEM,"The price decline added to the woes of the industry that is already grappling with rising costs, labor issues, strikes, delays and/or the cancellation of projects. This has put gold miners on the defensive, forcing them to cut costs.
"
630,NEM,"If prices fall further, margins will be constrained as the price of gold closes in on the cost per ounce of the companies. Analysing the all-in sustaining costs (total costs associated with producing gold), 2013 guidance of Barrick Gold, Newmont, Kinross, Goldcorp, Agnico Eagle, IAMGOLD Corp. (IAG) ranges from $900 to a maximum of $1250 per ounce. If prices fall beyond the lowest level of $1192, recorded in June, it will erode the margins of these companies.
"
631,NEM," The Survival Tactics
"
632,NEM,"Barrick, Harmony, Goldcorp, Newmont, Kinross, Agnico-Eagle have decided to curtail their capital spending for the year. Barrick Gold has hived off its oil and gas unit, Barrick Energy, and three of its Australian mines to offload underperforming assets.
"
633,NEM,"Goldcorp postponed non-essential infrastructure and non-critical path activities at Cerro Negro project, Argentina, until 2014 and 2015, respectively, owing to lower metals prices.
"
634,NEM,"Kinross does not expect to make a decision now on whether to proceed with a potential Tasiast mill expansion until 2015 at the earliest, regardless of the project feasibility study outcome. The study is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2014. The decision was part of the company’s focus on capital reduction in the current lower gold price environment.
"
635,NEM,"IAMGOLD announced that its joint venture with AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU  -  Free Report) and the government of Mali will suspend mining excavation activities at the Yatela mine in Mali, effective Sep 30, 2013. The decision was triggered by rising costs and falling gold prices, which made it extremely difficult to extend the mine’s life. Moreover, the mine has been also viewed as no longer capable of making a positive contribution to any of its stakeholders.
"
636,NEM,"Both IAMGOLD and AngloGold Ashanti hold a 40% stake in the mine. Newmont has signed a letter of intent to divest its Midas operation in Nevada to focus more on its core businesses by disposing its non-core assets. Barrick is reportedly considering a joint venture with Newmont in Nevada to explore means to cut costs.
"
637,NEM,"Barrick reduced the quarterly dividend by 75% to 5 cents per share in order to improve liquidity. Newmont’s board announced third quarter gold-price-linked dividend of 25 cents per share that is based on the average London P.M. Gold Fix. It reflects a 10 cents drop compared with the prior quarter. Kinross’ board of directors suspended the semi-annual dividend in order to reduce its operating and capital costs.
"
638,NEM,"The key to stay afloat in these turbulent times is to identify and reduce discretionary expenses wherever possible, trim capital spending, defer new capital development programs, divest underperforming assets and cut dividends. Once all expenses are reduced to the bone, the only way to survive will be to reduce their expenses by reducing operations. They will be compelled to either shut down or sell mines with the highest operating costs. The eventual decrease in supply may inflate the price of the yellow metal. If prices do not rise in the next 12 months, the miners will need to drastically cut production in order to conserve cash.
"
639,NEM,"The companies should judiciously proceed on only low-risk, high-return Brownfield and the best Greenfield projects. In the falling gold price environment, companies with major projects may require additional debt to complete them. Miners with lower costs, lower levels of debt, and with recently completed new mine development will be able to sustain themselves.
"
640,NEM," Consolidation
"
641,NEM,"The austerity in the mining sector has led to more measured mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. Companies have slowed down their deal activities since last year, but Chinese gold miners remained active on the acquisition front. To capitalize on the strong domestic demand for gold, Chinese companies are enhancing their gold resource base by acquiring overseas as well as domestic gold mines.
"
642,NEM,"In 2012, China’s second largest producer, Zijin Mining Group, bought Australia-based Norton Gold Fields and the third largest gold producer, Shandong Gold Group, acquired majority stake in Australia’s Focus Minerals. Australia was a preferred target considering it is the world's second-largest gold producer after China. In China, one deal worth mentioning was of Shandong Gold Mining buying Shandong Shengda Mining for $590 million in Jun 2012.
"
643,NEM,"Lower gold prices seemed to be the triggering force behind the few deals in the first half of 2013, as the companies were able to acquire assets at discounted prices. In May 2013, Shenzhen-listed Shandong Qixing Iron Co. agreed to a conditional $140 million deal to acquire the assets of Australia-listed Stonewall Resources Ltd.
"
644,NEM,"The largest deal in the gold sector in the first half of 2013 was the sale of Mikhail Prokhorov’s 37.8% stake in Polyus Gold International Ltd. for $3.6 billion. Another notable deal in the first half of the year was Hecla Mining Co.’s (HL  -  Free Report) acquisition of Aurizon Mines Ltd. for $775 million. In August, New Gold, Inc. (NGD  -  Free Report) took over 86% of exploration company Rainy River Resources Ltd. in a deal valued at about $310 million.
"
645,NEM,"It is clear that for the balance of 2013 and in 2014, M&A activity in the mining industry is expected to remain slow. Deals will come through only when companies have enough cash to seize the opportunity to takeover the assets unloaded by peers in the cost cutting environment. Gold is expected to remain the top commodity for acquisitions in the months ahead and the successful deals will help to shape the future of the mining industry and to determine its key players.
"
646,NEM," Earnings Performance in 3Q13 and 2Q13
"
647,NEM,"We are still a couple of weeks away from getting into midst of third quarter earnings season. Only 4.2% of the companies in the basic material sector have reported to date. Earnings increased 3.5%, accelerating from the 2% growth recorded in the second quarter by these companies. Revenues went up 4.4%, faring much better than the 0.7% growth in the second quarter. Even though results are tracking better than the previous quarter, it is too early to rejoice.
"
648,NEM,"Looking back at the overall results of the Basic Material Sector in the second quarter, earnings dipped 10.9% in the second quarter of 2013, deteriorating from the 1.6% decline in earnings witnessed in the first quarter of 2013. However, revenues for the sector went down 1.4% in the second quarter, worsening from the flat sales in the first quarter.
"
649,NEM,"Of the companies reported, the Basic Material sector had a beat ratio (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 0.0%, compared with 100% in the first quarter.Expectations for 2013 & 2014
"
650,NEM,"The Basic Material sector is one of the sectors experiencing material negative estimate revisions. However, the overall projection of a 5.0% dip in the third quarter paints a somewhat better picture when compared with the 10.9% drop experienced in the second quarter. The sector is expected to return to growth with a 10.8% increase in earnings in the fourth quarter of 2013. Revenues are expected to rise 0.7% in the third quarter and 2.1% in the fourth quarter.
"
651,NEM,"In the first quarter of 2014, the sector’s earnings are expected to rise 11.9% in the first quarter of 2014 despite a rise of a meager 3.3% in revenues. In the second quarter of 2014, earnings are projected to surge 21.9% while revenue is expected to increase by 1.7%.
"
652,NEM,"In 2013, the sector’s earnings is expected to edge up 0.1% while revenues are expected to grow 0.7%. In 2014, earnings growth is projected at 17.9% and revenues at 4.2%.
"
653,NEM," To Sum Up
"
654,NEM,"Demand for gold will undoubtedly continue to rise in the long term, thanks to the rising middle class in India, China and other emerging markets. The Euro-zone debt crisis will also be an important driver for gold demand. Furthermore, demand for gold bullion and coins are currently at unprecedented levels. It may, however, take months for this new demand to feed into prices, but prices will eventually stabilize.
"
655,NEM,"Investors have fled the mining sector and two things need to happen before investors regain interest in gold mining stocks: gold price needs to rise and the industry needs to rebuild its credibility by delivering on promises of greater shareholder returns. The consumers who rushed to buy gold following the fall in prices might have to wait patiently for their anticipated returns to materialize.
"
656,NEM,"Meanwhile, it remains to be seen how the political turmoil and debt crisis in the U.S. turns out, which will have its effect on the yellow metal. At current levels, one should invest in gold as a long-term investment, which will grow in value and add diversification to a portfolio. For quick returns, it is advisable to focus on other assets.
"
657,NEM,"A Brief Overview
"
658,NEM,"Metals, given their characteristics -- high strength, durability, conductivity and aesthetic appeal -- command a pivotal role in daily life and economic development. The global population growth, phenomenal rise in the Chinese economy, urbanization in the Asian countries and the increasing requirements in the developed countries have created an unprecedented demand for minerals and metals. The metals & mining industry caters to this ever-rising demand by extracting (mining) and through primary and secondary processing of these metals.
"
659,NEM,"The industry is oligarchic in structure, with certain producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output. The industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. However, the tepid global economic growth outlook has currently emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry.
"
660,NEM,"With respect to volume, iron and steel command a majority in the global metal industry, followed by aluminum. We have thus divided the metal industry into two broad parts: ferrous and non-ferrous. Ferrous indicates the presence of iron and it includes steel, iron and alloys of iron. Non-ferrous indicate metals that do not contain an appreciable amount of iron. Popular non-ferrous metals include aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, titanium and zinc, and alloys like brass.
"
661,NEM,"Let’s have a look at the ferrous and non-ferrous industry in detail, including driving factors, price dynamics, performance, outlook, etc.Mining - Ferrous: Iron & Steel
"
662,NEM,"The steel industry, as well as its provider of raw materials -- the iron ore and coal mining industries -- have historically been highly cyclical and are highly susceptible to general economic conditions. This is particularly due to the cyclical nature of its main customers: the automotive, construction, machinery and equipment industries.Iron Ore Price Trends
"
663,NEM,"The cost of iron ore is crucial for the global economy as it affects the price of steel and consequently changes the cost of everyday goods. It is also critical for the profitability of two of the world’s largest heavy industries: mining and steelmaking.
"
664,NEM,"In the first half of 2012, iron ore prices were more or less stable before plummeting to a three-year low of $88.50 per ton in September last year. The price was dragged down by low buying activity due to a weak economic environment. It recovered by the end of 2012 due to aggressive restocking driven by Chinese steel mills.
"
665,NEM,"In the first quarter of 2013, iron ore prices attained a high of $160 per ton, aided by strong steel production in China, seasonally weaker supply of the seaborne iron ore and increased demand growth from steel end-consumers, particularly the Chinese construction sector.
"
666,NEM,"However, iron ore prices remained volatile in the second quarter with an average price of $137.4 per ton in April, $124.7 per ton in May and then down to an average price of $114.5 per ton in June. The volatility owed much to the uncertain outlook for steel demand in China. Post-June, iron ore prices have trended higher as sentiment improved across the Chinese metals sector. Steelmakers were no longer destocking raw materials like iron ore, thus necessitating iron ore buying to meet the demand of the steel mills.Iron Ore Industry Performance So far
"
667,NEM,"Emergence of Chinese industrial demand has led to a paradigm shift in the iron ore market over the last two decades. China has become the largest producer of steel and consequently the largest consumer of iron ore, accounting for around 60% of the global seaborne market.
"
668,NEM,"Incidentally, global exporters of iron such as BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP  -  Free Report), Vale S.A. (VALE  -  Free Report) and Rio Tinto plc (RIO  -  Free Report), which together control 70% of total iron ore exports, largely benefited as China’s inland production failed to meet the burgeoning demand.
"
669,NEM,"Meanwhile, just as the iron ore and steel market recovered from the effects of recession in the second half of 2009 and through the first three quarters of 2011, the Euro-zone crisis and significant destocking caused demand to weaken again in the fourth quarter of 2011.
"
670,NEM,"In 2012, contraction in Europe and a slowdown in China dampened both iron and steel prices. In the first half of 2013, demand continued to be weak, particularly in Europe where demand plunged to about 30% below the 2007 peak.
"
671,NEM,"In 2012, demand in China weakened in response to policy tightening, mainly directed toward the real estate market. However, demand picked up thereafter from the fourth quarter of 2012 on the back of acceleration in infrastructure approvals, which has continued through the first half of 2013.Major Game-Changing Projects in the Iron Ore Industry
"
672,NEM,"BHP Billiton’s $3.4 billion project of Jimblebar Mine expansion in the Pilbara region in Western Australia is expected to augment its iron ore annual production capacity to 220 million tons. The mine will start producing in the fourth quarter of 2013, and help the company cash on the continued appetite for iron of countries like China.
"
673,NEM,"BHP’s rival Rio Tinto is investing heavily in growing iron ore output in the Pilbara region. Rio Tinto has embarked on a major port, rail and mine expansion, which is touted to be the largest integrated mining project in Australia and will up its annual capacity to 290 million tons. Rio Tinto has successfully loaded its first iron ore shipment from its expanded operations in Pilbara, ahead of schedule, marking the commencement of commissioning of the expansion program.
"
674,NEM,"Separately, Vale was recently granted an environmental license for its $20 billion investment, in new iron ore production capacity at its Carajas mining complex in northern Brazil. This will help Vale to scale up its iron ore production and will be the largest project in Vale’s history as well as in the iron ore industry. It is also considered to be a path-breaking project that will fully replace in-mine trucks with conveyor belts.Iron Industry: Outlook
"
675,NEM,"The industry has been affected by the falling iron ore prices. However, the companies have stayed afloat by reducing costs to maintain their margins in the falling commodity prices scenario. We see improved future prospects for the industry on the back of ongoing industrialization in China, India and in other developing economies.Steel Industry
"
676,NEM,"The steel industry is considered an economic indicator, as it plays a critical role in infrastructure and overall economic development.Steel Price Trends
"
677,NEM,"Steel prices have been on the decline in 2013 due to a glut in imports, oversupply in the market from zealous steelmakers, weak demand in Europe and slow growth in Asia. A sustained downside in steel prices will materially and adversely affect the margins of steel companies. We believe that the recovery in pricing momentum will be driven by a reviving economy, stabilization in the Euro-zone and a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, particularly in China, India and South Korea.Challenges
"
678,NEM,"A lingering Euro-zone sovereign debt crisis, economic stagnation or slow growth in developed economies and a cooling of emerging market economies have taken a toll on the steel industry. Furthermore, overcapacity has been a perennial problem. Stiff competition in the United States from cheaper imports and from domestic producers with new or expanded facilities or under-utilized existing facilities continues to result in significant oversupply of steel compared to demand.Steel Industry: Outlook
"
679,NEM,"The World Steel Association projects global steel usage to rise 2.9% in 2013 to 1.454 Mt. In 2013, the steel industry will continue to face headwinds in the form of overcapacity and surge of imports. The steel companies are going through a restructuring process, which will have a positive impact on operations in the mid to long term. Some of the major industry trends are strategic cost reduction, vertical integration and capital optimization.
"
680,NEM,"Growth in the United States will be supported by strong momentum in the auto sector and recovery in construction markets. Concerns surrounding China’s growth and the European debt crisis remain overhangs on the sector’s outlook.
"
681,NEM,"The overall scenario is expected to improve in 2014 with global demand expected to increase 3.2% to a record 1,500 Mt. The increase will be driven by a further pickup in global steel demand as the developed economies increasingly contribute to growth.Mining - Non-Ferrous
"
682,NEM,"Aluminum
"
683,NEM,"Given its unique characteristics -- lightness, strength, flexibility, non-corrosive and infinitely recyclable -- aluminum is one of the most widely used metals. The world’s leading aluminum market is China, which accounts for over 40% of global aluminum consumption thanks to the rapid development and urbanization of China. Japan, Europe and the US are next in line in the aluminum market. Aluminum’s main markets are transportation, machinery and construction.About the Industry
"
684,NEM,"The aluminum industry is an extremely competitive and highly consolidated sector with 40% of global output commanded by the largest producers: Russia’s Rusal, Alcoa Inc. (AA), Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd  and Hydro Aluminum (part of the Norsk Hydro group).
"
685,NEM,"The demand for aluminum in developed countries stems from the rapidly growing auto market. A strong focus on environment and strict restrictions on carbon emissions prompt the automakers to increase the energy efficiency of the vehicles.
"
686,NEM,"Due to its lightness, aluminum makes cars more energy efficient, decreasing fuel consumption and cutting hazardous emissions. In developing countries, the construction industry is the biggest consumer of aluminum as these countries are expanding their infrastructure to satisfy the needs of a growing population.Performance
"
687,NEM,"Industry results suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices. Alcoa kicked off the second quarter earnings season with a revenue decline of 2%, affected by weak aluminum prices. Alcoa continued to see pricing pressure with London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price falling 8% sequentially in the reported quarter.Adaptive Measures to Combat Falling Prices
"
688,NEM,"Following the decline in aluminum prices, BHP had to sale its 33.3% stake in the Guinea Alumina joint venture to Dubai Aluminum and Abu Dhabi state-owned Mubadala. In 2012, it had halted bauxite exploration at its Boffa-Santou-Houda site in Guinea and abandoned plans to build a smelter in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
"
689,NEM,"Rio had earlier planned to sell its underperforming Pacific Aluminum, which has high-cost smelters in New Zealand and Australia and an alumina refinery. However, it had to abandon its plan after failing to find a buyer. Rio will incorporate Pacific Aluminum back under its larger aluminum umbrella, Rio Tinto Alcan group.
"
690,NEM,"Prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Aluminum prices have fallen to four-year lows and the market continues to be uncertain and volatile. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer, reported losses in the first half of 2013 and announced that it will further reduce production by 357,000 metric tons (mt) in 2013, or 9% compared with 2012. Rusal plans to accelerate aluminum output cuts in the second half. Rusal is also contemplating production halts at its least efficient smelters and cut down production at certain smelters in Siberia.
"
691,NEM,"Alcoa is aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve by 10 percentage points in smelting and by 7 percentage points in refining by 2015.
"
692,NEM,"In May, Alcoa announced its plans to curtail 460,000 mt over a 15-month period of smelting due to falling aluminum prices and maintain cost competitiveness. In line with this, Alcoa announced closures or curtailments representing 269,000 mt, which included the permanent closure of 105,000 mt of capacity at Alcoa’s Baie-Comeau smelter in Canada and its Fusina, Italy, smelter representing 44,000 mt that was not part of the May review. Recently, Alcoa announced that it will close or curtail 164,000 mt of smelting capacity in the United States and Brazil.Going Forward
"
693,NEM,"Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry. In addition to the curtailments, the companies will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
694,NEM,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from its recyclability and light-weight properties.
"
695,NEM,"The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double the demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025. Further, the surge in substitute metals such as copper and zinc has triggered a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus to the more economical metal.
"
696,NEM,"To capitalize the growing aluminum demand for auto production, Alcoa recently broke ground on its $275 million expansion of Alcoa's Tennessee Operations. This marks Alcoa’s second automotive expansion to cater to the car makers. The previous one was a $300 million expansion of Alcoa's Davenport, IA plant that has already begun commissioning and is set to be completed by the end of 2013.
"
697,NEM,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. Following China, India also holds promise as its current low level of aluminum consumption and high urban population growth make a favorable combination. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period and creates the backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices.Copper
"
698,NEM,"Copper is a major industrial metal with its price strongly depending on the economic growth outlook. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.” The metal’s popularity in industrial usage is due to its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, along with its resistance to corrosion.
"
699,NEM,"In terms of consumption, copper holds the third place after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.Movement in Copper Prices
"
700,NEM,"Copper prices witnessed record high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies led to the surge in copper prices and low level of inventories. In Dec 2008, copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
701,NEM,"During 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from a low of $3.29 per pound to a high of $3.93 per pound, which averaged $3.61 per pound, a 10% drop from 2011. This drop reflected concerns regarding a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and a slowing U.S. economy.
"
702,NEM,"During first-quarter 2013, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.42 per pound to $3.74 per pound, averaging $3.60 per pound. During the second quarter 2013, LME spot copper prices ranged from a low of $3.01 per pound to a high of $3.42 per pound, averaging $3.24 per pound.Performance
"
703,NEM,"Lower prices hurt the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report). Demand from key end-markets, including construction materials and electronics, remains weak due to the overall economic softness.Diverse Reactions
"
704,NEM,"In the wake of recent decline in metal prices, Freeport has reduced budgeted future capital expenditures, exploration and other costs by a total of $1.9 billion in 2013 and 2014.
"
705,NEM,"Freeport has recently taken a major step to venture into the U.S. energy space by wrapping up Plains Exploration & Production Company and McMoRan Exploration Co. for $19 billion as part of the company’s strategy to diversify from its bread-and-butter copper mining business. The merger positions the combined entity as a leading natural resource conglomerate in the U.S., leveraging Freeport’s industry-leading mineral assets and the oil and gas resources of Plains and McMoRan.
"
706,NEM,"On the contrary, banking on strong returns from the copper business, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are jointly investing $3 billion in a sea desalination plant that will supply water to Chile’s Escondida copper mine. BHP, which has a 57.5% ownership in the mine, is investing $1.97 billion and Rio Tinto, which owns 30%, will contribute $1.03 billion. BHP Billiton expects global demand for copper to rise by 3% annually.Copper Industry: Outlook
"
707,NEM,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
708,NEM,"Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.Overall Industry Ranking
"
709,NEM,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the industry is broadly grouped in the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and is further sub-divided into three industries at the expanded level: Mining – Gold, Mining – Iron and Mining – Non-Ferrous. We rank all of 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
710,NEM,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ industries is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #87 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative.
"
711,NEM,"For the Mining Industry, Iron Mining barely makes into the top 1/3rd with its Zacks Industry Rank #81, while the Non-Ferrous (aluminum, copper, etc.) is barely in the bottom 1/3rd at Zacks Industry Rank with a Zacks rank of #222, respectively.
"
712,NEM,"The steel producers industry makes it to the bottom 1/3rd with a Zacks Industry Rank #174, followed by steel–pipe and tube industry producers with a Zacks Industry Rank #198. The steel specialty industry is near the bottom of the list with a Zacks Rank #244.
"
713,NEM,"This indicates that the overall outlook for the steel industry is on the ‘Negative’ side. Given the exact location of the three mining industries on the Zacks Industry Rank, one could say that the near-term outlook for the group depicts a Neutral outlook.
"
714,NEM,"Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks, which are at the core of our Industry Outlook, has an impressive track record, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, particularly over the short term (1 to 3 months). The rank, along with Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Way to Find Earnings Surprises) helps in predicting the probability of earnings surprises.Earnings Performance in 2Q13
"
715,NEM,"Looking at the overall results of the Basic Material Sector, earnings dipped 11.1% in the second quarter of 2013, deteriorating from the 1.8% decline in earnings witnessed in the first quarter of 2013. However, revenues for the sector went down 1.4% in the second quarter, faring better than the 2.1% decline in the first quarter.
"
716,NEM,"Second quarter earnings across all 16 sectors covered by Zacks increased 2.5% with the Finance sector being the only saving grace. Barring the finance sector, earnings dipped 2.9% with the Basic Material sector being one of the laggards. Nevertheless, the Basic Material sector had a beat ratio (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 56.5%, though lower than the 69.6% noted in the first quarter.
"
717,NEM,"The Basic Material sector has suffered given its heavy exposure to the negative cross-currents in the global economy, particularly the emerging markets. The weak global conditions are a deterrent factor for volumes and falling metal prices has dented the earnings for the companies.Expectations for 2013 & 2014
"
718,NEM,"The Basic Material sector is one of the sectors experiencing material negative estimate revisions, largely reflecting the overall negative tone of guidance provided by companies. However, the overall projection of a 3.0% dip in the third quarter paints a somewhat better picture when compared with the 11.1% drop experienced in the second quarter.
"
719,NEM,"The sector is expected to return to growth with a 12% increase in earnings. Revenues are expected to rise 1.5% in the third quarter and 2.1% in the fourth quarter.
"
720,NEM,"In the first quarter of 2014, the sector’s earnings are expected to rise 14.3% in the first quarter of 2014 despite a decline of 14.9% in revenues.Overall Industry Outlook
"
721,NEM,"Cost inflation in the sector is expected to be a headwind for metal and mining companies over the next several years, driven by a number of factors viz. labor, energy, ore grades, currencies, supply constraints and taxes. Global economic uncertainties, softening commodity prices, higher input costs are increasing the pressure on company margins.
"
722,NEM,"To combat this, mining and metals companies are reviewing their portfolios to identify underperforming assets and shut down or divest these high cost and non-core assets. Industry consolidation, automation technology, owner-operated mines and investment in energy assets are some of the steps that companies are taking to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
"
723,NEM,"Persistent recessionary conditions in Europe will have residual effects elsewhere. This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space at present. Thus, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as growth in the emerging markets, particularly in China and India, will be a major driver of metals demand.
"
724,NEM,"Tale of Gold: What Has, Is and Will Happen
"
725,NEM,"Gold may have lost the battle to diamonds in becoming a girl’s best friend, but the yellow precious metal can very well qualify as historically the most desirable metal. The attributes including malleability, resistance to corrosion and tarnishing, and the glitter makes it ideal for many jewelry purposes. But there is more to Gold; and that is the opportunity that the metal provides for investors.
"
726,NEM,"Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins as a hedge against inflation or a safeguard against the collapse of paper assets such as stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. Gold ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) have also become very popular as an investment option.
"
727,NEM,"Gold ETFs are units representing physical gold, which may be in paper or dematerialized form and are traded on the exchange like a single stock of any company. Governments, central banks and other official institutions hold significant quantities of gold as a component of exchange reserves.Gold Mining Industry – A Brief Overview
"
728,NEM,"Gold exploration and mining is a time consuming and expensive endeavor. Given its scarcity and remote location of deposits, exploration for new gold deposits is difficult. Once an economically viable deposit is identified, bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more, and it requires substantial capital investment.
"
729,NEM,"Moreover, the mining industry is subject to several risks and hazards such as political conflicts, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unexpected geological conditions, labor force disruptions, unavailability of materials and equipment, weather conditions, pit wall failures, rock bursts, cave-ins, flooding, seismic activity and water conditions. However, once the mine development project is successful, returns can be enormously high, which more than offsets the risks and the capital invested.Industry Ranking & Outlook
"
730,NEM,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the gold industry falls under the broader Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). We rank all of the more than 260 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank page.
"
731,NEM,"The way to align the ranking and outlook from complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 260+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #87 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #174 and higher) is negative. Currently, the gold mining industry is featuring in the bottom 1/3rd with a Zacks Industry Rank of #251, indicating the outlook is on the ‘Negative’ side.
"
732,NEM,"Please note that the Zacks Rank for stocks, which is at the core of our Industry Outlook, has an impressive track record going back years, verified by outside auditors, to foretell stock prices, particularly over the short term (1 to 3 months). The rank along with Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) (Read: Zacks Earnings ESP: A Better Method) helps in predicting the probability of earnings surprises.
"
733,NEM,"There is a lot of buzz in recent days surrounding gold prices. Let's look at the driving factors, recent trends and the road ahead:What affects gold prices?
"
734,NEM,"Gold prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are influenced by industrial and jewelry demand, demand for gold as an investment, central bank lending, sales and purchase of gold, volume of recycled material available in the market, speculative trading; and costs and levels of global gold production by producers of gold.
"
735,NEM,"There are a number of economic factors as well that influence gold prices. Over the past few years, the price of gold has shown a high inverse correlation with the U.S. dollar. In the wake of dollar weakness, investors opt for gold as a safe haven. Other factors include expectations of the future rate of inflation, interest rates; and global or regional, political or economic uncertainties.Recent Price Trends: Alarming Drop Witnessed in April and May
"
736,NEM,"In 2012, gold’s average market price of $1,669 per ounce was an all-time record high, representing a 6% annual increase. Lingering concerns about Europe’s financial problems, China’s reduced economic growth, announcement of the third round of quantitative easing (QE3) led to a surge in gold prices.
"
737,NEM,"In the first quarter of 2013, gold prices ranged from $1,574 per ounce to $1693.75 per ounce, with average gold price at $1,631.8 per ounce, down 3% year over year. However, gold prices slumped drastically subsequent to the first quarter.
"
738,NEM,"On Apr 12, prices dipped 9% in 1 day from $1,535.50 to $1,395 per ounce, a level last witnessed in Feb 2011. After a short-term correction, the price dipped to the lowest level in 2013 of $1,354.75 on May 20.
"
739,NEM,"Year to date, gold prices have fallen 18%. This steep drop has technically put the yellow metal in a bear phase, leading to widespread concerns and questions such as -- why gold is going down, whether it will last, and whether it can still be termed as a ‘safe haven.’Why is the sheen wearing off?
"
740,NEM,"It was not a day’s event that affected the gold market, but the unfavorable factors had been building up over the past few months. The U.S economy started showing signs of a revival. As mentioned earlier, the strengthening of the US dollar has an inverse relationship with gold prices. Monetary easing in Japan led to dollar’s strength, thus proving the theory.
"
741,NEM,"A decline in inflation level across the globe also reduced gold’s value as a hedge against rising prices. Furthermore, anticipation that U.S Fed’s QE3 could end soon also influenced the fall.  Rising interest rates make bonds more attractive than gold. The final straw was the news that Cyprus may sell gold from its reserves. This led investors to offload their positions in gold.What Lies Ahead
"
742,NEM,"Analysts continue to see rough days ahead for gold. They have cut down their estimates for 2013 as well as 2014, citing mounting headwinds from a strengthening dollar, improving U.S. growth, rising interest rates, subdued inflation and lack of investment buying. However, they expect prices to remain above 1,500 per ounce in 2013.
"
743,NEM,"The recent plummet in prices has dealt a severe blow to investor confidence for the yellow metal. This may take many months to restore. Even though it has resulted in major losses in the paper gold market, it has otherwise triggered a gold rush for the actual physical metal, in the form of bullion, jewelry, bars and coins. Thus, gold prices will at least become stable if not move higher as retail demand for gold lends support, particularly in India and China.Demand Dynamics
"
744,NEM,"Total gold demand stood at 963 tons in first quarter 2013, down 13% as substantial net outflow from gold ETFs offset growth in consumer demand for gold and from central banks. Technology demand was down due to weak consumer demand, uncertainty in Europe and substitution to more affordable alternatives.
"
745,NEM,"Jewelry demand soared to 551 tons in the quarter, helped by lower price levels. Even though India and China (62% of the global jewelry demand) were at the forefront with respective annual growth of 15% and 19%, respectively, other markets also improved, particularly the U.S.
"
746,NEM,"In India, a good spring harvest and lower prices ahead of the wedding season triggered the increase. In China, festive buying for the Chinese New Year and regained confidence in China’s economy led to a record quarter.
"
747,NEM,"The surprise package in the quarter was U.S with jewelry demand increasing after a hiatus of seven years, fueled by positive signs of U.S recovery and lower prices. Demand had been low due to weak consumer sentiment against a backdrop of high unemployment, falling real wages and rising gold prices. Demand for gold bars and coins stood at 378 tons, well above the five-year quarterly average, fueled by demand from India, China and the US.
"
748,NEM,"Central banks remained the primary purchasers of gold, accounting for around 11% of total gold demand at 109.2 tons. Demand topped the 100 ton mark for the seventh consecutive quarter, a testament to the fact that central banks continue to favor gold’s diversification benefit as they reduce their portfolio allocations to US dollars and euros.
"
749,NEM,"On the contrary, the quarter witnessed a 176.9 tons net outflow from gold ETFs. This led to overall investment demand decline of 49%. This performance brings to light the conflict in behavior of investors at the retail level and the investment level.
"
750,NEM,"Retail investors (in gold bars and coins) view gold for preserving wealth and hedging against inflation over the long term. Thus, in the first quarter, demand from retail investors remained high as they saw an opportunity to add to their holdings as gold prices dipped.
"
751,NEM,"On the other hand, the institutional investors have a different perception with a short term, speculative approach. The price drop in the quarter prompted these opportunistic investors to sell their ETF holdings and shift to other investment options.
"
752,NEM,"Gold-backed ETFs have seen outflows of 350 tons out of a total of 2,700 tons held in 2013 till April end. Further price pressure could lead to continued outflow in the near term. On the contrary, bar and coin demand has leaped to unprecedented levels.
"
753,NEM,"This phenomenon is not constrained to Asian markets only. In the US, total number of American Eagle coins sold in April recorded the highest ever dollar value of $311 million. The UK mint reported a tripling of coin sales in April, and the Perth mint in Australia reported the highest demand levels in five years.
"
754,NEM,"With buyers flocking the gold retail stores, several key markets have reportedly run out of stock, particularly in China and India. In April and May, India imported around 300 tons, nearly twice the average level.
"
755,NEM,"However, to rein in the surging demand, India has increased the duty on gold imports. Nonetheless, this increase in the import duty is unlikely to impact imports, as consumer demand remains at very high levels.
"
756,NEM,"The World Gold council expects 300-400 tons of gold to be imported into India during the second quarter, a 200% annual climb. China, another major consumer, is not far behind as imports from Hong Kong are also reported at high levels.
"
757,NEM,"The official sector is expected to continue to be the net buyer of gold. Gold will also enjoy demand from industrial and technology companies for a wide range of products.Supply
"
758,NEM,"A combination of current mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals, constitute the annual gold supply.
"
759,NEM,"In the first quarter, mine production was at 688 tons, up 4% year over year and 2% above the five-year quarterly average of 671.9 tons. Production increased in the Dominican Republic fueled by Barrick Gold Corporation’s (ABX  -  Free Report) Pueblo Viejo mine and in China. Growth was also noted across several mines in Canada and Brazil. Goldcorp Inc.’s (GG  -  Free Report) Penasquito mine continued to ramp up production in Mexico.
"
760,NEM,"Recycling of gold contributed 366.6 tons to total supply in the first quarter, 4% lower year over year, the fourth consecutive quarter of annual decline. This was due to reduction in the available supply of gold and economic factors. Overall, gold supply increased a meager 1% to 1,051.6 tons.Performance of Gold Companies
"
761,NEM,"As we delve into the March-end quarterly numbers of the gold companies in our coverage – Barrick Gold Corporation, Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (HMY), Newmont Mining Corporation (NEM  -  Free Report), Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (AEM  -  Free Report) and Goldcorp, we see earnings being hampered across the board by decline in average realized gold prices.
"
762,NEM,"Shares of Newmont, Barrick Gold, Kinross, Goldcorp, Agnico Eagle and Harmony Gold hit their 52-week lows in the April-May timeframe driven by the sudden drop in gold prices, first quarter results and trimmed guidance. Furthermore, the companies are also riddled with their individual operational issues. Barrick’s stock has fallen under pressure since the April 10th announcement that the company is suspending construction at its Pascua-Lama mine in Chile, in response to a court order from a Chilean court citing environmental concerns.
"
763,NEM,"The price decline added to the woes of the industry that is already grappling with rising costs, labor issues, strikes, delays and/or the cancellation of projects. This has put gold miners on the defensive, forcing them to reassessing and cutting costs. Companies like Barrick and Agnico-Eagle have trimmed down their cash cost guidance for 2013 in order to remain profitable.
"
764,NEM,"If prices fall further, margins will be constrained as the price of gold closes in on the cost per ounce of the companies. Analyzing the all-in sustaining costs (total costs associated with producing gold), 2013 guidance of Barrick Gold, Newmont, Kinross, Goldcorp and Agnico Eagle ranges from $950 to a maximum of $1200 per ounce.
"
765,NEM,"Even if prices continue at April/May levels, there is still a chance for these companies to earn profits. On the other hand, IAMGOLD Corp. (IAG) is running at a risk with consolidated total all-in sustaining cost guidance of $1,200 - $1,300, which is quite close to the current price.
"
766,NEM,"Barrick, Harmony, Goldcorp, Newmont have decided to curtail their capital spending for the year. According to reports, Barrick Gold is contemplating to sell three of its Australian mines and its oil and gas unit -- Barrick Energy and Kabanga, its 50% owned nickel project in Tanzania to offload underperforming assets.
"
767,NEM,"The key to stay afloat in these turbulent times is to identify and reduce discretionary expenses wherever possible, trim capital spending, defer new capital development programs, divest underperforming assets and cut dividends. The companies should judiciously proceed on only low-risk, high-return brownfield and the best Greenfield projects.
"
768,NEM,"In the falling gold price environment, companies with major projects may require additional debt to complete them. Miners with lower costs, lower levels of debt, and with recently completed new mine development will be able to sustain themselves.Consolidation
"
769,NEM,"Companies have slowed down their deal activities since last year, but Chinese gold miners remained active on the acquisition front. To capitalize on the strong domestic demand for gold, Chinese companies are acquiring overseas gold mines. In 2012, China’s second largest producer, Zijin Mining Group, bought Australia-based Norton Gold Fields and the third largest gold producer, Shandong Gold Group, acquired majority stake in Australia’s Focus Minerals.
"
770,NEM,"Australia was a preferred target considering it is the world's second-largest gold producer, after China. Hong Kong-listed Kingwell Group Limited recently made an offer to Canada-based Brazilian Gold Corporation to acquire not less than 50.95% of its share. Brazilian Gold focuses on the acquisition, exploration and development of gold properties located in northern Brazil.To Sum Up
"
771,NEM,"Demand for gold will undoubtedly continue to rise, thanks to the rising middle class in India, China, Latin America and other emerging markets. The Euro-zone debt crisis will also be an important driver for gold demand. Furthermore, demand for gold bullion and coins is currently at an unprecedented level. It may however take months for this new demand to feed into prices, but prices will eventually stabilize.
"
772,NEM,"According to the World Gold Council, the bull market for the yellow metal is very much intact even if there’s a lot of uncertainty at the moment for investors. Gold is expected to return to pre-April levels as the long-term drivers of demand are firmly in place.  
"
773,NEM,"The consumers who rushed to buy gold following the fall in prices might have to wait patiently for their anticipated returns to materialize. At current levels, one should invest in gold as a long-term investment, which will grow in value and add diversification to a portfolio. For quick returns, it is advisable to focus on other assets.
"
774,NEM,"A Brief Overview
"
775,NEM,"The Metals & Mining industry broadly refers to metals and minerals extraction (mining) and the primary and secondary processing of these metals and minerals. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output.
"
776,NEM,"With respect to volume, iron and steel commands a majority in the global metal industry, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products.
"
777,NEM,"The precious metal and minerals industry comprise companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores as well as cultivation of pearls.
"
778,NEM,"The industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Historically, it has suffered from oversupply (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. The tepid global economic growth outlook has emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry. Notwithstanding these near-term challenges, the group’s long-term dynamics appear attractive.
"
779,NEM,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, the industry is broadly grouped in the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and is further sub-divided into three industries at the expanded level: Mining – Gold, Mining – Iron and Mining – Non-Ferrous. All the industries within the Basic Materials sector like chemicals, paper, steel and mining are economically sensitive, but the level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.
"
780,NEM,"We rank all of the more than 250 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry. This ranking is available in the Zacks Industry Rank https://www.zacks.com/rank/industry.php.
"
781,NEM,"The way to look at the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 250+ companies is that the outlook for the top one-third of the list (Zacks Industry Rank of #85 and lower) is positive, while the outlook for the bottom one-third (Zacks Industry Rank #170 and higher) is negative.
"
782,NEM,"For the Mining Industry, Iron Mining barely makes into the top 1/3rd with its Zacks Industry Rank #77, while the Non-Ferrous (aluminum, copper, etc.) and Gold Mining industries are barely in the bottom 1/3rd at Zacks Industry Rank of #187 and #182, respectively. The exact location of the three mining industries on the Zacks Industry Rank aside, one could safely say that the near-term outlook for the group is leaning towards a Neutral outlook.A Detailed Look into Metals: Performance and Outlook
"
783,NEM,"Steel
"
784,NEM,"The steel industry has steadily recovered from the impact of the global economic downturn, which slashed crude steel production by 9% in 2009. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,548 Mt in 2012, outperforming the record set in 2011 by 1.2%. Significant growth in Asia and North America were instrumental for the annual upside, marred somewhat by declines in Europe and South America.
"
785,NEM,"During 2012, production in Asia improved 2.7% to 1,012 Mt. China emerged as the leading steel producing country once again, up 3.1% year over year and yielding almost 46% of the global output. Production in Japan, the second largest producer, remained flat year over year. The United States held the third position, producing 88.6 Mt of crude steel, up 2.5% annually and accounting for 6% of the total global output. Production in Europe and South America were a dampener, declining 2.7% and 3.1%, respectively.
"
786,NEM,"Let’s have a look at the performance and outlook of the end markets for the industry:
"
787,NEM,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has been promising in recent times. Auto sales in the U.S. surged 13% to 14.5 million vehicles in Dec 2012, the highest volume attained in the last five years. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) in December was 15.4 million vehicles, the second straight month of above 15 million SAAR in 2012. This performance will likely generate solid momentum going into 2013.
"
788,NEM,"The robust growth rate in the sector has been fueled by strong pent-up demand, cheap financing, launch of several redesigned and fuel-efficient vehicles and rebound in consumer confidence thanks to a growing belief that the housing market is recovering.
"
789,NEM,"Another major market, the construction sector, has so far been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, in 2012, the sector finally started picking up began signaling a recovery evidenced by solid growth in the major indicators.
"
790,NEM,"The architecture billing index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximate nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, climbed back into the positive territory with a score of 50.2 in August after languishing in the negative territory for five consecutive months. Any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings and the score has remained stable till December.
"
791,NEM,"The ABI readings in the fourth quarter of 2012, in fact, exhibited the strongest growth since the downturn in early 2008. This momentum is expected to persist and conditions are expected improve, albeit at a slow and steady rate.
"
792,NEM,"The American Institute of Architects projects a 5% increase in spending in 2013 for non-residential construction projects, on the back of higher construction of commercial facilities, particularly for hotels followed by industrial construction spending. The spending is expected to shore up to 7.2% in 2014.
"
793,NEM,"Meanwhile, the residential housing sector is also showing signs of positive growth with figures at highest levels in more than four years. In 2012, housing starts totaled 780,000, surging 28% from 2011 and housing permits (an indicator of future demand) escalated 30% to 813,000. Both attained their respective highest level since 2008. Housing completions rose 11% to 651,000 in 2012, the highest level since 2010.
"
794,NEM,"According to the most recent most issued data, in December housing starts spiked 37% year over year to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 954,000. Building permits were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 903,000, 29% higher than the year-ago figure.
"
795,NEM,"In a nutshell, record-low mortgage rates, rising rents and reduced prices of properties are luring buyers. These figures reinforce the belief that U.S. residential construction is finally stabilizing and is on the road to a much awaited recovery.
"
796,NEM,"Analyzing the fourth quarter results of the major steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel (X  -  Free Report), Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel (AKS) -- we see revenues were marred by the drop in average steel prices. This does not come as a surprise as oversupply in the U.S. steel industry and increased steel imports in the domestic market affected steel prices, which in turn hurt margins and profits of the steel players. Furthermore, the gloomy macroeconomic condition in Europe is another area of concern as it is the largest market for total U.S. exports.
"
797,NEM,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker in terms of volume and Europe’s largest steelmaker, recently announced its plans to permanently close its plant in Liege, Belgium owing to the slack demand and weakening European economy. The company also announced the idling of its liquid phase in Oct 2011 due to structural over-capacity in Northern Europe. The production halt at the Liege plant was done to better focus on the company’s downstream activities, operating five core lines and seven flexible lines.
"
798,NEM,"However, economic conditions worsened since then and demand for steel in Europe declined another 8%-9% in 2012 and is currently 29% below the pre-crisis levels. The Leige business is heavily dependent on the automotive sector, which faced a major downturn in 2012. Consequently, tepid demand also had a hand in idling of the facility and ArcelorMittal further stated that it will close six production lines at Liege that manufacture finished steel products for the auto industry. It is also closing a coke plant, which produces fuel for blast furnaces.
"
799,NEM,"Going into 2013, steelmakers expect profits to be affected by continued increase in steel imports, volatility in steel pricing along with macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the recessionary conditions in Europe and sluggish growth in the emerging markets.
"
800,NEM,"However, the sector will benefit from the strong momentum in the automotive markets. The outlook for other key markets -- transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors also remains favorable. The turnaround in the so-far faltering construction sector will definitely provide a much-needed impetus to the sector.
"
801,NEM,"Steelmakers are increasing their consolidation efforts, particularly in China and India, to derive economies of scale and other synergies to remain competitive. A major development in this sector was the recent merger of Japan's largest and the world's sixth-largest steel maker Nippon Steel Corporation with Sumitomo Metal Industries to form the world’s second biggest steel firm -- Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation . With a combined capacity of 46.1 million tons, it has replaced China's Hebei Group in the second position, with production of 44.4 million tons. The merger is targeted to generate savings in the face of increasingly intense global competition.
"
802,NEM,"China’s recent attempt to bolster its economy by approving 60 infrastructure projects worth more than $150 billion will help bolster the steel sector. Prices could potentially stabilize on the back of a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, in particular China, India and South Korea. Furthermore, the sector will reap the benefits of the Federal Reserve’s move to boost the U.S economy. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain headwinds for the industry.Gold
"
803,NEM,"As per the World Gold Council, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal scaled up 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly driven by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
804,NEM,"As per the most recent data available, gold demand stood at 1084.6 tons in third quarter 2012, down 11% from the historic high level in the third quarter of 2011. Strong ETF inflow and higher demand from central banks was offset by declines in demand for jewelry, investment and in the technology sectors due to higher prices. Almost 68% of the decline stemmed from a steep drop in the bar and coin segment.
"
805,NEM,"In absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $57.6 billion, down 14% from the third quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the quarter stood at $1,652, down 3% year over year.
"
806,NEM,"Central banks remained the primary purchasers of gold, accounting for around 9% of total gold demand at 97.6 tons. Investment demand declined 16%, mainly due to a drop in bar and coin investment. Gold demand in the technology sector was 108.2 tons, a 6% annual decline due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, uncertainty in Europe and substitution to more affordable alternatives.
"
807,NEM,"Jewelry demand dipped 2% to 448.8 tons due to higher price levels as well as unfavorable economic conditions. China, Saudi Arabia, US and European markets saw declines. On the contrary, jewelry demand was strong in India, a major consumer of gold and accounted for 30% of global demand. Despite record high prices, demand was on the rise thanks to improving sentiment, stock building and positive price expectations.
"
808,NEM,"Demand for gold in China, another major market, decreased 5% to 123.8 tons as consumers cut back spending given the slow economic growth. Demand in the U.S market was affected as customers are trending toward lower carat gold, particularly with the penetration of 10-carat and other alternative metals.
"
809,NEM,"Mine production dipped 1% to 731.6 tons in the quarter. Mine workers’ strike in South Africa, disappointing results for a number of operations, lower-than-expected growth at new or recovering mines affected production during the quarter. Recycling activity decreased 2% to 460.7 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,188.3 tons, down 2% year over year.
"
810,NEM,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce in November.
"
811,NEM,"In 2012, gold prices have has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,791.75 per ounce, with an average of $1,669.03 per ounce. Gold prices had a solid run in the first three quarters of 2012. Continuing concerns about Europe’s financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb.
"
812,NEM,"Furthermore, the announcement of a third round of quantitative easing led to a surge in gold prices. However, in the fourth quarter, prices fell from $1,776 per ounce to $1,657 per ounce, a 6.7% drop. Despite a weak fourth quarter gold stood at $1657.5 per ounce at 2012 end, up 8.3% and marked the 12th year of annual gains.
"
813,NEM,"The official sector is expected to continue to be a net buyer of gold in 2013. However, high gold prices and economic uncertainties will likely keep a check on demand for jewelry. Demand in the technology sector will be dampened due to high prices and the shift toward lower cost substitutes.
"
814,NEM,"A climb in gold prices has not always translated into increased revenues for all the gold miners, as they have to deal with increased cash costs and production issues. As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as Barrick Gold (ABX) and Goldcorp (GG  -  Free Report), being unhedged producers of gold, will enjoy significant leverage to gold prices.
"
815,NEM,"The cost increases need to be controlled in order to rake in profits. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont Mining (NEM  -  Free Report) and Kinross Gold (KGC  -  Free Report) are expected to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
816,NEM,"Ironically, rising gold prices has not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may be entangled in labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
817,NEM,"Gold remains a coveted asset given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macroeconomic factors. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to lure investors and consumers, and is considered a safe investment. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option.
"
818,NEM,"Gold prices will continue its rally in 2013, driven by investment and buying of gold by the central banks as a reserve portfolio asset. Strength in Indian markets, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should also provide support.
"
819,NEM,"Furthermore, recovery in China could contribute to the rise in the prices of gold. The Eurozone debt crisis and the geopolitical risks in the Middle East will pose as important drivers for a sustained demand for gold as a safe haven.Aluminum
"
820,NEM,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.Alcoa (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, kicked off the fourth quarter earnings season with a revenue decline of 1.5% due to lower realized metal price. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 6 cents reversing its year-ago loss of 18 cents per share earned in the year ago quarter. The company’s midstream and downstream businesses delivered profits and its cost-cutting measures also supported the results.
"
821,NEM,"Alcoa is optimistic for 2013 and expects global demand for aluminum to increase 7%, up from 6% growth in 2012. The company projects 9%-10% global growth in the aerospace sector this year. Its growth forecast for the other markets are -- automotive (1%-4%), commercial transportation (2%-7%), packaging (2%-3%), building and construction (4%-5%) and industrial gas turbine (3%-5%). Alcoa remains firm on the long-term prospects for aluminum and envisions global demand for aluminum to double by 2020.
"
822,NEM,"Alcoa’s positive long-term outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Alcoa’s results have suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices. BHP Billiton (BHP  -  Free Report) and Rio Tinto (RIO  -  Free Report) have either sold or halted development of aluminum projects following a decline in aluminum prices.
"
823,NEM,"In 2012, BHP sold its 33.3% stake in the Guinea Alumina joint venture to its partners and also halted bauxite exploration at its Boffa-Santou-Houda site in Guinea. The company also abandoned plans to build a smelter in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rio is set to divest 13 aluminum assets, including its Gove operations in Australia. Alcoa is looking to buy mines used in the manufacture of aluminium from BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.
"
824,NEM,"Alcoa is aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining by 2015. The company completed planned closure or curtailments of 531,000 metric tons, or 12% of its highest-cost system smelting capacity, to enhance its competitive position.
"
825,NEM,"This trend will likely continue until aluminum prices recover. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been on the downside lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
826,NEM,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve on a global basis. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from its recyclability and light-weight properties. The global push to improve fuel efficiency in vehicles is expected to more than double demand for aluminum in the auto industry by 2025.
"
827,NEM,"Further, the surge in copper prices last year has triggered a switch among manufacturers to aluminum. Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus to the more economical metal. In response to the upsurge in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
828,NEM,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are witnessing rapid industrialization.
"
829,NEM,"The China stimulus plan will also work as positives for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China, or Chalco (ACH) should also benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
830,NEM,"Copper is a major industrial metal with its price strongly depending on the economic growth outlook. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
831,NEM,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage is due to its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, along with its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper holds the third place after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
832,NEM,"Copper prices witnessed record high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies led to the surge in copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008, copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
833,NEM,"However, copper prices have since improved based on the strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. In 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound.
"
834,NEM,"In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.77 per pound. However, during the second quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.57 per pound and dipped further to $3.50 in the third quarter. This drop reflected concerns regarding a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and a slowing U.S. economy.
"
835,NEM,"During fourth-quarter 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.59 per pound. Overall in 2012, LME spot copper prices averaged $3.61 per pound, a 10% drop from 2011.
"
836,NEM,"The drop in price has hurt the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont. Struggling with declining copper prices, Freeport has recently taken a major stride to venture into the U.S. energy space as part of the company’s strategy to diversify from its bread-and-butter copper mining business. The company is set to buy Plains Exploration & Production (PXP) and McMoRan Exploration (MMR) for roughly $9 billion.
"
837,NEM,"Freeport’s copper business has been affected by the sluggish global economy. Demand from key end-markets, including construction materials and electronics, remains weak due to the overall economic softness. The buyouts are expected to provide new opportunities for the company.
"
838,NEM,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.Overall Industry Outlook
"
839,NEM,"Cost inflation in the sector is expected to be a headwind for metal and mining companies over the next several years, driven by a number of factors viz. labor, energy, ore grades, currencies, supply constraints and taxes. Global economic uncertainties, softening commodity prices, higher input costs are increasing the pressure on company margins.
"
840,NEM,"To combat this, mining and metals companies are reviewing their portfolios to identify underperforming assets and shut down or divest these high cost and non-core assets. Industry consolidation, automation technology, owner-operated mines and investment in energy assets are some of the steps that companies are taking to mitigate the impact of rising costs.
"
841,NEM,"Growth in the emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. However, of late, demand in China has slowed down. China’s recent $150 billion infrastructure stimulus has helped improve the sentiment somewhat and holds promise for the metals and mining industry going forward.
"
842,NEM,"In the developed world, persistent recessionary conditions in Europe will have residual effects elsewhere. The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the U.S economy’s momentum, which will hopefully jumpstart growth once again.
"
843,NEM,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.
"
844,NEM,"The Metals & Mining industry encompasses the extraction (mining) as well as primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for a lion’s share of the output.
"
845,NEM,"Iron and steel commands a major chunk of the global metals market -- more than half the metals industry in terms of volume, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, as well as iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products.
"
846,NEM,"The precious metal and minerals industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls.
"
847,NEM,"The industry is highly cyclical and competitive. Historically, it has suffered from overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in prices, general economic conditions and end-user markets. The weakening outlook for global economic growth has emerged as a major headwind for the global metal industry. These near-term challenges aside, the group’s long-term dynamics appear attractive.A Detailed Look into Metals: Performance and OutlookSteel
"
848,NEM,"As the major stakeholder in the metals market, the steel industry was severely hurt by the global economic downturn. Recovery, however, was swift and forceful. According to the World Steel Association, world crude steel production was a record 1,527 Mt in 2011, a 6.8% annual jump. In the first quarter of the current fiscal, world crude steel production was 377.3 Mt, and improved further to 388.4 Mt in the second quarter. Moreover, recent data shows that crude steel production for July and August was at 252.5 Mt, trending 0.4% higher than the comparable period last year.
"
849,NEM,"China retained its leadership position among the steel producing countries, yielding almost half of the global output at 48%, growing 2% year over year so far in the third quarter. Japan, the second largest producer, posted a 2% increase. The United States held the third position, producing 14.8 Mt of crude steel, flat annually and constituted 6% of the total global output. Asia improved 2.3% to 166.8 Mt, while production in Europe was a dampener, declining 4.5%.
"
850,NEM,"The automotive and construction markets have historically been the largest consumers of steel. The automotive sector has shown significant promise. Auto sales in the U.S. surged 13% to 1.19 million vehicles for the month of September 2012. The seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) went up 13.7% to 14.9 million vehicles from September last year, the highest sales rate in the last four years.
"
851,NEM,"Auto sales for the first nine months of 2012 averaged 14.5 million SAAR and grew a promising 15%. The robust growth rate in the sector has been fueled by strong pent-up demand, cheap financing, launch of several redesigned and fuel-efficient vehicles, rebound in consumer confidence, thanks to a growing belief that the housing market is recovering.
"
852,NEM,"The construction sector had been a drag on the steel companies’ earnings. However, recent figures suggest a turnaround in the non-residential as well as residential construction sector. According to the American Institute of Architects, the architecture billings index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximate nine- to twelve-month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, stood at 48.7, up considerably from 45.9 registered in June.
"
853,NEM,"Even though in the negative territory (since any score above 50 indicates an increase in billings), the index level pointed toward a moderation in the downturn. The momentum picked up in August with ABI climbing back into the positive territory with a score of 50.2 for the first time in five months.
"
854,NEM,"The American Institute of Architects projects a 4.4% increase in spending this year for non-residential construction projects, on the back of increase in demand for industrial facilities so far this year along with sustained demand for hotels and retail projects. The spending is expected to accelerate further to 6.2% in 2013.
"
855,NEM,"As per the U.S. Department of Commerce, housing starts increased 29% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 750,000 in August 2012 compared with August 2011. Building permits in August were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 803,000, 24.5% higher than the year-ago figure. It is worth mentioning that building permits in July this year had touched the highest level in four years at 811,000.
"
856,NEM,"In a nutshell, record-low mortgage rates, rising rents and reduced prices of properties are luring buyers. These figures provide a glimmer of hope that U.S. residential construction is finally stabilizing and is on the road to a much awaited recovery.
"
857,NEM,"Reflecting on the second quarter results of the steel companies in our coverage -- ArcelorMittal (MT  -  Free Report), United States Steel Corp. (X  -  Free Report), Nucor Corporation (NUE  -  Free Report) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS  -  Free Report) -- we see revenues were constrained due to drop in average steel prices. This does not come as a surprise, however, as oversupply in the U.S. steel industry and increased steel imports in the domestic market affected steel prices, hurting margins and profits of steel players in the process.
"
858,NEM,"Looking forward to the third quarter, the steelmakers expect profits to be lower than the second quarter due to continued increase in steel imports, decline in average realized prices along with macroeconomic uncertainty and sluggish growth in emerging markets.
"
859,NEM,"For 2012, the World Steel Association provides a muted outlook, projecting a 3.6% increase in global steel usage, a sharp deceleration from 5.6% growth in 2011. This reflects a continuing slowdown in Chinese steel demand and Eurozone debt crisis uncertainties. Furthermore, questions about the U.S. growth outlook also loom large.
"
860,NEM,"After recording a 6.2% growth in 2011, China’s steel usage in 2012 is estimated to grow 4% to 648.8 Mt as the economy is entering a less steel-intensive growth phase as a result of the government’s efforts to rebalance the economy and restrain the real estate bubble. After a weak performance in 2011, India is expected to grow by 6.9% to 72.5 Mt. Japan’s steel usage is expected to drop 0.6% to 63.7 Mt in 2012, due to the impact of exchange rate appreciation despite the reconstruction activities after the March 2011 earthquake.
"
861,NEM,"In 2013, world steel demand is expected to increase 4.5% to approximately 1,486 Mt. China’s steel usage is expected to grow 4% to 674.8 Mt from the 2012 projections. India is expected to pick up pace and grow 9.4%, triggered by urbanization and surging infrastructure investment. In 2013, the steel use in the U.S. is envisioned at 99.5 Mt, recording 5.6% growth. Brazil is expected to grow 6.7% to reach 52.5 Mt in 2013. Japan is expected to decline further by 2.2% to 62.3 Mt, comprising 77% of the 2007 level. Europe is, however, expected to record a modest recovery of 3.3% to 155.8 Mt in 2013.
"
862,NEM,"Given the scenario in Europe, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steelmaker in terms of volume and Europe's largest steelmaker, had earlier decided to idle five of its 25 blast furnaces in Europe and announced the extended idling of a number of facilities. The company will continue to align its steel growth projects to match demand situations. To reduce its exposure to Europe, the company recently sold its 24% share in European energy company, Enovos International.
"
863,NEM,"Steelmakers are increasing their consolidation efforts, particularly in China and India, in order to derive economies of scale and other synergies to remain competitive. A major development in this sector was the recent merger of Japan's largest and world's sixth-largest steel maker Nippon Steel Corporation with 27th-ranked Sumitomo Metal Industries to form the world's second biggest steel firm - Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corporation (NSSMY). With a combined capacity of 46.1 million tons, it is set to replace China's Hebei Group in the second position, which has a production of 44.4 million tons. The merger is targeted to generate savings in the face of increasingly intense global competition.
"
864,NEM,"To sum up, despite plagued by overcapacity and softening prices, the outlook for the sector is not that bad. The outlook for key end-markets in the automotive, transportation, energy, industrial and agricultural sectors remains favorable. The faltering construction sector is showing signs of a turnaround.
"
865,NEM,"China’s recent attempt to bolster its economy by approving 60 infrastructure projects worth more than $150 billion will help lift up the steel sector. Prices could potentially stabilize on the back of a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, in particular China, India and South Korea.
"
866,NEM,"Furthermore, the sector will also benefit from the Federal Reserve’s move to boost the U.S economy. However, the European debt crisis and its potential global impact remain an overhang on the industry.Gold
"
867,NEM,"As per the World Gold Council, 2011 was a milestone year for gold as global demand for the yellow metal grew 0.4% to 4,067.1 tons at an estimated value of $205.5 billion -- the highest tonnage level with a value exceeding $200 billion since 1997. The increase was mainly propelled by the investment sector, particularly in India, China and Europe.
"
868,NEM,"In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, gold demand was at 990 tons, down 7% year over year. Increase in demand from central banks was offset by declines in demand for jewelry, investment and in the technology sectors, due to higher prices. Central banks continued to be the primary purchasers of gold, accounting for around 16% of total gold demand, at 157.5 tons. This was a record quarter for central bank, buying more than twice the purchases in the second quarter last year.
"
869,NEM,"In absolute terms, gold demand in the quarter was valued at $51.2 billion, a 1% decline from the second quarter of fiscal 2011. Average gold price in the first quarter stood at $1,609.49, 7% above the prior fiscal’s quarter.
"
870,NEM,"Investment demand declined 23% to 302 tons, due to lower demand for ETFs and physical bars, particularly in India and China. Gold demand in the technology sector was 1,112.2 tons, a 5% decline year-over-year due to higher gold prices, weak consumer demand, uncertainty in Europe and substitution to more affordable alternatives.
"
871,NEM,"Jewelry demand dipped 15% to 418.3 tons due to higher price levels. Jewelry demand in India, a major consumer of gold, was down 30%, mainly due to a deprecation in the Indian rupee against the US dollar, which led to record high local prices. Furthermore, slowing GDP growth, domestic inflation, high interest rates and below average monsoon rain also contributed to the decline. Gold in India is currently at an all-time high in rupee terms.
"
872,NEM,"In China, another major market, demand for gold decreased 9% to 93.8 tons as consumers were discouraged by the slowing GDP growth and the lack of clear trend in gold price. However, China is expected to resume its pace as economic growth is expected to pick up as a result of the monetary easing implemented in the second quarter.
"
873,NEM,"Mine production inched up 3 tons to 706.4 tons, up 3% year over year. Adverse weather conditions, interruptions at few operations and slower ramp up of production at few mines affected the production numbers during the quarter. Recycling activity decreased 12% to 363.7 tons, bringing the total supply to 1,059.1 tons, down 6% year over year.
"
874,NEM,"Russia is becoming an important player in the global gold market. The Central Bank of Russia remains a significant purchaser of gold. A healthy domestic economy is driving the demand for gold jewelry in the region, catapulting it to the position of the world’s fourth largest gold jewelry consumer. The region accounts for 8% of the total global gold output.
"
875,NEM,"Gold prices in 2011 ranged from a low of $1,310 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce, with an average gold price of $1,572 per ounce in 2011. The record gold price of $1,895 per ounce was attained in September, 33% higher than the 2010 peak of $1,421 per ounce recorded in November 2010. So far in 2012, gold has ranged from $1,540 per ounce to $1,791.75 per ounce, with an average of $1,656.18 per ounce.
"
876,NEM,"Continuing concerns about Europe's financial problems and China’s reduced economic growth forecast led to the climb. Furthermore, the announcement of a third round of quantitative easing led to a surge in the price of gold. Given the performance in 2011, and thus far in 2012, we expect this year to be stellar for gold.
"
877,NEM,"This climb in gold prices has not translated into increased revenues at all of the gold miners. In the second quarter, while revenues at Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC  -  Free Report) and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (AEM  -  Free Report) benefited from higher average realized price of gold, Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX), Goldcorp Inc. (GG  -  Free Report) and Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM  -  Free Report) could not capitalize from them due to increased cash costs. Moreover, Goldcorp was riddled with production issues at its Red Lake mine.
"
878,NEM,"As prices for gold rise further, gold giants such as Barrick Gold and Goldcorp being unhedged producers of gold will enjoy significant leverage to gold prices. The cost increases need to be controlled in order to rake in profits. On the other hand, gold producers like Newmont and Kinross are slated to suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and negate the benefits of rising gold prices.
"
879,NEM,"Ironically, rallying gold prices have not had the same effect on the share prices of the gold companies. Investors prefer alternative financial products that allow them to invest in gold, rather than investment in gold companies per se. These companies may be entangled in labor issues, escalating cost and other risks.
"
880,NEM,"Gold remains a coveted asset, given its long-term supply and demand dynamics and influenced by macro-economic factors. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers, and is considered a safe-haven investment. Concerns regarding economic growth in developed countries have made gold an attractive and safe investment option.
"
881,NEM,"The European sovereign debt crisis promoted gold as a currency hedge for European investors.
"
882,NEM,"Lingering economic concerns, higher inflation expectations in many countries, including India and China, and the relentless Euro-zone debt crisis will continue to drive gold prices this year, as well. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world’s gold, should drive demand for gold along with China. China will likely emerge as the largest gold market in the world in 2012 and Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years.Aluminum
"
883,NEM,"The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand.Alcoa, Inc. (AA), the world leader in the production of primary aluminum, kicked off the third quarter earnings season with a revenue decline of 9% due to a 17% and 20% year-over-year decline in the realized metal price and realized alumina price, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 3 cents compared with 6 cents per share earned in the second quarter.
"
884,NEM,"Results were down sequentially due to lower metal prices, seasonal factors and weakness in Europe. Alcoa’s results in the past two quarters have suffered because of the decline in realized aluminum prices.
"
885,NEM,"The company has trimmed its 2012 outlook expecting global aluminum demand to go up by 6% this year from the earlier expectation of 7%, due to the slowdown in China. Alcoa believes that the long-term prospects for aluminum remain bright and envisions that global demand for aluminum will double by 2020.
"
886,NEM,"Alcoa’s positive long-term outlook notwithstanding, prices have been under pressure, prompting companies to cut back on production. Rio Tinto plc (RIO) plans to sell its aluminium assets and close its smelter in order to cut costs. In line with this, Rio recently sold its U.S.-based wire and cable business Alcan Cable for $185 million. BHP Billiton Limited (BHP) is also mulling the sale of its aluminum and nickel operations to exit from its non-profitable projects.
"
887,NEM,"Alcoa is aggressively slashing costs and pursuing strategies to move down its cost curves in its upstream businesses. The company remains committed to achieving its target of moving down the cost curve 10 percentage points in smelting and 7 percentage points in refining by 2015. The company is curtailing 390,000 metric tons of its system smelting capacity to improve its competitive position. Alcoa permanently closed its smelter at Alcoa, Tennessee, and two lines at Rockdale, Texas. Alcoa has completed partial curtailments at La Coruña and Avilés, Spain. The curtailment at its Portovesme, Italy smelter is underway.
"
888,NEM,"This trend will continue until aluminum prices recover. Energy prices and other input costs are expected to pose challenges for the aluminum industry, though oil prices have been trending down lately. In addition to the curtailments, the company will step up activities to reduce the escalating cost of raw materials.
"
889,NEM,"In the medium to long term, aluminum consumption is expected to improve globally. The revival is palpable in the automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum-intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and its light-weight properties.

Automobiles, air conditioners and industrial components manufacturers are now shifting their focus on more economical metal. In response to the spurt in automotive demand, Alcoa has invested $300 million in expansion projects at its Davenport, Iowa rolled products plant.
"
891,NEM,"We expect aluminum demand to increase over the next three years, outstripping supply growth. As a result, the aluminum market is likely to witness deficits for a prolonged period. This provides a backdrop supportive of high alumina and aluminum prices. China and India are undergoing rapid industrialization.
"
892,NEM,"The China stimulus plan and QE3 announcement will also work as positives for underlying aluminum demand. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa and Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, or Chalco  should also benefit from the improving demand outlook.Copper
"
893,NEM,"Copper is a major industrial metal, with its price strongly correlated with the outlook for economic growth. The metal’s strong cyclical leverage accounts for its nickname “Dr. Copper.”
"
894,NEM,"The metal’s popularity in industrial usage reflects its high ductility, malleability and thermal and electrical conductivity, and its resistance to corrosion. In terms of consumption, copper holds the third place after iron and aluminum. Construction is the single largest market for copper, followed by electronics and electronic products, transportation, industrial machinery, and consumer and general products.
"
895,NEM,"Copper prices were at high levels from 2006 through most of 2008 as limited supplies, growing demand from China and other emerging economies led to the surge in copper prices and low level of inventories. In December 2008, copper prices dipped to a low of $1.26 per pound, due to reduced consumption, turbulence in the U.S. financial markets and concerns about the global economy.
"
896,NEM,"However, copper prices have since improved, thanks to strong demand from emerging markets and limited supply. In 2011, London Metal Exchange (LME) spot-copper prices ranged from $3.08 per pound to a record high of $4.60 per pound, with an average of $4.00 per pound. In the first quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices ranged from $3.39 per pound to $3.93 per pound, averaging $3.77.
"
897,NEM,"However, during the second quarter of 2012, LME spot copper prices declined ranging from $3.29 per pound to $3.89 per pound, averaging $3.57 per pound. This drop reflected concerns regarding a slowdown in the Chinese economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, and a slowing U.S. economy. The drop in price has affected the results of copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX  -  Free Report) and Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO  -  Free Report) and Newmont.
"
898,NEM,"Notwithstanding the current volatility in prices, we have a long-term bullish stance on copper. Prices will be influenced by demand from China and emerging markets, economic activity in the U.S. and other industrialized countries, the timing of new supplies of copper and production levels of mines and copper smelters.
"
899,NEM,"Despite the near-term challenges, the long-term outlook for the copper remains positive, supported by its widespread use, limited supplies from existing mines and the absence of significant new development projects. Companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand for the metal in the developing markets.Overall Industry Outlook
"
900,NEM,"Growth in emerging markets, particularly China and India, was a major driver of metals demand over the last few years. However, of late, demand in China has slowed down as the government cut its 2012 target growth rate to 7.5%, the lowest year-on-year growth projection in eight years. China’s recent $150 billion infrastructure has helped improve sentiment and holds promise for the metals and mining industry.
"
901,NEM,"In the developed world, persistent recessionary conditions in Europe will have residual effects elsewhere. The U.S. economy, which looked very promising earlier this year, no longer offers a robust picture. The U.S. Federal Reserve also appears to be actively engaged in sustaining the economy’s momentum and its recent announcement of another round of quantitative easing, will hopefully jumpstart growth once again.
"
902,NEM,"This synchronized global economic slowdown is the biggest headwind for the metals space overall at present. That said, the long-term picture remains a lot more promising as the emerging market economies are expected to get back in shape with the help of expected fiscal and monetary stimuli.
