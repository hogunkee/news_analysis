0,LB,"Watching how a stock behaves after a strong breakout is vital. If a stock holds firm near a certain price level for at least three straight weeks, it can give the alert investor a chance to add shares to an already profitable investment.IBD has a simple name for this follow-up buying opportunity: the three-weeks-tight pattern.First of all, what does ""follow-up"" mean?In a bull market, the first time to buy a stock is when it clears the proper buy point of a primary base pattern. These patterns include the cup with handle, double bottom, flat base and base-on-base. If the stock's breakout is healthy, you should establish a full-size position in the stock.The follow-up buy should only be a fraction of the full-size position. If you buy the same number of shares as the first purchase, your average cost will go up dramatically. This leaves you more vulnerable to a loss if the stock pulls back to its buy point.One element of a good base is narrow trading action — both in the size of its swings from high to low, and how it closes. A stock that closes at 40 one week, 32 the next and 39 a week later is showing the opposite of price tightness; it means market players have mixed views about the company's future. This can lead to false rallies.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLet's assume a stock rallies 5%, 10% or more from its proper buy point then refuses to give up ground.During that holding period, study the stock's weekly chart. If shares close at nearly the same price in prior weeks, a light bulb should shine inside your head. This behavior suggests overall demand for the stock is exceptionally high.The time to add shares is when the stock climbs past the highest level in the tight pattern in heavy volume. You might also find a lower buy point where the stock faced an area of upward resistance. Don't add the same amount of shares as when you bought on the breakout. Be happy with a small amount; you don't want to aggressively raise the average share cost of your position too fast.Not all three-weeks-tight patterns work. A sudden spate of bad economic or corporate news can drown a stock in sellers. So could a major market top.Also keep in mind that the three-weeks-tight pattern does not appear often. But it tends to show up during the run of an exceptional market leader.If the width between the highest close and the lowest close exceeds 1% to 2%, it's probably not a three-weeks-tight. Volume during those weeks is usually quiet, but that's not an absolute requirement.Limited Brands, now known as L Brands (LB), helped lead the bull market that began in August of 1982. In 1978 to 1979, the women's clothing chain suffered a huge slide from 22.50 to as low as 4. But the stock marched back to 16 by May of 1981 before weaving a long cup with a long handle (1).L Brands cleared its handle in three straight up weeks on accelerating volume (2). By early May, the stock climbed nearly 30% above its 15.98 buy point. Mild pullbacks to its 10-week moving average gave holders chances to add shares (3).In mid-August of 1982, the market indexes followed through vigorously. L Brands thrust ahead 44% in just three weeks (4). While a typical growth stock would peak after such a huge run, L Brands barely budged the next three weeks (5). It closed at 28.25, 28.25 and 28. The weekly spread between the closes was less than 1%. That's tight action.L Brands resumed its huge run in the week ended Oct. 1. The stock passed its 29.60 buy point on two days of gains on above-average trade. The rally that followed was stunning; it ramped up another 325% by July 1983, making a pair of 2-for-1 splits along the way.L Brands corrected sharply for 11 months, built a new base and broke out again in January 1985. That breakout ushered a 465% gain over the next 2-1/2 years.(A version of this column was originally published in the Aug. 4, 2010, edition of IBD.

3,LB,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA). Analysts reportedly criticized the decision.Broadcom ranked on the top of the ""Down in Price"" section of IBD's Stocks On The Move table. Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK), Zumiez (ZUMZ) and L Brands (LB) also dropped significantly in huge turnover. That's usually a sign of heavy institutional profit-taking or pure selling.Small caps lagged a touch on Thursday, yet remain leaders in year-to-date performance.The Russell 2000 rose just 0.4%, but at 1690 the popular small-cap index boasts a 10% gain since Jan. 1. The S&P 500, closing the session at 2798, is up 4.6%.On Friday, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey hits the wires at 10 a.m. ET.

24,LB,"L Brands (LB) said Thursday it is restructuring its Victoria's Secret business in a bid to streamline the lingerie retailer's operations and strengthen core categories.Victoria's Secret will now be divided into three segments -- Victoria's Secret Lingerie, the millennial-focused Pink and Victoria's Secret Beauty -- with the a greater focus on core merchandise and the elimination of certain categories. About 200 positions will be cut at the company's headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, and its offices in New York.L Brands shares closed down 2.3% on the stock market today.About two years ago, Victoria's Secret exited most of its clothing business and stopped selling outerwear and jeans, among other items, though it still sells swimwear, workout gear and loungewear. L Brands did not specify which categories would get the cut this time around.The company also said it will integrate the direct business as a ""primarily digital channel within the Victoria’s Secret and Pink businesses to align with how customers engage with the brands,"" and will focus more on loyalty programs vs. coupons and catalogs.""We are making these changes to accelerate our growth and to strengthen the business for the long term by narrowing our focus and simplifying our operating model,"" said Chief Executive Les Wexner in prepared remarks, adding that the changes are ""necessary for our industry-leading brands to reach their significant potential.""In March, Victoria's Secret total comps including direct sales grew 2%, a deceleration from March 2015's 6% comp growth. Store-only comps were flat vs. 9% in the prior year. Including standalone Pink locations, there are 1,164 company-owned Victoria's Secret stores in the U.S. and Canada.""Going forward, we like Victoria's Secret's fresh spring color palettes and use of textures/patterns,"" said Cowen's Oliver Chen in his Thursday note. ""We believe newness and emotional/differentiated product offerings and exceptional operations from an inventory and business management point of view could continue to deliver upside to comps.""L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works, said reported net sales for March rose 5% to $1.027 billion. Comps grew 3% for the month, above Wall Street estimates for 1.9% growth.Image provided by Shutterstock.

37,LB,"In January 2005, Larry Summers made a comment about women during a speech that was a gross generalization. It was also grossly erroneous.Now, we are talking about a highly accomplished individual. Summers served as U.S. Treasury Secretary during the Bill Clinton presidential years. He became an economics professor at age 28 and has written 150 scholarly papers. He advised President Obama on what to do about the biggest banks and the auto industry during the Wall Street subprime debt meltdown of 2008.However, Summers' comment at a National Bureau of Economic Research luncheon -- that innate differences between men and women may explain the relatively low number of women scholars in the physical sciences -- raised a lot of hoopla in academic circles and at Harvard University, where at the time Summers was serving as president. The Harvard Crimson reported that MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins ""felt physically ill"" after hearing Summers' remarks.Some believe the controversy ultimately cost Summers his job.What does this anecdote have to do with the art and science of stock investing?If you want to be a great stock picker and an equally great stock seller, then it matters practically zilch whether you are a man or woman. The market is blind to your sex.What factors matter far more?

The scholars argued that since frequent trading eats away at returns, women thus performed a full percentage point better than men.Excuse me?When it comes to mastering IBD's CAN SLIM investment system, frequent buys and sells are a part of the process. No one will perfectly pick the next Home Depot (HD) (up 1,835% from its Oct. 20, 1981, breakout to a peak in September 1983), Wal-Mart (WMT) (giant market winner from the late 1970s to 1990s), L Brands (LB) (formerly The Limited, one of the biggest stock market winners in the women's apparel industry), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Qualcomm (QCOM) or Apple (AAPL) in every single trade.In a field of 10,000 stocks trading each day, the mathematical odds are simply too low.Good trading is certainly an act of research and preparation before you buy any security. But the search for great stocks also carries a big element of trial and error.Speaking of errors, do you think the founder and chairman of Investor's Business Daily, William O'Neil, ever made bum stock trades? Of course. Not every stock O'Neil touched turned into gold. But O'Neil's greatness in the stock market came not only in the ability to find and clarify the elements of great stocks at the start of their huge price runs (what CAN SLIM is all about). As associates who have worked closely with O'Neil will tell you, he also succeeded by quickly recognizing his errors of market judgment and keeping losses in many stocks very small.Over the years, women have made strides in the field of equity research and portfolio management. You can read about their adventures on Wall Street via books such as ""Tiger Woman on Wall Street"" by Junheng Li. Meredith Whitney became famous for making a bearish call on Citigroup (C) in late 2007, saying the big bank will be forced to suspend its dividend (she was right). Whitney later left Oppenheimer as a research analyst and started a hedge fund. But in 2015, she was forced to close Kenbelle Capital LP due to poor results and an exit by its largest investor, according to a June 11, 2015, Wall Street Journal article.To be fair, innumerable men have had far more spectacular failures as fund managers. John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital Management, which included two Nobel Prize winners, blew up big time in the fall of 1998. The point: Being a woman doesn't provide you immunity from a stock market that is going the opposite direction of what you think or feel. Everyone must respect the market.""I will never give myself the luxury of thinking: I've made it,"" Zaha Hadid, the designer of the aquatics center at the 2012 London Olympics and other grand projects who died in March in Miami, once said. Although the star Iraqi-American architect wasn't likely talking about stock investing, such an attitude is valuable in the market.The stock market doesn't know who you are. It cannot know whether you're male or female. Nor will it ever care.

38,LB,"Express may not have the cachet of power brands like Nike and Under Armour, but the specialty retailer of clothing for consumers ages 20-30 thinks it has elevated its image among millennials using some of the same marketing tactics.Express (EXPR) has signed sports stars and models to serve as ""brand ambassadors,"" a variation on the promotions used by such sportswear giants as Under Armour (UA) and Nike (NKE). The effort may never become part of the public conversation like Nike's famed ""Air Jordan"" campaign featuring basketball great Michael Jordan, but it is unusual for fashion retailers to employ the move.All-Star third baseman Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs signed on in March with Express. He joins supermodel Kate Upton and Golden State Warriors basketball guard Steph Curry -- arguably the best player in the game today. Curry and Upton became brand ambassadors in 2014.""Express recognized the value of elevating a brand around ambassadors,"" Nomura Securities senior analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""The athletic companies do that very well, but generally speaking, mall-based fashion companies have not utilized that approach. Express has embraced that and is appealing to millennials.""It's just one tactic Express is using to create buzz in the hotly competitive fashion retail arena. Since taking the helm in January 2015, Chief Executive David Kornberg has implemented a number of initiatives that have vaulted the company's financial performance after some years of tough times.His efforts are bearing fruit. Express has logged four straight quarters of at least double-digit earnings growth. Now, after a strong performance in 2015, Express is expected to keep up its winning streak.Kornberg has a number of new initiatives on tap, including the launch of new planning systems expected to come online soon, an upgrade to its e-commerce experience and a continued rollout of its off-price store concept.It also is improving store productivity through individual outlet closures. Express closed 27 stores in 2015, and another 17 are set for closure in fiscal 2016. It now operates more than 650 retail and factory outlet stores in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and in Canada.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Express to see a 16% rise in earnings this year to $1.68 a share after an 79% year-over-year earnings gain in 2015. They forecast a 9% increase in 2017.But it could take some doing for Express to keep up the momentum, say analysts.""(The year) 2015 benefited from a regime change that drove some really strong improvements in the business in its first year,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Paul Alexander told IBD. ""I think they harvested a lot of low hanging fruit in 2015, but I don't see as much opportunity in 2016.""""Their goal is to continue to be lean on inventories, to continue to improve the fashion and to continue to be conservative (on the financial front),"" Alexander went on to say. ""This year, they're focused on rolling out state-of-the-art retail systems that should start paying off in 2017.""Kornberg modified the retailer's product makeup to incorporate more fashion items and bring newer fashions more often, as well as expand product categories and launch new collections, he said on the company's recent fourth-quarter conference call.It's no easy feat marketing and selling to millennials in an environment where it is competing for their business with cheap chic ""fast-fashion"" retailers like privately held Forever 21 and Sweden-based H&M.""They're definitely in direct competition for the millennial wallet with the fast-fashion guys,"" said Alexander. He says Express differs from these competitors by offering better quality merchandise and by having an assortment of clothing that covers a ""broad array of occasions,"" from casual and jeans to clothes for work.The company also put in new inventory management, speed-to-market and product testing disciplines. Express also continued to upgrade its systems and processes. And Kornberg laid out a financial plan.""Kornberg put an emphasis on consistent and steady, modest gains in both comps and margins, as opposed to swinging for home runs,"" said Alexander.Alexander sees Express growing earnings over the next few years.""But I worry if they don't get enough benefits out of implementing these new systems, competitive headwinds may weigh on EPS growth, and we will likely see the pace at which they grow earnings moderate,"" Alexander said.For now, Express is on a growth trajectory. One sign of that came during its holiday fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, when earnings jumped 37% to 67 cents a share. Sales increased 5% to $765.6 million. Same-store sales, including e-commerce sales, rose 4% from a year earlier.Total e-commerce sales increased 8% to $156.3 million. Merchandise margin grew by 180 basis points, due to carefully managed promotions and inventory levels, the company said. Its gross margin rose to 34.0% from 31.7% a year earlier.Kornberg, who had been president, added the title of chief executive when Michael Weiss retired after a longtime stint in the post. He immediately set out to make some changes where Express -- which got its start in 1980 as a division of L Brands (LB), formerly Limited Brands -- had been lacking, analysts say.""The new CEO looked at this business and wanted to build a sustainable business model, which involved (reporting) a low-single-digit comp, and on top of that, if they spent a few years updating their systems, then the low-single-digit comp would translate to low double-digit operating income growth,"" said Nomura's Siegel.""The stock is now at a crossroads,"" Siegel said. ""They had a very successful year. Now investors will find out if it was because of the strength of the business, given the right processes are now in place, or if it was simply due to a year of strong products and the right merchandise.""Siegel believes it is the former. He says investors often mistake Express for ""the old, fashion-driven"" company it was as a part of Limited.""Express has the opportunity to see both upward earnings revisions and upward multiple expansion,"" Siegel said. ""I think it is an under-appreciated story. I think the appreciation will come when people see that Express is not the Express of old.""

Morgan Stanley released its ""30 for 2019"" list, which includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Nike (NKE) and Facebook (FB), among others, as recommended picks to hold onto for the next three years.These companies are ""especially well positioned"" amid global uncertainties, said the firm.""It’s really hard to bet against quality in the long run,"" said Morgan Stanley Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Adam Parker.The investment bank’s primary criterion for its selections is ""sustainability -- of competitive advantage, business model, pricing power, cost efficiency and growth.""Here are a few highlights:The iPhone maker could more than triple its total addressable market over the next five years.""Longer term, we see the potential for streaming video service, and devices and content for new categories like virtual reality and autos,"" wrote analyst Katy Huberty.The athletic apparel and footwear giant's innovations are sales drivers, wrote analyst Jay Sole, who said that Nike has a ""significant margin opportunity"" in sales abroad, e-commerce and demand for premium product. Plus, the upcoming 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia are ""key for Nike’s momentum.""Strong brand recognition, customer loyalty, a ""growing recurring revenue base"" and a wide moat make the e-commerce heavyweight ""unique,"" said Nowak in the report.""Accelerating revenue growth, expanding (gross margins) and improving profitability leave us bullish on the core e-commerce business,"" he wrote, also calling out Amazon Web Services as driving incremental growth.Alphabet (GOOGL) should benefit from mobile and online video ad market growth through its mobile search and YouTube platforms. And the tech giant’s management is seen exercising financial discipline while continuing to seek out innovation in its ""Other Bets"" segment, said Morgan Stanley.""We see evidence of this in promising core high-growth businesses such as Google Cloud Platform and potentially (in) 'moonshots' such as Verily Life Sciences and autonomous vehicles,"" wrote analyst Brian Nowak.Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works are ""two of retail’s best brands,"" says analyst Kimberly Greenberger, adding that its growth potential abroad, long-term earnings growth outlook and ""best-in-class shareholder returns"" likely bode well for L Brands (LB). Here's the whole list:

Tesla's Model S did not receive the highest IIHS safety rating. Wednesday's loss sent shares tumbling below their 10-week line of support, tripping a sell signal and trimming its gain above a 313.83 buy point to 4%.Earnings results reported late Wednesday sent PriceSmart (PSMT) down 9% and Yum China (YUMC) 10% lower. Electrical components maker AZZ (AZZ) dived 7% after reporting a broad first-quarter miss early Thursday.China's BeiGene (BGNE) spiked 30% at the open, after announcing a strategic partnership with Celgene (CELG) to develop immuno-oncology compounds targeting solid tumors. The deal provides BeiGene with $263 million in upfront license fees and $150 million in capital investment.The gain put the thinly traded BeiGene up 160% from its February 2016 IPO price. Celgene shares opened 0.7% lower.Mazor Robotics (MZOR) bolted 7% higher after a late Wednesday update on its second-quarter revenue guidance. The company now sees revenue of $15.4 million, up from prior guidance of $12.1 million.

43,LB,"Wal-Mart (WMT) shares are rallying on an earnings beat, while four other retailers delivered better-than-expected profits. But while Wal-Mart closed at two-year highs, the other retailers had a less-positive day.Children's Place (PLCE) delivered a beat-and-raise quarter that has shares shot up initially in the stock market today, as profit grew 48% to $1.95 a share and revenue rose 4% to $436.7 million from the prior-year quarter.That easily beat consensus for $1.64 a share on sales of $422.5 million.Same-store sales rose 6.1%, which the children's clothier said was its highest Q1 comparable-sales figure ""in over a decade."" The highly watched metric is a contrast to the negative slide from department stores last week and from Target (TGT) on Wednesday.Children's Place ""continues to execute extremely well in a tough environment,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, ""with strong inventory control, expanding (average unit retail), and margin expansion.""The company upped its full-year outlook to $7.10-$7.20, up from prior guidance for $6.50-$6.65. Analysts are currently looking for $6.66 a share for 2017.Children's Place shares shot up to 124.90 soon after the open, just below Monday's record 125.30, but reversed sharply, closing down 0.45% at 111.10.Ralph Lauren (RL) beat on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings grew 1% to 89 cents a share, beating views for 78 cents; revenue fell 16% to $1.57 billion, but the slide wasn't as bad as expected. Still, Ralph Lauren, apparel retailer and clothier, reversed from early gains to finish off 1.9%.And shares of Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB) did manage to close up 2.6% after disclosing Q1 results late Wednesday that did not disappoint, even as same-store sales dropped 9%. The company nudged up full-year profit guidance to $3.10-$3.40 from $3.05-$3.35.Sporting goods retailer Hibbett (HIBB), which carries Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and other popular brands, beat on profit. Hibbett's same-store sales, however, fell 4.9% in Q1. Shares initially ran up to 24.75, but reversed to trade down 0.65% to 22.90.On the flip side, things are pretty bad for Ascena Retail Group (ASNA). The parent of women's apparel brands Ann Taylor, Loft and dressbarn, among others, is tanking in a major way, down 26.8% to 2.07 after slashing Q3 and full-year guidance. Ascena hit 17-year low of 1.65 intraday.Management now expects 10-15 cents in fiscal 2017 earnings, a fraction of its earlier guidance for 37-42 cents.

Same-store sales slid 1.3%, but that was far less than the 3.7% drop expected.Outlook: Q2 EPS of 95 cents-$1.15, with the midpoint above views for $1.00, on a same-store sales decline in the low single digits. Target did not formally revise its full-year guidance, but noted that the strong Q1 performance suggests that the retailer will top the midpoint of its prior targets.""After starting the quarter with very soft trends, we saw improvement later in the quarter, particularly in March,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. ""We are in the early stage of a multiyear effort to position Target for profitable, consistent long-term growth, and while we are confident in our plans, we are facing multiple headwinds in the current landscape. As a result, we will continue to plan our business prudently while preparing our team to chase business when we have an opportunity.""Stock: Shares rose 3.3% to 56.33 soon after the opening bell in the stock market today. The stock is not in a great place, with a Relative Strength rating of 8 (a sign of underperformance vs. the S&P 500) and a 50-day moving average that undercut the 200-day back in February. Since December, shares have only come up for air above their 50-day line for about two weeks, total. Wal-Mart shares rose 0.9%.As retail stocks suffer one devastating blow after another (even off-price chain TJX (TJX) got munched on earnings results), Target's shares have resembled those of department stores, which had a disastrous week last week, rather than big-box counterpart Wal-Mart.Target's online strategy is notably behind that of Wal-Mart, which is broadly credited as being in better shape to fight off Amazon's (AMZN) march down the retail war path.Wal-Mart has already bought Jet.com, and so far in 2017 alone, it has announced deals to buy e-commerce properties ModCloth, Shoebuy and Moosejaw.

Home goods have been ""a driver"" for the company, he said, as they have for other retailers.Off-price chain Burlington Stores (BURL), for instance, has reduced its dependency on coats for its sales in part by sprucing up its home and beauty product lines.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongWal-Mart Targets Amazon, Pulls Away From Rivals Online; Stock At 2-Year HighTarget's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will Work

48,LB,"Under Armour’s (UA) fourth-quarter same-store sales likely weren't very strong, said Morgan Stanley, partly because women may not love the brand as much as men do.Under Armour's most recently reported quarterly comps were likely flat or declined 3%, year over year, said the firm, which pointed to store-count growth outpacing direct-to-consumer growth in Q4.Shares closed down 1%, having found support at their 50-day line on Feb. 16.The company, which had 191 standalone and factory stores by the end of 2015, does not break out same-store sales for those locations. Much of its merchandise is sold through chains such as Foot Locker (FL) and Sports Authority, the latter of which just filed for bankruptcy protection.While warmer-than-expected weather, poor mall traffic and other factors could have impacted comps, analyst Jay Sole also noted a maturing brand, more women's activewear choices on the market, and the idea that some women may be put off by the brand's ""aggressive, young and fearless"" image.Plus, ""we don't think (Under Armour)'s product has been as good as it needs to be to fend off competition from Nike (NKE), Victoria's Secret, Lululemon (LULU), and others,"" he wrote, adding that women have far less brand loyalty than men. Victoria's Secret is owned by L Brands (LB).Under Armour has been making a big push for more female customers with endorsers such as dancer Misty Copeland and model Gisele Bundchen.Among other concerns highlighted in Sole's lengthy analysis are a decline in average sale prices for running footwear and the stock's high valuation.Shares of Nike fell 1%, Lululemon lost 1.6% and L Brands dipped 0.6%.Morgan Stanley's commentary comes just a day after William Blair said Under Armour lost market share with teens and young adults in 2015.Meanwhile, Adidas recently brought on former Lululemon CEO Christine Day as a strategic advisor as it looks to capture more market share among women.Adidas, once a much more dominant force in sportswear, slipped to the No. 3 spot in the U.S. in 2014 behind Under Armour. (Nike continues to sit pretty at the top of the heap.)But on Thursday, Adidas said Q4 sales grew 8% in North America -- Adidas brand sales alone grew 12% in the region -- a marked difference from the 4% North American sales decline that it logged in the year-ago Q4. Management also forecast 10%-12% in currency-neutral sales in 2016 as management sounded bullish about the brand's year ahead.It remains to be seen whether Adidas can retake its second-place spot and displace Under Armour, but activewear makers won't be able to rest in the competition for women's wallets.Speaking broadly about women's apparel in his Under Armour note, Sole said: ""Women will search each season to find the best product for them and go with it, no matter what brand it is. To have a strong and growing women's business, apparel companies have to earn it, year after year.""RELATED:Under Armour Share Loss In This Key Demographic Is ‘Disconcerting’Can Stephen Curry Be Under Armour’s Michael Jordan?Adidas Boosts Outlook, Seen Heating Up Race Vs.

52,LB,"Last week, we learned from Piper Jaffray that teens love Apple (AAPL) iPhones, Nike (NKE) and Disney (DIS) movies.This week, a Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs report reveals the fashion, retail and beauty brands that their slightly older millennial peers love. L Brands' (LB) Victoria's Secret, LVMH-owned Sephora and Nike make the top three in favorability rankings, said Bloomberg, which acquired the results.And unsurprisingly, what millennials like and what Wall Street likes doesn't always overlap. Despite the recent softness in handbag trends, all three major purse makers made the list.Rounding out the top 10 favorites list were Coach (COH), Kate Spade (KATE), Michael Kors (KORS), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Lululemon (LULU), DSW (DSW) and Nordstrom (JWN).Still, it's perhaps worrying for brick-and-mortar-based retailers that their greatest online nemesis is also climbing the ranks.IBD'S TAKE: The Conde Nast-Goldman Sachs study is but another reflection of the ongoing existential crisis faced by retailers — but the situation has created potential shorting opportunities for investors.Amazon (AMZN) topped the list as men's favorite retailer across all categories, said Bloomberg, citing the report, which also bestowed Amazon with the title of ""Most-Loved Brand"" overall.The recent Piper Jaffray teen survey showed similar results: Amazon gained ground as the No. 1 preferred shopping website among teens, reaching 43% share, said analysts.""(Amazon) Prime adoption has increased across all income brackets in each of the past six surveys,"" said Piper Jaffray analysts in last week's note.L Brands rose 1.5% on the stock market today. Nike fell 0.45%. Kate Spade lost 0.6%. Michael Kors dipped 0.1% while Coach fell 0.3%.Ulta Beauty fell 1.2% to 279.46, still above a 274.09 buy point but dipping below its 50-day moving average after undercutting that support level for the first time this year.Amazon slipped 0.5% to 899.20, just in range from an 860.96 four-weeks-tight entry.

53,LB,"It's good to see a stock pull back after a long, healthy run. After all, that gives it a chance to catch its breath and set the stage for what could be the next leg up.When you see a stock make its third pullback, dig a little deeper; the setup could be more than just an ordinary pullback. The stock may be shaping an ascending base.Unlike cups, cup with handles, double bottoms and flat bases, all of which are quite common, ascending bases are rare. They are also tougher to spot, but they can be powerful patterns.In 1999, Internet service provider America Online cleared an ascending base and nearly doubled in about five weeks. Specialty metal producer Titanium Metals bolted out from a 15-week ascending base in 2006. The stock doubled in about seven weeks.An ascending base usually forms after a stock has already broken out from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom pattern. So there should be a prior uptrend of at least 20%.One can characterize the ascending base as a pattern of a strong stock in a not-so-strong market. Each time the stock tries to rally, the weight of the overall market holds it back. Once the resistance from the general market disappears, the stock is free to make its advance — kind of like removing a brick off a heavy metal spring.The key distinguishing feature in an ascending base formation is its three pullbacks. Each one has a higher high and higher low, which gives it the overall ascending appearance.Each retreat should be due to general market weakness. And each pullback should be limited to no more than 10% to 20%.Sometimes these pullbacks will take the stock to its 10-week or 50-day moving average.Ascending bases take more time to form than other patterns. They usually develop over nine to 16 weeks. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the third pullback. Volume should be at least 40% above normal on breakout day.Retailer Limited Brands, now called L Brands (LB), cleared a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Feb. 26, 1982 (1). The stock gained 43% by late July before retreating to its 10-week moving average (2). It came out of that pullback and shot up for 10 straight weeks. After that rampage, the stock fell 13% (3) — the first of what would be three pullbacks of an ascending base.A second retreat came in January 1983. The stock fell 17% before finding support near its 10-week line (4). Limited's third pullback came in March. That set up an ascending base with a 15.29 buy point (5), which is adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split later in the year.The stock cleared that base in the week ended March 25, 1983. Limited more than doubled by July before settling into another base (6).(Editor's Note: This column originally was published in the July 15, 2010, edition of IBD.

55,LB,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

57,LB,"Tax season is upon us, and about 150 million of us are about to go through the anxiety filled exercise of filing tax returns while wondering if we made a mistake or took a deduction that we really can’t justify.I’m not one to aggressively take deductions, but I often wonder how my behavior would change if I had an IRS agent living in my spare bedroom who looked over my shoulder while I prepared my tax return. Would I act differently if I knew that my return would be audited, no matter how careful I was?And how would I feel if, in spite of doing everything by the book, it turned out that because I’m owed a refund, my tax return would consequently be subjected to a second layer of review by a team of congressional lawyers working for what’s known as the Joint Committee on Taxation?That sounds like a tax nightmare, doesn’t it? Well, this is the reality for every Fortune 500 company in America.But when you hear the outcries that U.S. companies are taking advantage of loopholes to avoid paying “their fair share” or even any taxes at all, you’d think that there were no checks on the system. You’d think that these companies are getting away with murder.The truth is, there are multiple checks on the corporate tax system, including the fact that every Fortune 500 company is under continuous audit by a team of IRS agents who are on site, five days a week, fifty-two weeks a year.The IRS has more than 5,000 agents and tax professionals in its Large Business & International (LB&I) division, which oversees public companies, S corporations and partnerships with assets greater than $10 million. About half of this division’s resources are assigned to large Fortune 500 companies who are under continuous audit.But this is not like the audit that you and I might be subject to. Large companies are required to provide office space to a team of IRS agents who are permanently on-site and who have access to the company’s accounting systems. These audits are ongoing and often take years to get a final ruling.Should a corporate taxpayer be eligible for a refund larger than $5 million, the IRS is obligated to forward that return to Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) for review. (The review threshold for estates and other taxpayers is $2 million.)As the IRS website explains, the Joint Committee on Taxation was given oversight of IRS operations due to “concerns over the potential for corruption and favoritism.”The JCT’s role is oversight, as opposed to approval or denial. However, committee staff can “recommend adjustments to the amount of the refund when the tax effect in the case is significant.”According to the JCT’s website, the IRS is not required to comply with Joint Committee staff requests for reconsideration of adjustments. But, “as a matter of agency policy, the IRS will not pay any part of a refund until the Joint Committee staff and the IRS conclude their review of the case.The conclusion of a case can be that the IRS initial position was correct, that the IRS concurs with the Joint Committee recommendation or that no change will be made because the IRS does not agree with the Joint Committee recommendation.” This process assures that any large refunds have been thoroughly vetted and are thus justified.If these two layers of scrutiny over corporate tax returns aren’t enough, there is always the backstop of Federal Tax Court, which both the IRS and taxpayers can use to adjudicate disputes over interpretations of the tax code. As in most disputes, the court has the final say in the matter.Lastly, the final check on the system is Congress itself. While many politicians complain that there are too many ways for corporations to avoid paying taxes, let’s not forget who put those “loopholes” in the tax code: Congress, not taxpayers.If lawmakers are troubled by the consequences of the laws they write, they have only themselves to blame, not the taxpayers who take advantage of those laws.As the famous Court of Appeals Judge Learned Hand wrote in a 1947 tax case, “Nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands: taxes are enforced exactions, not voluntary contributions. To demand more in the name of morals is mere cant.”Scapegoating large corporations may be a winning political strategy, but it doesn’t address the core issues. Taxpayers and the economy would be better served by a sincere effort to simplify and reform the tax code. With luck, that effort will begin in earnest in 2017, with a new president and Congress.Hodge is president of the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research organization in Washington, D.C. 
"
58,LB,"The retail industry is facing an existential crisis — and not while mired in the depths of recession, but as the economy notches its eighth year of expansion.XIn March alone, Sears Holdings (SHLD), the parent of Sears and Kmart stores, said ""substantial doubt"" exists about its survival prospects after losing more than $10 billion over six years and watching sales fall for even longer. Urban Outfitters (URBN) likened the troubled industry to a housing bubble that has popped. And Bloomberg reported that women's apparel chain Bebe Stores (BEBE) plans to close all its 168 stores and go online only. (On Wednesday, it said it will close 21 stores and explore options for the rest.)As retailers take a hard look at the future in the age of Amazon.com (AMZN), investors face a big question of their own: Are retail stocks just flat-out doomed?No analyst interviewed for this story was ready to declare the physical store dead. But retail's wounds still run deep, and there are almost certainly too many stores in the U.S. Many stocks of top chains, while not as low as during the Great Recession, are rolling over into pronounced downtrends. The weak stock action creates short-selling opportunities for investors who believe the worst for retail is yet to come.A Yardeni Research report estimated that online shopping has grown to 29.1% of retail sales of items like general merchandise, apparel and accessories, and furniture — but not autos and fuel. That's up from less than 10% in the late 1990s. Over the same period, department stores' share of sales withered to 12.6% from around 30%.Still, companies that sell things within walls, floors and ceilings still have options in a $4 trillion market.""There's no way Amazon becomes a $4 trillion e-tailer in 10 years,"" said Jeff Roster, vice president of retail strategy at IHL Group. ""That's just not going to happen.""Analysts say physical stores can still be vital in a connected, buy-anywhere, retail-everywhere world, with chains experimenting with new uses for their locations and even e-commerce companies seeing the value of in-store experiences.""There's plenty they can do,"" Roster said of retailers. ""The question is: Will they do it?""Meanwhile, the weight has accumulated on retail stocks. Take Macy's (M), which earlier had been praised for its aggressive efforts to integrate online and in-store operations. The department store's shares have lost more than half their value since July 2015. Earnings and sales have fallen for eight consecutive quarters.L Brands (LB), whose Victoria's Secret brand ought to be more insulated from e-commerce, has seen its stock halved since late 2015. The SPDR Retail ETF (XRT) has fallen some 20% over the past two years.IBD'S TAKE: Retail stocks trending below their declining 200-day moving averages offer shorting opportunities. For example, Macy's is struggling to get back in the 30s, but that would set up yet another test of the 50-day average and a possible short entry. Dillard's has stumbled this year, down as much as 25%, and just got turned away from its 50-day. See if it can hold support at 46.56.As those trends have solidified, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who prides himself on being a long-term investor, divested almost all his stake in Wal-Mart (WMT) in Q4. He told CNBC in February that ""the online thing is very hard to figure out, you know?""Amazon, Buffett said, was a company ""that's gonna have everybody in their sights. And they've got delighted customers.""""Now, Wal-Mart's pushing forward online themselves and they've got all kinds of strengths,"" he later added. ""But I just decided that I'd look for a little easier game.""For much of the past 60 years, retail was an easier game. The postwar population explosion held consumerism aloft for years, says Doug Stephens, founder and CEO of retail advisory service Retail Prophet. When baby boomers' spending slowed as they reached their 50s, growth in personal credit — spurred by financial deregulation — helped pick up the slack, or at least masked weaker trends, he says.""It allowed a lot of retailers to get away with being pretty average,"" Stephens said. ""The average American aspired to be average. They aspired to the middle-class average lifestyle, and retailers like JCPenney (JCP) and Sears and others were happy to accommodate them by selling average goods and average prices with average experiences.""Then the financial crisis and recession hit. The resulting consumer flight to either luxury or deep discounting hollowed out retail's middle-of-the-road set, he added.That has left the retail industry with too many stores, not enough shoppers, and more bankruptcies. Sports Authority was liquidated last year. Payless ShoeSource filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday and disclosed plans to close 400 stores. Markets are wondering if Sears and JCPenney are next.U.S. retail square footage per capita is more than six times that in Europe or Japan, Urban Outfitters CEO Richard Hayne said in March. Deutsche Bank in February estimated that among the retailers it follows, more than 13,100 stores will have closed during the decade ending this year. The analysis indicated that 6,400-plus locations could still be pruned from those companies' store counts.With more companies clearing out of their store space, malls can try to re-anchor their properties with grocery stores and fill in other spots with restaurants and fitness centers. The anchor stores tend to draw foot traffic, but their long stretches of square footage make those spaces hard to fill, Deutsche Bank analysts say.""Fewer retail stores should translate into a direct decline in the number of viable retail properties, including malls,"" Deutsche Bank analysts Ed Reardon and Simon Mui wrote in February. ""An enclosed mall can quickly reach a 'tipping point' where a decline in foot traffic leads to further closures and rent declines (aka the mall death spiral).""And yet the store persists, with even e-commerce companies recognizing its value. In fact, the physical store is still an efficient way to grab customers, especially as the cost of acquiring them online has gone up, Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said.Nordstrom's (JWN) Trunk Club, an e-commerce site that delivers clothing according to the wearer's tastes, has opened physical stores in recent years. Amazon has opened pop-up stores and plans to launch grocery stores.The pop-up, often backed by heavy online promotion, can also lend brick-and-mortar retailers flexibility and intrigue.""When you start to see a pop-up store by Amazon, that to me validates (the idea) that there is still a place for a brick-and-mortar, touch-and-feel type of retail experience,"" said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Commerce.Newcomers to the business, particularly in clothing, also found different ways to retail, like using real-time data and greasing their supply chains to respond more quickly to fashion trends, said Peter Dixon, who runs a number of consumer discretionary-focused funds at Fidelity, noting that it was shortsighted for some retailers to blame their problems solely on the rise of e-commerce.""Hiring star merchants to forecast fashion trends 12 months ahead of time and then commit to inventory orders nine months in advance of a season?"" he said. ""It just doesn't seem to work on a consistent basis anymore.""IBD'S TAKE: Other potential shorts include Ralph Lauren, whose stock is bumping up against its 50-day moving average. A decisive move below 75 would dump it at the lowest levels in nearly seven years. And L Brands last touched its 10-week moving average in December. Wait for an attempted rebound to that line before betting on another plunge.What may work, after retailers shrink their real-estate footprint, is a hybrid approach to stores that accommodates online orders and has more attractive floor space.Analysts say vacant stores could be used as warehouses and pickup spots for online orders. Or, in existing stores, a smaller floor space might be used to display merchandise, while a larger back area would serve the e-commerce end.Macy's and Target (TGT) are already considering such a store layout. Target has said 55% of online orders are completed at its stores, potentially strengthening the case for the strategy.Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has tried to stay digitally relevant through acquisitions. The company last year shelled out $3 billion for online discounter Jet.com. In March, Wal-Mart acquired ModCloth, which sells indie-and-retro-leaning women's apparel. Wal-Mart in February also bought online outdoor-gear retailer Moosejaw.Long-term, the ratio of apparel retailers' physical-store and online purchases could reach 50/50, Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar says. Along with a bigger focus on e-commerce, analysts stress the importance of shrinking store-counts and using the remaining stores as areas that are more ""experiential.""Several chains are trying different things along those lines, though their ability to replicate such formats on a large scale is questionable:""Specialty stores often know their customers on a personal level more closely than big-box stores do, but retailers like Target, Sears, and Wal-Mart also break up their stores into departments,"" Caporaso said over email. ""They can therefore create experiential services in those areas that target specific subsections of their customer bases.""Stephens, of the Retail Prophet, said stores could apply the pop-up approach to the way they handle in-store experiences, replenishing them several times a year to give consumers a reason to return.Such experiential offerings also speak to one of Amazon's weaknesses, especially as it picks up more merchants.""If you want a white T-shirt, and you search for a white T-shirt, you're going to get thousands of results at all different price points, and no one wants to weed through that,"" Weishaar said.She and others say that retailers that can both build out their online infrastructure and maintain a unique identity are the most likely to weather the current storm of falling sales and fleeing investors.""They'll be fine as long as they have a coolness to them,"" said Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management. ""Amazon will never be cool. It's just efficient and easy.""

62,LB,"It doesn't have an online shop. It doesn't promise luxury brands. And its fluorescent lighting and long, uninterrupted racks of merchandise aim in no way to replicate the glossy feel of a Bloomingdale's or Macy's.But Ross Stores (ROST) is widely considered a solid, if not particularly flashy, find as other retailers struggle against the Web tide, and as shoppers increasingly take their business to off-price channels.""They are so well positioned. They’re one of the best,"" Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar said of Ross, adding that the off-price industry overall has hit the ""sweet spot of pricing and distribution.""Ross is also a safe bet in this  increasingly hostile world for retailers, where online giants like Amazon (AMZN) are swallowing market share away from conventional brick-and-mortar stores by the plateful.The realities of the modern retail landscape reflect a consumer base that is increasingly drawn by Amazon's gravitational pull and the appeal of ordering things online. Last summer, Cowen had predicted that Amazon would topple Macy's (M) as America's No. 1 apparel retailer by 2017.""In 2016, we believe investors can't ignore Amazon, the growing giant in the retail world,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen said in a recent note to clients. ""We suggest buying companies who can offer an 'un-Amazon-able' brand proposition.""Ross appears to have done just that. It is included in that brief list of companies impervious to Amazon's market-share grab, along with off-price retail rival TJX (TJX), upscale furniture retailer Restoration Hardware (RH), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) and beauty-product vendors Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH) and Ulta (ULTA).The distinction is notable for this unassuming chain of off-price stores, since the rest of the retail field has been working hard to fend off the creeping advance of e-commerce.Macy's has turned each and every store into a mini-fulfillment center in order to expedite online shipping orders. Nordstrom (JWN), known for its tech spending, has set aside $1.5 billion, or 35% of its $4.3 billion five-year capital plan, for tech and supply chain investments.Even TJX has an e-commerce presence, though it remains a relatively small one. In general, selling items online isn't easy for off-pricers that have a revolving door of merchandise.""Such a potpourri is not necessarily conducive to traditional online (shops),"" said Cowen's Chen.Visitors to Ross's website won't see any online offers, and no way to peruse its inventory outside of a physical store. Could its lack of an e-commerce segment hurt the company down the road?""I don’t think it’s a big issue right now,"" said William Blair analyst Daniel Hofkin. ""Could it become a big issue over time? Sure, it could. At this time, they don’t feel it could be profitable.""An online shop would bring greater access to shoppers.""I think it merits exploration because the reality is, with the prevalent use of mobile phones, it’d be nice for them to tap into that device that everybody has,"" said Chen. But with a selection of mostly low-ticket items, ""the main issue is shipping costs.""Hofkin highlighted one benefit that TJX has seen from its online efforts; it is reaping incremental traffic from customers who stop by stores to make returns and wind up picking up a few things while they're there. That happens about 70% of the time, he said.But shoppers are likely to want to visit Ross stores in person, even stopping by brick-and-mortar locations as often as once a week, said Chen.""It’s about the treasure hunt -- that isn’t something that you can replicate online,"" he said.Ross also retains other advantages.Unseasonably warm weather late last year prompted an inventory pileup for many stores, which in turn prompted heavy discounting as cold-weather gear didn't leave shelves as quickly as hoped. Other retailers' inventory management was ""appalling"" last year and over the holiday season, said Morningstar's Weishaar.But Ross is not expected to shoulder the same burden from winter's toasty start as its department-store brethren -- in fact, weather woes for other companies can translate to cheap buys for off-pricers, which often source from overstocked suppliers.""(It can) allow (Ross) and TJX to buy some excess merchandise in the marketplace at substantially better prices, which can support future sales and margins,"" William Blair's Hofkin said via email. ""(Ross) also likely has less weather exposure, given its larger (California) and sunbelt presence.""Between 20%-25% of Ross Stores are located in California, he said.Analysts also highlight Ross's buying strategy. The company purchases a lot of ""packaway"" inventory, i.e. basics that can be bought at a low price now but then sold seasons later, regardless of what's in fashion.While high inventory levels aren't generally regarded as a positive for most retailers, Ross' 48% packaway level doesn't trouble Wall Street. Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger called it a ""strategic advantage"" and wrote in November that packaway ""typically provides (Ross) customers with the greatest value and produces the highest merchandise margin, enhancing financial returns.""How does Ross rate against its primary rival, TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods and Marshalls? Both are broadly well-regarded. Both have been outperforming their retail peers.The TJX customers, though, tend to come from from a wider range of household incomes, and they generally spend more per visit than the average Ross customer. TJX products also have higher price points. T.J. Maxx, for example, stocks a selection of high-end items more in line with what one might find at Saks Fifth Avenue, including $600 Versace watches and Fendi purses that go for a ""discounted"" price that is still nearly $3,000.Ross also is a domestic play. As of the end of its most recent quarter, the company had 1,276 Ross Dress for Less locations in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, plus 172 DD's Discounts across 15 states. Conversely, TJX operates stores in Canada, Europe and most recently Australia, with its 2015 acquisition of Trade Secret.Ross shares are up roughly 13% over the last 12 months, in stark contrast to its broader category, IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories industry group, which has fallen 16%.Ross's third-quarter earnings for the period ended Oct. 31 grew 13% to 53 cents a share, topping views by three cents. Revenue growth of 7% to $2.78 billion pulled ahead of forecasts for $2.77 billion.Management is ""solid as a rock,"" said Cowen's Chen. ""I think they have good strategies that are balanced.""What kind of speed bumps could Ross encounter in the future?Wage increases could put pressure on margins, noted several analysts. But the minimum wage hike in California -- which is now $10 an hour as of the start of 2016 -- could also help Ross, said Chen, as the lower-income shopper now has more money in his or her pocket.And deeper discounts at Macy's and other department stores could also lure in bargain hunters as competition for shoppers heats up.Ross declined to provide comment for the story. Its executives generally do not grant media interviews, said a Ross spokesperson.""There’s a certain degree of privacy because in the industry you don’t want to reveal too much to your competitors,"" said Chen, ""and because there’s competition for goods and competition for how you should change your store to capture share.""

63,LB,"Retailers likely saw sluggish January sales gains as consumers took a breather after the holidays, and as abnormally warm weather in recent months left shelves bulging with cold-weather apparel.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting sales at stores open at least a year to increase 0.3% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.Perkins said inventories appeared to be ""elevated a bit"" in January due to unseasonably warm weather throughout November and December. Traffic and conversion from storage to sales ""decelerated"" from December, which is a typical trend following the holiday selling season, he added.Considered the final month of the retail calendar, January is primarily a transitional period, Perkins noted in his report. Most retailers mark down holiday and winter merchandise to make room for early spring products in early February.""January is the least important month of the (retail) calendar fourth quarter for virtually all retailers, and (I) would not read too much into January results,"" Perkins said.Still, overall top-line growth has been tough to come by for many retailers, noted Perkins. L Brands (LB) and Costco Wholesale (COST) -- for its core U.S. comps -- are the only retailers in Perkins' index of monthly forecasts to generate January same-store sales growth greater than 2%, he added.Amazon (AMZN) and other online retailers continue to gain share from traditional mall-based chains.""While Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings and sales results disappointed investors, the leading online retailer still managed to generate 22% revenue growth, a good chunk of which is coming out of mall-based and big-box retailers,"" Perkins said. ""Fierce competition from fast fashion, off-price, discount and e-commerce is putting added pressure on revenue and earnings growth.""Analysts expect fourth-quarter same-store sales for the retail industry to rise a sluggish 0.9%, Perkins said. They estimate fourth-quarter retail industry earnings will decline 1.5% from a year earlier, he added, noting that this would be the first quarterly retail earnings decline since the first quarter of 2014.""Flat"" consumer spending in December and continued ""heavy discounting"" and promotions -- which decreases the dollar value of sales -- are among the factors impacting January same-store sales, Perkins said. And strong auto sales are likely ""crowding out"" spending at traditional retailers.Perkins said monthly reports in the Retail Metrics index have surprised on the upside in three of the last four months. But given the ""sizable miss"" posted by Rite Aid (RAD), it may be more difficult to beat expectations once again, he said. Rite Aid reported  a 1.4% decline in January same-store sales on Jan. 28, missing views for a 0.2% gain.Warehouse club giant Costco is expected to show a 0.7% increase in January same-store sales. Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, which exclude the impact of gas and foreign-exchange volatility, are seen growing a healthy 3.6%.Elsewhere, L Brands, Victoria Secret's parent and typically a strong retail performer, is expected to see a 2.5% gain in January same-store sales.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is seen showing a 3.9% decline in January same-store sales when it reports on Monday.Also, PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates Costco-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, is forecast to show a 1% increase in January comps.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) is expected to show a 1.7% increase in January same-store sales.And teen retailer Buckle (BKE) is forecast to see a 4.4% decline in January comps.

67,LB,"As Super Bowl LI takes its place in the history books — climaxing with a 34-28 victory by the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots over the feisty Atlanta Falcons, settled abruptly in overtime as the Patriots notched the biggest come-from-behind rally in the NFL championship game's annals — the Patriots and the Falcons probably were not the only teams you had a rooting interest in. Through mutual funds in which you are a shareholder, you likely had a financial stake in the annual sports and advertising extravaganza.More than 10,000 mutual funds hold shares in at least six companies that ran television ads during the game in NRG Stadium in Houston, which was expected to be watched by more than 100 million viewers. The ranks of those funds include some of the biggest names in the industry. That puts the odds in your favor that a slice of your portfolio may gain value, depending on the impact of ads during the game. The odds go up that your portfolio will be impacted when the pool of mutual funds is expanded to account for ads before and after the game as well, and game-related ads in additional media.Advertisers ranged from the very familiar such as Budweiser beer, whose parent company is Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD), and carmaker Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler (DDAIF), to lesser-known enterprise software company Wix.com (WIX).IBD'S TAKE: IBD reported Thursday that German automaker Daimler said that its fourth-quarter net profit rose 18%, but the firm offered only modest guidance for future earnings as it gets ready to spend on new models and advanced technologies such as autonomous driving.InBev shares were down 16% over the past 12 months, going into Friday. But Daimler was up 8% in that period. And Wix shares had soared 159%.Mutual funds owning a piece of advertisers in the big game included $104 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), $82.2 billion American Funds Investment Company of America (AIVSX), $40.9 billion MFS Value (MEIAX), $16.7 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), $13.1 billion JPMorgan U.S. Equity (JUEAX), $12 billion Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and $8.5 billion Hartford Capital Appreciation (ITHAX).Other funds with players in the ad contest: $7.5 billion MFS Total Return (MSFRX), $6.8 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX), $5.7 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLGX), $4.8 billion Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value (GCMAX), $4.6 billion AMG Yacktman Focused (YAFFX) and $3.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation (ALARX).Those funds are among the stock owners in six publicly traded companies that advertised on TV during the Super Bowl: Budweiser, Intel (INTC), Mercedes-Benz, Mountain Dew (PEP), Victoria's Secret (LB) and Wix.com.Intel shares are up 23% over the past 12 months. The stock has a decent 82 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.PepsiCo shares are up 6% in the past year. Performing dismally, L Brands stock is down 38% in the past year.Altogether, 10,898 mutual funds held stakes in those six companies or their corporate parents as of Dec. 31. Their positions in the six amounted to 2.49 billion shares.Mutual funds held just 1.3% of total shares in Budweiser owner Anheuser Busch InBev. Mutual funds owned 40.7% of Wix.com, an Israeli company that offers customers a web development platform.Mutual funds held 39.1% of the shares in Victoria's Secret parent L Brands, 34.8% of Intel, 31.7% of Mountain Dew parent PepsiCo and 26.6% of Mercedes driver Daimler's ADRs.Additional publicly traded TV advertisers during the game included Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAY)-owned Audi and Kia.RELATED:Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

68,LB,"Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are soaring Thursday on positive same-store sales results for the month of January, making it a standout amid lukewarm comps from other retailers.Shares soared 3.9% to 168.15 in heavy volume in the stock market today, clearing a 165.05 entry point from a cup-with-handle base.Excluding the impact of currency and gas price changes, Costco logged 5% in comp gains, the membership warehouse chain said late Wednesday. That marks the largest monthly comparable sales increase since August 2014, according to research firm Retail Metrics. Including those factors, total company comps rose 7%.Core U.S. comps grew 5%, above the firm's expectations. Hard-line items such as tires, sporting goods and hardware performed well, but so did soft-line items such as small appliances and home furnishings, according to a Retail Metrics report.Other retailers did not fare as well during the first month of 2017. L Brands (LB) reported a 4% comp decline, as its exit from swimwear and apparel weighed on sales at Victoria's Secret. Included in that total figure are a 10% comp drop at Victoria's Secret but a 12% same-store sales gain at Bath & Body Works.According to Retail Metrics, that marked the company's worst monthly comp report since November 2013.For all of Q4, ended in late January, total comps for L Brands were flat, with strength at Bath & Body Works offsetting weakness at Victoria's Secret.Shares of L Brands initially fell but rallied for a 0.8% gain.Meanwhile, among teen retailers, Zumiez (ZUMZ) comps rose 9.4%, while Buckle (BKE) comps sank 17.6% for the month.

L Brands sank 7.9%, Fossil tumbled 7.6% and Michael Kors fell 3.2%.

71,LB,"Walt Disney (DIS) on Tuesday agreed to end ""on-call"" work scheduling in its stores, along with five other retailers to settle a multistate probe of the practice.Disney stores, along with teen-oriented apparel chains Aeropostale, Pacific Sunwear and Zumiez (ZUMZ), baby clothes store Carter's Inc. (CRI) and DavidsTea (DTEA), according to the New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was one of nine AGs investigating.Retailers have increasingly relied on last-minute scheduling to make sure they have enough staff, sometimes offering as little as an hour's notice. Computer technologies has made always on-call practices easier to employ. But while burdensome for teens, it can be extremely difficult for adults with children. And it makes it harder for workers to have a second job. Given that many low-wage businesses that tend to use on-call scheduling are restricting hours to avoid ObamaCare mandates and other regulations, workers may have set aside a huge amount of hours to come close to full-time work.""People should not have to keep the day open, arrange for child care, and give up other opportunities without being compensated for their time,"" Schneiderman said in a statement.The six retailers join several other, mostly youth-oriented chains, who agreed to similar steps in 2015 as part of the same probe. They include Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Gap (GPS), J. Crew Group (JCG), Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB), Pier 1 Imports (PIR) and Urban Outfitters (URBN).Disney, Carter's DavidsTea and Zumiez also agreed to provide at least one week of notice in their scheduling. Aeropostale and PacSun, which are both in bankruptcy protection, did not.

72,LB,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

Penney and Kohl's shares falling despite beating consensus views.An October retail sales data miss — a worse-than-expected 0.1% gain — didn't help either, though Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce sellers notably logged a 7.1% rise from the previous year as consumers continue to do much of their shopping online. Cowen & Co. predicted in July that Amazon would knock out Macy's as the top U.S. apparel retailer by 2017.Even much-lauded off-pricers haven't been immune to the pummeling that retail stocks were subjected to over the past week. Shares of TJX (TJX), the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, lost 12% over the past week.In a possible sign of things to come, Q3 same-store sales at Nordstrom's off-price arm, Nordstrom Rack, fell 2.2%.""This type of miss from Rack is surprising to us, and we acknowledge the Rack's off-price slowdown could be a negative indicator for TJX,"" wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Friday.But he added that TJX, which reports Tuesday, could ""offset some secular weakness"" based on a few factors, including the strength of the company's sourcing and buying teams, home goods offerings and international reach.The company is expected to report a slight earnings dip of 1% to 84 cents a share. That would mark the third straight quarter of earnings deceleration and a swing from earnings gains of 7%, 8% and 15% in the three preceding periods.Revenue is seen rising 5% to $7.73 million, which also would reflect a slowdown.With a 75 IBD Composite Rating, TJX is the highest ranking member of IBD's Retail-Apparel/Shoes/Accessories group, which ranks a feeble 144 out of 197 groups.Peers in the group include Ross Stores, Foot Locker (FL), L Brands (LB) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO).Fellow off-pricer Ross Stores (ROST) gapped down ahead of its Thursday earnings release, losing 11% for the week. Analysts expect over 6% EPS growth to 50 cents on 6% sales growth to $2.77 billion.And what about the big-box retailers?Target's (TGT) earnings are seen accelerating, with a predicted 59% climb to 86 cents a share on a 1% revenue dip to $17.57 billion. Shares retreated 6.9% last week.And Wall Street expects Wal-Mart (WMT) earnings to slide 15% to 98 cents a share on a 1% revenue decline to $117.79 billion. Shares slid 4%.""We believe retail is in a state of transition as brands wrestle with how to compete against growing & dynamic pureplay online retailers,"" wrote Chen.RELATED:Retail Sales Weak, Except For Amazon, EcommerceMacy's Stock Selloff Could Be Tip Of Iceberg4 Reasons TJX, Off-Price Retailers Will Keep Surging.

"
99,LB,"Retailers likely suffered sluggish September sales, as unseasonably warm weather cooled spending on fall apparel, and a volatile stock market made consumers more cautious in their buying.As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting September sales at stores open at least a year to slip 0.2% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.If retailers turn in a drop in same-store-sales for September, it would mark the second straight monthly decline and third in the last six months, Perkins noted. August same-store sales fell 1% from a year earlier.The forecast for a weak September showing suggests only a so-so finish to the back-to-school shopping season, which ran from late July to mid-September.""(Back-to-school) spending appeared uneven and skewed to necessities,"" Perkins said.Costco Wholesale (COST), which is expected to report results late Wednesday, is forecast to post a 1% decline in September same-store sales. If correct, it would be the second such drop in a row for the giant warehouse-club operator, and third in the last four months, Perkins noted. But Costco's core September U.S. same-store sales, excluding gas and foreign-exchange effects, are expected to be a much healthier 5.2% gain.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) is estimated to lead the pack with a 4.1% rise in September same-store sales.Last Thursday, drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) posted a 1.5% increase in September same-store sales, below views for a 1.9% rise.PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates Costco-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, said early Wednesday it saw a 3.2% gain in September same-store sales, ahead of views for a 2.8% increase.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is expected to see a 1.6% decline in September same-store sales.Regional discount chain operator Stein Mart (SMRT) is forecast to show a 0.7% decline in September same-store sales.Teen apparel retailer Buckle (BKE) is expected to report the month's same-store sales slipped 2.5%.

"
106,LB,"The final tally for the month will be released Thursday.Why such a soft forecast?""July auto sales were quite robust,"" Perkins told IBD. ""That, in my estimation, is pulling money away from traditional retailers.""The weather was particularly hot across the country in July, he adds, which likely kept shoppers out of the malls as they headed to the beach and other outdoor venues.Another key factor leading to the softness is that consumers aren't seeing wage gains and are ""cautious with their spending,"" Perkins says.Perkins says the projected soft showing for the month suggests that the back-to-school shopping season is ""going to be a difficult one for most retailers.""The back-to-school shopping season started in late July and runs through mid-September.Costco Wholesale (COST) is projected to see an 0.2% decline in July same-store sales. But its core U.S. same-store sales are expected to lead the pack with a healthy 5.7% increase from a year earlier, excluding gasoline and foreign exchange drags.Regional discount chain Stein Mart (SMRT)is also forecast to outpace most of the group with a 3.5% increase in July same-store sales.Major apparel retailer Gap (GPS) is expected to see a 2.7% decline in July same-store sales. But its Old Navy brand is seen posting a 4.1% gain.Victoria's Secret parent L Brands (LB) is estimated to show a 1.9% rise in July same-store sales.Last Thursday, drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) posted a 2.4% increase in July same-store sales, in line with estimates.PriceSmart (PSMT), which owns and operates U.S.-style membership shopping warehouses in Latin America and the Caribbean, is expected to see a 3.3% gain.

109,LB,"Dads, grads and America's 239th birthday weren't enough for June to bloom, as retailers had another so-so month with consumers finding other outlets for pocket change.The numbers indicate that consumers are shifting their spending away from traditional retail shops and in favor of shelling out for technology such as smartphones and tablets by Apple (AAPL), Samsung and other makers, as well as dining, entertainment and car purchases.June same-store sales missed forecasts, coming in down 0.2% from a year ago, after a 0.6% year-over-year gain in May and a 0.9% decline in April, according to a tally of 11 chains by The Retail Economist, a Tucson, Ariz.-based economic forecasting firm. Michael Niemira, chief economist there, had in May forecast that June same-store sales would likely rise in the range of 1% to 2%.June's A WallflowerTypically, June acts as a lull between Mother's Day shopping in May and when back-to-school sales ramp up in late July and early August. ""June is sort of a transitionary month,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, who called the numbers ""lackluster.""Warm weather and a falling unemployment rate haven't been enough to muster consistent growth in the retailers still providing monthly sales statistics.""The long-term impact that the Great Recession has had has definitely tempered spending,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Wage increases have been very small during the recovery. The retailers are still waiting for the consumer to show up.""One of those retailers, Costco (COST), was hurt by the strong dollar and fallen gasoline prices as its overall June showing of a 1% decline missed the consensus of a 0.1% decline. It was Costco's sixth miss during the past seven months.Gasoline prices have rebounded to a degree since last year's 50% collapse in crude oil prices, but they're still below where prices were a year earlier. Excluding gasoline, the Issaquah, Wash.-based warehouse club notched a 6% gain, ahead of views forecasting a 5.2% gain, indicating Costco's underlying domestic business is strong.Gap's (GPS) same-store sales fell a worse-than-expected 1% in June. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.7%. June sales at its Old Navy unit grew a disappointing 1%, less than the 2.3% consensus. Banana Republic did better than expected, growing sales 1%, vs. the 0.2% decline forecast. Gap's namesake clothing stores saw a 5% year-over-year fall in same-store sales, worse than the 3.9% drop that was predicted.L Brands (LB), the parent company of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works, notched a 3% gain compared with a year ago, but just missed views of 3.1%.The clothing on its models wasn't the only scant adornment at Victoria's Secret. Its sales growth was skimpy, notching a 1% gain in June, below a forecast for 3.2%. Bath & Body Works was the stronger performer of the two L Brands units, posting a 6% gain, beating views calling for a 3.8% increase in sales.""Young consumers more interested in what kind of smartphone they have instead of what they're wearing,"" Perkins said.Stein Mart (SMRT), a Jacksonville, Fla.-based discount retailer, was the strongest performer in the Retail Metrics index, posting a 5.8% gain compared with June 2014, doubling estimates of 2.9%.""Overall, we've seen a little bit of sluggishness since the beginning of the year; that's mirrored the broader sluggishness we've seen in the economy,"" said Niemira.Teen clothing retailer Buckle (BKE) edged a 0.5% gain, beating estimates calling for a 1.1% decline.Drugstore chain operator Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), highly rated by IBD, jumped more than 4% in the stock market Thursday after an upbeat quarterly report. It noted domestic comparable-store sales growth of 1.6% for the quarter ended in May.Drugstore operator Rite Aid (RAD) saw a 2.4% increase in June same-store sales, missing views of 2.9%. The Camp Hill, Pa.-based company's sales were powered primarily by its pharmacy unit, which grew by 3.4%, just missing the consensus of 3.5%. Rite Aid's front-end sales rose 0.3% from a year earlier, falling short of forecasts of a 1.8% gain.Specialty clothier Zumiez (ZUMZ) had a 3.3% decline in sales, performing worse than the 3.2% drop that analysts expected.Cato (CATO), a Charlotte, N.C.-based women's fashion retailer, posted no gain in June sales, better than the 1% decline forecast.Fred's (FRED), a discount retailer based in Memphis, Tenn., fell short of views, posting a 1.6% year-over-year gain; analysts expected 1.9%.San Diego-based warehouse club PriceSmart (PSMT) turned in a 4% gain in June comparable sales, beating the forecast for 3%. Its quarterly report after the bell Thursday fell short of expectations, though, and the stock slipped after hours.Home ImprovementsDespite retail being flat for June, consumers have opened their wallets in other areas, such as home improvement. Firms such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) announced in May they had strong Q1 sales.The impact of lower gasoline prices — a problem for Costco's revenue — is being felt as a positive effect in other areas of the U.S. economy, Niemira told IBD.""Anything house-related seems to have picked up,"" he said.

177,LB,"Retailers hit a rough patch in March as severe winter weather, an economic speed bump and merchandise delays resulting from the West Coast port disruptions dragged down results, leading to the month's sales gains falling below views.
"
178,LB,"Even amid the headwinds, L Brands (LB), Stein Mart (SMRT), Cato Corp. (CATO) and PriceSmart (PSMT) came shining through with same-store sales that sailed past views, according to data out Thursday.
"
179,LB,"March sales at stores open at least a year rose 0.5% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics. Analysts expected a 1% gain.
"
180,LB,"The results were weighed down by a big miss from warehouse club giant Costco Wholesale (COST), Perkins says. The company saw March same-store sales slide 2% from a year earlier, short of views for a 0.3% decline.
"
181,LB,"That was the typical top retail performer's first decline in monthly same-store sales since August 2009, Perkins says.
"
182,LB,"Fuel And The Freeze
"
183,LB,"Costco's core U.S. same-store sales, ex gas and the effects of foreign exchange rates, were up a ""much healthier"" 4%, said Perkins. Still, they were below views for a 5.5% gain.
"
184,LB,"""Costco was a huge drag on the month,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Part of that was attributable to them having lower year-over-year gas prices, and foreign currency translations also weighed on their sales.""
"
185,LB,"The month's results were a mixed bag.
"
186,LB,"Harsh winter weather conditions in parts of the U.S. such as the Northeast ""weighed on sales"" in those areas, said Perkins.
"
187,LB,"Consumers weren't in the mood to buy seasonal goods like patio furniture and bathing suits or apparel when they were ""freezing,"" he said.
"
188,LB,"But Jacksonville, Fla.-based Stein Mart and Charlotte, N.C.-based Cato, located in the South, where the weather was better, posted double-digit gains in March same-store sales, he adds.
"
189,LB,"""Weather clearly played a big role overall (on the March results), both positive and negative,"" Perkins said.
"
190,LB,"Another factor weighing on March sales was a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, he adds. Perkins notes retailers also missed sales opportunities because of delays from late shipments due to the West Coast labor dispute.
"
191,LB,"""Overall I would not read too much into the March numbers,"" Perkins said. ""The jobs market stands on pretty solid footing, and with warmer temperatures I would expect May, June and July sales to show significant improvement from the first quarter.""
"
192,LB,"April Outlook
"
193,LB,"This month is apt to be weak, Perkins says, mainly because the early Easter this year, on April 5, pushed holiday-related sales into March.
"
194,LB,"The month's standouts are L Brands (which owns Victoria's Secret), value-priced apparel seller Cato and regional discount retail operator Stein Mart.
"
195,LB,"L Brands posted a 9% increase in same-store sales for March, topping views for a 5.8% gain. The company's same-store sales for the month ""were positively impacted"" by the earlier Easter this year by about 3% to 4%, it said in a press release.
"
196,LB,"Cato saw a 12% rise in the month's sales, sailing past estimates for a 3.8% gain. Cato also got a lift from the early Easter shift, the company said in a press release. But it expects April sales will be ""unfavorably impacted"" by the shift.

211,LB,"But overall, retailers should see better days, Perkins says.
"
212,LB,"""I don't think you can extrapolate where the consumer stands from the March results and the related speed bumps (during the month),"" said Perkins. ""Consumer confidence is near the cycle high, gas prices remain low, interest rates remain low and the labor market is on solid footing. I think those factors should bode well for better economic growth in the second and third quarters, which should lead to better retail sales.""
"
213,LB,"Still, he cautions that the vast majority of lower- and midincome consumers are not really seeing rising pay.
"
214,LB,"""The ability for consumers to spend is still tied to significant wage gains, which haven't materialized,"" he said.

216,LB,"And they're buying a lot of cars. Perkins says the auto segment is doing better than other retail segments. That bodes well for auto parts retailers such as O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP).
"

"
218,LB,"Niemira, looking toward the summer, expects apparel will be one of the stronger retail categories, driven by ""pent-up demand.""

Buckingham Research, citing weaker-than-expected trading revenues, gave the New York-based investment bank a ""neutral"" rating amid ""significant uncertainty around the recovery in (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading, to which (Goldman) has much greater exposure than (its) peers.""Morgan Stanley, the other big investment bank that reports Jan. 20, is expected to see a 2-cent year-to-year EPS decline to 48 cents for Q4, while its revenue is expected to have dropped 1.5% to $8.08 billion.Continued strength in mergers and acquisitions ""could mitigate declines in equity and debt underwriting,"" wrote Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, in a Tuesday note.

"
472,LB,"Retailers posted soft February sales gains Thursday as frigid temperatures in many parts of the U.S. kept consumers out of the malls, but business picked up during the month's second half — an encouraging sign given the harsh-weather head winds.
"
473,LB,"February sales at stores open at least a year were up 2.7% — in line with analysts' forecasts — for those retailers that have reported so far, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
474,LB,"The tally excludes results from apparel giant Gap (GPS), which reports after the close. Using analysts' estimates for a 1.1% rise in Gap's February comps, total same-store sales would be up 2.6%, Perkins said. The soft February follows a 3.3% comp gain in January.
"
475,LB,"February comp gains were a much weaker 1.7% when factoring out results from drugstore chains Walgreen (WAG) and Rite Aid (RAD), he noted.
"
476,LB,"""The results were largely in line,"" Perkins said. ""With the adverse weather conditions, they could have been worse than we expected. Business looked to have picked up around Valentine's Day and the back half of the month wasn't as weak as it could have been.""
"
477,LB,"Still, sales in general were soft against easy comparisons last year when comps rose 2%, he added.
"
478,LB,"Overall, results were mixed with no standouts other than Walgreen, which reported a same-store sales gain of 4.5% Wednesday, ahead of views for a 3.4% rise.
"
479,LB,"But there were a few surprises on the upside. In the struggling teen space, action sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ) posted a better-than expected 2% rise in February same-store sales, rebounding from its disappointing 7.6% drop in January. Analysts had forecast a 0.4% gain for last month.

"
485,LB,"Mother Nature wreaked havoc on retailers in January as frigid temperatures in much of the U.S. kept mall traffic weak and dampened spending, leading to sluggish sales reports for most chains Thursday even as they touted aggressive discounts.
"
486,LB,"But overall sales still came in ahead of the forecasts, led by a strong showing from Costco Wholesale (COST) and L Brands (LB).
"
487,LB,"Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.3% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
488,LB,"Analysts had predicted a modest 2.2% increase. ""The month was not as bad as feared,"" said Perkins. ""But it was still a sluggish month for most retailers.""
"
489,LB,"Retailers faced a number of head winds in January.
"
490,LB,"""Retailers were very promotional for the month and mall traffic was very sluggish,"" said Perkins. ""Weather was a major factor for many in the Midwest and Northeast.""
"
491,LB,"The cold weather, he adds, led to a very ""slow start"" to the early spring selling season, with many consumers ""cooped up"" and not shopping.
"
492,LB,"Another head wind was ""negligible"" personal income gains for mid- and lower-income consumers, which kept a ""lid on spending,"" Perkins said. Also, there was a ""dearth"" of fashion during the month.
"
493,LB,"Michael Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, also calculates January same-store sales rose 3.3% vs. a year earlier, which he calls a ""moderate"" showing.
"
494,LB,"Weather Dampens Demand
"
495,LB,"Overall, the month was ""OK"" and a repeat of December's showing of a 3.4% comps rise, he said.
"
496,LB,"""It's overwhelmingly a weather story on top of a low-volume month,"" said Niemira. ""Therefore, I don't read too much into the numbers for the long haul. It certainly had an impact on the month and the quarter. But it doesn't mean there's a fundamental weakness.""
"
497,LB,"As the months go by there's often a ""bigger rebound from the exceedingly weak demand we're seeing because of the weather,"" he added. ""We may have to wait until March, but as long as the economy continues to perform well, which is our expectation, I would tend to look beyond the weather.""
"
498,LB,"There were some bright spots during the month. Upside surprises from warehouse club giant Costco, Victoria's Secret's parent L Brands, and drugstore chains Walgreen (WAG) and Rite Aid (RAD) accounted for much of the beat, Perkins says.
"
499,LB,"Also on the bright side, giant apparel retailer Gap (GPS) posted January comps well ahead of views.
"
500,LB,"Costco came in with a solid 4% comp for the total company, ahead of forecasts for a 3.4% gain. Its U.S. same-store sales, excluding the negative impact of gasoline prices, climbed 5%.
"
501,LB,"L Brands posted a 9% rise in comps vs. a year earlier, sailing past forecasts for a 0.5% gain.
"
502,LB,"L Brands had to discount ""quite a bit"" during the month, as did most apparel retailers, said Perkins. But, he adds, it still came in with a strong comp gain even as it faced a tough comparison with last January's 9% increase in same-store sales.
"
503,LB,"""That's impressive, even though they had to take markdowns,"" said Perkins.
"
504,LB,"L Brands also raised Q4 earnings guidance, ""something virtually no retailers have done this quarter,"" Perkins said.
"
505,LB,"Gap Guides Up
"
506,LB,"Gap posted a 1% increase in January same-store sales late Thursday, smashing views for a 1.1% decline.
"
507,LB,"Gap also announced Q4 earnings guidance in the range of 65 cents to 66 cents a share. That would represent full-year fiscal 2013 earnings growth in the mid- to high teens, on top of a 49% full-year earnings increase in fiscal 2012.
"
508,LB,"But outside of L Brands and Gap, the rest of the apparel-related space came in below views.
"
509,LB,"Even regional discounter Stein Mart (SMRT), which had been a ""pretty strong"" performer of late, disappointed with a -0.7% decline vs. forecasts for a 1.3% gain, Perkins says.
"
510,LB,"In the struggling teen space, action sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ) posted a 7.6% decline, missing views for a 3.3% drop.
"
511,LB,"Niemira says that based on the data out Thursday, consumer spending continues to be ""very cautious."" And the sales pace remained ""uneven"" by some of the major segments.
"
512,LB,"""Different retailers are performing well and some are struggling,"" Niemira said. ""By and large it's a moderate kind of environment for sales gains. Until we get something that forces us to break out of that pattern we will get a moderate improvement in retail sales.""
"
513,LB,"Now, he adds, it's a ""market-share game, where those that are doing well are doing it at the expense of others."" He sees February same-store sales increasing between 3% and 3.5%, depending on weather conditions.
"
514,LB,"What Will Spring Bring?
"
515,LB,"Perkins expects the spring selling season is going to be difficult for many retailers.
"
516,LB,"""Improved fashion should help,"" he said. ""But slow economic growth and no wage growth will prevent many retailers from seeing significant sales gains. And this should result in a continued promotional environment for retailers with continued pressure on margins.""
"
517,LB,"Wall Street is looking for Q4 earnings to fall 4.4%, which would be the worst performance since 2009, Perkins says. Q4 same-store sales growth is expected to rise just 0.5%.
"
518,LB,"But analysts see earnings for Q1, which typically runs from February through April, to be up 11.8% from a year earlier, says Perkins.
"
519,LB,"That's due in part to relatively easy comparisons with Q1 2013, says Perkins, when earnings were up only 4.5%.
"
520,LB,"Also, he adds, ""there's a significant amount of optimism for a rebound"" in earnings for department stores in particular, which saw a 44% drop in earnings growth in 2013.
"
521,LB,"Economic Outlook
"
522,LB,"Separately, the National Retail Federation released an upbeat 2014 economic forecast Thursday. The industry trade group forecasts retail industry sales (which exclude automobiles, gas stations, and restaurants) will increase 4.1%, up from the preliminary 3.7% growth seen in 2013. It also announced Thursday it expects online sales in 2014 to grow between 9% and 12%.

523,LB,"""Measured improvements in economic growth combined with positive expectations for continued consumer spending will put the retail industry in a relatively good place in 2014,"" said CEO Matthew Shay in a statement.

"
524,LB,"The NRF predicts economic growth will be above its long-term historical average. Early estimates for real GDP growth could fall between 2.6% and 3%, ""a noticeable improvement from the estimated 1.9% rate for 2013 and the fastest pace in the past three years.""
"
525,LB,"It forecasts a continued modest recovery in the labor market, averaging approximately 185,000 jobs per month, helping decrease unemployment to near 6.5% or lower by the end of 2014.

Combined November-December holiday same-store sales for those reporting were up 2.9% vs. a year earlier, Perkins says.Wall Street is looking for Q4 earnings to fall 4.4%, which would be the worst performance since 2009, Perkins says. Q4 same-store sales growth is expected to be up just 0.5%.

545,LB,"Retailers likely kicked off the year with soft January sales gains as frigid temperatures in many parts of the U.S. and a lack of fashion newness kept mall traffic weak and dampened early spring selling despite aggressive clearance sales. As of Wednesday, analysts were expecting January sales at stores open at least a year to rise 2.2% vs. a year…
"
546,LB,"Retailers rang up sluggish sales gains in February as a harsh winter blast in many parts of America kept mall traffic weak and spending soft, though business rallied some in the second half of the month.
"
547,LB,"February sales at stores open at least a year were up 2.1% vs. a year earlier, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
548,LB,"However, February comps were much weaker — at just a 0.7% rise — when factoring out results from drugstore chains.
"
549,LB,"The soft February results followed a 3.3% comp gain in January.

"
552,LB,"Winter Blues

"
554,LB,"""It's hard to find another drag on the results other than the weather,"" Niemira said. ""The broader economy has been affected by the adverse weather, and that certainly has affected the composition of spending toward more energy use.""
"
555,LB,"But the impact won't last long, he said: ""Once the weather turns more seasonal and the spring weather arrives, you will start to see a much improved retail environment.""
"
556,LB,"While weather was the main head wind in February, other factors have been weighing on the retail industry.
"
557,LB,"For one thing, consumer spending has ""generally been sluggish,"" Perkins said, with more going more into entertainment and big-ticket items as well as online sales.
"
558,LB,"""And price competition has been fierce,"" he added. ""These are all the factors that have weighed on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers as they transition into having more omnichannel operations.""
"
559,LB,"Still, Perkins says, investors are likely to overlook the soft February same-store sales with expectations of a pickup in March.
"
560,LB,"He points to improving chains such as specialty apparel retailer Cato Corp. (CATO) and giant department store operator Macy's (M). Both said they saw a turnaround in business around Valentine's Day and the second half of February.

"
564,LB,"A few other surprises popped up. In the struggling teen space, action sports retailer Zumiez (ZUMZ) saw a better-than-expected 2% rise in February same-store sales, rebounding from its disappointing 7.6% drop in January.

"
579,LB,"With a late April 20 Easter holiday this year, that could ""make for a much more buoyant month in April,"" Niemira said.
"
580,LB,"He forecasts March same-store sales will rise by around 3% vs. a year earlier.
"
581,LB,"Comps face a tough comparison with March 2013, when retailers benefited from an early Easter on March 31.

626,LB,"Although Wall Street had the best start to 2018 in more than three decades, things turned bitter to end the first quarter, with many sectors and stocks entering correction territory from their latest peak. With a day’s trading left, the S&P 500 is down 2.6% and on track for the worst quarter in two and a half years.A combination of factors like concerns over faster-than-expected rates hike, trade tensions, and the health of the technology sector pushed the Wall Street from deep green to red.Rate Hike FearsThe first round of brutal trading came in early February following the better-than-expected wage growth, sending major indices into correction territory. At the lower levels, the S&P 500 shed about $2.5 trillion in its value from Jan 26. Then, the Fed minutes and the new Fed chairperson Jerome Powell took away some sheen from the riskier assets.Trump TariffAgain in early March, Trump’s tariff news spooked markets, sparking threats of a trade war. President Trump imposed severe tariffs of 24% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports that could lead to retaliation from other countries thereby resulting in unforeseen consequences. Although this fear faded with Trump and other countries starting negotiations, the President’s intention to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeting the technology and telecommunications sectors, led to bloodbath in the stock markets yet again.Tech RoutThen the panic was created by the social media giant Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) following the data breach report, which sparked concerns about data privacy and security, resulting in increased scrutiny and possible regulatory pressure. The news has taken a toll not only the broader technology sector but the broad U.S. market as well. This was followed by a slew of negative news that again has sent the sector into a tailspin this week, with FANG stocks being the biggest losers.In particular, the most recent tech rout has washed away about $2.34 trillion from the market cap of the S&P 500 since its peak in late January. This means that almost one-third of the Trump rally was erased during the current market pullback.The stock market had added $6.9 trillion in market cap at the peak since Trump was elected. The FAAMG stocks — Facebook, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — were the largest contributors. Though these stocks do not shed larger in terms of percentage, the pullback in Facebook and Alphabet took out a combined $230 billion of market cap from the S&P 500 in the last two months. Both stocks were down 13.3% and 4.6%, respectively.That said, a number of stocks have crushed, piling up heavy losses during this time frame. Below, we have highlighted five such stocks from the S&P 500 index that have been hit badly in the market turmoil and might continue their rough trading in the months ahead if similar trends persist.Patterson Companies Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) – Down 38.3%The company distributes and sells dental and animal health products in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of 37 cents for the year (ending April 2018) during the quarter and is expected to generate earnings decline of 27.78%. PDCO has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a VGM Score of C. It belongs to the bottom-ranked Zacks industry (bottom 14%).L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) – Down 37.4%This company operates as a retailer of women's intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products and accessories primarily in the United States.

627,LB,"Volatility has been dominating Wall Street over the past couple of weeks. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones saw second consecutive weeks of loss, with the Dow suffering its largest percentage decline in two weeks since mid-September 2016. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index witnessed the fourth week of losses, marking the longest weekly losing streak since May 2016 (read: 4 ETF Ways to Hedge Against Volatility).The Washington turmoil, a terrorist attack in Barcelona and rumors over the resignation of President Donald Trump's Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn led to investors’ pessimism, sparking off risk aversion. Investors losing faith over Trump’s ability to deliver business-friendly policies following the abandon of his plans to form an infrastructure advisory council to implement his keystone $1-trillion infrastructure spending plan took a toll on the stock market last week.Further, lingering tensions over North Korea and a slew of disappointing earnings reports added to the woes. In particular, Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) tumbled nearly 30% following weaker-than-expected earnings while Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) dropped 1.6% despite earnings and revenue beat.Both, network equipment maker Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and data storage company NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report) issued weak sales forecasts for the current quarter while L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) cut its annual profit forecast on weakening sales that led to a decline in their share price following their reports (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus on Wal-Mart Earnings Beat).The feeble domestic backdrop coupled with a weak dollar has given an edge to international and commodity investing. As such, we have highlighted five top-performing ETFs of last week. Any of these could be strong momentum plays for investors should uncertainty prevail this week.iPath Pure Beta Aluminum ETN This note provides exposure to the Barclays Aluminum Pure Beta TR Index, which reflects returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in the futures contracts in the aluminum markets.

The ETN has accumulated just $0.9 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry average daily volume of about 1,000 shares. It charges 75 bps in annual fees and gained 9.6% last week. FOIL has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook.Columbia India Small Cap ETF (SCIN  -  Free Report)SCIN targets the small cap segment of the Indian stock market. It tracks the Indxx India Small Cap Index and holds 75 securities in its basket with none making up for more than 3.9% of assets.

The index may roll into one of a number of futures contracts with varying expiration dates, as selected using the Barclays Pure Beta Series 2 Methodology. NINI has AUM of $1.3 million while trades in a paltry volume of more than 1,000 shares. It charges 75 bps in annual fees and gained 5.9% last week. However, the note has an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) with a High risk outlook.VanEck Vectors China SME-ChiNext ETF (CNXT  -  Free Report)This fund offers exposure to the largest and most-liquid China A-share stocks listed and trading on the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Board and the ChiNext Board of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange by tracking the SME-ChiNext 100 index.

628,LB,"Shares of Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) jumped 10.67% in trading on Friday, closing at $59.02 per share, after reporting better-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results.Ross reported earnings of $0.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76. Earnings grew 15.49% year-over-year. The company also reported revenue of $3.431 billion, surpassing our estimate of $3.370 billion and growing 7.88% year-over-year.The company also stated that comparable store sales rose 4%. Ross Stores expects to earn between $0.64 and $0.67 per share during the third quarter.This positive earnings report comes in sharp contrast to falling retail stocks resulting from poor earnings and sales this week. Today, Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) fell 28% after missing analyst expectations, dragging other athletic retailers along with it. L Brands (LB  -  Free Report), the owner of Victoria’s Secret, also tumbled on Wednesday after reporting disappointing sales and a weak outlook for the third quarter.Ross owes its success partially to its strategy of being an off-price retailer. The company offers designer and brand name products at deeply discounted rates. This has attracted consumers to its 1,340 U.S. stores, allowing Ross to succeed despite e-commerce retailer threats, like from Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report).TJX Companies Inc (TJX  -  Free Report), which owns T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, and the popular HomeGoods, also reported second quarter earnings this week that beat our estimates. The success of both these off-price companies demonstrates that department stores like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) aren't doing well just because of online competition, but because consumers want quality products at low prices.ROST remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a VGM score of ‘A.’Want to learn more about retail?

629,LB,"L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) has been witnessing a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate after the company updated fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 guidance. Shares of this specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products, home fragrance products and accessories has declined 13.3% in a month, underperforming the industry’s growth of 1.9%.Management projects earnings in the band of $3.05-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017, which is well below fiscal 2016 and 2015 earnings of $3.74 and $3.99, respectively. Moreover, the company now expects earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be nearly $2, in comparison with previous guided range of $1.95-$2.10. Analysts polled by Zacks are now less constructive on the stock. This is evident from the movement witnessed in the Zacks Consensus Estimate that declined 0.5% and 0.3% to $2.02 and $3.12, respectively, in the past 30 days.Further, declining bottom-line and shrinking gross margin remain major concerns. Management anticipates gross margin to deteriorate year over year during the fourth quarter as well as fiscal 2017.Turnaround Strategy Bode WellHowever, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. We believe these measures facilitate it to generate incremental sales and increase store transactions through higher conversion rate. The company is repositioning its La Senza brand by focusing on the younger generation and providing fashionable assortments at a reasonable price. Moreover, to drive growth, the company remains focused on adding the entire PINK and lingerie assortments at its Victoria’s Secret stores and seeks to expand in the adjacent categories. In an effort to streamline Victoria’s Secret business, the company made some strategic changes in 2016. L Brands stated that the strategic efforts will continue in 2017, which is likely to put pressure on the results. However, it is confident of achieving growth in the long run and anticipates annual operating income to increase by 10%.Further, the company’s foray into international markets is likely to provide long-term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes.Hot Stocks in the Retail Space Worth Checking OutInvestors interested in the retail space may consider better-ranked stocks such as American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.

(ADP  -  Free Report). This was also quite better than November’s revised number of 185,000.Coming to earnings, the exact earnings impact of the tax legislation will become clear once it is signed into law, but preliminary estimates suggest a material earnings boost. S&P 500 earnings in 2018 are already expected to be up 11.7%, with the growth pace expected to roughly double as a result of the tax legislation.

While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.We believe that the hike in annual membership fees and increased penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program will benefit the stock.

633,LB,"Shares of L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) are riding high on its efforts to streamline Victoria’s Secret business, revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. In the past three months, the company’s shares have gained 50%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 26.4%. However, the declining bottom line and margins are primary hindrances for the stock at the moment. Let’s delve deeper.Hidden CatalystWe believe that L Brands’ sustained focus on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise, and speed-to-market initiatives has kept it afloat in a competitive environment. This is evident from its positive earnings surprise history. In eight of the trailing nine quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.5%.We believe that the company’s operational efficiencies, together with its new and innovative collections, bode well. Further, the company’s foray into international markets is likely to provide long-term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes. Management now projects earnings in the band of $3.05-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017 compared with the previous guidance of $3.00-$3.20.The big take away from the third-quarter results was robust top-line performance. Revenues surpassed the consensus mark for the first time in five quarters and also increased year over year after witnessing a decline of 7% and 5% in the first and second quarters, respectively. The company reported net sales of $2,617.8 million, up 1% from the prior-year quarter.L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. We believe these measures facilitate it to generate incremental sales and increase store transactions through higher conversion rate. The company is repositioning its La Senza brand by focusing on the younger generation and providing fashionable assortments at a reasonable price.Hurdles to CrossL Brands’ dwindling bottom-line remains the primary concern for investors. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that earnings per share fell 29%, 44% and 31% in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. Management projects earnings in the band of $3.05-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017, which is well below fiscal 2016 and 2015 earnings of $3.74 and $3.99, respectively. Moreover, the company now envisions fourth-quarter earnings in the range of $1.95-$2.10 compared with the prior-year quarter earnings of $2.03.Gross margin, an important financial metric, which gives an indication about the company’s health has shown constant deceleration in the past few quarters. In the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320, 120 and 190 basis points (bps) to 37.1%, 37.3% and 37.8%, respectively primarily due to buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage during the quarter. It was further impacted by fall in merchandise margin rate. We noted that gross margin has contracted 230 bps, 190 bps, 180 bps and 170 bps in the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of fiscal 2016 to 43.3%, 39.7%, 38.5% and 40.3%, respectively.

638,LB,"L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report), a specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products, is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 16. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 11.1%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.How are Estimates Shaping Up?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether L Brands will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 45 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 35%. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by 3 cents in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $2,764 million, down over 4% from the year-ago quarter.L Brands forms part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline by 0.9%, however, revenue is projected to improve 4.1%.L Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  L Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | L Brands, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayL Brands continues to disappoint investors with dismal comparable sales (comps) performance. This specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products reported 7% drop in comps for the four-week ended Jul 29, 2017 following declines of 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%,13%, 4% and 1% in June, May, April, March, February, January and December, respectively.For the 13-week ended Jul 29, 2017, the company’s comps had declined 8%, while sales decreased 4.7% to $2.755 billion. L Brands’ comps declined 14% at Victoria’s Secret but increased 6% at Bath & Body Works. The exit from the swim and apparel categories had a 6 percentage points and 9 percentage points adverse impact on overall company and Victoria’s Secret comparable sales, respectively.However, we believe that the company’s operational efficiencies, together with its new and innovative collections may help augment sales. Further, its foray into international markets is likely to provide long-term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes. Management now envisions second-quarter earnings to be at the high end of its previously provided guidance range of 40–45 cents a share.What Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that L Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.L Brands has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are pegged at 45 cents.

639,LB,"A glimpse of L Brands, Inc.’s (LB  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has plunged roughly 36.4% so far in the year, wider than the industry’s decline of 27.9%. So what is behind the debacle? We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for this Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) stock’s dismal show in the bourses.Declining CompsMajor chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping. L Brands continues to disappoint investors with soft comparable sales (comps) performance so far in the year. This specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products reported 2% drop in comps for the month of September, following declines of 4%, 7%, 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%,13% and 4% in August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively.The company continues to face short-term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category, which according to analysts has failed to generate desired results. Management expects comps to decline in low-single digits in October. It projects comps (excluding Victoria's Secret swim and apparel) in the third quarter to be in the range of flat to down low-single digit. For fiscal 2017, the company envisions comps to be down low-to-mid-single digits.Waning Top & Bottom LinesL Brands dwindling top and bottom-line results remain the primary concern for investors. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7% and 5% in the first and second quarter, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order, we note that earnings per share fell 44% and 31%, respectively. Moreover, the second quarter marked the fourth straight quarter when the company’s top-line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Management now projects earnings in the band of $3.00-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017, down from the prior view of $3.10-$3.40 and also well below fiscal 2016 and 2015 earnings of $3.74 and $3.99, respectively. Moreover, the company envisions third-quarter earnings in the range of 25-30 cents, compared with prior-year quarter earnings of 42 cents.Gross Margin Continues to HurtGross margin has shown constant deceleration in the past few quarters. In first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320 and 120 basis points (bps) to 37.1% and 37.3%, respectively primarily due to buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage. We noted that gross margin have contracted 230 bps, 190 bps, 180 bps and 170 bps in the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of fiscal 2016 to 43.3%, 39.7%, 38.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Further, management anticipates gross margin to deteriorate year over year during the third quarter as well as fiscal 2017.Bottom LineUndoubtedly, aforementioned factors are enough to unnerve investors. Nevertheless, L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. The company is focusing on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise, and speed-to-market initiatives.Can’t Get Over Retail?

However, comps inched up 1% on a year-to-date basis.We note that retail sector has long been bearing the brunt of changing consumer preferences from offline shopping to online, resulting in lower store traffic and volatile consumer spending.

However, the metric rose 6% in March 2018.Due to lower store traffic, volatile consumer spending, intense competition, retailers are resorting to store closures and concentrating more on digital capabilities. Evidently, Cato shuttered down one store in Guthrie, OK. Consequently, the company operated 1,350 stores across 33 states as of Jul 7, 2018, down from 1,374 stores as of Jul 1, 2017.In the past month, shares of Cato have lost 12.2% against the industry’s 1.8% rise.Apart from Cato, retailers like L Brands, Inc.

646,LB,"The retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change in shopping trends. With customer focus gradually shifting to online shopping, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. Retailers are now concentrating more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Moreover, steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration are undoubted signs of economic recovery. These are playing a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate in to higher consumer spending that may help rev up sales.Among the host of industries that builds up the overall Retail-Wholesale sector, we are focusing on Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry, which occupies top 34% (91 out of 265) position. Despite being placed in top 34% position, there are certain underperforming stocks in the industry that are limiting the overall growth potential of the industry.Among these, L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) is one such stock which is struggling to find space in the investors’ good books due to dwindling top and bottom-line results along with disappointing comparable store sales (comps) performance.

Moreover, the second quarter marked the fourth straight quarter when the top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Further, comps have also been witnessing a sharp decline in the past ten months. This specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products reported 2% drop in comps for the five-week ended Sep 30, 2017 following declines of 4%, 7%, 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%,13%, 4% and 1% in August, July, June, May, April, March, February, January and December, respectively.Investor sentiment was further hurt after the company trimmed fiscal 2017 guidance, when it reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Management projects earnings in the band of $3.00-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017, down from the previous guidance of $3.10-$3.40. This was also below the fiscal 2016 earnings of $3.74 and fiscal 2015 earnings of $3.99. Moreover, the company anticipates the fiscal third-quarter earnings in the range of 25-30 cents, compared with prior-year quarter earnings of 42 cents.Well it is quite apparent from above introspection that L Brands is having a tough time.

649,LB,"The Cato Corporation  continues to disappoint investors with its dismal comparable-store sales (comps) trend for more than a year, mainly due to a tough retail landscape. In fact, the trend entered the month of July as well, for which the company released dismal sales metrics.This specialty retailer of fashion apparel and accessories posted sales of $56.1 million for the four-week period ended Jul 29, 2017, which fell nearly 8% from $61.2 million recorded in the four weeks ended Jul 30, 2016. Further, it registered sales of $442.7 million for the first half of 2017, reflecting a decline of 15% from sales of $522.2 million recorded in the year-ago period.Cato's July comps dropped 9% year over year, followed by the declines of 16%, 16%, 2%, 21%, 25% and 15% in the months of June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively. Furthermore, comps for the first half fell 15% from the prior-year period. Below is the trend of comps for the last seven months:We note that the dismal sales trend has been pressurizing the company’s merchandise margins and in turn, adversely impacting the overall profitability. Evidently, management anticipates loss in the second quarter, which it schedules to report on Aug 17. In addition, the company projects its 2017 earnings to be significantly down from 2016.In fact, these factors are well reflected in Cato’s stock price performance. The company’s shares have plunged over 53% in the last one year, wider than its industry’s decline of 29.8%. Currently, the industry is placed at the bottom 36% of the Zacks classified industries (163 out of 256).Retail IndustryRetail-Wholesale sector is currently placed at the bottom 6% of the Zacks classified sectors (15 out of 16). Over the last three months, the sector has gained 3.3%, in line with the S&P 500 index’s growth. Currently, the sector is grappling with soft mall traffic, volatile consumer spending and macroeconomic volatility.Consequently, retailers are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities to counter these headwinds. Evidently, Cato inaugurated one store in Greensboro, NC and shuttered one store in the month under review. This brings the total store count to 1,374 as of Jul 29, 2017. Prior to this, it also opened one store in Lake City, FL in June.Apart from Cato, retailers like L Brands, Inc.

(BKE  -  Free Report) came out with comparable sales results for the month of July. While comparable sales for Costco and Zumiez increased 6.2% and 5.1%, respectively, that of Buckle declined 8.4%.Merchandise marginsVictoria’s Secret merchandise margin rate increased in July on account of the favorable impact of exiting non-core operations in the prior year and enhancement in the beauty business. The company announced that in August it will concentrate on new fashion in Body by Victoria Collection in the lingerie business and back to school in the Pink business.However, in case of Bath & Body Works merchandise margin rate was down in July compared with last year. In August, the company will focus on new seasonal collections in body care, home fragrance, and soap and sanitizer business.Outlook L Brands expects comps to decline in low to mid-single digits in August. The exit from the swim and apparel categories would hurt the comps by 2%.However, we believe that the company’s operational efficiencies, together with its new and innovative collections may help augment sales. Further, its foray into international markets is likely to provide long-term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes. Management now envisions second-quarter earnings to be at the high end of its earlier provided guidance range of 40–45 cents a share.L Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for L Brands shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, L Brands is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while 10 have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 18 cents per share to 15 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about L Brands right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

653,LB,"The earnings season is in full swing with results from 350 S&P 500 members already out. But Retail-Wholesale sector earnings are yet to gain steam and will take center stage as the reporting cycle nears its last leg. The sector has gained 16.6% so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 index that advanced 10.7%.Per the most recent Earnings Outlook, about 39% of the total S&P 500 companies in the sector have reported results, wherein 62.5% beat earnings estimates and 68.8% surpassed revenue expectations. The report also suggests that the sector is expected to record top-line growth of 4% but is likely to witness earnings decline of 1.6% this season.Thus, though investors are cautious, they are still looking to replenish their portfolio in a favorable economic scenario, with the GDP breezing past the $19 trillion mark. We believe that the encouraging economic data and friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.Sector’s Correlation with the EconomyThe U.S. economy rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter. A pick-up in consumer spending and an uptick in business investment in software, research and equipment boosted economic growth. Consumer outlays in particular improved on a steady job market and healthier household finances.Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the real gross domestic product (GDP) “advance” estimate for the second quarter of 2017 improved at an annual rate of 2.6% compared with a 1.2% rise witnessed in the preceding quarter. This indicated that the sluggish start to the year was primarily due to seasonal factors such as adverse weather conditions and delay in tax refunds.Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity, increased 2.8% in in the second quarter buoyed by the strongest labor market in years. As per reports, the U.S. economy has created over 16 million new jobs since 2010 that has helped lower unemployment rate to 4.4%. In fact, the U.S. job market roared back to life in June, with a better-than-expected 222,000 job additions in the month.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in improving consumer confidence, which rose to 121.1 in July from June’s reading of 117.3.Changing Retail DynamicsThe retail landscape has been witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping. This transition in consumer shopping pattern is compelling retailers to fast adapt to the changes in the ecosystem. Retailers now have no option left but to keep pace with the changing retail scenario or get eliminated. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. We note that U.S. retail sales fell for the second straight month in June (down 0.2%). But sales at non-store retailers inched up 0.4% sequentially and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.Likely Winners this SeasonThe Retail-Wholesale sector has not been an outstanding performer and identifying the winners is definitely a herculean task. Given the numerous stocks in the sector that almost always muddle one’s stock-picking prowess, the Zacks methodology could offer some relief. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.

654,LB,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 10. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this fashion specialty retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Nordstrom, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Nordstrom, Inc. QuoteThe company has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the last four quarters, with an average beat of about 41%. The robust earnings history has also helped shares of the company to jump 10.7% in the last one year, outperforming the industry’s slump of 25.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents compared with 67 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter. However, we noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.7 billion, up almost 2% from the year-ago quarter.Nordstrom forms part of the Retail – Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector’s earnings are expected to dip 1.6% year over year while revenues are projected to grow 4%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Nordstrom may beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: Nordstrom currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.28%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 63 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 61 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Nordstrom currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Nordstrom’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Factors Driving the Better-than-Expected EarningsNordstrom’s solid past performance reflects the company’s robust brand image, cost-savings initiatives and impressive omnichannel efforts. The company is undertaking several initiatives to keep pace with customers’ shift to online shopping. Evidently, Nordstrom has been focused on technological advancement, through development of e-commerce and digital networks, and improvement of supply-chain channels and marketing efforts. Backed by these endeavors, the company’s online business crossed $3 billion in fiscal 2016, thus resulting in annualized growth of nearly 30% since 2010. Further, Nordstrom’s online sales formed nearly 24% of the company’s business in first-quarter fiscal 2017.Clearly, Nordstrom is making significant progress with respect to its customer-based strategy and it seems to be well on track with its long-term sales target of $20 billion by 2020.  With regard to cost savings, the company plans to strike a balance between its sales and expense growth. We believe that these factors are likely to drive Nordstrom’s growth. Thus, it seems like the company is set to maintain its splendid earnings surprise trend this time as well. Let’s wait and see.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

655,LB,"Deckers Outdoor Corp. (DECK  -  Free Report),  the designer, producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories, is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 27, after the closing bell.In the preceding quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 283.3%. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 74%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Deckers Outdoor will be able to come up with a positive surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of $1.67. In the year-ago quarter, the company had posted a loss per share of $1.80. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $179.3 million, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.We noted that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past three months. The company’s shares have increased 12.8%, while the industry gained 7.2%.Factors Influencing the QuarterDeckers Outdoor is targeting profitable markets and remains focused on product innovations along with store augmentation. Management is also enhancing eCommerce capabilities and transitioning to a direct subsidiary model from a distributor model outside the U.S. The company’s focus on expanding brand assortments, bringing more innovative line of products, targeting consumers through marketing and optimizing omni-channel distribution bode well.Moreover, in an effort to drive long-term growth the company has taken strategic initiatives. Its store fleet optimization plan focuses on striking the right balance between digital and physical stores. Additionally, Deckers plans to close approximately 30–40 outlets over the next two years.Earlier, the company has stated that in the first quarter it expects net sales to increase by low-single digits. Management envisions loss per share of approximately $1.70–$1.65. Moreover, decline in sales of UGG brand have been a major concern for the investors. During the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, UGG brand net sales have declined 19.8%, 2.1%, 5.3% and 1.1%, respectively.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Deckers Outdoor is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

656,LB,"L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report), a specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products, is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 15.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEndeavors UndertakenL Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. These measures will facilitate it to generate incremental sales and increase store transactions through higher conversion rate. Further, the company’s foray into international markets is likely to provide long-term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes.We believe that L Brands’ sustained focus on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise, and speed-to-market initiatives has kept it afloat in a competitive environment. This is evident from its positive earnings surprise history. In the trailing eight quarters, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.4%.Comps Seem Back on TrackL Brands finally broke its streak of declining comparable sales (comps) in October, reporting 2% gain. As a result, management now expects third-quarter earnings to be at the high end of its previously estimated guidance range of 25-30 cents. However, this is still down from the prior-year quarter earnings of 42 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has increased by a penny in the past 30 days, and is presently pegged at 30 cents.Additionally, comps have declined 2%, 4%, 7%, 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%, 13% and 4% in September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively. Meanwhile, the company continues to face short-term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category that failed to generate desired results.Will Earnings & Revenues Continue to Decline?L Brands dwindling earnings and revenues remain the primary concern for investors. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7% and 5%, while earnings per share fell 44% and 31% in the first and second quarter, respectively. Moreover, the second quarter marked the fourth-straight quarter when the company’s top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Per analysts surveyed by Zacks, third-quarter earnings are likely to decline more than 28% year over year. However, revenues are anticipated to come in at $2,607 million, reflecting an increase of roughly 1% from the year-ago quarter.L Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  L Brands, Inc.

First-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales jumped 8% year over year to $2.63 billion, while comps improved 3% — reflecting an increase of 1% and 8% at Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works brands, respectively. Comps for the four-week ended May 5 were flat following an advancement of 4% in March and 3% in February.Furthermore, total Victoria’s Secret revenues increased 3.7% and Bath & Body Works brands revenues rose 12.2% on a year-over-year basis.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that L Brands is not likely to beat estimates this quarter as the stock does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

670,LB,"Meredith Corporation (MDP  -  Free Report), one of leading media and marketing companies in the U.S. is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, in the trailing four quarters, it has posted an average earnings beat of 3.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Meredith will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 96 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of over 11%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 60 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $440.6 million compared with $435.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing this QuarterStrategic endeavors such as increase in digital offerings, the launch of new magazine, The Magnolia Journal, and addition of newscasts across television stations, along with its focus on non-advertising revenue generating avenues such as retransmission fees, brand licensing and e-commerce are likely to drive the top line higher.To strengthen position, Meredith has launched additional newscasts in the Atlanta, Phoenix, Portland, Nashville, Greenville and Flint/Saginaw markets. The company also renewed licensing program with Wal-Mart Stores, which allows it to showcase 3,000 SKUs of Better Homes & Gardens branded products at 5,000 outlets and on Walmart.com. For the fourth-quarter earnings are anticipated to be in the range of 93–98 cents per share. Local Media Group’s revenue is expected to be up mid-single digits, while that of National Media Group is likely to be down marginally in the final quarter.  However, with advancing technology, the print media is on a decline. Shift to online is likely to put enormous pressure on Meredith’s magazine portfolio.

671,LB,"World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers, before the opening bell on Jul 27. In the previous quarter, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.3%.Notably, the company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of trailing four quarters by an average of 34.3%. Here’s a discussion on the determinants of the second-quarter results.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether World Wrestling Entertainment will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 6 cents, in comparison with year-ago quarter earnings of 1 cent. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 60 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $204.5 million compared with $199 million reported in the year-ago quarter.We noted that the stock has outperformed both the Zacks categorized Movie/TV Production/Distribution industry and the S&P 500 Index on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have advanced 15.7%, while the Zacks categorized industry and the S&P 500 have witnessed a gain of 1.5% and 10.1%, respectively.Factors Influencing This QuarterIn three out of the preceding four quarters, WWE has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and consequently analysts are skeptical about the company’s performance in second-quarter 2017. WWE operates in the highly competitive market of entertainment video. Further, decline in home entertainment and pay-per view revenues has been a major concern for the investors. In 2016, home entertainment net revenues came in at $13.1 million in comparison with $13.4 million and $27.3 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Further, the trend continued in the first quarter, with home entertainment revenues declining 27%.For second-quarter 2017, WWE anticipates average paid subscribers of 1.63 million. Adjusted OBIDA is projected in the range of $13–$17 million. Further, WWE expects contractual rise in television right fees from important distribution agreements and believes that the company will continue to add more WWE Network subscribers.In order to boost WWE Network’s revenues, the company has been implementing certain strategies including the development of fresh content, execution of customer acquisition and retention programs, increase in distribution platform, introduction of new features along with foraying into new locations.Zacks Model Shows Unlikely BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show that WWE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. WWE has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 6 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP but an ESP of 0.00% makes a surprise prediction difficult.

672,LB,"Rent-A-Center, Inc. (RCII  -  Free Report), which recently turned down the buyout offer by private equity firm, Vintage Capital, is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. The question lingering in the minds of investors is whether this leading rent-to-own store operator will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 8 cents, substantially down from 41 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $665.9 million, down about 11% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe remained concerned about the company’s top-line and bottom-line performance which has been declining year over year. Moreover, total revenue has also missed the consensus mark for the seventh straight quarter. Total revenue fell 11.2% year over year during the first quarter, exhibiting decline witnessed across the Core U.S., Mexico and Franchising segments, partially mitigated by growth registered at Acceptance Now segment.Nevertheless, Rent-A-Center is concentrating on a new labor model, supply chain initiative and productivity enhancements. Management hinted that these endeavors are directed toward improving the performance of Core U.S. segment, optimizing the AcceptanceNOW business, and enhancing distribution channels as well as integrating retail and online offerings. These may have a favorable impact on the quarter to be reported.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rent-A-Center is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Rent-A-Center has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are pegged at 8 cents.

673,LB,"After L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) announced weak sales for the month of June at Victoria’s Secret, the stock dropped nearly 10%. The VS parent company said it saw disappointing sales during the store’s Semi-Annual Sale.Looking more specifically, in a monthly sales call with chief investor relations officer Amie Preston, L Brands said the Semi-Annual Sale had a soft start with negative traffic level.Over The Years   It’s clear that VS hasn’t been doing the best over the past couple of years. Along with posting weak sales in four consecutive quarters, there has also been a decline in customers. According to Business Insider, almost 58% of customers have stopped shopping at VS due to high prices.Customers are now looking for comfort over appeal and VS has had trouble keeping up with that trend. Since taking its swimsuit and apparel collections off the shelves, Victoria’s Secret has been seen as the underdog as compared to other stores selling similar products.Aerie vs. Victoria’s Secret Victoria’s Secret has faced continuous competition from American Eagle’s (AEO  -  Free Report) Aerie brand. In its first quarter report for 2018, Aerie reported a 38% increase in comparable sales, whereas VS a 1% fall in comparable sales during the period.Aerie seems to attract more customers because of its brand and image. The company has created a positive image around its products, seeing as they enforce body positivity. In part of its most recent Aerie Real campaign, the company used models with disabilities and chronic illnesses. This enforces a positive image for the company and makes customers feel good about themselves when buying Aerie’s products.Meanwhile, when you think of Victoria’s Secret, you think about the sex appeal and the models that are shown in its campaigns and fashion shows. It’s a stigma that has been created that you have to look like the models from VS in order to wear their products. Not only does this present a bad image for the company, but it also turns away customers from shopping with such a brand.Current SituationCurrently LB is a #5 (Strong Sell) on the Zacks Rank. It hasn’t been doing so well amongst investors and has lost over 45% of its value over the past year. Although Victoria’s Secret is a well-known brand, its parent company is still struggling to keep up.OutlookIt seems as though the trend of buying Victoria’s Secret and PINK products is slowly dying. Customers are looking for products that VS is simply not delivering, and therefore, it is becoming a ‘broken’ brand. It’s clear to customers and even investors now that this a strong sell stock, and it could easily continue on like this if things aren’t solved.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

674,LB,"Shares of L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) have not only declined but have also underperformed the industry and the overall sector in the past six months. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has lost approximately 40% as against the industry’s rise of 1.1% and the overall sector’s gain of 7.5%.Margin contraction and the issuance of bleak view following first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein the bottom line plunged year over year may cited as primary reasons behind the company’s dismal run on the bourses.Soft ViewManagement not only trimmed the fiscal 2018 view but also provided muted second-quarter guidance. For fiscal 2018, L Brands now envisions comps growth in low-single digits. Earlier, management had expected the same to increase 2-4%. The company also lowered its fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance to $2.70-$3.00 from $2.95-$3.25. In the year-ago period, the company posted earnings of $3.20. In fact, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, earnings are envisioned in the range of 30-35 cents versus 48 cents in the year-ago quarter. Declining MarginGross margin, a key metric which helps gauge a company’s financial health, has persistently declined in the past few quarters. In the last reported quarter, gross margin contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 35.9%. Further, in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320, 120, 190 and 100 basis points (bps) to 37.1%, 37.3%, 37.8% and 42.3%, respectively, primarily on buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage in the quarter.Further, in the second quarter, gross margin is expected to decline year over year and SG&A costs are anticipated to escalate considerably, as a percentage of sales. For fiscal 2018, gross margin rate is expected to decline year over year, while it was anticipated to remain flat earlier. Also, SG&A costs are likely to increase year over year in fiscal 2018.Wrapping UpManagement is trying all means to boost the company’s performance. We believe L Brands’ sustained focus on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise and speed-to-market initiatives may help cushion the stock. Apart from these, L Brands continues to revamp its business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing its direct business. While we believe that these measures are in the right direction, it will take a while for the results to reflect the effects of the same.Forget L Brands, Focus on These 3 Retail Stocks Shoe Carnival, Inc.

675,LB,"Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, 2017. In the trailing four quarters, it had underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 17.3%. However, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 9.1% in the preceding quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Skechers will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the second quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 45 cents compared with 48 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $965.7 million, up about 10% from the year-ago quarter.Skechers forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector, which occupies a space in the bottom 38% of the Zacks classified sectors (10 out of 16). As per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the sector are expected to decline 1.6%, while revenues are projected to improve 7.8%.Factors at PlayWith greater emphasis on new line of products, cost containment efforts, inventory management and global distribution platform, Skechers remains well positioned to sustain momentum. The company is also enhancing eCommerce platform. However, investors remained apprehensive about Skechers’ bottom-line performance that continued to decline for the fourth successive quarter, when it reported first-quarter results. Moreover, due to high exposure to international markets it remains prone to currency fluctuations.Management had earlier highlighted that it expects to deliver flat to slightly positive sales for domestic wholesale business, growth in international business and increase in company-owned retail stores. Further, management had forecast second-quarter net sales in the band of $950–$975 million and earnings per share in the range of 42–47 cents.Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

676,LB,"Shares of J. Crew Group, Inc. (JCG) have gained by double digits this morning after the clothing company raised its outlooks on the fiscal third and fiscal fourth quarters. 
"
677,LB,"JCG is up approximately 12% Thursday, making it a top-performing Zacks #1 Rank company. Similarly, volume has spiked higher to more than 4 million shares, compared to the daily average of 1.13 million.  
"
678,LB,"JCG is of 5 companies from the Retail-Apparel/Shoe industry on today's Zacks #1 Rank List, which includes 222 stocks in total. The other 4 names are Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. (JOSB), Limited Brands, Inc. (LTD), The Men's Wearhouse, Inc. (MW) and Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report). Nice Outlook 
"
679,LB,"Thanks to strong sales and margin trends in the fiscal third quarter, J. Crew Group now expects earnings per share between 54 cents and 59 cents. Previously, the company had been expecting 30 cents to 33 cents. At the moment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 36 cents for the quarter.  
"
680,LB,"Meanwhile, the fiscal fourth quarter also got some attention as JCG said it anticipates same-store sales in the mid-to-high single digit range. That's an improvement from the prior outlook for a low single digit increase in same-store sales. (Of course, this guidance is based on the expectation that current trends will continue.)  
"
681,LB,"The fiscal third quarter will be officially announced on Nov 23. Earnings Estimates  
"
682,LB,"Earnings estimates were moving in the right direction even before today's announcement, and are likely poised for further upside.  
"
683,LB,"At the moment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending January 2010 is $1.25 per share, which is up 26% from 99 cents over the past 2 months.  
"
684,LB,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year is $1.55 per share, or approximately 24% better than the guidance for this fiscal year. That outlook has gained by 23% in 2 months from $1.26. Fiscal Second Quarter 
"
685,LB,"Over the past 4 quarters, J. Crew Group has put together an average profit surprise of right around 84%.  
"
686,LB,"Most recently on Aug 27, the company announced earnings per share of 29 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by more than 93%. In the previous-year quarter, JCG announced 28 cents.  
"
687,LB,"Revenues advanced 6% to $357.6 million. 
"
688,LB,"Consumers are showing a willingness to spend, even as they watch their budgets.
"
689,LB,"This morning, the Commerce Department said that retailers saw sales rose 0.5% last month, excluding motor vehicles and parts. Furniture & home furnishing stores, health & personal care stores, general merchandise stores and gasoline stations all saw increases of 0.8% or better.
"
690,LB,"(The hangover from the Cash for Clunkers program resulted in an 11.8% drop in sales at auto dealers. This skewed the overall change in retail sales down to -1.5%.)
"
691,LB,"The increase may seem surprising given the economic backdrop. After all, unemployment is rising towards 10% and another wave of foreclosures could be forthcoming as adjustable rate mortgages reset. On the other hand, the majority of Americans are employed and the improving economic data is probably giving consumers some confidence, even if the sentiment surveys are less clear.
"
692,LB,"Plus, the Commerce Department's data is backed up by rising sales at several retailers. For instance, Limited Brands (LTD), Kohl's (KSS  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) saw an improvement last month.
"
693,LB,"Of course, some of the biggest increases continue to occur at the discount retail chains. Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) and TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) both said September same-store sales jumped by 7% or more.
"
694,LB,"Sales Benefiting From Several Factors
"
695,LB,"There was no single key driver to explain the improvement in sales. Traffic was better and Target noted that the average transaction continues to improve. Costco (COST  -  Free Report) executives observed that though coupon use has increased, consumers are still spending essentially the same amount of the register.
"
696,LB,"Unseasonably cool weather may have also played a role. TJX saw increased demand for fall apparel. The good weather across much of the country may have also given people reason to go out and shop. Not to mention that the calm hurricane season probably helped stores in the Southeast.
"
697,LB,"Again, the economy is also playing a role. With business conditions stabilizing, consumers are more willing to open their wallets. Though spending patterns will remain comparatively depressed well into 2010, and probably longer, even relatively small increases can make a difference in the data.
"
698,LB,"Retail Remains A Top Sector
"
699,LB,"Despite rising unemployment, Retail has been among the top-ranked sectors for many months. Several retailers have been able to top analyst expectations, resulting in positive earnings estimate revisions.
"
700,LB,"Last week, several companies raised their third-quarter guidance, including KSS, ROST, TJX and TGT. Though LTD did not provide any guidance, 10 out of the 15 covering analysts raised their third-quarter projections. The full year Zacks Consensus Estimate has recently been raised on all 5 companies.
"
701,LB,"There is no doubt that retailers still face challenging conditions. The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend 1% less this year than last year. However, as long as retailers continue to perform better than expectations, their stocks should continue to rise. This is why I hold Retail SPDR (XRT  -  Free Report) in Zacks ETF Trader.

707,LB,"Dow components Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) headline the last official week of second-quarter earnings season. Joining them will be S&P 500 members Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), Lowe's (LOW), Limited (LTD) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report).

714,LB,"Volume could be modest through Labor Day as traders try to get in late summer vacations. Late August can be tricky for the markets, so be prudent. Oil remains a wildcard and it is hurricane season.
"
715,LB,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 18 - 22Aeropostale (ARO) enjoyed a 13% increase in August same-stores sales, at a time when many other retailers were struggling. The strong performance led the teen apparel chain to raise its second-quarter EPS guidance by 5 cents to between 30 and 31 cents per share. Brokerage analysts believe the company will report 31 cents per share. ARO has surprised to the upside for 3 consecutive quarters, so current projections may prove to be conservative. Aeropostale is scheduled to report on Thursday, Aug 21, after the close of trading.
"
716,LB,"Discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) credited bargain-hunting consumers, the stimulus checks and favorable weather for driving July same-store sales 4% higher. Given last month's good performance, the company believes quarterly profits will total between 53 and 54 cents per share, a slight increase over previous guidance. Revisions by 5 brokerage analysts pushed the consensus earnings estimate 2 cents higher to 54 cents per share. ROST has topped expectations for 3 consecutive quarters. Ross Stores is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 20, before the start of trading.
"
717,LB,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 18 - 22
"
718,LB,"Trends were not favorable for Saks (SKS), which experienced a 5.3% drop in August same-store sales. The company observed that business trends worsened as the second quarter progressed and, as a result, brokerage analysts have been steadily lowering their projections. The second-quarter consensus estimate calls for a loss of 18 cents per share, reflecting cuts from a majority of the 7 covering analysts. SKS missed expectations last quarter by a margin of 4 cents per share. Saks is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 19, before the start of trading.

"
724,LB,"1Some of the companies listed in the earnings calendar may not be in the Zacks Rank universe.
"
725,LB,"The lack of fear in the markets continues to be puzzling.
"
726,LB,"Take Thursday for instance. Former St. Louis Fed President William Poole told Bloomberg that Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) were """"insolvent"". Rising retail sales at Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) were offset by lower spending at J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Limited (LTD) and Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report).  Oil rebounded back above $141.
"
727,LB,"So what did stocks do? Close higher on strong volume.
"
728,LB,"It could well be that investors were trying to pick a bottom before earnings season heats up next week. Remember April? Stocks rallied in spite of bad news from the financial sector. Possibly some traders are hoping for a repeat.
"
729,LB,"As much as I want to be optimistic and call for a market rebound, I have to be pragmatic.
"
730,LB,"Excluding energy and financials, negative revisions to full-year earnings estimates are outnumbering positive revisions by a ratio of 1.2:1. This could change in the next few weeks, if guidance is good, but we'll need more than good numbers from Alcoa (AA) and flat earnings from General Electric (GE  -  Free Report).
"
731,LB,"The housing slump appears likely to get worse. The Fed wants to tighten regulations on mortgages. (A step that is long overdue.) Meanwhile, Freddie and Fannie are in trouble (though the Fed might help). Combined, these two events suggest that mortgages will be harder to get. At a time when pending home sales are falling, this is not welcome news.
"
732,LB,"Crude's bubble got bigger, and now it's hurricane season. Bertha didn't do much, fortunately, but it's just July.
"
733,LB,"Consumers are tightening their wallets. With gas averaging $4.10 a gallon and the job market tight, who could blame them? $1200 does not go very far when you're driving a SUV.
"
734,LB,"Despite all of this, the VIX has been at historically tame levels and gold remains far below its recent highs. These are signs of complacency. (Both rose notably on Friday, however.)
"
735,LB,"Adding to the befuddlement is the indiscriminate selling. Video game sales are setting records this year and GameStop's (GME  -  Free Report) valuation keeps getting compressed. EOG Resources (EOG  -  Free Report) got knocked down even though profit forecasts have risen by 50 cents in just the past 30 days.
"
736,LB,"Good stocks with strong fundamentals are being taken out to the woodshed. If there were signs of fear, this would make sense, but there aren't any.
"
737,LB,"The markets can and do act in random ways. This is certainly the case right now.
"
738,LB,"More Volatility Ahead
"
739,LB,"Next week will bring more volatility. There will be earnings announcements from 6 Dow components, inflation data, Fed minutes, option expiration and Congressional testimony from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. In addition, about 70 financial firms will report second-quarter results.
"
740,LB,"The light at the end of the tunnel could start appearing in about 10 days, however.
"
741,LB,"Earnings season will shift towards energy and tech companies. Oil companies will have strong profits. If the tech companies can reaffirm full-year guidance, we could get a rebound. Unfortunately, there are concerns about IT spending weakening in the second-half of the year, so don't bet the farm yet.
"
742,LB,"Keep Looking At Stocks
"
743,LB,"When things get messy in the markets, the temptation for investors is to stop looking at the stocks. This is the exact opposite of what you should do. Risky environments bring opportunities.
"
744,LB,"I learned this early in my career by analyzing oilfield companies in Houston. I heard multiple stories of investors who greatly increased their wealth by buying assets when Houston's economy went bust in the 1980s.
"
745,LB,"Rather than shy away, they created a shopping list and looked for bargains.
"
746,LB,"Investing in stocks is no different. This is why we are looking at potential names to add to the Focus List if prices keep dropping.
"
747,LB,"For those of you who are nervous, consider dollar-cost averaging. Given the low cost of commissions, you can easily get your toes wet and still sleep comfortably at night.
"
748,LB,"And if you don't feel comfortable at investing, don't. But keep looking, because when the rebound finally occurs, stocks could rise very quickly.
"
749,LB,"Focus List Update
"
750,LB,"The Zacks Rank for Corning (GLW  -  Free Report) fell to 4 due to a lack of agreement among analysts and a most accurate consensus estimate that was below the current estimate. Consequently, the stock was removed from the portfolio. If GLW provides good guidance and brokerage analysts raise their forecasts, we will consider adding the stock back to the portfolio.
"
751,LB,"Kirby (KEX  -  Free Report) was removed from the portfolio because full-year forecasts were cut within the past 30 days.
"
752,LB,"Silicon Motion (SIMO  -  Free Report) was removed from the Focus List because of unfavorable market conditions. We remain optimistic about the company's prospects, however, and will consider adding it back to the Focus List in the future.

754,LB,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in LB.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 11 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $3.48 a share a month ago to its current level of $3.17.Also, for the current quarter, L Brands has seen seven downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 19 cents a share from 32 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 22% in the past month.L Brands, Inc.

755,LB,"A glimpse of L Brands, Inc.’s (LB  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has plunged roughly 24% in the past six months. The stock has decreased nearly 6.6% in a month, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.2%.So what is behind the debacle? We have tried to ascertain major reasons that can be held responsible for this Zacks Rank # 5 (Strong Sell) stock’s dismal show in the bourses.Declining CompsMajor chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping. L Brands continues to disappoint investors with soft comparable sales (comps) performance so far in the year. This specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products reported 4% drop in comps for the month of August, following declines of 7%, 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%,13% and 4% in July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively.L Brands continues to face short-term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category, which according to analysts has failed to generate desired results. Management expects comps to decline in low-single digits in September. The company projects comps (excluding Victoria's Secret swim and apparel) in the third quarter to be in the range of flat to down low-single digit. For fiscal 2017, the company envisions comps to be down low-to-mid-single digits.Waning Top & Bottom LinesL Brands dwindling top and bottom-line results remain the primary concern for investors. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7% and 5% in the first and second quarter, respectively. Maintaining the same chronological order, we note that earnings per share fell 44% and 31%, respectively. Moreover, the second quarter marked the fourth straight when the company’s top line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Management now projects earnings in the band of $3.00-$3.20 per share for fiscal 2017, down from the prior view of $3.10-$3.40 and also well below fiscal 2016 and 2015 earnings of $3.74 and $3.99, respectively. Moreover, the company envisions third-quarter earnings in the range of 25-30 cents, compared with prior-year quarter earnings of 42 cents.As a result, analysts polled by Zacks have also tweaked their estimates. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 and $3.18 for fiscal 2017 and 2018 has declined 10 cents and 13 cents, respectively. Moreover, for the third quarter the same has dropped 8 cents to 29 cents.Gross Margin Continues to HurtGross margin has shown constant deceleration in the past few quarters. In first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320 and 120 basis points (bps) to 37.1% and 37.3%, respectively primarily due to buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage. We noted that gross margin have contracted 230 bps, 190 bps, 180 bps and 170 bps in the fourth, third, second, and first quarters of fiscal 2016 to 43.3%, 39.7%, 38.5% and 40.3%, respectively. Further, management anticipates gross margin to deteriorate year over year during the third quarter as well as fiscal 2017.Bottom LineUndoubtedly, aforementioned factors are enough to unnerve investors. Nevertheless, L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. The company is focusing on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise, and speed-to-market initiatives.Can’t Get Over Retail?

"
756,LB,"Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) and The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) will help wrap up first-quarter earnings season. The two Dow components will be joined by 14 other S&P 500 members, including Gap (GPS  -  Free Report), Lowe's (LOW  -  Free Report), Limited (LTD) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report).
"
757,LB,"Overall, we have confirmed that 111 companies should release quarterly results, a sharp decline from the number of reports released over the past several weeks.
"
758,LB,"The minutes from the April Federal Open Market Committee meeting will be published Wednesday. Given the current economic data and the stimulus checks, no changes to rates are expected until August, at the very earliest. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the minutes should elicit much of a reaction. This said, I would not completely rule out a move by the markets following the release of the meeting notes.
"
759,LB,"Other notable economic data will include:
"
760,LB,"Tuesday: First-quarter Case-Shiller housing price index, April new home sales, May Conference Board consumer confidence survey
"
761,LB,"Wednesday: April durable goods orders
"
762,LB,"Thursday: Revised first-quarter GDP, weekly jobless claims
"
763,LB,"Friday: April personal income and spending, May Chicago PMI, final May University of Michigan consumer confidence survey
"
764,LB,"Three Fed officials will be speaking. Vice Chairman Donald Kohn will discuss the economic outlook on Tuesday morning. Kevin Warsh will deliver a speech entitled ""Using the Federal Funds Rate in Extraordinary Times"" on Wednesday afternoon. Randall Kroszner will talk about the mortgage markets on Thursday morning.
"
765,LB,"The markets have been in a trading range, though traders have mostly been shrugging off the bad news. The calendar does not contain much that would seem to move stocks out of the current range, though a continued climb in oil prices could be a concern.
"
766,LB,"Keep an eye on volume late in the week, particularly on Friday afternoon, as some traders and portfolio managers head out early for the holiday weekend.
"
767,LB,"First-Quarter Earnings
"
768,LB,"First-quarter earnings were not terrible, but they were not good either.
"
769,LB,"Although the median company did achieve per share growth of 9.2%, more than 160 companies with the S&P 500 reported a year-over-year drop in income. (Thirty-four firms actually lost money - most of them being either financial firms or home-builders.)
"
770,LB,"Looking at the numbers from the index level, S&P 500 earnings were down 16.3% last quarter. This number reflects the weighting of the financial stocks in the index and therefore differs from the median calculation, which is not weighted.
"
771,LB,"Positive surprises outnumbered negative surprises by a 2.2:1 margin. Good, but not nearly as good as we
"
772,LB,"have seen in past quarters.
"
773,LB,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of May 19 - 23BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) realized a 17.8% increase in same-store sales last month. (Gasoline sales helped as did the timing of Easter.) The strong performance led five of the 14 covering brokerage analysts to raise their forecasts for the first-quarter. The current consensus estimate of 27 cents is two cents above the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at 29 cents per share. BJ has exceeded expectations during each of the past three quarters by an average margin of 4.6 cents. BJ's Wholesale Club is scheduled to report on Wednesday, May 21, before the start of trading.
"
774,LB,"Last Tuesday, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) preannounced fiscal second-quarter earnings of 87 cents per share, above the then consensus estimate of 84 cents per share. Four brokerage analysts promptly raised their forecasts, but the majority has not, putting the current consensus estimate at 85 cents per share. Given that HPQ has consistently topped expectations for several years, it is likely that the consensus estimate is too low. Hewlett-Packard is scheduled to report on Tuesday, May 20, after the close of trading.
"
775,LB,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of May 19 - 23The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) has missed earnings estimates twice in the past four quarters. Ahead of the company's first-quarter announcement, the most accurate estimate is suggesting earnings will total 36 cents per share, which would be a penny below the consensus estimate. The Home Depot is scheduled to report on Tuesday, May 20, before the start of trading.

"
781,LB,"Last week, I advised investors to keep Dramamine by their side. This advice continues to hold.
"
782,LB,"Heres why. Fear about the credit crisis has worsened to the point that the Fed was forced to abandon its hawkish stance on inflation and cut the discount rate. Although the move was intended to reassure lenders that the Federal Reserve will do what is necessary to ensure that the banking system remains liquid, it also creates concerns about how bad the crisis really is. The fear about the credit crisis seems to be worse than the actual problem itself, but fear is a powerful force.
"
783,LB,"Unfortunately, there isnt much in the way of scheduled releases to alleviate fears over the next five trading days.  The earnings calendar is limited to just 97 companies, 13 of which are members of the S&P 500. Retailers will again be front and center with the likes of Abercrombie (ANF  -  Free Report), GAP (GPS  -  Free Report), Limited (LTD), Lowes (LOW  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) reporting. (Approximately half of the 97 companies scheduled to report earnings will be retailers.)  The economic calendar has July Leading Economic Indicators being published on Monday and July durable goods orders and new home sales data slotted for Friday.
"
784,LB,"Simply put, at a time when investors could really use some reassuring news, there wont be much. The number of earnings estimate revisions will be on the decline as companies pass mid-quarter and are not likely to give much in the way of revised guidance. (This is neither a positive nor a negative, but rather just a factor of the calendar.)  Deal volume tends to be lower in August simply because so many people are on vacation and/or getting kids ready for school. Even the Stock Traders Almanac has nothing to say other than Wednesday and Friday should be bullish days, based on past trends.
"
785,LB,"Besides keeping Dramamine by their side, investors should use this period of time to research stocks. When markets get volatile, the natural tendency is to move money into money market funds and think about anything, but investing. Rather, investors would be well served to double-up their research efforts and find fundamentally strong stocks with rising earnings estimates that are trading at reasonable valuations. A disciplined dollar-cost averaging strategy now can result in notable profits being realized in the future. In other words, buy fear.
"
786,LB,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 20 - 24
"
787,LB,"All of the covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts on Gap (GPS  -  Free Report) after the company said that it would probably report second-quarter profits within a range of 19 to 20 cents per share. Prior to the new guidance, the consensus estimate had called for profits of 13 cents per share; now it calls for profits of 19 cents per share. GPS revised guidance comes after the company achieved a 2% rise in July same-store sales for its namesake stores and a 1% increase at Banana Republic stores. (Old Navy same-store sales plunged 18%, however). The company also noted that it was also able to achieve higher margins. GPS has exceeded expectations for six consecutive quarters. Gap is scheduled to report on Thursday, Aug 23, after the close of trading.
"
788,LB,"Gymboree (GYMB) reaffirmed its raised EPS guidance of 13 to 15 cents per share earlier this month. The reaffirmation occurred as the company said July same-store sales rose a respectable 5%. Brokerage analysts held their profit forecasts steady at 15 cents per share in response to the July numbers, though the consensus estimate is three cents above the average forecast of 30 days ago. GYMB has exceeded expectations for three consecutive quarters. Gymboree is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 22, after the close of trading.
"
789,LB,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 20 - 24Pacific Sunwear of California (PSUN) recently cut its non-GAAP second-quarter profit guidance to a range of six to seven cents per share. The revision followed a 4.6% drop in July same-store sales and weak gross margins. Most of the covering brokerage analysts lowered their projections in response, causing the consensus estimate to drop by 10 cents to seven cents per share. PSUN has missed expectations twice during the past four quarters. Pacific Sunwear is scheduled to report on Thursday, Aug 23, after the close of trading.

"
798,LB,"This might the best way to describe the last full week of trading in May. First-quarter earnings season is basically done, outside of retailers and some late reporters. The economic calendar is fairly light. And the Friday before Memorial Day tends to be marked by light volume.
"
799,LB,"So whats going to move the markets? Merger news will play a role, though given the extremely high number of deals already announced so this year, calling for more mergers to occur is akin to forecasting a sunny day in June  its just going to happen. Sentiment remains bullish. The trend in full-year earnings estimate revisions are positive, though the number of revisions  both positive and negative  is going to start falling. At some point the markets are going to pay more attention to the combination of slow and lumpy economic growth and rising energy prices, but until that occurs, the Dows upward trend is our friend.

811,LB,"This week Id like to focus on evaluating your holdings, monitoring your watchlists and getting rid of losing stocks. 
"
812,LB,"And as the title suggests, theres no particular magic in making (or keeping) money; just good old-fashioned common sense. The trick is exercising it! 
"
813,LB,"If youve used our Research Wizard program even for a short amount of time, then youve either built your own proven, profitable Screening Strategies or selected a few of the Pre-defined Strategies that came with the program. 
"
814,LB,"But just because youve made your move(s) (or are at least watching potential candidates), doesnt mean your work is over.  
"
815,LB,"Whatever your stocks are, whether they be actual holdings or stocks youre considering buying, dont stop monitoring the fundamentals of those stocks. 
"
816,LB,"For example, if you originally bought a stock due to a low Debt to Equity ratio, but subsequently watched that ratio change to an unacceptable level, then you should consider exiting and looking for a new stock to replace it. One that currently does meet your criteria. 
"
817,LB,"Lets say you use the Zacks Rank as a timing indicator and you look at the Zacks #1 Rank list for immediate movers. If in a few weeks, as Zacks aggregates EPS Estimate Revisions, the company is degraded to a Zacks #3 Rank or Zacks #4 Rank, take note and consider dumping it. 
"
818,LB,"Sure it was a Zacks #1 Rank, but its not anymore.  
"
819,LB,"Think about it; if you never would have gotten into a Zacks #3 Rank or a Zacks #4 Rank in the first place, why would you now want to hold onto one? 
"
820,LB,"Thats using your common sense.  
"
821,LB,"What if youre a momentum investor and you generally look for stocks trading within 10% of its 52-week high (a great item by the way) and it suddenly falls below that level? Well, if youre only interested in focusing on stocks within 10% of its high and its now of 15% or 20% (or more), ... move on. The momentum has seemingly shifted and so should your focus. And dont convince yourself to hang onto your losers either. If you got into a stock expecting great things and its now 8% to 10% against you, get out. Dont let your love of a stock (or denial) ruin your portfolio. Almost every big losing trade could have been exited when they were just beginning to crumble. 
"
822,LB,"And if you get out and it zips back up, you can always get back in if you want. But if it keeps going down, youre just losing more and more money.  
"
823,LB,"So once youve found the items that have proven to work well for you in picking profitable stocks, be sure to monitor those values. And if they no longer meet the winning criteria, get rid of them fast and find new ones that do. 
"
824,LB,"And the Research Wizards backtesting feature is the best way to do that! Backtest your strategies to see what works and what doesnt.

834,LB,"The Cato Corporation  reverted to the trend of reporting declining comparable-store sales (comps) with a 6% fall in April. The company posted sales of $71.8 million for the four-week period ending May 5, 2018, which dropped 11% from $80.5 million recorded in the prior-year period.Further, the fashion apparel and accessories’ retailer reported sales of $236 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, down 1% from the prior-year period. Quarterly comps also slipped 1% year over year.Management stated that sales for April decreased due to the shift of Easter from April to March in 2018, unlike the previous year. As a result, management combined sales for both months in order to analyze the performance better than last year. Notably, sales for the combined period were down 3%, while comps for the nine-week period ended May 5, 2018 inched up 1%. Further, the company has been witnessing favorable sales trends after the first quarter, which is expected to persist in second-quarter fiscal 2018.Notably, Cato operated 1,351 stores across 33 states as of May 5, 2018 in comparison to 1,374 stores as of April 29, 2017.Retail sector has long been bearing the brunt of changing consumer preferences from offline shopping to online along with lower store traffic and volatile consumer spending. Consequently, retailers are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities to counter such headwinds. Also, they are resorting to store closures to concentrate more on digital spaces with smart phones becoming the primary avenue for making purchases.Due to such woes in the retail space, declining comps have become a major issue for retailers. In fact, Cato has been enduring a long dismal comps trend. Though Cato’s comps grew 6% for March 2018, it waned 5%, 6%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 16%, 16% and 2% for February, January, December, November, October, September, August, July, June, May and April 2017, respectively.The above concerns and disappointing comps trend have deeply hurt investors’ sentiments. Shares of the company have plunged 28.4% in a year against the industry’s gain of 0.2%. Apart from Cato, retailers like L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report), Zumiez Inc.  and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) released their sales data for April. While L Brands reported flat comps year over year, Zumiez and Costco continued with their favorable comps trend, gaining 1.7% and 10.9%, respectively. In fact, mall-based retailer Zumiez reported comps growth for the 14th straight month.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021. Early investors stand to make a killing, but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look.See the pot trades we're targeting>>

835,LB,"The health of the retail industry is an important economic indicator, as it is linked directly to consumers and their propensity to spend. Consumer spending holds the key to the well-being of the U.S. market as it accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity.The link between consumer spending and the retail industry becomes more relevant as retail sales attract approximately 30% of total consumer spending in the United States. Also, the retail industry ranks among the top U.S. industries and employs an enormous workforce, thereby deciding the health of the job market.Before jumping on to the trends in retail, here’s a sneak peek into the key economic indicators, which suggest where the market is heading.On the whole, the U.S. economy is picking up pace. The economic backdrop remains positive with the stock markets surging for most of the past year, wages improving gradually, the unemployment rate at a 17-year low, home prices rising and inflation remaining modest. These factors have changed consumers’ outlook, resulting in more spending as they have more money in their pockets.This is well reflected in the 0.4% or $54.2 billion increase in consumer spending recorded in December, following a gain of 0.8% in November. Further, recent reports indicate that the optimism that built up during the holiday season has carried into January as consumers are no longer wary of shopping and the economy is taking the road uphill.These positives led to a further rise in consumer confidence, which gauges consumers’ optimism on the economy expressed through savings and spending patterns. Per the Conference Board, Consumer Confidence Index showed a marked improvement in January, after witnessing a setback in December. Consumer Confidence rose 2.3 points to 125.4 in January, following a decline to 122.1 in December. Notably, the index rose to 129.5 in November — the highest mark since the increase to 132.6 recorded in November 2000.The primary reason for the surge in the index is consumers’ belief that the pace of growth witnessed in the latter half of 2017 will continue in 2018. This has led consumers to use their savings to make purchases. Notably, U.S. personal savings were 351.6 billion in December, reflecting a decline from $365.1 billion in November. The savings rate dipped to 2.4% of disposable income from 2.5% in November.Moreover, savings for 2017 declined to $485.8 billion (from $680.6 billion in 2016), with the savings rate declining to the decade lowest of 3.4%.The low savings rate led to a rise in imports, brining about a slowdown in economic growth for the fourth quarter. Per the ‘Advance’ estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Jan 26, 2018, the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared with the 3.2% growth in the third quarter of 2017. However, the economy grew 2.3% in 2017, speeding up from 1.5% in 2016.Looking at the broader picture, retailers have been the primary beneficiaries of the recent surge in consumer spending and the uplift of consumer confidence. This was evident from the splendid sales results of retailers in the holiday season. This has turned the tide of the sector, which had been struggling due to soft store traffic and the rise of e-commerce. Moreover, trends witnessed in the holiday season have continued into 2018, making us optimistic about the performance of retailers in 2018.National Retail Federation (“NRF”) recently revealed that retail sales for January remained as strong as the holiday season. Retail sales in January rose 5.4% year over year following a 5.1% unadjusted year-over-year growth in holiday sales during November and December.With consumers feeling good about their financial health and consumer spending reflecting steady growth, NRF predicts retail sales for 2018 to improve between 3.8% and 4.4% from the 2017 level. Notably, retail sales were up 3.9% in 2017 from 2016. Further, online and other non-store sales are likely to witness growth of 10-12% as the definition of retailing continues to evolve.Retail Sector Poised for GrowthThe Retail sector has been witness to some grave changes in 2017. The sector has evolved as a segment where buying and selling is now not restricted to stores alone. The sector now fully lives up to the mantra “Everything Everywhere,” in the real sense.On the face of it, the sector may seem to be an Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)-dominated space, as the company continues to enter every retail category. Moreover, the retail sector has seen some big surprises in 2017, whether store closures, bankruptcies or acquisitions. In fact, it has seen the highest level of consolidation in recent times. However, the trends following the holiday season have been encouraging, with sales picking up and new trends emerging.The recent trends in retail reveal that the sector has become a hub of innovative ideas to create fabulous consumer experiences. To be successful in the current scenario, retailers have to be ready to deliver on consumers’ shopping preferences and behaviors, which are not static.Retailers are scrambling for ways to convert a prospective consumer into a buyer. To do this, brick-and-mortar retailers are increasingly investing in emerging technologies, including social commerce, e-commerce point of sale, face recognition techniques and virtual reality, all of which are likely to change consumers’ retail experience.Further, the companies in the space are optimizing supply chain operations to bridge the gap between demand and delivery. Consequently, retailers are investing in advanced technologies to optimize value chain and retail market share. Today, consumers are on the lookout for convenience, personalization, speed, reasonable price, choice and quality. Though this has bestowed a great challenge on retailers, it also provides opportunities to take more risks and be more innovative.Key Retail MetricsThe key data in retail industry analysis is comparable-store sales (comps) as it excludes sales at newly opened and closed stores. We observe that sales data for the month of January has been encouraging as the aforementioned favorable trends continue to aid top-line growth. Further, most retailers have perked up their expectations following solid comps results. With many retailers having discounted the practice of reporting monthly comps, we only have five of them providing this key metric for January.The list of gainers for January had specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products, L Brands Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) on the top. The company posted comps growth of 7% while sales surged 29.2% to $1,040 million. This marked stellar growth following the 1% increase witnessed in December.Right behind was Washington-based retailer of sports-related teen apparel Zumiez Inc. . The company reported a 6.3% increase in comps, with sales improving 33.6% to $66 million from the year-ago period. This was the company’s 11th straight month of comps growth.This was followed by warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report) that posted a 6% rise in comps for January, while total sales rose 8.4% to $12.24 billion. This reflects continued comps and sales growth since January 2017. Comparable e-commerce sales for the month of January surged 34.8%.At the bottom of the pile, we have The Buckle Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report), which reported a 0.2% increase in comps, following a 4.1% decline in December. Further, net sales rose 27.1% to $55.7 million for January.Lagging behind, apparel and accessories retailer Cato Corp.  continued with its dismal comps trend. Comps for January declined 6%, while sales rose 19% to $45.5 million. We note that the company’s comps have been declining for more than a year, primarily due to a tough apparel retail scenario.Retail/Wholesale Sector – Steady Growth, Valuation StretchedThe Retail and Wholesale is displaying steady growth as is reflected by its performance trend. The sector has outperformed the broader market in the past year. In the said time frame, the sector has surged approximately 31%, while the S&P 500 index has advanced 16.5%.The group’s Zacks Sector Rank shows further optimism. This 218-company sector has seen 110 positive and 62 negative revisions in earnings estimates in the recent past. It carries a Zacks Sector Rank of 2 (out of 16), placing it at the top 13% of the Zacks Rank sectors.However, a look at the sector’s trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is the most reliable multiple to value retail stocks, shows that it is pretty overvalued compared with the S&P 500. The sector has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 30.5, which is above the median level of 27.1.This reflects an unfavorable comparison with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E for the S&P 500 is at 21.3 and the median level is 20.1. The Retail and Wholesale sector’s stretched valuation shows that there is only little upside left for the space when compared with the S&P 500 market index.Zacks Industry Rank – PositiveWithin the Zacks Industry classification, retailers are broadly grouped under the retail and Wholesale sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and are further sub-divided into 18 industries at the expanded (aka “X”) level -- Retail–Computer Hardware, Retail–Home Furnishings, Retail–Discount Stores, Automotive–Retail and Wholesale–Parts, Retail–Mail Order, Building Products–Retail, Automotive–Retail and Wholesale, Retail–Restaurants, Retail–Consumer Electronics, Retail–Jewelry, Internet – Commerce, Retail–Apparel and Shoes, Food–Natural Foods Products, Retail–Pharmacies and Drug Stores, Retail–Miscellaneous, Retail–Supermarkets, Retail–Convenience Stores, Retail – Catalog Shopping, and Retail–Regional Department Stores.We rank all the 250 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies. We put our X industries into two groups: the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.The Zacks Industry Rank is #2 for Automotive–Retail and Wholesale (top 1%), #3 for Retail–Regional Department Stores (top 1%), #5 for Retail–Consumer Electronics (top 2%), #12 for Retail–Miscellaneous (top 5%), #22 for Retail–Discount Stores (top 9%), #33 for Automotive–Retail and Wholesale–Parts (top 13%), #37 for Retail–Computer Hardware (top 14%), #58 for Retail–Home Furnishings (top 23%), #75 for Retail–Apparel and Shoes (top 29%), #83 for Building Products–Retail (top 32%), #86 for Retail–Mail Order (top 34%), #91 for Retail–Restaurants (top 36%), #116 for Food–Natural Foods Products (top 45%), #133 for Internet – Commerce (bottom 48%), #133 for Retail–Pharmacies and Drug Stores (bottom 48%), #133 for Retail–Supermarkets (bottom 48%), #133 for Retail – Catalog Shopping (bottom 48%), #236 for Retail–Jewelry (bottom 8%), and #236 for Retail–Convenience Stores (bottom 8%).On analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for the constituent industries in this space, it is apparent that the overall outlook for the Retail and Wholesale sector is Positive.Sector Level Earnings TrendsThe Q4 earnings season (meaning December-end quarter results) is materially behind us. While majority of the sectors are done with this reporting cycle, we still have reports coming mostly from the retail sector. The Q4 earnings season is tracking to be fabulous in all ways. The quarter clearly points to momentum both for revenues and earnings. The quarter has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive surprises and upward estimate revisions.Notably, first-quarter 2018 estimates have been going up significantly since mid-December. The first-quarter estimates for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors have been rising invariably, with only the Conglomerates, Autos and Consumer Staples sectors witnessing a downtrend. Further, we note that the positive estimate revisions trend is not only confining to the first quarter but also for the following quarters and full-year 2018.As of Feb 16, we have seen results from 398 S&P 500 members, with total earnings for these index members already up 14.5% from the year-ago quarter, and revenues increasing 9%. Of these, approximately 77.9% have delivered positive earnings surprises, while 75.6% beat top-line expectations. The blended beat ratio (companies beating both earnings and revenues) has so far been 62.1%.For Q4 as a whole, total earnings are expected to be up 14% on an 8.2% increase in revenues. This will follow 6.7% earnings growth and 5.8% revenue upside registered in third-quarter 2017.Undoubtedly, the fourth-quarter earnings season is on track to be among the best in recent quarters. The results are better not only in terms of enhanced growth from the same group of 398 index members, but also a greater proportion beating top and bottom-line estimates.Coming to the retail sector, 18 of the 39 retailers in the S&P 500 index have reported earnings so far. Of these, 72.2% of the members posted earnings beat and about 77.8% surpassed revenue estimates. Total earnings for these companies were up 13.1%, on 14.6% revenue growth.Combining results on board and upcoming, earnings for the Retail sector are expected to improve 7.3% in Q4, with revenues anticipated to grow nearly 9%.For more details on earnings of this sector and others, please read our ‘Earnings Preview’ report.Retail Stocks Worth Buying NowThe Retail sector seems to be booming with a stable economy and robust consumer spending and confidence.

836,LB,"Founded in 1963 and headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) is a specialty retailer of women's intimate and other apparel, personal care, home fragrance and beauty products. They own Victoria’s Secret, PINK, Bath & Body Works, La Senza and Henri Bendel brands.The company operates more than 3,000 owned specialty stores in the US, Canada, the UK and China, and its brands are sold in more than 800 additional franchised locations worldwide. Their products are also available online.Weak Guidance Reflects Rising ChallengesThe company posted quarterly earnings of 17 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. However, the earnings were down 48.5% year over year. Revenues were in-line with our estimate.The management cut their FY 2018 guidance. They now expect earnings per share in the range of $2.70 to $3.00 from $2.95 to $3.25 previously.Shares plunged about 7% in the after-hours trading and are now down about 37% this year even though they have rebounded a bit in the last couple days after better-than-expected May sales data.Falling EstimatesAnalysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak guidance.  Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have fallen to $2.82 per share and $2.94 per share from $3.11 and $3.27 respectively, before the report.L Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise L Brands, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | L Brands, Inc. QuoteThe Bottom LineIn addition to disappointing mall traffic, this retailer has been struggling with increased competition, and changing consumer preferences. With tightening labor markets, wage pressure has also started hurting retailers.It would be better for investors to stay away from this stock for the time being. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

837,LB,"The number of earnings reports will drop off notably next week, with just 162 companies confirmed to report. This compares to more than 600 reports this week. Nonetheless, profit results will continue to have influence on the direction of the markets with the likes of Dell (DELL), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report) reporting. 
"
838,LB,"Of course, earnings reports are never released within a vacuum of information and next week will be no different. The economic calendar is booked with inflation reports (PPI on Tuesday and CPI on Thursday), FOMC minutes (Tuesday), New York Fed manufacturing index (Wednesday), industrial production and utilization (Thursday) and October housing starts (Friday). Given that the psychology of the financial markets continues to be very data-dependant, both the equity and bond markets could be volatile next week.
"
839,LB,"Data-dependency can help move stocks, as we have seen major equity indexes rise in response to what has been a good third-quarter earnings season. More companies have beaten expectations than missed. However, some of the choppiness in the markets this week can be attributed to reports that havent been as good as what weve seen over the past several weeks. Specifically, within the Zacks Rank universe1, there were 287 positive surprises and 244 negative surprises this week. The higher proportion of negative surprises caused the ratio of positive to negative surprises for third-quarter earnings season to decline to 1.7:1. (A week ago, the ratio stood at 1.96:1).
"
840,LB,"Growth expectations, however, remain pretty much intact with analysts predicting the average company within the Zacks Rank universe to generate 21.4% growth this year. Looking out into next year, expect 12% growth2.

841,LB,"Companies That Could Surprise During the Week of Nov 13-17
"
842,LB,"Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report) will be one of several retailers to report earnings next week. While I will resist the urge to talk about the possibility of a big surprise, I will point out a very bullish change in earnings estimates. Following announcement of a 5.8% increase in October same-store sales, two of the four covering analysts raised their forecasts for third-quarter results. The current consensus estimate calls for a loss of four cents per share. The most recent consensus is more bullish at a loss of three cents per share. In comparison, the month-old forecast calls for a loss of seven cents per share. (Forecasts for both 2006 and 2007 profits have also been recently raised.) BIG has topped expectations for two consecutive quarters by an average margin of 9.5 cents. Big Lots will report on Thursday, Nov 16. 
"
843,LB,"Limited Brands (LTD) generated same-store sales growth of 9% in October. Based on this data, the company recently raised its forecast for third-quarter earnings to a range of five to seven cents per share. (Previously, LTD had projected breakeven results). Analysts had been ahead of the curve, having adjusted their forecasts for third-quarter earnings upward over the last 60 days. The consensus estimate now calls for profits of seven cents per share. (Forecasts for 2006 and 2007 earnings have also been rising.) LTD has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters by an average margin of five cents. Limited Brands will report on Wednesday, Nov 15, after the close of trading.
"
844,LB,"Those investors looking for a trading opportunity within the tech sector may want to keep their eyes on Nuance Communications (NUAN  -  Free Report). The provider of speech and imaging solutions recently raised its guidance for both fiscal fourth-quarter revenues and losses. NUAN expects GAAP revenues to come in a range of $126 million and $128 million, instead of its previous guidance for sales between $116 million and $120 million. GAAP losses should total between a penny and two cents per share instead of three cents per share. Two of the three covering analysts adjusted their forecasts accordingly to a loss of a penny per share. NUAN has topped expectations during six out of the past seven quarters. Nuance Communications will report on Tuesday, Nov 14, after the close of trading.
"
845,LB,"Target (TGT  -  Free Report) generated same-store sales growth of 3.9% last month. Although the majority of analysts did not change their projections following the announcement of the October data, two analysts did raise their forecasts. The adjustment resulted in a most recent consensus for the third quarter of 55 cents  a penny above the consensus estimate. TGT topped second-quarter results by a penny, but missed first-quarter results by a penny and matched fourth-quarter 2005 results, so this call is admittedly a bit gutsy. Target will report on Tuesday, Nov 14, before the market open.
"
846,LB,"Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report) could miss expectations when it reports next week. In late October, the company warned that revenues would be slightly below its previous guidance because of a decline in sales of chipsets for cellular handsets. Analysts cut their forecasts for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in response, causing the consensus estimate to fall by three cents to 36 cents per share. The most recent consensus, however, is more bearish at 35 cents per share. ADIs fiscal third-quarter earnings were a penny below expectations at 39 cents per share. Analog Devices will report on Tuesday, Nov 14, after the close of trading.

853,LB,"Amid a tough retail landscape Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST  -  Free Report) continued with its solid comparable-store sales (comps) trend in the month of November as well. While major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers switch to online shopping, Costco seems somewhat resilient to the challenging retail backdrop.Improving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in the operator of membership warehouses, while impressive November sales heralds a blissful holiday season ahead. As a result, the stock has increase roughly 4.3% since Nov 29, 2017, when the company announced sales results.Shares of Costco have outpaced the Zacks Retail-Discount Industry in a year gaining from sturdy comps performance. In a year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has advanced 22%, while the industry, which occupies a space in the top 20% (50 out of 256) among the Zacks classified industries, has gained 6.1%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sturdy Comps PerformanceComps for four-week ended Nov 26, 2017 increased 10.8%, following an increase of 7.5% in October, 8.9% in September, 7.3% in August, 6.2% in July, 6% in June, 4.1% in May, 3% in April, 6% in March, 4% in February and 7% in January.The company generated net sales of $11.26 billion in November, up 13.2% year over year. Notably, net sales increased 10.1%, 12.1%, 10%, 8.8%, 7%, 7%, 5%, 9%, 8% and 9% in October, September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively. Comparable e-commerce sales for the month under review surged 39%.Comps for November reflect an increase of 10.2%, 13.8% and 11.1% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and gasoline prices, Costco’s comps for the month under review rose 7.9%. The company recorded comps increase of 8.4%, 6.3% and 7.2% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations.For the 12-week period, Costco reported 10.5% jump in comps, displaying an increase of 10.3%, 11.3% and 10.1% at the United States, Canada and Other International locations. Net sales for the period came in at $31.13 billion, an increase of 13.3% from the year-ago period.Wrapping UpWe believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. The company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track as cash-strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low-cost necessities. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, U.K., Mexico, Korea and Taiwan.We believe that the hike in annual membership fees and increased penetration of Citi Visa co-brand card program will benefit the stock. We are also encouraged by Costco’s expansion strategy, as it remains committed to opening new clubs and expanding e-commerce capabilities.Costco, which competes with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), operates 746 warehouses, comprising 518 warehouses in the United States and Puerto Rico, 98 in Canada, 37 in Mexico, 28 in UK, 26 in Japan, 13 in Korea, 13 in Taiwan, nine in Australia, two in Spain, one in Iceland and one in France.Apart from Costco, L Brands, Inc.

855,LB,"The overlooked Deep Value ETF (DVP  -  Free Report), which carries an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a High risk outlook, emerged as the best-performing ETF of November. It gained 11.6%.Most of the gains came in the first half as concerns over the delay in implementation of corporate tax cuts and the sell-off in high yield bonds made investors jittery, triggering the demand for value stocks. Additionally, the recent technology rout and North Korea new missile tests led to a further increase in demand (read: Value ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Tax Cut Delay Concerns).Honing in on value securities ensures a safety net for investors as it includes stocks with strong fundamentals – earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow – that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market, In fact, value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of DVP.DVP in FocusThis ETF offers exposure to undervalued dividend paying stocks in the S&P 500 with solid balance sheets, earnings and strong free cash flow. It tracks the performance of the TWM Deep Value Index, charging investors 80 bps in annual fees. The product is home to 20 stocks with none accounting for more than 8.1% of the assets. It has amassed $104.3 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of 6,000 shares a day.DVP is a large cap centric fund, which tend to be the most stable in an adverse economic scenario while at the same time offer capital appreciation in a booming market (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Though most of the stocks in the fund’s portfolio delivered strong returns, a few were the real stars.

856,LB,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23, after the market closes. Last quarter, this multi-channel specialty retailer of premium quality home products delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.25%.The company surpassed earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.05%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Williams-Sonoma, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayWilliams-Sonoma has been witnessing soft comparable brand revenues for quite some time now. The rate of increase of comparable brand revenues has decreased significantly from 7.1% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015 and 0.7% in 2016. Comparable brand revenues inched up 0.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, significantly lower than the 4.5% rise in the preceding quarter. The rate of comparable brand revenue increase has softened across all the brands over the years.However, Williams-Sonoma is focused on enhancing customer experience through improved and innovative marketing techniques. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company increased its digital advertising spend, which led to strong growth across all brands. To enhance customer experience, the company is using web tools that utilize augmented reality, creating videos on social media sites and making digital advertisements. This will help the company to generate higher sales in the to-be-reported quarter. The company will continue to strengthen its competitive advantages through innovation in e-commerce in the upcoming quarters.The company expects net revenue in the range of $1.195-$1.230 billion against $1.159 billion reported in the prior-year quarter. Comparable brand revenues are likely to grow in the 2% to 5% range (higher than 0.6% growth seen in the prior-year quarter). Finally, the company expects earnings per share between 55-61 cents in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (against 58 cents reported in the prior year quarter).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal second-quarter earnings has been stable at 59 cents per share over the past 60 days. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 1.2%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.2 billion for the said quarter, reflecting a 3.7% increase from a year ago.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Williams-Sonoma is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at -0.08%.Zacks Rank: Williams-Sonoma currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Although a Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Other Releases in the Retail-Wholesale SectorRoss Stores, Inc.

858,LB,"Under Armour, Inc. (UAA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average of 33.2%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 1 cent down from 23 cents reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,308 million, almost flat from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWe believe fourth-quarter results are likely to be impacted by weakness in North American business. Decline in sales in North America has been a major concern in the past few quarters. The company has been reporting sluggish sales from the region since fourth-quarter 2016. In third-quarter 2017, sales from North America declined 12.1% and operating income slumped 64%. This dismal showing can be attributed to bankruptcies, store closures, decrease in productivity and demand along with change in fashion preference.Further, Under Armour has been grappling with higher interest expense as a result of increased debt level. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s interest expenses increased to nearly $9.6 million in comparison with $8.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, it anticipates interest expenses to rise to roughly $35 million in 2017 from $26.4 million in 2016. Gross margin, a key financial metric determining a company’s basic financial health, has consistently declined in the past few quarters. In third-quarter 2017, gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 46.2% following a decline of 190 bps and 70 bps in the second and first quarter, respectively. The company expects gross margin to decline in fourth-quarter 2017.These factors have been well reflected in the company’s stock price performance. Evidently, Under Armour’s shares have plunged over 26.9% in the past six months against the industry’s growth of 10.7%.However, Under Armour’s sustained focus on brand development, expansion of direct-to-consumer and technology-based fitness businesses look encouraging.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Under Armour this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Under Armour has an Earnings ESP of -63.46%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Foot Locker, Inc.

864,LB,"March shone bright on renewed consumer spending, reversing the three-quarter spell of declines with a sharp uptick in retail sales. The Commerce Department said that U.S. retail and food services sales advanced 0.6% to $494.6 billion last month, following a respective decline of 0.1% and 0.2% in February and January. Consumer outlays rose on the back of a strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising income.This definitely brings good tidings for investors who closely track the Retail-Wholesale sector. Analysts pointed that the sales pickup may not enhance retailers’ first-quarter performance much but it definitely indicates that Americans are more confident now. Certainly, this positive sentiment is likely to translate into higher consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy.Given the favorable backdrop, the sector is likely to catch investors’ attention this reporting cycle. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year earnings growth of 12%, per the latest Earnings Outlook. This shows a significant improvement from the previous quarter’s earnings growth of 3%. The top line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% in the preceding quarter.So, picking stocks that are likely to trump estimates can fetch handsome returns for investors. This is because a stock generally picks up steam on an earnings beat. On the flip side, not all retail companies are going to beat or meet expectations. There will be some slow coaches. Apparently, dodging stocks with lower earnings beat predictability will definitely minimize the risks to your portfolio.We can identify the probable underperformers before they report by combining our proprietary Zack Rank and Earnings ESP system.

865,LB,"The Cato Corporation  has reversed its long standing trend of declining comparable-store sales (comps) with growth of 6% for March. The fashion apparel and accessories’ retailer also posted sales of $96.9 million for the five-week period (ended Apr 7, 2018), which grew 4% from $93.1 million recorded in five weeks ended Apr 1, 2017.Upbeat comps in the month were driven by the shift of Easter from April to March in 2018, unlike the previous year. However, this uptrend does not seem to last longer as management expects comps for April to decline in high single digits.Due to the Easter shift, management intends to combine sales for March and April in order to analyze the company’s performance better compared with last year. Incidentally, comps for the combined period are expected to be down in low single digits.Retail sector has long been bearing the brunt of evolving consumer preferences toward online shopping, lower store traffic and volatile consumer spending. Consequently, retailers are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities to counter these headwinds. Also, they are resorting to store closures to focus more on digital channels as smart phones started becoming the primary avenue to make purchases.Notably, Cato operated 1,351 stores across 33 states as of Apr 7, 2018, down from 1,373 stores as of April 1, 2017.These factors adversely weighed upon the company’s performance in terms of dismal sales and comps trend. As a result, Cato’s merchandise margins remain pressurized, which might dent overall profitability.In a year’s time, shares of Cato have lost 24% against the industry’s gain of 7.2%.Apart from Cato, retailers like L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report), Zumiez Inc.  and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) recently came out with their sales data for March. While L Brands reported an equal increase in comps as Cato, Zumiez and Costco continued with their favorable comps trend, surging 12.6% and 8.6%, respectively. In fact, mall-based retailer Zumiez marked 13th straight month of comps growth.A glance at the stocks’ price performance reveals that L Brands has lost 23.8% in a year. Meanwhile, Zumiez and Costco gained 47.1% and 11.8%, respectively, amid retail hurdles.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider.

867,LB,"L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for LB broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 23.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for LB stock.If that wasn’t enough, L Brands isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 11 estimates have been reduced, while one has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead.

868,LB,"Despite undertaking several strategic measures to drive performance, L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) has failed to impress investors. The stock has witnessed a sharp decline of 36.7% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s fall of 7.1%. The company’s recent performance indicates that it may take some more time to adjust to changing retail landscape.However, other stocks such as Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), Zumiez Inc.  and Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report), belonging to the same industry, have witnessed a rally of 20.1%, 13.3% and 35.4% in the past three months, respectively. Today, we will focus on L Brands and try to analyze the factors that are keeping investors away from the stock.More Pain AheadIn spite of beating estimates for earnings and sales in the fourth quarter of 2017, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s stock was affected by dismal first-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook. Per management, it anticipates first-quarter comps in low-single digits. Earnings per share are envisioned in the range of 15-20 cents, down from 33 cents in the year-ago quarter.For fiscal 2018, the company expects comps to increase in the 2-4%, range while sales are estimated to be 2 points higher than comps. Management projects earnings in the band of $2.95-$3.25 per share, compared with $3.20 last year.Analysts were expecting the company to be back on track after disappointing performances in the past few quarters. However, a dismal outlook forced them to slash their estimates. In the past 30 days, the company’s fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings estimate have moved down 31 cents and 32 cents to $3.17 and $3.42, respectively. In the same time frame, first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings estimate have declined to 19 cents from 32 cents, respectively. Further, gross margin, which contracted in all of the four quarters in fiscal 2016, disappointed investors in 2017. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin contracted 320, 120, 190 and 100 basis points (bps) to 37.1%, 37.3%, 37.8% and 42.3%, respectively.The downside was primarily caused by buying and occupancy expenditure deleverage in the quarter. The metric was affected by fall in merchandise margin rate. Management expects first quarter fiscal 2018 gross margin rate to decline year over year, due to fall in merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses.Performance of Victoria’s Secret has been a cause of concern for quite some time. In an effort to streamline Victoria’s Secret business, the company made some strategic changes in 2016. However, these efforts are yet to show fruitful results. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, sales at Victoria’s Secret Stores declined 1.2% to $2,038.3 million, while Victoria's Secret direct sales were up 19.9% to $630.6 million. Total Victoria’s Secret sales rose 3.1% to $2,668.9 million, while comparable sales fell 1%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here..Bottom LineUndoubtedly, the aforementioned factors are enough to unnerve investors. Nevertheless, L Brands continues to revamp business by improving store experience, localizing assortments and enhancing direct business. The company is focusing on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise and speed-to-market initiatives.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

869,LB,"L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) witnessed an increase in comparable sales (comps) for the third consecutive month as it reported February sales numbers. Comps for the four-week period (ended Mar 3, 2018) rose 3%, after registering an increase of 7% and 1% in January and December, respectively. We note that rate of comps growth has decelerated from the month of January.Net sales, in the month under review, also surged 11.5% to $853.9 million. While, comps increased 2% at Victoria’s Secret, the same at Bath & Body Works improved 7%.Victoria’s Secret merchandise margin rate decreased significantly in February primarily due to rise in promotional activities. However, in case of Bath & Body Works, merchandise margin rate was flat in the same time period compared with last year.Moreover, L Brands announced new share buyback program worth $250 million, which includes $23.1 million remaining under the previous program.Stock PerformanceEver since the company announced fourth-quarter results on Feb 28, shares of this specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care products have declined 15.6%. Moreover, in a month, the stock has declined 14.5% wider than the industry’s decrease of 0.5%. The decrease in stock price can be primarily attributed to soft first-quarter and fiscal 2018 outlook. Per L Brands, first-quarter comps are anticipated to be in low-single digits. Sales are projected to be nearly 5 points higher than comps. Further, gross margin is expected to decline marginally due to a fall in merchandise margin rate, somewhat offset by lower buying and occupancy expenses. Earnings per share are envisioned in the range of 15-20 cents versus 33 cents in the year-ago quarter.For fiscal 2018, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s Gross margin rate is anticipated to remain flat compared with the prior-year tally.

870,LB,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put L Brands, Inc. (LB  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, L Brands has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.0, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 21.0. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts L Brands’ current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 18.6) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that L Brands has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for L Brands’ stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, L Brands has a P/S ratio of about 1.0. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, L Brands currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LB a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for L Brands is just 1.2, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.7. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.2, which is marginally better than the industry average of 8.3. Clearly, LB is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though L Brands might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of F and a Momentum score of D. This gives LB a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of D. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and five lower, while the full year estimate has seen five upward and five downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined about 31.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has fallen about 3.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:L Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus  L Brands, Inc. Price and Consensus | L Brands, Inc. QuoteThis bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineL Brands is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a decent industry rank (top 40% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than Visa The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

872,LB,"Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) has been benefiting from its impressive comps performance for a long time. Comps remained robust mainly owing to competitive pricing and its strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. Additionally, favorable margin trends have been aiding the company’s bottom-line performance. Dollar Tree is also poised to gain from the integration of Family Dollar.Let’s analyze the factors driving the company performance.Robust Comps GrowthDollar Tree has maintained an impressive comps performance for the past several quarters. Evidently, it has delivered comps growth for the 39th straight quarter. In the third quarter fiscal 2017, the company witnessed consolidated comps growth of 3.2% and 3.3% in constant currency. This solid comps growth can be attributed to improved customer count and average ticket. While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 5% (in constant-currency), the same at the Family Dollar banner climbed 1.5%. For fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017, the company anticipates comps growth in a low-single digit range.Of late, the retail sector on the whole has witnessed favorable comps trend, particularly in the holiday season and in January 2018. The companies note that the robust consumer spending and other economic factors that aided performance in the holiday season have continued into 2018 as well. Notably, some other players that witnessed favorable comps growth in January are Zumiez, Inc. , Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) and L Brands Inc. (LB  -  Free Report), which recorded comps growth of 6.3%, 6% and 7%, respectively.Robust Surprise Trend & Solid OutlookDollar Tree has witnessed a spectacular surprise trend recently, with second straight earnings and sales beat in third-quarter fiscal 2017. The company’s results gained from strong comps and improved margins. In third-quarter fiscal 2017, gross margin expanded 90 basis points on reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses, as a percentage of sales. Further, positive impact from Canadian currency fluctuations aided results.Driven by the solid quarterly results and progress on Family Dollar integration, the company raised guidance for fiscal 2017 and provided a solid view for the fourth quarter. The company anticipates comps growth in a low-single digit range for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017. Further, Dollar Tree anticipates the additional 53rd week to increase sales by $400-$430 million and earnings by 19-22 cents per share.Family Dollar Integration Augur WellDollar Tree is befitting from the ongoing integration of Family Dollar that was acquired in July 2015. In the third quarter, sales from the Family Dollar banner notably represented nearly 50% of the company’s consolidated sales. Additionally, the company is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. Evidently, the company renovated 191 Family Dollar stores in the third quarter and intends to complete 350 renovations in fiscal 2017.Also, the company is on track with the Family Dollar integration and re-banner process, which is likely to generate run rate savings of about $300 million in three years. The combined chain, on the completion of the integration, will be positioned to reach out to more value-seeking consumers through a network spanning across vast geographies.Store Expansion PlansDollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements. Moreover, the company leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets. Notably, Dollar Tree opened 169 new stores and expanded or relocated 23 stores during the third quarter. Meanwhile, the company remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States.Bottom LineWhile all is well with Dollar Tree, volatile consumer behavior remains a concern. Also, significant global exposure may pose threats. However, the company’s solid comps growth, expansion of stores, improved margins and solid acquisitions paves the path for long-term growth.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All  Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.
