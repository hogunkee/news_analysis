Newell rallied back above its 10- and 40-week moving averages as it works on a consolidation.China-based online retail giant JD.com (JD) surged 7% at the open. The company's first report according to GAAP rules showed it turning to a profit from a year-ago loss and posting a 41% increase in revenue. Both results were better than expected. The stock is well-extended from a February breakout and a March rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Mallinckrodt (MNK) climbed 1% as its fiscal second-quarter revenue and earnings growth bested views. The stock is trying to form a bottom in a deep, two-year-old consolidation.Petmed Express (PETS) jumped 9% in early action as fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue cleared expectations by wide margins, and management raised its quarterly dividend by a penny, to 20 cents a share.

21,SYY,"If you're generating steady income from a dividend stock, it doesn't matter what the company's fundamentals or technicals look like. Or does it?Many income investors may be content with a steady dividend payer even if the stock is a laggard when it comes to price performance. But stock price depreciation could erase some or all of that dividend income each quarter. To maximize your total return, it makes sense to focus on potential outperformers that offer a payout.""Without question, the most important factors income investors should look for with dividend stocks are fundamental factors,"" Robert Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services, told IBD. ""In recent years, the price-earnings ratios on these stocks have been driven up to historically high levels ... because high-quality bonds were simply not providing the level of yields that many investors were looking for.""Click Here For A List Of Top Performing Dividend StocksSo how should one search for quality dividend stocks? IBD's daily Dividend Leaders, REIT Leaders and Utility Leaders screens offer a good starting point. The companies making the screens meet certain fundamental criteria and pay a yield in line with or higher than the S&P 500's average, which is currently 1.99%.

Is it one of the leaders in an outperforming industry group? Is there recent news that could affect the company?Study its price and volume action on a chart. Bookmark The Income Investor column and check back for an in-depth look at a different dividend stock each day.IBD's proprietary Composite Rating is a useful tool to quickly identify quality stocks. It takes a stock's key ratings — Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity, Accumulation/Distribution — and combines them into a single rating on a scale from 99 (best) to 1 (worst). The rating also takes into consideration price performance by measuring how far a stock is from its 52-week high. The closer it is to the high, chances are its overall rating will be higher.Be sure to keep an eye on the overall market as well as news or other factors that could affect a stock's industry group. For instance, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-point at its Dec. 13-14 monetary policy meeting.""Investors should operate under the premise that rates will rise, not only in December, but for the foreseeable future,"" Johnson said. ""I would expect financial stocks — banks and insurance companies, in particular — to benefit the most from the expected increase in rates.""In fact, bank stocks have staged a strong rally since midyear as the likelihood of higher rates increased.President-elect Trump's proposals for tax cuts and increased military and infrastructure spending could affect dividend stocks too.""If he is able to push this agenda through, it would likely lead to an increase in inflation and higher inflation rates,"" Johnson said. ""As rates increase, we will likely see a rotation out of high-dividend yielding stocks and into the bond market.""The accompanying chart shows the Dividend Leaders with the biggest year-to-date price gains through Dec. 8.Topping the list is Oneok (OKE), which has surged 134% this year to nearly 58. The Tulsa, Okla.-based natural gas gatherer has a hefty 4.3% dividend yield. And its dividend growth rate is 22%. Shareholders would have soundly beaten the market twice with this stock — in terms of stock price appreciation and a big yield. Per-share earnings fell 17% last year as oil and gas transport/pipeline stocks skidded, but analysts expect a 12% EPS gain this year and 8% in 2017. Fair warning, though: This stock has been no steady eddy and must be watched. It plunged from a peak of 71.19 in September 2014 to a low of 18.24 in December 2015.That's followed by Spectra Energy (SE), another natgas gatherer and distributor, up 72% year to date to about 41. Shares are working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 44.10. The stock is 6% off its 52-week high. The Houston-based company's payout is 4% on an annual basis. Full-year profit slipped the past two years but is projected to resume growth with a 1% increase this year and 21% the next. Spectra yields 4.0% and has a dividend growth rate of 9%.Chip designer Qualcomm (QCOM), which has seen its share price rise 37% this year to 68.33, also made the list. The San Diego-based company has paid dividends each year since 2003; its current annualized yield is 3.1% and its dividend growth rate is 22%.Qualcomm has posted double-digit earnings growth the past two quarters after four quarters of year-over-year declines. That trend is expected to continue with a 22% EPS gain in the current period and 15% in fiscal Q2.Hasbro (HAS) has advanced 29% so far this year to 86.78 as it shapes the right side of a base with a potential entry at 88.63. The Pawtucket, R.I.-based toymaker offers a 2.4% dividend yield and a dividend growth rate of 10%.It has a three-year earnings growth rate of 13% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 12 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). Analysts forecast EPS will rise 18% this year and 9% the next.A few S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — companies that have increased their dividends each year for the past 25 consecutive years — make the list too. Illinois Tool Works (ITW) and Sysco (SYY) are two such classic income plays. They have advanced 37% and 33% this year, respectively, and pay annualized dividends of 2% and 2.4%.RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingProfits From Stock Gains And Augment A Low-Yielding Portfolio

23,SYY,"In just the past year and a half, antitrust concerns have undone or jeopardized several merger deals, adding to doubts that AT&T (T) can consummate its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner (TWX).AT&T agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Time Warner, but the media giant's stock fell 3.1% to 86.74 on the stock market today, well below the bid price and an indication investors are skeptical that the deal will go through. AT&T fell 1.7% to 36.68. Still, the companies see the deal closing in late 2017.The Obama administration has become more aggressive on mergers and acquisitions lately, either suing to block them or demanding conditions that were too onerous to accept. Donald Trump has said he would block an AT&T-Time Warner deal as president, while Hillary Clinton has voiced concerns.In February  2014, Comcast (CMCSA) agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, combining the top two cable and broadband providers. The Federal Communications Commission raised concerns, with consumer groups and Netflix (NFLX) also objecting. With regulators expected to block the deal outright, Comcast gave up in April 2015.Charter Communications (CHTR) moved in, agreeing in May 2015 to buy TWC. That deal closed in May 2016.In November 2015, Pfizer (PFE) reached a deal to buy Allergan (AGN) for $160 billion in a so-called tax inversion that would've allowed Pfizer to change its domicile to Ireland and slash its tax bill.The deal, which would've created the world's largest drugmaker, came at a time when politicians were already bashing tax inversions. The Treasury Department introduced a series of new rules that made inversions less attractive.In April, Pfizer walked away from the deal, citing the Treasury rules.RELATED:Forget Allergan: Pfizer Has Its Sights On This Cancer Drugmaker Allergan, Pfizer Strike Off Down Separate Paths After Merger Killed As crude prices were collapsing in November 2014, oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) agreed to buy rival Baker Hughes (BHI) in a deal that was worth $34.6 billion at the time. It also would've put the combined companies above Schlumberger (SLB), prompting regulators to warn of a duopoly.Halliburton scrambled to find buyers for assets it sought to shed to win regulatory approval. But the Justice Department reportedly pushed Halliburton to sell more than $7.5 billion in assets to a single buyer.Then in April, the DOJ filed a lawsuit to block the merger, and in May the companies called off the deal, which by then was worth about $28 billion.RELATED:Why Halliburton's Failed Buyout May Actually Hurt CompetitionHalliburton Eyes New Deals After Ending Baker Hughes Bid In February 2015, Staples (SPLS) agreed to buy Office Depot (ODP) for $6 billion as the retailers faced pressure from e-commerce rivals like Amazon (AMZN).It was their second attempt. An earlier one was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission in 1997, but Staples and Office Depot said this time was different because the industry landscape was completely different, citing Amazon and other competitors.The FTC disagreed and sued in December 2015. In May, a judge sided with the federal government.In September 2014, General Electric (GE) inked an agreement to sell its home appliance business to Electrolux (ELUXY) for $3.3 billion as the industrial conglomerate sought to shed noncore assets and focus on areas like aviation, power systems, and oil and gas.The DOJ sued in July 2015, saying the merger would hurt consumers. Before a judge could rule on the lawsuit, GE walked away in December. The next month, GE sold the unit to China's Haier for $5.4 billion.In December 2013, top food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy rival US Foods for $3.5 billion. In February 2015, the FTC sued, arguing that a merger of the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the market would result in higher prices for restaurants, hotels and other companies that buy food and related supplies.In June 2015, Sysco abandoned the deal after a judge ruled in favor of the FTC.In July 2015, Anthem (ANTM) said it would buy Cigna (CI) for $54 billion, creating the largest health insurer by membership. It came just three weeks after Aetna (AET) reached a deal to acquire Humana (HUM) for $37 billion. The consolidation efforts came as the health sector struggled to find savings and address higher-than-anticipated costs associated with ObamaCare mandates.In July, the DOJ filed lawsuits to block both deals, saying much of the U.S. health insurance market would be controlled by just three companies. But in August, the DOJ signaled it might be willing to reach a settlement with Anthem and Cigna to allow their merger.In October 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) said it plans to buy Rite Aid (RAD) for $17 billion, bringing together the No. 2 and No. 3 drugstore chains and leapfrogging No. 1 CVS Health (CVS).Walgreens has been looking for buyers who could help the company offload stores and pass regulatory muster. Management is also in talks with the FTC and appeared to be making progress this summer.But Kroger (KR) seems unwilling to buy hundreds of stores that Walgreens and Rite Aid are trying to divest. Kroger had been interested, but wanted to close the locations and reopen them in its grocery stores. The FTC wants to preserve the stand-alone drugstores, sources told the New York Post.

25,SYY,"Samsung, Hitachi and Tokyo Electron will likely mount a regulatory attack on Lam Research's (LRCX) $10.6 billion bid to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), but that's only if U.S. regulators don't kill the deal that would unite two of the largest makers of chip-manufacturing equipment, analysts said Thursday.KLA stock fell 2.8% to 67.51 in the the stock market today after toppling 10% on Wednesday when Lam said that regulatory hurdles in South Korea, China and/or Japan might extend the merger's close beyond the Oct. 20 deadline.Lam stock fell 4.5% Wednesday, and closed down 0.25% to 88.89. Shares are 6% extended from an 83.93 entry point achieved June 2. KLA stock, on the other hand, is down more than 8%, in a sell zone, from a 73.69 buy point hit June 20.The Lam-KLA merger has been riddled with antitrust concerns since its announcement last October. This is the third time the deal has been delayed, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research report Thursday.Shah downgraded Lam stock to neutral from buy and cut his price target to 85 from 95.IBD'S TAKE: Lam stock has a high IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it performs in the top 10% of all stocks. KLA stock trails with a CR of 84.In May, the U.S. Department of Justice sent a ""second request"" asking for more information into Lam's plan to buy KLA, likely over antitrust issues.Combined, Lam-KLA would have a $25 billion market cap, trailing leaders ASML (ASML) and Applied Materials (AMAT) with $46.9 billion and $29 billion, respectively. The duo would have 21% market share and be No. 1 or No. 2 in three out of four major manufacturing process steps.""This announcement reinforces a growing trend of skepticism from the DOJ that merger remedies will be sufficient to prevent higher prices,"" Shah wrote. ""Recent examples include Halliburton (HAL)-Baker Hughes (BHI), Sysco Foods (SYY)-US Foods (USFD) and Albertsons-Safeway.""Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire noted KLA could ask Lam for more money or terminate the deal. Unlike Applied Materials abandoning its bid on Tokyo Electron in the face of antitrust concerns, Lam can't easily walk away from KLA.And foreign regulators are just as apt as U.S. regulators to question the antitrust angle, Maire wrote in a research note.""We are sure that Samsung is pushing Korean regulators for two pounds of flesh,"" he wrote. ""And Japanese regulators are probably well aware of the 'fox guarding the hen house' problem from both Tokyo Electron and Hitachi.""

29,SYY,"Stocks held onto modest gains at midday Monday following a weaker-than-expected U.S. manufacturing report.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were each up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq edged up 0.1%. Volume was running below Friday's levels on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq.The Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index slid in April to 50.8, trailing estimates for 51.5. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.The weaker-than-expected data added to uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve interest-rate policy. The central bank held rates steady last week amid concerns about the outlook for the U.S. economy.Retail and food stocks were among the day's best performers. Several have gotten a boost from strong earnings reports.Amazon.com (AMZN) rose more than 2%, building on Friday's 10% jump following a blowout quarterly earnings report. The Internet retail giant is 12% past a 603.34 buy point of a cup-with-handle base, well out of buying range.B&G Foods (BGS), a maker of hot sauces, jellies and other packaged foods, was up nearly 2% after rocketing 23% higher on Friday and clearing a 40.60 cup-base buy point on strong Q1 results. The stock is at a new all-time high and is still within the 5% buy zone.Food distributor Sysco (SYY) also hit a new high Monday after climbing more than 4% on a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report. It's extended from a rebound off support at its 10-week moving average.Most IBD 50 stocks were higher, with Cambrex (CBM) leading the way, edging up less than 1% after paring an earlier 6% gain.

"
30,SYY,"Federal regulators have been on a roll when it comes to blocking proposed megamergers.The Staples (SPLS)-Office Depot (ODP) deal is simply the latest casualty. The victims have come from all walks of corporate life, from oilfield services giants Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cable television titans Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner Cable (TWC).Several more big takeovers are threatened. Health insurance behemoths Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) are looking to recite corporate nuptials as are Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM), but already regulators are whispering their concerns. The  Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)-Rite Aid (RAD) deal also is in doubt.Is it politics, or happenstance? San Diego State University finance professor Nikhil Varaiya, an expert on M&A activity, cautions not to read too much into it even though there has been heightened scrutiny of mergers in the last year of the Obama administration. Varaiya agrees there's been more activity, but says it usually depends on the individual circumstances.""(It) could be because these companies are trying to merge in this time period,"" he said. ""Halliburton’s merger attempt, for example, reflected the lower demand for oil and their trying to reduce capacity. The concern by regulators might be that when the oil markets pick up, they might have a dominant company.""Halliburton and Baker Hughes called off their $28 billion merger on May 1, citing tough resistance from U.S. and European regulators. Still, Varaiya noted that future Justice Department actions on proposed mergers could hinge in part on who comes into power in the fall.""Any Democrat administration tends to be more concerned about concentration and competitiveness,"" Varaiya said. ""So it's likely they will bring more cases before a judge.""U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington late Tuesday agreed with Federal Trade Commission regulators that the pairing of Staples and Office Depot would violate antitrust laws and reduce competition.Shares of Staples gapped down 18% to 8.37 in the stock market Wednesday after the office supply giants announced they would no longer try to merge. Office Depot plunged 40% to 3.62.Roy Behren, partner and portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Funds in Valhalla, N.Y., said it would have been hard for Staples and Office Depot to satisfy the FTC.""In the case of Office Depot, which we have been monitoring carefully but declined to invest in because it involved creation of a monopoly, you essentially had the two main players in the market. That would create problematic market power,"" Behren said.But Behren doesn't rule out political influence in all cases.""We view that the Bush administration was much less inclined to prosecute what they perceived as antitrust or market concentration,"" he said. ""Obama administration regulators were aware in the case of Baker Hughes that Halliburton had agreed to divest $7 billion of revenue to get this done. That still didn’t get the job done.""Behren said the most scrutinized transaction at the moment is the Walgreens Boost Alliance deal to buy smaller drug store chain Rite Aid. Walgreens has agreed to divest stores to get the $17 billion deal done, but regulators are still scrutinizing it.""It’s possible that structural remedies could satisfy regulators,"" he said.Meanwhile, the list of failed mergers gets longer. General Electric's (GE) proposed sale of its appliance business to Sweden's Electrolux fell through in December after the Justice Department said the deal would unfairly reduce competition in that sector and asked a federal judge to block it. Last year's $3.5 billion bid by privately held US Foods for rival Sysco (SYY) was blocked on grounds that it would have created a food distribution behemoth.No. 1 cable company Comcast's $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable was turned down in late August of last year after regulators threatened to issue a hearing designation that would have delayed its consideration for months or years.Instead, last Friday the FCC OK'd Charter Communications' (CHTR) offer for TWC, and Charter's separate purchase of Bright House Networks. The combined deals, valued at nearly $79 billion, will create the No. 2 cable TV and Internet provider, the FCC said.The DOJ also is eyeing health insurance consolidation.No. 3 U.S. insurer by revenue Aetna agreed to merge with Humana in a deal valued at $34 billion. But William Baer, assistant attorney general, said during a Senate subcommittee hearing last week that the proposed tie-up would be ""very, very carefully"" scrutinized.No. 2 insurer Anthem hammered out a deal with another major player, Cigna. But in a regulatory filing this month, Cigna said ""In light of the complexity of the regulatory process and dynamic environment, it is possible that such approvals may not be obtained in 2016.""Michael Shannon, another Westchester Capital managing partner and portfolio manager, said that with the national elections just months away some candidates are talking tough about regulating mergers.""In past elections, parties (running for office) would talk, saying we’re going to do this or do that. But regulators are under the law,"" Shannon said. ""At the end of the day, you can’t just rule as you want to.""

31,SYY,"Food distributor Sysco (SYY) agreed to buy Brakes Group for $3.1 billion, including Brakes' $2.3 billion debt, significantly expanding Sysco's global footprint. But shares fell sharply as investors questioned the timing, price and lack of synergies.The acquisition from private equity firm Bain Capital bolsters Sysco’s current presence in the U.K. and Ireland, also enabling it to expand further into Europe, including Brakes' operations in France, Sweden, Spain and other European countries.Sysco tried and failed last year to buy US Foods, a privately held food distributor with $19 billion a year in sales. Sysco announced it was ending its bid for that company after a U.S. District Court granted the Federal Trade Commission's request to block the planned $3.5 billion buyout in late June.Analysts on the call discussing the deal wondered if this was a good time for a deal, noting that Sysco was paying 12 times EBITDA (adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Unlike the US Foods deal, Sysco isn't expecting major synergies from the Brakes deal.Sysco shares sank 4.9% to 42.79 in the stock market today after falling to 42.05 intraday. That briefly undercut a recent 42.13 buyout point, but closed above that key level. Sysco shot up 8.4% on Feb. 1 on its Q4 earnings report, breaking out of a consolidation.The combination would create a food distribution giant with about $55 billion annual sales and operations in North and South America, as well as Europe. Sysco sees the acquisition as being immediately accretive to earnings once the deal closes, which is expected around mid-2016.London-based Brakes employs about 15,000 and distributes fresh, refrigerated and frozen-food products, as well as non-food products and supplies to more than 50,000 customers throughout Europe.""We expect to retain key members of Brakes Group’s talented leadership team,"" Sysco CEO Bill DeLaney said in a written statement, ""and to experience little distraction from integration, given the minimal overlap of the businesses.""
"
32,SYY,"Meat producer Tyson Foods (TSN) and food wholesaler Sysco (SYY) set record highs Friday as both stocks continue to benefit from favorable industry trends as well as the relative safety of the food segment in an otherwise rocky market.Tyson shares rose just a penny but still set a fresh closing high of 62.97 on the stock market today. It was the fourth straight session in which the supplier of beef, pork, chicken and other products established a new record.Sysco, which distributes food to restaurants, hospitals, schools and other customers, closed up 1.1% to a new high of 44.99 Friday. It was the fifth straight record session for Sysco.Tyson and Sysco join Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM) among large-cap food stocks that have set new highs this month.The entire sector has gotten a lift from the defensive nature of the food business, analysts say. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food, which are less susceptible to wide fluctuations and also tend to pay regular dividends.Food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs. This is especially important to companies like Sysco that move a lot of product from one place to another.Meanwhile, companies such as Tyson have gotten a lift from falling food costs. A large supply of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans has lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork -- a big reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month.IBD’s Wholesale-Foods group ranks at No. 3 out of 197 industry groups tracked.

35,SYY,"When it comes to mature markets, it doesn’t get much more mature than breakfast cereal, which was first introduced in the U.S. during the Civil War.That kind of mileage makes it difficult for leading cereal makers such as Post Holdings (POST) -- which traces its history to 1895 -- to find growth through the kinds of disruptive, gee-whiz advances you’ll find in other sectors of the economy. There’s only so many flavors you can pull out of cereal grains after more than a century of trying, and only so many ways to package and market them.So Post has looked for growth via acquisitions into different product lines. Since being spun off by Ralcorp in February 2012, the company has made nine buyouts. You can expect Post to keep scouting deals in coming months.“We believe we are quite well positioned with the considerable amount of cash on hand approaching $900 million,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Zadoks said on the company's recent fiscal-first-quarter conference call with analysts. “We’ve got considerable secured debt capacity (and) a very rich pipeline of opportunities. I think we are going to have plenty of opportunities on the M&A front.”Acquisitions have helped Post grow its top line nearly 400% over the last four years — from $959 million in annual revenue in 2012 to $4.6 billion last year.Some have helped Post expand its traditional lineup of cereal brands. But the company also has moved into other product areas like pasta, protein bars, dried fruits, nuts, eggs, sports nutrition supplements and peanut butter. Among the company’s acquired brands: PowerBar, Attune Foods, Dakota Growers Pasta, American Blanching and Mom Brands.Post’s latest buyout came in October, when it spent $90 million to acquire Willamette Egg Farms, a producer, processor and wholesale distributor of eggs and egg products in the Northwest. The Willamette business is expected to add $80 million a year in net sales to Post and around $15 million a year in earnings before various adjustments, or EBITDA.Several different businesses fall under the Post corporate umbrella. The Post Foods business includes ready-to-eat cereal brands such as Grape Nuts, Post Raisin Bran and Pebbles. Mom Brands is geared more toward hot and value-priced cereals.Brands in the Michael Foods Group include Simply Potatoes hash browns, Dakota Growers pasta and All Whites liquid egg whites. The Active Nutrition segment features the PowerBar, Premier Nutrition and Dymatize Nutrition brands. Post also has a Private Brands group that includes Golden Boy peanut butter and nuts, as well as Attune Foods, which is heavy on organic and non-GMO granolas, cereals and snacks.Michael Foods is the biggest segment by sales, accounting for just less than half of the total. Post Foods contributes about one-third of sales, with the rest fairly evenly split between Active Nutrition and Private Brands. All of the segments saw declines in comparable sales during the first quarter.Post had a mixed performance during the quarter, which ended in December. The company logged adjusted earnings of 52 cents a share. That reversed a loss of $1.15 per share from the previous year and came in well above consensus estimates for 25 cents.But sales, which grew 16% to $1.25 billion, came in slightly below views. The gain was driven by Mom Brands, which Post acquired last year for about $1 billion. On a comparable basis that excludes the contribution of acquired brands, Post’s net sales declined 4.2% from the prior year.Still, the company’s share price hit a record high of 72.64 on March 3. The stock has also been helped by volatility in the broader market, which tends to push investors to the relative safety of the food business. In addition to Post, other food stocks that have set new highs in recent weeks include Tyson Foods (TSN), Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).“Underlying sales were negatively affected by the volume declines in the egg business, as well as the company’s transition in its Dymatize business to an outsourced production model following the closure of its manufacturing facility in the quarter,” Stifel analyst Christopher Growe noted in a first-quarter earnings report.On the upside, Post’s EBITDA for the quarter came in at $236 million, ahead of estimates. Post also raised its fiscal 2016 EBITDA guidance to a range of $810 million to $840 million from prior guidance of $780 million to $820 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Post to log full-year earnings of $1.61 a share, up from 62 cents in fiscal 2015. Earnings are seen rising another 30% to $2.09 in fiscal 2017.“The company noted that this new guidance range incorporates incremental investments (approximately $25 million) related to incremental marketing spending and achieving synergies from the Mom Brands acquisition,” Growe said.During the first-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Robert Vitale mentioned a couple of macro trends that work in his company’s favor. One is low energy prices tied to cheap oil, which helps keep manufacturing costs down.Another is the company’s low exposure to volatile international markets. Post gets less than 10% of its sales from outside the U.S., and most of that comes from Canada.“While this domestic profile is a challenge in delivering volume growth, it also provides a safe haven from recent currency headwinds,” Vitale said.

36,SYY,"The stock market started February smelling like a skunk and ended the month looking like a phoenix rising from the ashes -- and U.S. stock mutual funds followed suit.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds ended the month with a 0.15% decline on average, extending their 6.25% debacle recorded in January, according to Lipper Inc. To get to near break-even, the funds had to work through a stock market that shaved a 6% mid-month decline in the S&P 500 to a 0.14% loss by month's end.February's late-month rally was fueled by a surge in the price of oil. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark went from $26.05 per barrel on Feb. 11 to $33.40 on Feb. 29.Click Here To See List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe price rise began amid reports that Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar were discussing a freeze in oil production levels.""But the market rally wasn't just because of oil,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial. ""We got an upward revision in the fourth-quarter GDP. Data on personal income and spending both moved higher. We got a stronger-than-expected durable goods order number.""The income and spending figures were especially welcome. They suggested that consumer spending -- the linchpin of economic growth -- is on the rise, Joy said.In addition, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator number, which showed an uptick in inflationary pressure. ""That fueled expectations of a Federal Reserve rate increase,"" Joy said.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceAlso, bond yields rose in the back half of the month. ""That helped banks, and a lot of investors feel the market can't move higher unless financials participate and perhaps lead,"" Joy said.Still, ""aside from oil and other raw-material stocks, February's other leading sectors were defensive and bearish,"" said Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century’s target-date One Choice Portfolios.Precious metals funds led sectors, soaring 30.99% last month. Commodities precious metals funds were next, jumping 7.08%. Basic materials funds vaulted 6.59%. Commodities base metals climbed 2.95%. Industrials rose 2.50%.February strength in those sectors suggested that global demand may have bottomed in January. Maybe, just maybe, it was stabilizing in February, Joy said.A 0.96% February gain made mid-cap value funds the best-performing category among all U.S. diversified stock funds in the month.Top large-cap growth managers included Will Danoff, whose Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) slid 1.18% last month.Foreign stock funds fared worse than U.S. funds. They lost 1.58% on average. Emerging markets, led by China, are ""in a clear (economic) deceleration mode,"" Weiss said.""In economic terms, we're doing better than Europe and Japan,"" Joy said.Taxable bond funds overall advanced 0.36% in February. U.S. Treasury funds led, gaining 1.66%.So what's next? Many investors want to see dramatic cuts in oil production. ""But I'll take a situation where all oil does is stabilize in the mid-30s range,"" Joy said. ""Keep in mind that low oil is also a benefit to consumers (as well as many manufacturers and other businesses). If the energy sector can stabilize, then maybe in the second half of the year, other sectors -- especially U.S.-oriented ones -- can do better and produce earnings gains.""Low oil prices already seem to have helped boost automotive sales, especially for gas-thirsty SUVs. Housing, restaurants and travel also seem to have benefited, Joy said. ""But not department stores. But consumer discipline also helps economic expansions in the long run.""Economic softness in Japan and Europe has recently forced Ameriprise strategists to question their late-2015 forecast that those regions can outperform the U.S., Joy said.""Emerging markets are worthy of underweights,"" he added. ""They're still buffeted by declining global trade, weak commodity prices and diverging central policies around the globe.""Joy continued, ""Developed markets are still the place to be, but whether the U.S. will outperform is an open question."" Still, the U.S. is outperforming Europe and Japan.As for China, ""at the beginning of the year and continuing through the Lunar New Year (beginning Feb. 8), investors had real concern about China devaluing its currency and getting a competitive advantage. But the value of the yuan vs. the U.S. dollar is actually a little stronger now, so fears of additional devaluation have receded -- not gone away, but receded.""American Century's Weiss has a relatively cautious outlook. He says U.S. consumer spending is the strongest part of the global economic jigsaw puzzle. ""And it just doesn't make sense that the fate of the entire global economy can rest solely on the U.S. consumer,"" he said. ""I can't think of a healthy recovery (being plausible) where the only bright spot is the U.S. consumer.""Still, he says U.S. companies generally look stronger going forward than European, Japanese and emerging market businesses.For the next one to two years, he expects current macro conditions to continue. ""My outlook is sideways with a lot of volatility,"" he said. ""I don't expect a nightmare for investors, just little if any returns, with a lot of volatility.""Weiss advises investors who rely on diversified strategies to tilt more into defensive sectors. ""We've already rotated into more defensive positions, not selling out of stocks and going into cash.""He added, ""You should move from high-beta, high-growth, FANG strategies, which have done well in recent years."" FANG refers to Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Weiss also urges investors to consider shifting assets from emerging markets and foreign stocks to equity income funds. The $9 billion American Century Equity Income Fund's (TWEAX) top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which has a strong 82 Composite Rating from IBD and a dividend yield of 2.8%.The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest. American Century Equity Income's top holdings also include Sysco (SYY), which has an 86 Comp Rating and a 2.8% dividend yield; and One Gas (OGS), which has a 94 Comp Rating and a dividend yield of 2.4%.Top new buys by the fund include Atmos Energy (ATO), which has a 92 Comp Rating and a 2.4% dividend yield.Weiss urges investors with even more risk tolerance to consider strategies like American Century Global Allocation (AGAVX). In addition to shifting more money into defensive-style assets, the fund has boosted weightings in VIX futures to hedge equity market risks, Weiss says.The four-year-old fund has $21.7 million in assets. It achieves its target global allocations by investing in other American Century funds. As of Nov. 30, the fund had 23.5% of its money in foreign stocks, 17.5% in U.S. stocks, 29% in bonds and 30% in alternatives. Alternatives included 7% in currencies, sector ETFs and volatility instruments.Image provided by Shutterstock.

39,SYY,"Eighty-year old companies that specialize in meat production aren’t usually looked upon as growth stocks, but Tyson Foods (TSN) aims to position itself as one anyway.The world’s largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef and pork plans to do so by putting more focus on branded products rather than commodities such as fresh poultry.Its ultimate goal? To become the ""leading branded protein company in the world,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer noted in a recent report.""Tyson continues to position itself as a growth company with advantaged brands within advantaged categories,"" Palmer said.Those categories include high-margin, ""value-added"" products such as marinated and breaded poultry; prepared foods, including what it calls its “Core 9” packaged brands like Jimmy Dean sausage and Hillshire Farms lunch meat; and antibiotic and gluten-free chicken.During the recent Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Fla., Tyson officials said 85% of the company’s chicken business consists of poultry that is more than just raw meat.""This further differentiates (Tyson) from its more commodity-oriented peers,"" Palmer noted.Tyson Chief Executive Donald Smith echoed that point on a fiscal first-quarter conference call with analysts.""I believe we've demonstrated separation from the commodity players in large part due to the disproportionately high mix of value-added products in our portfolio as well as the production flexibility created with our buy vs. grow strategy, which also reduces commodity exposure,"" Smith said. The ""buy vs. grow"" strategy refers to Tyson’s decision to purchase some of its chickens from other facilities and reduce the number of chickens it grows itself.Tyson officials have made no secret of their desire to change the way investors view the company. As JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman pointed out in a recent note, the first two words of Tyson’s presentation at the consumer group event were ""different company.""""Tyson remains firmly (and understandably) committed to convincing investors that it is a different company than it used to be,"" Goldman noted. ""The primary reason for the difference continues to be Tyson’s emphasis -- both in reality and perception -- on branded food rather than commodity protein.""One difference between branded food and commodity meat items is that the former carries higher prices and margins, Goldman says. Tyson’s Core 9 brands carry ""an 11% average premium over the category average.""Tyson also spent a lot of time talking about revenue growth during the consumer group event. That stood in contrast to other food companies, such as General Mills (GIS) and Nabisco parent Mondelez International (MDLZ), which mainly focused on cost-cutting.""These companies spent much, maybe most, of their time today talking about costs, whereas the opposite was true for Tyson,"" Goldman noted. ""It helps to have a category (meat/protein) growing at a better-than-average pace, as well as a category that responds well to mix- and margin-accretive innovation today.""There appears to be plenty of demand for Tyson’s meat products. Palmer cited Tyson research showing that 54% of U.S. consumers want to increase the amount of protein in their diets.Worldwide, long-term demand for protein is expected to increase more than 60% from current levels due to population growth and the emergence of a global middle class that can afford to buy more meat products.Favorable industry trends, combined with investor optimism over the food sector in general, have helped push Tyson’s stock price up more than 40% since Nov. 20. Its shares set a record high of 64.63 on Feb. 23 — the sixth straight session they reached a new high.Other large-cap food companies that have set new highs this month include Sysco (SYY), Campbell Soup (CPB) and J.M. Smucker (SJM).One reason for the recent stock gains is the defensive nature of the food business. When stock markets are volatile, many investors flock to consumer staples such as food. Companies in this industry aren’t as vulnerable to wide swings in performance and value and also tend to pay regular dividends. Some food companies also have benefited from cheap gas prices, which lower transportation costs.Meanwhile, Tyson has gotten a lift from falling food costs. Excessive supplies of cattle feed such as corn and soybeans have lowered production prices of beef, poultry and pork. Lower costs were one reason Tyson raised its full-year earnings forecast earlier this month to a range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share from prior guidance of $3.50 to $3.65.The company also recently reiterated its goal of 10%-or-better annual earnings-per-share growth in coming years, and suggested that its long-term margin goals might be conservative.“We would not be surprised if before the fiscal year ended, Tyson raised its long-term chicken margin to maybe 8% to 10% from 7% to 9% currently,” Goldman noted.Tyson posted earnings of $1.15 a share for its fiscal first quarter, which ended in December. That was up 49% from the previous year and well above consensus analyst estimates for 89 cents. It was the biggest quarterly EPS gain in nearly two years.On the downside, revenue declined 15% to $9.15 billion -- the first dip since the September 2012 quarter -- partly because of the divestiture of a few noncore businesses. The top-line result fell short of consensus for $10 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Tyson’s full-year earnings to climb 27% this fiscal year and another 7% in fiscal 2017.

52,SYY,"When economic times are good, conservative investors sometimes stretch for yield.In good times, it's hard to imagine anything going wrong, so why not pick up a bigger dividend?The problem is that stretching can change a portfolio from low risk to high risk in a hurry.

"
55,SYY,"Willie's portfolio is now confetti.In bad times, risks sometimes come into play. Earnings shrink, making payouts questionable. If earnings shrink enough, then dividend increases end. If earnings worsen further, the dividend is cut. And if things really head south, the dividend is eliminated.Of course, an investor can always sell before trouble emerges. However, that's easier said than done. By the time a sell rule applies, much of the paper gains will have vanished. Timing a bad investment is more difficult than timing a good investment.A good investment doesn't require perfect execution in order to make money. A longer climb gives the investor more opportunities to leave with a gain.Stocks with only a high yield going for them aren't necessarily guaranteed to rise, which means that investors will have to play them that much better. So dividend investors will sleep more soundly if they don't focus too much on yield.What, then, should they focus on?A stock's liquidity, dividend growth rate and dividend stability are worth considering. Such an approach isn't absolutely safe (what is?), but it decreases the odds of getting burned badly.The screen above, run on Sept. 1, shows liquid stocks with good dividend growth rates and dividend stability ratings. IBD's daily Income Investor column has recently covered some of them.Another way to keep a conservative bent on a portfolio is to buy stocks in the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrat list. These are stocks that have increased their dividend payouts for 25 consecutive years.The Aristocrats list is well-balanced. Its 52 constituents represent ten sectors. (Sometimes chasers of high yields end up invested in only a few sectors, which increases risk. Normal sector rotation can create havoc for such investors.)As of Aug. 31, sector exposure in the Dividend Aristocrats broke down like this: consumer staples, 25% (results are rounded); industrials, 15%; health care, 13%; financials, 13%; materials, 12%; consumer discretionary, 12%; energy, 4%; utilities, 2%; telecom, 2%; and information technology, 2%.The Aristocrats list includes stocks such as food distributor Sysco (SYY), utility Consolidated Edison (ED), home improvement store Lowe's (LOW), steel producer Nucor (NUE) and cleaning products firm Clorox (CLX).

121,SYY,"Patent expiration often heralds slower growth for innovative firms.Such has been the case with Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR), which sells single-cup coffee brewers along with single portion K-Cups of their own and licensed brands of coffee.The expiration of key patents in September 2012 let unlicensed rivals win share in the lucrative K-Cup market.Keurig, which boosted sales at a compound annual clip of roughly 55% from 2009 to 2013, was forced to make do with more pedestrian low double-digit growth levels. Some bearish observers wondered if the market for single cup-coffee was as robust as Keurig claimed.But Keurig, on the verge of introducing two major products, thinks it has the solution to slowing growth. And Wall Street seems convinced. Keurig stock, which ended 2013 priced just under $75, recently fetched over $120.Keurig's Composite Rating — 98 of a possible 99 —puts it first among the eight firms in IBD's Wholesale-Food industry group. With a market value of just over $20 billion, it ranks second in size only to Sysco (SYY) among those eight.Still, the company has had to weather declining revenue growth in the past two years. Sales growth, which as recently as the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2012, stood at 33%, was just 10% in the quarter ended March 31. Even with slower revenue growth, Keurig has been able to expand earnings per share nicely: EPS rose 16% last quarter.Later this year, Keurig will unveil a new system that brews whole carafes of coffee as well as its familiar one-cup servings. Perhaps more important, the Keurig 2.0 brewers threaten to lock out unlicensed purveyors of K-Cup compatibles.Coca-Cola StakeNext year Keurig will carve out new product territory with its Keurig Cold system for at-home carbonation of soft drinks.Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has invested in the at-home carbonation concept by purchasing 16% of Keurig shares. Coke's share purchases seem to validate Keurig's carbonation product plan. They've also fueled speculation of a buyout.Akshay Jagdale, analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, makes the bullish case. ""We think the company can triple to quadruple its earnings in a three to five year period. It has the potential to do that,"" he said in a phone interview.He believes Keurig's core brewing business is far from saturation and that Keurig Cold will offer new capabilities beyond those of existing home-carbonation platforms.""Five years from now, they have the potential to earn $8.20 from the hot platform and $3.50 from the cold,"" he said. Jagdale has a price target of $150. If Keurig's hot and cold businesses flourish as he anticipates, the stock would be ""a steal"" at his price target of $150.Others have their doubts. Theo Brito, an analyst with BTIG, a New York-based trader for hedge funds, mutual funds and other institutional clients, begins by throwing cold carbonated water on the notion of a Coke buyout, which he terms ""very unlikely."" His fundamental skepticism is centered on Keurig's core brewing business.Pods And ProfitKeurig brewers are in roughly 18 million U.S. households. Suzanne DuLong, Keurig vice president of investor relations, notes that there are 90 million coffee-drinking households in America. ""We think there's still ample opportunity with our Hot systems,"" she said.Brito questions whether all those 90 million households have the income or inclination to purchase a Keurig brewer, which can run from $80 to $189.Brito claims that as Keurig has expanded sales, the average number of cups brewed on its machines — the attachment rate, in industry lingo — has declined.""Over the last five years, there's been an annual decline of around 10%,"" Brito told IBD. ""I expect the decline to continue.""That's important because Keurig derives the bulk of its profit from K-Cups, not brewers. Declining K-Cup sales would definitely pinch margins, he contends.Still, Wall Street bulls have been winning the argument on Keurig this year. And KeyBanc's Jagdale tackles the bearish doubts head-on. He contends that Keurig has the potential to vastly increase the household presence of its brewers.In Europe, he notes, single-serve brewers are in 30%-35% of households. Keurig currently has just 20% penetration.And Jagdale foresees huge gains in single portion coffee as the new Keurig 2.0 locks out unlicensed packet providers. In just the last year and a half, unlicensed sellers have gone from zero to roughly 14% of the K-Cup market, he notes.""The Keurig 2.0 brewer will not allow any unlicensed cups to work with it,"" he said.Jagdale sees signs that the strategy is already working. He notes that several retailers — including Target (TGT) — that had been unlicensed have recently entered into licensing arrangements with Keurig. He suggests that retailers prefer sharing coffee packet revenue with Keurig to being locked out of the business entirely.Jagdale does not venture to predict the likelihood of Coca-Cola expanding its equity ownership in Keurig Green Mountain. ""It's hard to predict what will happen with buyouts,"" he said.He does think the likelihood of buyout ""will increase with the success of Keurig Cold.""The Cool FactorKeurig Cold systems will hit the market in 2015. Keurig spokeswoman DuLong says that at $80 to $189, Keurig Cold units will carry similar pricing to Keurig brewers.Consumers have other choices for at home carbonation, including products from market leader SodaStream International (SODA).Still, the market is in its infancy and Jagdale is impressed with one expected Keurig Cold feature: ""It will be the only product that can produce a cold beverage.""The Keurig carbonators could begin to contribute as much as $3.50 in EPS just three years after their 2015 introduction , Jagdale estimates. That's one reason he expects Keurig to get back on the fast growth track.""You're going to see an acceleration in top-line growth for Keurig,"" he said.

122,SYY,"Whether you dine at a restaurant, college or hotel, there's a good chance the food and related products were delivered by Sysco (SYY).The Houston-based company distributes food-service items to some 425,000 customers from 193 locations in the U.S., Bahamas, Canada and Ireland. Those customers also include hospitals, nursing homes and schools.And Sysco aims to reach even more people. On Dec. 9 it said it's buying privately held rival US Foods, based in Rosemont, Ill., for $3.5 billion in stock and cash. The deal is valued at $8.2 billion, including $4.7 billion in US Foods debt.The merger will create the biggest food distributor in the U.S., with estimated annual sales of more than $65 billion. The combined entity will likely command at least a quarter of the North American market — and is likely to draw regulatory scrutiny.Sysco's competitors include Core-Mark Holdings (CORE), with annual sales around $9.5 billion, and United Natural Foods (UNFI), with $6.3 billion in sales.Sysco expects the deal to close in the third quarter of 2014. Shares shot up 14% on the news. They're up 15% this year, lagging the S&P 500's 29% gain.The food distributor is more of a typical income stock, providing slow but stable earnings growth and steady returns.Last month it raised its dividend by 3.6% to 29 cents a share. That works out to $1.16 for the year, or an annualized yield of 3.2%, well above that of the S&P 500.Sysco has paid out a quarterly dividend every year since its IPO in 1970. Core-Mark's annualized yield is roughly 1.2%, while United Natural Foods doesn't pay a dividend.Annual earnings have trended mostly higher since 2006, with the exception of a 1-cent dip in 2009 and 2013. The fiscal year ends in June. The three-year Earnings Stability Factor is a stable 2 on a scale of 0 to 99. The five-year factor of 3 also indicates stable growth.

143,SYY,"Global food products maker and distributor Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues exceeded expectations. The acquisition of London-based Brakes Group (completed in July 2016) and margin improvement drove earnings.Adjusted earnings, including extra week of fiscal 2016, of 72 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents by 1.4% and were up 12.5% year over year. In fact, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six out of the past 7 straight quarters, including this one. Growth in sales, expense management, and improved gross and operating margin led to the upside. Excluding the Brakes acquisition and extra week, earnings increased 15.5% to 70 cents per share.Quarter in DetailSysco's sales of $14.42 billion exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.23 billion by 1.4% and increased 5.7% on a year-over-year basis in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Excluding the Brakes acquisition and extra week, sales grew 3.4% to $13.1 billion.Gross profit improved 10.3% to $2.8 billion in the quarter, while gross margin improved 80 basis points (bps) to 19.1%. The improvement was backed by the company’s ongoing growth strategy, which focuses on accelerating sales, reducing costs and mitigating ongoing gross margin pressure. Excluding the Brakes acquisition and extra week, gross profit margin increased 14 bps to 18.5%.Adjusted operating income also rose 6.1% in the quarter to $666.8 million despite a 11.6% increase in adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating margin improved 2 bps to 4.6%. Excluding the Brakes acquisition and on a 13-week comparable basis, operating income was up 9.0% to $636.0 million, while margins improved 25 bps.We are impressed with the fact that Sysco has delivered higher gross margins for the last nine consecutive quarters, after witnessing declining gross margins over the last two fiscals due to multiple factors. It seems that the company’s growth strategy is paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are bearing fruit. The company’s sales have also improved consistently, driven by acquisitions and volume growth.In fact, if we look into the share price performance of the company over the last one year, we note that Sysco’s shares have declined 2.8% in the said time frame. However, the fall was narrower than 9.8% decline of the industry. Notably, the industry is part of the bottom 30% of the Zacks Classified industries (186 out of the 265).Segment DetailsThe company reports through these operating segments: U.S. Foodservice Operations and International Foodservice Operations.U.S. Foodservice OperationsSegment sales declined 3.8% to $9.8 billion.

145,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 14, before the opening bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this global food products maker and distributor will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.9%.Let’s delve deeper on how things are shaping up for this announcement. Which Way are Estimates Treading? A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days at 71 cents and $2.47, respectively.Estimated earnings for the fourth quarter depict a year-on-year growth of 11.2%, while the same for fiscal 2017 is estimated to grow 17.8%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of 14.23 billion for the fourth quarter, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Sysco is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Sysco has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 71 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteFactors Influencing the Quarter Sysco’s strategic acquisitions, especially London-based Brakes acquisition in Jul 2016 have aided the growth of its distribution network, customer base and drive long-term growth. In fact, this acquisition is likely to be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by low to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. Such acquisitions have significantly improved the company’s top-line.Sysco has also been managing its expenses quite efficiently since the past few years. We are impressed with the fact that Sysco has delivered higher gross margins for eight consecutive quarters now, on the back of SG&A and supply chain process improvements.  Further, the company remains on track to achieve the recently raised three-year adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.However, Sysco has been facing deflationary pressure for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters. The trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation from third-quarter fiscal 2017. Though the company is anticipating overall modest inflation in the fourth quarter, the impact on the company might take little more time. The grocery/supermarket business is also grappling with stiff competition, aggressive promotional environment and reduced store traffic.Such industry wide headwinds have hurt the company’s share prices. Nevertheless, the decline was narrower than the industry owing to its strong fundamentals. We note that Sysco’s shares have declined 1% over the last one year, narrower than the industry that fell 10.2%. This makes it quite evident that the company’s growth strategy is paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are bearing fruit.Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

146,SYY,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) posted mixed second-quarter 2017 results, wherein though the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, top line missed the same. Further, management reiterated full-year adjusted earnings guidance at the low end of its previously stated range.The company’s shares have declined nearly 2.1% yesterday, probably as investors were disappointed with the top line miss and the bleak earnings view. However, we note that the stock has rallied 4.5% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 1.2%. Nonetheless, the industry is placed at top 47% of the Zacks Classified industries (120 out of 256).Q2 HighlightsAdjusted earnings of 53 cents per share rose 26.2% from the year-ago period, and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents by 1.9%. This was in line with the company’s robust earnings trend in recent quarters. Notably, the company has a track record of either meeting or beating earnings estimates,  much similar to Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) that  has maintained this trend for over seven years now, barring one quarter of negative earnings surprise in Jun 2015.Coming back to Pinnacle Foods, the company has delivered positive earnings surprise in eight of the last 14 quarters and posted in-line results in the remaining six.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteHowever, GAAP earnings for the quarter came in at 16 cents versus 39 cents in the prior-year period, significantly hurt by items affecting comparability.Net sales fell 1.6% to $744.6 million in the second quarter and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 766 million by 2.8%. In fact, its top line has lagged the consensus mark in 10 of the last 14 quarters.The decline is attributed to the 2.6% negative impact from the sale of its low-margin businesses comprising Aunt Jemima (AJ) retail and foodservice frozen breakfast products. In addition, the company’s top line included a 0.9% impact from the closing of Boulder UK operations as well as SKU rationalization program initiated in the second half of 2016. However, these negatives were offset by robust underlying sales growth of 1.9%.Adjusted gross profit decreased 6.8% to $203.8 million with the gross margin contraction of 150 basis points (bps) to 27.4%. This was attributable to adverse margin that was over 200 bps from the certain discrete items.Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) slipped 0.5% to $114.2 million in the quarter.Segment DetailsFrozen: Segment sales rose 2.5% to $295.9 million in the quarter on the back of higher volume/mix of 9.2%, partially offset by reduced net price realization of 2.4% and currency headwinds of 0.3%.However, adjusted EBIT for the segment dropped 14.4% to $38.1 million as unfavorable impact from discrete items was higher than increased productivity as well as positive timing of marketing spending.Grocery: Segment sales fell 1.8% to $276.1 million due to the unfavorable net price realization of 2.1%, somewhat compensated with favorable volume/mix of 0.3%.Adjusted EBIT for the segment grew 15% to $61.9 million backed by productivity savings, synergies from the Boulder Brands acquisition as well as favorable impact from items affecting comparability. These items were offset by input cost inflation.Boulder: Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15, 2016. Consequently, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company.In second-quarter 2017, Boulder segment contributed $94.7 million to net sales, which is in line with the prior-year period. This represents higher volume/mix of 4.9%, along with favorable net price realization of 2.8%, which were mitigated by the winding down of the Boulder UK operations and SKU rationalization program.Adjusted EBIT for the Boulder Brands segment totaled $15.8 million, up 30.3% from the prior-year quarter.Specialty Foods: Segment sales declined 15.1% to $78 million due to reduced volume/mix of 6.8% and 8.9% decrease from the AJ exit, partly favorable net price realization of 0.6%. Meanwhile, the private label business continued to be under pressure in the quarter as was anticipated by the company, due to lower sales of USDA stew as well as the exit of the gardein private label business. Also, the segment’s adjusted EBIT plunged 39.5% to $4.4 million in the reported quarter.Notably, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has been witnessing sluggish net sales for the Specialty segment for quite some time now. Due to a heightened competitive bidding environment for the already low-margin USDA stew business, the company continues to expect Specialty to remain challenged through 2017, reflecting lower sales of private label canned meat.Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $130.9 million, long-term debt of $2,940.8 million, and total equity of $1,944.9 million.In the quarter, the company generated cash flow from operations of $57 million and incurred capital expenditure of $20 million. Additionally, its total free cash flow for the quarter totaled $37 million.2017 GuidancePinnacle Foods reaffirmed its adjusted earnings guidance in the band of $2.55–$2.60 per share for 2017 but expects the same to be at the lower end. This reflects a year-over-year increase of nearly 19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.59 for the full year.Net sales and adjusted earnings for 2017 are anticipated to gain roughly 1% and 3 cents, respectively, from the 53rd week. Further, this is likely to benefit the fourth quarter as well.Moreover, the company continues to expect input cost inflation in the range of 2.5−3% for the year. Productivity is estimated to be at the top or marginally above its cost of products sold range of 3.5–4%. Notably, this does not include the synergies of not less than $15 million from Boulder Brands acquisition, which are likely to benefit the gross margin as well as SG&A overhead.Additionally, capital expenditures for the full year are expected to be in the range of $115–$125 million.Our TakeOverall, the company boasts of a strong brand portfolio and intends to continue investing in innovation products to further differentiate its brands in the marketplace. It has also been pursuing various acquisitions over the years to enhance its distribution network, customer base and long-term growth.Moreover, Pinnacle Foods has an operational excellence program to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. In fact, these productivity savings, along with higher pricing have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same industry include Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report).Nomad Foods has delivered positive earnings surprise of 3.9% in the last reported quarter and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

148,SYY,"United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) has been in good shape lately, with a flourishing organic food business and growing presence in the e-commerce space. Moreover, the company’s well-chalked strategic targets for 2018 are expected to add greater sheen to its expanding business. However, higher freight costs and labor expenses have been acting as roadblocks in its performance.That said, let’s closely inspect some of these factors impacting this renowned name in the natural and specialty food space.Focus on E-commerce & Other Growth Initiatives Bodes WellWith sophisticated distribution networks and fulfillment centers, United Natural’s growth in the e-commerce arena is quite remarkable. Buoyed by such efforts, the company’s e-commerce sales jumped 23% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, positively impacting the top line. Furthermore, United Natural remains committed to enhancing its presence in e-commerce space through investments in technology and infrastructure. In this regard, for the forthcoming quarters, management projects robust opportunities.Apart from bolstering omnichannel presence, United Natural has laid out key targets for 2018, some of which drove fiscal third-quarter results. These targets mainly include plans to enhance customer base, expand the company’s broadline distribution channel, improve gross margin and retain focus on mergers and buyouts.Speaking of buyouts, the company has been carrying out several acquisitions over the years to grow distribution network and customer base, and boost long-term growth. A few noteworthy buyouts of the company include Haddon House, Gourmet Guru and Nor-Cal Produce. Further, the company strives to develop effective sourcing processes and supply-chain networks to better align supplies with demand, thereby efficiently meeting consumer needs.The solid focus on growth initiatives along with robust consumer demand across all sales channels, has been favoring United Natural’s top- and bottom-line performances for a while. During the fiscal third quarter, both top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed estimates. This marked the fifth and third consecutive quarter of earnings and sales beat for the company, respectively. Encouragingly, management expects the stellar performance to continue and it has raised fiscal 2018 outlook accordingly. Can Efforts Offset Cost Related Hurdles?Despite the aforementioned upsides, all doesn’t appear bright for United Natural. The company has been grappling with dismal gross margin rates for three straight quarters now, thanks to an unfavorable shift in consumer mix. Higher inbound freight costs have also been weighing on gross margin for some time.Unfortunately, for the next two quarters, management expects higher freight costs to remain a hurdle. Apart from United Natural, other food companies such as Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report), TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) and J.M. Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report) have also been grappling with rising freight expenses lately. To further worsen matters, United Natural has been incurring higher labor expenses across several distribution centers due to the higher-than-anticipated demand. In fact, owing to the high demand, the company’s fill-rates have been deteriorating continuously for the past few quarters.Notably, such downturns have eclipsed the company’s performance. In the past three months, the stock has declined 2.7% compared with the industry’s increase of 5.5%.Nonetheless, we remain hopeful that the company’s strategic goals for 2018, especially, its e-commerce expansion efforts and plans to broaden distribution networks, will continue bolstering its performance. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects consistent growth in demand for its better-for-you products.Marching ahead with such bold ambitions, we expect United Natural to easily combat the aforementioned hurdles and raise shareholders’ confidence in the stock.

149,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $66.97 on Jun 19, before closing the day at $66.9. The company is gaining from solid performance in U.S. Foodservice Operations, cost-cutting initiatives and strategic acquisitions.  Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 10.7%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.6% in the past three months. While the broader Consumer Staples sector declined 4.3%, the S&P 500 gained 2.1%. We believe the stock still has upside potential as apparent from a VGM Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 10.4%.   Furthermore, analysts are steadily becoming optimistic about the stock. This is apparent from the rise in earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.98 for fiscal 2018 earnings has moved north by 3 cents in the last 60 days. Also, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.25% in the trailing four quarters. It has surpassed sales estimates in nine of the last 10 quarters as well. What's Driving the Stock?Sysco’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark, for the fourth straight quarter, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. The company witnessed year-over-year growth in both the top and bottom lines. The primary reason behind strong results is its U.S. Foodservice Operations segment, wherein sales advanced 5.1% to $9,704.5 million on 2.6% growth in local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations, with total case volumes up 2.4%. Notably, local case volumes in this segment have been rising year over year for 16 consecutive quarters. Additionally, rising restaurant sales have been benefiting the company’s U.S. operations for a while now. Further, the company’s performance gained from lower taxes and favorable results in the international segment. Management expects these upsides to continue in the forthcoming periods as well.Sysco has been actively pursuing strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio and expand its base. In this regard, the company closed its Kent Foods buyout during the fiscal third quarter and expects the same to bolster the U.K. and European business bandwagon. During the fiscal third quarter, the company also concluded the acquisitions pertaining to Hawaii-based HFM FoodService and Louisiana-based Doerle Food Service. Incidentally, the HFM buyout aided the company’s U.S. Broadline operations during the quarter. Sysco also remains on track with the integration process of London-based Brakes Group that was acquired in July 2016.Apart from this, the company is likely to continue gaining from its recently highlighted three-year financial goals. These include enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. Progressing in this line, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and manage product costs effectively.All said, management believes that the company is well placed to achieve adjusted operating income improvement in the higher end of its targeted range of $600-$650 million. Wrapping Up However, the company has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin for the past three quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, gross margin contracted 9 basis points to 18.65%. The company continues to bear the brunt of higher inbound freight costs, which stemmed from driver availability challenges in the industry.   Nonetheless, we expect the company’s growth drivers to offset these hurdles and help Sysco continue with its bullish run. Besides Sysco, Darling Ingredients (DAR  -  Free Report), Medifast (MED  -  Free Report) and Nomad Foods (NOMD  -  Free Report) scaled 52-week highs on Jun 19.  Shares of Medifast hit a 52-week high of $171.59, though it closed a tad lower at $171.44. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Shares of Darling Ingredients hit a 52-week high of $19.92, though it closed a tad lower at $19.8. It carries a Zacks Rank #3. Shares of Normad Foods hit a 52-week high of $18.91, though it closed a tad lower at $18.8. It has a Zacks Rank #3. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

150,SYY,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents for the quarter under review moved south by 3 cents in the last seven days and reflects a decline of 6.7% year over year.Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer Daniels Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer Daniels Midland Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the first-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayArcher Daniels has been struggling with a dismal surprise history for quite a long time. In fact, the company has lagged sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14,965 million, down 0.2% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprises in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.In the previous quarter, the company’s margins remained under pressure due to soft operating performance at the Oilseeds Processing segment. Despite robust crush volumes and persistent growth in demand, results were hurt by soft crush margins and lower South American origination margins. These factors also hampered Crushing and Origination results. Additionally, soft biodiesel results affected Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations.However, Archer Daniels’ solid focus on cost savings to strengthen business is commendable. It remains focused on cost synergy activities by addressing redundancies and removing overlapping corporate SG&A. Furthermore, the company’s Project Readiness program that aims at enhancing operational efficiency at production and supply chain networks to curtail costs bodes well. Management has also been on track with business transformation, under its 1ADM program.In March, management realigned its business into four segments namely Carbohydrate Solutions, Nutrition, Oilseeds and Origination, to accelerate growth and resonate well with changing customers’ needs. These changes will be reflected in first-quarter 2018 results. The new business segments are expected to clearly differentiate the company’s product and service offerings, while justifying its operating structure. Additionally, the segments should help Archer Daniels provide value-added and exclusive product assortments, hence boost growth across its business portfolio. These efforts, in turn, are likely to add stimulus to the company’s performance and profitability.Given the major strengths and weaknesses, let’s wait and see what lies ahead for Archer Daniels when it reports quarterly results.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

151,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been the market’s darling of late, courtesy of numerous growth initiatives. With focus on acquisitions being one of the key endeavors, the stock has rallied 20.9% in a year, faring way better than the industry that tumbled 14.3% in the same time frame. Rolling on these lines, the company recently concluded the previously announced buyout of Kent Frozen Foods – following which its shares have gained 4.9%.Given this bullish run over just two trading sessions, we remain quite encouraged about the prospects from this take over, among the other strategies driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. What Kent Frozen Acquisition Means for Sysco?Sysco brought U.K.-based Kent Frozen Foods under its wings on Apr 3, which will form part of the company’s international operations, thereby being an addition to its existing Brakes, Fresh Direct and M&J Seafood businesses. Following the approval of the Competition and Markets Authority, the deal was concluded in an all-cash basis.Although Kent Frozen Foods will continue to function as a separate entity, it is set to gain from Sysco’s superior hold and brand image in the foodservice market. Further, the deal will enable Kent to establish closer ties with other businesses of Sysco in the U.K. and European regions. While Sysco’s U.S. Foodservice operations has long been a growth driver for the company, this buyout is likely to fuel its International segment.Well, sales at the International Foodservice segment increased 9.3% to roughly $2,869 million in the last reported quarter. Adjusted operating income tanked 28.8% to $79 million. While results in Canada gained strength from surge in local cases and efficient expense management, the company’s European business remained difficult. This stemmed from the amendment from the calendar year to fiscal, which weighed on costs and gross profit. Also, the company incurred higher costs in Europe due to constant investments in transformation endeavors. However, these initiatives poise the company well for the long term.Focus on Buyouts: A Major Key to Sysco’s SuccessNotably, acquisitions have always been profitable and aided in augmenting Sysco’s market share and distribution network, thereby boosting long-term growth prospects. Notably, the company expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions, in the long run. In fact, earlier this year, the company acquired Doerle Food Services (a Louisiana-based food service distributor) to widen its U.S. distribution network. This buyout is expected to Strengthen Sysco’s core business and maximize customers’ value.Looking back, in 2017, Sysco acquired HFM FoodService and the remaining 50% stake in Mayca Distribuidores to enhance its U.S. and international businesses, respectively. Apart from that, Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in 2016 has been benefiting the company significantly and is expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually.That said, we expect the addition of Kent Frozen Foods to add yet another leaf to Sysco’s growth story, by driving the performance of its international segment.Looking for More Promising Bets?

154,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7. This provider of food and related products has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.1% in the trailing four quarters, with a beat in each quarter. Let’s see if Sysco can keep this positive streak alive this time around as well.Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation Quote U.S. Food Service Unit & Strategy for 2020: Major DriversWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from strength at its U.S. Foodservice segment as well as its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions. These factors and solid cost-savings efforts helped the company retain its robust past record in the last reported quarter. Notably, Sysco’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its fourth straight quarter of sales beat, whereas earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight of the past nine straight quarters. Results in the quarter were mainly backed by strength in the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, wherein restaurant sales continued to grow and compensated for soft traffic. Further, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rose 4.8% and total case volumes jumped 3.5%. Notably, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters. Management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results from its International segment.In the third quarter analysts polled by Zacks expect sales from U.S. Foodservice and International units to grow 5.7% and 8.3% to $9,761 million and $2,739 million, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall sales is pegged at $14,382 million, up from $13,524 million recorded in the year-ago period.Apart from this, we also remain encouraged about Sysco’s focus on its strategy for 2020, as it gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. This is evident from the recent launch of its redesigned website, which is aimed at enhancing consumers overall experience. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and attain operational efficiency. Further, we commend Sysco’s focus on acquisitions, which are expected to drive sales and also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Will Cost Hurdles be Offset?However, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin for the past two quarters. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company continued to bear the brunt of higher inbound freight costs, which stemmed from driver availability challenges in the industry. Segment-wise, the U.S. Broadline unit gross margin was marred by food cost inflation of 3.3%, owing to categories like meat, dairy and produce. The International segment was hurt by food cost inflation in the U.K., driven by higher product costs and currency movements.Also, the company incurred higher costs in Europe due to constant investments in transformation endeavors. Moreover, weakness in pound sterling resulted in acute food cost inflation in the United Kingdom, thereby hurting volumes and margins. Further, adjusted operating income for the International segment tanked 28.8% to $79 million. Persistence of these hurdles remains a threat to Sysco’s International performance.Nevertheless, we expect Sysco’s robust cost-saving initiatives and other growth endeavors to help offset these hurdles in the to-be reported quarter. Moreover, the company envisions annual savings of roughly $200-$300 million from the recent tax reforms, which is likely to fuel the bottom line by 9-13 cents in the second half. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, Sysco remains well placed to deliver a solid third quarter. The consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at 64 cents, which marks a solid 25.5% improvement from 51 cents recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

The company has pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.3%.So, let’s delve deep into the factors to see how Newell is doing before its first-quarter earnings release.Factors at PlayNewell has been struggling with strained margins for the last few quarters. Lower core sales, absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix and, higher advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment have been denting the company’s margins. These factors might hurt overall profitability in the first quarter, apprehending which investors’ sentiments have taken a hit. Consequently, shares of the company have plunged 32% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 14.6%.Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteThough the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents for the first quarter of 2018 remained stable in the last 30 days, it portrays a year-over-year decline of 20.6%. Also, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $3.04 billion for the quarter, down 6.8% from the year-ago period.Furthermore, the consensus estimates of $1,051 million, $523 million and $551 million for Live, Learn and Work segments, respectively, reflect a decline of 39%, 5.1% and 21.8% sequentially. However, the consensus mark of $633 million for the Play segment shows an increase of 12.4% from fourth-quarter 2017.While the company has been witnessing margin issues, Newell remains on track with the execution of its transformation plan through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and cost-savings plans. Further, it is looking for strategic alternatives for assets in the industrial and commercial products as well as smaller consumer businesses. The strategic alternatives for these brands will significantly lower the company’s operational complexity by reducing 50% of its global factory and warehouse presence. On completion of these plans, Newell is expected to become a nearly $11 billion focused portfolio company with leading consumer-facing brands, impressive margins and significant growth potential in global categories.Furthermore, Newell’s Project Renewal Program continues to focus on saving costs in the areas of procurement by reducing the complexity of its business and simplifying the manufacturing and distribution processes, through further overhead reduction. In addition, it intends to use a major portion of the savings in accelerating growth by investing the same in business, while the remaining cost savings are expected to reflect in earnings. These savings are also expected to boost margins, cash flow and further investments.All said, we remain cautious about Newell’s performance in the upcoming quarter, however, the company is poised well for growth in the long term.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Newell is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Newell has an Earnings ESP of -4.67% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which make surprise prediction difficult.As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Hostess Brands, Inc.

Also, the company is cautious about social, economic and political issues that could affect consumer spending in few countries. Further, the company has been struggling with gross margin declines for more than four quarters now.Nevertheless, we expect the company to overcome the impacts of such hurdles with the help of the aforementioned growth drivers. Moreover, management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 5% in fiscal 2018.

ONEV has been able to amass assets over $450.81 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. ONEV, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index.The Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors high value, high quality, and low size characteristics, with a focus factor comprising low volatility characteristics.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for ONEV, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.ONEV's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.88%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 18.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector; Industrials and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.11% of total assets, followed by Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report).ONEV's top 10 holdings account for about 9.1% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -0.22%, and was up about 11.94% in the last one year (as of 05/24/2018). ONEV has traded between $69.37 and $76.42 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 11.29% for the trailing three-year period. With about 420 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market.

159,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been growing on strength in the U.S. Foodservice channel. This combined with well-planned buyouts and effective three-year financial strategies have enabled the renowned marketer and distributor of food products to stay competitive and hold a leading market share.Soaring U.S. FoodservicesSysco boasts a strong U.S. Foodservice network, mainly stemming from surge in local case volumes within U.S. Broadline operations. In fact, local case volumes in this segment have been improving year over year for 16 consecutive quarters. Additionally, rising restaurant sales has been driving the company’s U.S. operations for a while. Driven by such factors, sales in the U.S. Foodservice Operations advanced 5.1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 on 2.6% growth in local case volumes and 2.4% rise in total case volumes.Acquisitions Aid ExpansionSysco’s buyouts have played a vital role in enhancing business span, more specifically to widen distribution network. Apart from strengthening its base in the United States, the company also undertakes acquisitions internationally to bolster overseas business. In this regard, Sysco closed its Kent Foods buyout deal during the third quarter and expects the same to bolster the U.K. and European business bandwagon. During the third quarter, the company concluded the acquisitions pertaining to Hawaii-based HFM FoodService and Louisiana-based Doerle Food Service. Incidentally, the HFM buyout aided the company’s U.S. Broadline operations in the said period.In prior developments, Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in July 2016 is noteworthy and management is well on track with its integration process.  Apart from these, the company’s buyout efforts include Supplies on the Fly, North Star Seafood, Gilchrist & Soames, as well as stakes in Mayca Distribuidores and Pacific Star Foodservice.  Strategies for 2020 Bode WellSysco is on track with its three-year financial goals which mainly focuses on enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficiency. In this regard, the company is focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumers’ preferences, Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and manage product costs effectively.Driven by these strategies, the company witnessed local case growth and improved gross profit in the third quarter. Further, management believes that the company is well placed to achieve adjusted operating income improvement in the higher end of its targeted range of $600-$650 million.Final ThoughtsIn spite of the aforementioned growth drivers, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin since the past three quarters, thanks to higher inbound freight costs. Driver availability challenges in the industry have led to increase in freight costs. Further, during the third quarter, the company’s U.S. Broadline operations were hurt by food cost inflation, while rising prices stemming from product costs and currency translations in the U.K. marred international segment performance. Persistence of such headwinds continues to be a threat to Sysco’s performance in the forthcoming periods.

160,SYY,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been faring well in the industry, buoyed by yielding buyouts and cost-containment efforts. This has aided year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for more than a year now. Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been supporting this global leader in spices and seasonings, alongside analyzing the hurdles that have been denting performance.Acquisitions Provide Scope for Growth  Buyouts have been aiding McCormick to expand flavors business and reap grater profitability. The buyout of the food division of RB Foods in August 2017, is the largest deal by the company till date. With iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Sauce and French's Mustard, RB Foods is likely to continue as an asset for McCormick’s spices portfolio.The buyouts of RB Foods and Enrico Giotti SpA bolstered performances of consumer and flavor solutions units, driving sales by 12% during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Notably, a number of companies operating in the food industry such as TreeHouse Foods (THS  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) have also been resorting to strategic buyouts to widen prospects.Effective Cost ManagementMoving on, McCormick’s Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program has been an aspect of cheer for a while. The program aids the company to focus on savings and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, which lead to higher sales and profits.  Notably, cost savings from CCI improved the company’s gross and adjusted operating income margins during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.This also marked the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating income margin expansion. Further, the company projects adjusted operating income growth in the range of 23-25% in fiscal 2018, wherein it plans to achieve cost savings of $100 million.Resorting to cost-saving initiatives to induce efficiency is a common practice in the consumer staples space. For instance, Tyson Foods’ (TSN  -  Free Report) is on track with its Financial Fitness Program with the motive to induce supply-chain efficiencies, reduce overheads and fuel the bottom line. Tax Gains: A Joy HamperDuring the first quarter, McCormick recognized gains of $297.9 million from the recent U.S. Tax Act. This not only boosted the company’s bottom line for the period, but also led management to pass on a portion of its gains to well-deserved employees. Incidentally, McCormick announced bonuses worth $1,000 and plans to increase hourly wage rates for hourly U.S. employees.Improving wage structure is just one part of McCormick’s plans to strategically reap benefits from the tax reform. The company also plans to invest in organizational growth, debt reduction and provide returns to shareholders.Gains from tax cuts have enabled management to raise earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. Earnings are expected in the range of $4.85-$4.95, reflecting growth from the previous projection of $4.80-$4.90. The view also takes into consideration the estimated positive impact of nearly one percentage point from currency fluctuations.Final ThoughtsIn spite of the aforementioned upsides, McCormick’s performance continues to be eclipsed by escalating raw material costs, brand marketing and freight expenses. Incidentally, for fiscal 2018, the company expects material costs to escalate in low-single digits.Nevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to easily tide over such hurdles, courtesy of well-chalked savings initiatives. Additionally, positive impacts of buyouts and currency fluctuations are expected to fuel sales growth of approximately 13-15% in fiscal 2018. Indeed, such aspects have been a treat for investors, evident from the stock’s return of 10.9% in the past six months against the industry’s fall of 7.4%.

161,SYY,"Crude oil prices crept up over $70 per barrel for the first time in the global market since late-2014, before a long-term slide in prices took many economies into tougher times, including a relatively short-term dip in U.S. equities during our near-decade-long bull run. This comes as most headline-grabbing companies have already reported results from calendar Q1 earnings season, and without a lot of economic data on the docket for the current week.Why investors may pay closer attention to the price of oil this week — aside from already present spikes in gasoline prices at the pump — is because the May 12 deadline for whether the U.S. remains of the accord with Iran passed during the Obama administration that lifts economic sanctions in exchange for Iran keeping dormant its nuclear weapons development. President Trump has been a big opponent of this deal, both as a candidate and as president. Even with visits to the White House by people like France’s President Macron to assuage Trump to keep the U.S. within the agreement, odds are — like with the Paris Climate Accord — that we are likely to be out by week’s end.It’s unclear what the immediate implications of this step would be, but that in itself is part of the problem: the stock market abhors uncertainty. In addition to higher oil prices — which may continue to spike as relations between the U.S. and Iran become more frayed — military tensions may increase as a result of this negated agreement, not just between the West and Middle East, but within the region itself. Hezbollah, formed initially in Iran, now wields influence in countries like Lebanon, which borders on Israel, the U.S.’s main ally in the region.This is not the arena in which to debate U.S. foreign policy, but it is worth noting that a collapse in the Iran accord is likely to increase geopolitical concerns for investors in the U.S. stock market. Crude oil prices are already seeing the affect of this to a point, but ramifications have the potential of reaching much further. It would thus be reasonable to see market participants taking a guarded approach to investing ahead of the deadline this Saturday and beyond.Ahead of Monday’s opening bell, Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) reported a fiscal Q2 2018 miss on both top and bottom lines: $1.27 per share versus $1.32 was nevertheless up 25.7% year over year.

164,SYY,"With rising consumer spending on beauty products along with rapidly changing cultural ideals, catalyzed by social media and e-commerce platforms, firms such as The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) have reasons to continue looking attractive in investors’ eyes.Well, shares of this leading cosmetics company surged 73.2% in a year, comfortably outperforming the industry’s rally of 39.9%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been reporting strong results across most geographic regions and product categories, fueled by strategic acquisitions, strong online business and effective management policies.Let’s take a closer look at some of the aspects driving the company’s spectacular performance and see if it can add laurels to its growth story.Acquisitions: A Vital Growth DriverEstee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced in the past  strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 2 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in fiscal 2018. The investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is likely to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods.  Robust Online BusinessEstee Lauder has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming years. The company has been constantly implementing digital experiences such as online booking for each store appointment, omni-channel loyalty programs and advanced mobile services. These initiatives have been boosting the company’s online sales for a while, and boosting its overall top line. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, online sales were strong and primarily driven by a robust holiday-season performance. Owing to technological advancement and the increasing popularity of social media, mobile sales have been growing considerably. In fact, mobile sales soared more than 70% during the key holiday period. Further, Estee Lauder is focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Travel Retail Opens up Business Expansion ProspectsEstee Lauder has been strongly focusing on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged onto becoming a major sales driver for the company. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by the company’s continued investments in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, along with double-digit increases in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network. Well, the company is committed toward undertaking greater strategic efforts to enhance travel retail business. Vital endeavors in this regard include better customer insights, merchandising efficiency and digital marketing efforts.Wrapping it UpDespite persisting concerns surrounding lower sales in North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores, Estee Lauder is likely to overcome such hurdles on the back of well-chalked initiatives. Moreover, management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is projected to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. Additionally, acquisitions, better-quality products, innovation, improved market reach and gains from the recently enacted tax reforms are expected to aid performance in the forthcoming periods. With such positive factors rolled up in its sleeves, Estee Lauder is expected to continue growing and attain new highs.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

(TSN  -  Free Report) has become one of the shining stars in the meat products realm. In fact, the company’s impressive past performance has also helped its shares gain 13.2% over the last six months, surpassing the industry’s 3.1% growth.Rising Demand for Protein-Rich Products Propels GrowthEscalated demand for protein products have been one of the primary growth drivers for Tyson Foods for a while. Notably, sales volumes across the company’s Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.In addition to higher demand, the Chicken and Prepared foods categories have been gaining from higher volumes, courtesy of the AdvancePierre buyout.

The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples in this connection.In fact, Tyson Foods’ investment in Beyond Meat indicates the company’s efforts to venture into the meat substitutes market. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat without any added hormones or antibiotics. The company also invested $84 million (in August 2017) and $300 million (in November 2017) to expand poultry production capacity in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated focus on augmenting protein-packed food products. Further, it is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food-service channel.Robust Cost-Saving EffortsIn the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel bottom line performance. Incidentally, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter.The company aims to generate savings from this program, through synergies from AdvancePierre’s integration along with incremental cost optimization. These efforts are estimated to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018 and around $600 million by 2020.Wrapping UpAlthough there are persisting concerns surrounding higher wage and freight expenses, Tyson Foods is expected to easily overcome such hurdles, given the company’s strong segmental performance and savings initiatives.

166,SYY,"Sysco Corporation’s (SYY  -  Free Report) stock has been moving up the charts, thanks to its focus on strategic growth initiatives which have also helped the company to put up an impressive past record. Well, this food products company has gained 17.7% in a year, as against the industry’s decline of 8.6%. So, let’s take a closer view of the factors that have spurred investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is most likely to keep its spectacular show on.Focus on 2020 StrategySysco remains focused on its key growth strategies which were outlined at its New York Investor Day event, wherein it also highlighted its three-year financial goals. Sysco’s four core strategies are enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations.This is well evident from the recent launch of its redesigned website, which is aimed at enhancing consumers overall experience. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and attain operational efficiency.  Driven by these strategies, Sysco expects gross profit to rise in a band of 55% to 65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25% by 2020. Earnings per share is envisioned to grow at a double-digit rate on an average, by 2020. Also, the company’s solid balance sheet and free cash flow augmenting ability will help it make business investments, continue with mergers and acquisitions, make share buybacks, repay debt and attain a preferred dividend payout ratio of 50-60% over time.Robust Acquisitions Bolster GrowthThe company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. The company expects to achieve 0.5–1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long term. Other than sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance its presence in international markets and its product portfolio. In this regard, Sysco recently acquired Doerle Food Services to widen its US distribution network.  Prior to that it also inked a deal to buy Kent Foods, which is expected to bolster its U.K. and European business bandwagon. In an earlier development, the company acquired Hawaii-based HFM FoodService to add it to its U.S. Foodservice segment. Apart from this, Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in July 2016 has been benefiting the company significantly. Notably, the combined companies are expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually.U.S. Foodservice Segment: A Major DriverSysco’s U.S. Foodservice business has been doing exceptionally well, which also drove the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom line grew year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While this marked Sysco’s fourth straight quarter of sales beat, earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight of the past nine straight quarters. During the second quarter sales from U.S. Foodservice Operations advanced 6.6% to $9,681.2 million as restaurant sales continued to grow — which compensated for soft traffic. Further, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rose 4.8% and total case volumes jumped 3.5%. Notably, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters.Cost-Saving Efforts & Favorable ViewSysco has been impressively managing expenses since the past few years. The company is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain. In the supply chain area, the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements, which are driving efficiencies specifically in the warehouse. The company achieved $417-million operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of fiscal 2018. Sysco envisions this operating income growth to come from reducing administrative costs and improving gross margin.All said, management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results from its International segment. Moreover, the company envisions annual savings of roughly $200-$300 million from the recent tax reforms, which is likely to fuel bottom line by 9-13 cents in the second half. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, Sysco remains well placed to deliver another solid year.Looking for More?

167,SYY,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) recently came out with fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results, wherein both top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, sales and earnings improved year over year. Further, the company has provided a promising outlook for 2018.Let’s now take a closer look at the company’s fourth-quarter and 2017 performance as well as management plans for 2018.  Q4 HighlightsAdjusted earnings came in at 94 cents per share and include benefits of 5 cents from the 53rd week. The bottom-line figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny for the first time after beating the same in the preceding three quarters.  Nevertheless, adjusted earnings rose 19% from the year-ago period. Also GAAP earnings came in at $3.71 compared with 74 cents in the prior-year period.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteAlthough net sales of $883.5 million for the quarter missed the consensus mark of $909 million, the same depicted growth of 2.9% from the prior-year period. Top-line results during the period mainly gained from a 7.2% benefit stemming from the 53rd week combined with a 0.6% recovery from the negative impacts of hurricanes that had adversely impacted third-quarter results. Management further stated that the company’s in-market performance continued to remain quite strong in the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, these upsides were partially offset by negative impacts of 2.4% stemming from the Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) exit, 0.1% from the Boulder SKU rationalization and a decline of 2.4% in underlying sales. We note that underlying sales during the quarter suffered from lower retail inventory levels and lower volume/mix. These were partially countered by 0.8% higher net price realization and impacts of 0.1% stemming from favorable currency translation. Further, inflationary trends leading to higher packaging and logistics costs have also been weighing on the company’s margins.Owing to such factors, shares of the company have lost 9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s fall of 1.9%.Moving on, adjusted gross profit for the quarter in review was $274.3 million, advancing 2.5% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted gross margin, however, slipped 10 basis points (bps) to 31.1% on account of the AJ exit and higher manufacturing investments. Moreover, gross margin also suffered from unfavorable volume mix and higher inflation.On a GAAP basis, gross profit increased 2.2%, gaining predominantly from improved sales, strong productivity and reductions in performance-based compensation program. These were somewhat offset by higher input cost inflation arising from increased packaging and logistics costs. Further, gross profit also encountered unfavorable impacts of product mix, increased manufacturing investments and discrete costs arising from the AJ exit.Further, adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) went up 11.9% to $204.2 million in the quarter, gaining from growth in gross profit as well as dedicated cost management efforts mainly in discretionary spending.Segment ResultsFrozen: Sales increased 2.7% in the quarter to $381 million on account of benefits arising from the 53rd week as well as recovery from the hurricane related impacts witnessed in the preceding quarter. These were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from the AJ exit and underlying decline in sales. Adjusted EBIT for the segment gained 1% to $89 million.Grocery: Sales rose 3.8% to $309.6 million backed by the benefits from the 53rd week, partially offset by a decline in underlying net sales.  Adjusted EBIT for the segment grew 7.1% to $84.8 million.Boulder: Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15, 2016. Consequently, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. In fourth-quarter 2017, sales at the Boulder segment jumped 13.4% to $110.5 million, fueled by robust underlying sales growth and benefits stemming from the 53rd week. These upsides were somewhat mitigated by the SKU rationalization program and shutdown of the Boulder U.K. operations. Adjusted EBIT for the segment totaled $24.5 million, a remarkable surge from the prior-year quarter figure of $12.7 million.Specialty Foods: Sales tumbled 9.9% to $82.5 million due to negative impacts of the AJ exit and underlying sales decline. Underlying sales were majorly hurt by the lower volume/mix stemming from the company’s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business. These declines were partially countered by improved net price realization and benefits arising from the 53rd week. The segment’s adjusted EBIT came in at $11.3 million, gaining 13.5% from the prior-year quarter.Full-Year ResultsIncluding a benefit of 5 cents from the 53rd week, adjusted earnings per share for 2017 came in at $2.55, reflecting 18.6% growth from a year ago, mainly benefiting from stringent cost control measures.Net sales increased 0.5% from the prior year to $3.14 billion, courtesy of underlying net sales growth from favorable volume/mix and net price realization. Top-line performance also gained from the 53rd week and the additional three weeks of Boulder Brands acquisition. These upsides were partially offset by lower retail inventories, the AJ exit and the combined negative impacts of U.K. business closures and Boulder SKU rationalization.  Adjusted gross profit during the year went down 0.9% to $913.2 million, while adjusted gross margin slumped 40 bps to 29%. Further, adjusted EBIT gained 5.7% from the prior-year to $569.3 million.We also note that during 2017, the company’s market share grew 0.5%, while its composite retail consumption jumped 2.4% from 2016. This also marked Pinnacle Foods’ 15th straight quarter and sixth consecutive year of market share growth mainly fueled by the Duncan Hines and Birds Eye businesses.Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $249.8 million, long-term debt of $2,925.6 million and total equity of $2,380.2 million.During 2017, Pinnacle Foods net cash flow from operating activities was $416 million. The company had incurred capital expenditure of $94.2 million during the year. Management expects to incur capital expenditures of $155-$165 million in 2018.2018 GuidanceManagement remains quite impressed with this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s overall market share growth as well as stringent cost containing efforts. That said, the company expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $2.85-$2.95. Considering the guidance at mid-point, earnings represent growth of 16% from 2017’s 52-week adjusted earnings per share of $2.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.80 for 2018, which is currently below the company’s forecasted range.The company also expects net sales in the first quarter of 2018 to gain from early Easter, while the same will be offset in the second quarter. Management also expects input cost inflation for 2018 to be in the range of 3.8-4.2%, with greater inflationary pressure in the first half of the year.Going forward, the company expects results to be stronger and anticipates gross margin improvement of 300-400 bps by 2020. Also, Pinnacle Foods is on track with its savings objectives and network optimization plans. On account of such efforts combined with acquisition synergies, the company expects productivity for 2018 to lie in the range of 4-4.5% of cost of products sold..Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

168,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been scaling up the charts, with its shares rallying 17.7% over a year, versus the industry’s slump of 13.2%. We note that Sysco’s U.S. Foodservice Operations has been performing quite well of late, courtesy of its strategic growth efforts.   Notably, sales at this segment grew 6.6% and 3.9% year over year in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. During the second quarter, segment sales advanced to $9,681.2 million as restaurant sales continued to grow — which compensated for soft traffic. Further, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rose 4.8% and total case volumes jumped 3.5%. Markedly, local case volumes in this segment has been rising year over year for 15 consecutive quarters.Sysco’s U.S. Foodservice business has been gaining from the company’s solid brand strength across the nation, thanks to the impressive product assortment; constant focus on brand revitalization and innovations. In this regard, Sysco has been benefiting from its efforts to offer on-trend products as well as the success of its e-commerce platform. In fact, the result of these initiatives is evident from the fact that Sysco’s local customers contributed about 46% to the total cases bought, marking 37 bps growth from the year-ago period.Although the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been incurring high operating and selling expenses that can weigh on margins, a chunk of these expenses is allocated toward investments for business growth. Incidentally, Sysco recently announced the takeover of Doerle Food Services (a Louisiana-based food service distributor), in a drive to widen its U.S. distribution network. This buyout is expected to strengthen Sysco’s core business and maximize customers’ value. Investments like these and effecting marketing, along with productivity gains are likely to continue fuel the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment.What Else Keeps Sysco Well Placed for Growth?Apart from strength in the U.S. Foodservice Operations unit, Sysco has been riding on its focus on its key growth strategies announced last year. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. Driven by these strategies, Sysco expects gross profit to rise in a band of 55% to 65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25% by 2020. Earnings per share is envisioned to grow at a double-digit rate on an average, by 2020.Also, the company’s solid balance sheet and free cash flow augmenting ability will help it make business investments, continue with merger and acquisitions, make share buybacks, repay debt and attain a preferred dividend payout ratio of 50-60% over time. Talking of acquisitions, the company has been carrying out various buyouts over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In fact, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long term. Other than sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance its presence in international markets and its product portfolio.All said, management expects a stronger second half, wherein it also anticipates favorable results from its International segment. Moreover, the company envisions annual savings of roughly $200-$300 million from the recent tax reforms, which is likely to fuel bottom line by 9-13 cents in the second half. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, Sysco remains well placed to deliver another solid year.Looking for More Promising Bets?

171,SYY,"Monday, February 5, 2018A series of curious events occurred last Friday morning, which continued — Rube Goldberg-like — throughout the day and, it may be argued, even into this morning’s pre-market trading action. Friday’s Dow closed down 673 points, or -2.57%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hived off roughly 2% each. The Dow looks to open down another triple digits, although we’ve seen some early buying back from how low we started this morning.The first thing to have happened was the non-farm payroll report Friday morning, which posted another very strong month for employment gains (+200K). Average Hourly Earnings also gained another third of a percent, meaning wage growth is showing signs of adding to overall inflation in the U.S. And talk of a fourth interest rate hike in the next 12 months from the Fed when incoming Chairman Jay Powell takes over added to the already +50% likelihood of three rate hikes, beginning next month.From there we saw the 10-year bond yield spike up past 2.8%. As Zacks Strategist Tracey Ryniec remarked in real time on Friday, “A strong economy and inflation means no more free money.” Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak reacted, “Perhaps this is the bond market telling the US, ‘We’re a little concerned with that debt situation you’ve got now that you’ve cut those tax rates.’” And Senior Strategist Kevin Cook looked at the VIX and said, “Volume still looks tame, no huge fear. Spot VIX is acting like 1% moves could be normal again. Futures are hardly panicked.”Cook also points out that last week was the worst week… of one of the best two-year rallies we’ve ever seen. Markets are up 65%, so this correction is a mere pittance by comparison. Especially considering — if you can remember back to January 2016, not all that long ago — we saw a sell-off of 6.2%. Right now, even with Monday futures again in sell-off mode, we’re only looking at around -5%. Not really in the same ballpark, at least not yet.Earnings Estimates Going UpIf you’re still concerned about markets swooning to start this new week, a good tonic for you might be Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview, where he points out not only is Q4 earnings season the best we’ve seen in years, but future earnings guidance is shooting up for future quarters. So while we do see some near-term pressure on valuations — which outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen did mention was somewhat of a concern going forward — the name of the game is still earnings, and those are only pointing north.Q4 Earnings RoundupLast week saw a host of marquee names posting quarterly earnings reports, with mostly good results. In fact, the only bottom-line misses we saw stemmed from tax-related write-downs, which are essentially near-term in nature, and not a result of missed expectations (Apple’s [(AAPL  -  Free Report)] lower-than-anticipated iPhone X sales notwithstanding). This week, we see just as many reports hitting the tape, even if they are not quite the same household names as last week.Foodservice giant Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines this morning, with 78 cents per share on $14.41 billion surpassing the 65 cents per share and $14.19 billion in revenues expected. Earnings results for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company rose 34.5% year over year. For more on SYY’s earnings, click here.British pharma major Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) also topped expectations, beating on the bottom line by a penny to 68 cents per share, and quarterly sales of $5.45 billion outpaced the $5.31 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Guidance was ratcheted up a bit, but still within the Zacks consensus. For more on BMY’s earnings, click here.And Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report), the engineered products segment that formerly belonged to aluminum giant Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report), easily outperformed both sales and earnings estimates. The company saw 31 cents per share on $3.27 billion in revenues, ahead of the 24 cents per share and $3.07 billion we had been expecting. Guidance on the top-line rose past the Zacks consensus, while full-year earnings remain in-range.

172,SYY,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term. So how about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Consumer Staples Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

173,SYY,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5. We expect Church & Dwight to continue gaining from its stable portfolio of value and premium products, focus on innovations, benefits from buyouts and aggressive productivity programs. These factors have been driving Church & Dwight for a while now, with the Consumer International segment in particular.Consumer International to Remain a Major Driver Church & Dwight’s Consumer International business has been doing exceptionally well. Evidently, consistent strength at this segment has been driving the company’s overall organic sales growth for more than a year now. In the third quarter, organic sales in the consumer international segment jumped 6.2%, thanks to higher volumes. Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Further, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Clearly, this segment holds immense potential and is likely to sustain its splendid trend this time around as well. Markedly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $154 million, reflecting a solid 20.3% upside from the year-ago reported figure.Growth Initiatives to Continue Driving Performance Further, Church & Dwight’s regular innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories. Thus, management remains committed toward innovations in particular, as it believes that remains the biggest driver for its top and bottom-line growth in future. As for acquisitions, Church & Dwight has acquired a number of superior brands with high margin over time. These businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004 to $3.5 billion in 2016. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in third-quarter 2017 and is on track with its integration.Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Quote Together, such strategic endeavors drove Church & Dwight’s results in the third quarter. Despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes, both top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. While this marked the consumer products giant’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise, sales have outpaced the consensus mark in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In fact, Church & Dwight’s strong record has helped it jump 10.58% in the past three months, crushing the industry’s 2% growth. Delving deeper into the results, we note that improved volumes drove organic sales by 3.2% — thereby retaining its long year-over-year growth trend.

174,SYY,"Sysco Corp. (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 5. The food products giant delivered positive earnings surprise in seven out of the past eight quarters, while sales topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for three consecutive quarters. Sysco’s strong record has also helped it to jump 22.8% in a year against the industry that dipped 0.2%.So, let’s see if this Texas-based company can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too.Factors at PlayWe expect Sysco to continue gaining from its cost-saving and revenue-management efforts, which have been driving its performance for a while now. Incidentally, the company has been impressively managing expenses for the past few years, and is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain areas. In the supply chain area, the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements.Driven by these endeavors, the company remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600-$650 million through the end of FY18. This growth is expected to come from lower administrative costs and improving gross margin, which gives out positive signals for the quarter under review.Further, the company’s focus on acquisitions, new product developments, value-added services and improved e-commerce capabilities remains a growth driver. In this regard, the company’s recent acquisition of HFM Foodservice is likely to augment its top line, by boosting revenues of the U.S. Foodservice segment. Notably, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long term. Other than aiding sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance Sysco’s presence in international markets.Backed by these factors, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for quite some time now, and we expect this trend to continue in the quarter to be reported.How Are Sysco’s Segments Placed?Taking a segment-wise look, we remain optimistic about the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations, which delivered a strong performance in the last reported quarter despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes. Notably, sales in this segment advanced 4% to $9,849.9 million, with local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations up 2.8%. Also, gross profit increased 3.8%, backed by the company’s focus on product management, efficient pricing and revenue management initiatives.Going forward, management expects its domestic business to be buoyed by increased consumer demand and traffic. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $9,561 million, which reflects 5.2% growth from the year-ago period.Moving to the International Foodservice Operations, this unit delivered improved sales too in the last reported quarter. However, results were partly hurt by softness in Europe, which is battling slow traffic. Moreover, weak UK currency resulted in food cost inflation, thereby leading to pricing pressure. These headwinds are likely to persist throughout the fiscal, though management remains focused on reducing the impact of such obstacles. Additionally, the company remains encouraged about the growth prospects in Latin America. Markedly, the consensus mark for International sales stands at $2,784 million compared with $2,626 million in the same year-ago period.The company also remains hopeful of growth in its SYGMA segment, for which the consensus estimate for sales is $1,613 million, up 6.1% from the year-ago reported sales figure.Q2 Expectations as a WholeSysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation QuoteGiven these factors and Sysco’s focus on its recently announced strategies for 2020, we believe that the company will continue with its top and bottom-line growth in the second quarter.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 65 cents, which represents more than 12% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $14,186 million, up 5.4% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model Unveils?To top it, our proven model shows that Sysco is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

175,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been gaining from strategic buyouts, well-chalked growth endeavors and efficient financial strategies. Such efforts have helped this leading distributor and marketer of food products to augment business and develop a robust product portfolio.Portfolio Expansion Through BuyoutsAcquisitions have been a key catalyst for Sysco’s expanding distribution network and customer base. Coming to major buyouts, the company recently inked a deal to buy Kent Frozen Foods, a leading foodservice provider in the United Kingdom. Currently, the deal is subject to approval from the Competition and Markets Authority. Kent Frozen Foods is expected to form a part of Sysco’s U.K. and European business bandwagon, which already includes popular names like M&J Seafood, Fresh Direct and Brakes. Moreover, the deal is likely to help the company effectively combat sluggish business trends in the United Kingdom and induce a turnaround in the region’s performance.In 2017, Sysco acquired HFM FoodService and the remaining 50% stake in Mayca Distribuidores. Apart from that, the acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in 2016 has been benefiting the company significantly and is expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually.Notably, Sysco expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions in the long run. Other major food companies such as United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI  -  Free Report) and McCormick & Company (MKC  -  Free Report) have also been strengthening their foothold in the industry through strategic buyouts.Strategic Plans Favor U.S. BusinessSysco has been keenly working on business optimization strategies for inducing growth and improving operations. To this end, the company outlined some important strategies at the New York Investor Day event in December 2017, wherein it highlighted its three-year financial goals. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficiency. By evolving with changing consumer preferences, Sysco is committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain operations, increase transparency and enhance delivery capacity.Driven by these strategies, the company expects gross profit to rise in the band of 55-65%, while it anticipates 20-25% reduction in administrative expenses by 2020. Earnings per share are projected to grow at a double-digit rate on an average by 2020.  Further, we expect such efficient financial plans, supported by strong balance sheet and cash positions, to aid the company in continuing with investments and expansion efforts.Sysco’s focus on product management, efficient pricing and revenue management initiatives have been favoring the company’s domestic business. Notably, sales at the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations improved 4% to $9,849.9 million, with local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations rising 2.8%. Also, gross profit increased 3.8% at the segment.An Environment-Friendly Approach to Cost ReductionApart from augmenting financial strength and improving existing operations, Sysco has also been adopting an innovative approach toward delivering environment friendly services. In December 2017, the company reserved 50 new fully-electric semi tractors at Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) to introduce alternative-fuel vehicles to its fleet. This move will not only be environment friendly, but is also likely to curtail fuel and transportation expenses considerably.Bottom LineThe company’s dedicated efforts to emerge as a strong contender in the foodservices arena are laudable. Moreover, an impressive surprise history speaks volumes regarding the effectiveness of the company’s growth plans and operational polices. Such efforts are expected to continue strengthening the company’s business and sustain growth.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

177,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been in investors’ good books for quite some time now, courtesy of its splendid past record. The company has been gaining from a host of factors, especially its key growth strategies and strong U.S. Foodservice unit. This is well-reflected in its performance, as Sysco rallied as much as 41.3% in a year, against the industry’s decline of 2.5%.However, the company has been bearing the brunt of rising freight costs and input cost inflation, which may put pressure on margins. Let’s analyze both sides of the story and see if the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company can keep its robust show on.Four Core Strategies for 2020Sysco is on track with its key growth strategies for 2020, which include enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing brands. Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations. Moreover, it plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency, enhance deliveries and manage product costs effectively.Driven by these strategies, the company witnessed local case growth and improved gross profit during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Further, management believes that the company is well positioned to achieve adjusted operating income improvement in the higher end of its targeted range $600-$650 million. Also, the company’s solid balance sheet and ability to augment free cash flow will help it make business investments, continue with mergers and acquisitions, make share buybacks, provide adequate dividends and repay debts.Strong U.S. Foodservice Unit, Buyouts to Drive SalesSysco’s sales have long been gaining from strength in the company’s U.S. Foodservice operations. Sales at this segment advanced 5.1% to $9,704.5 million in third-quarter fiscal 2018 on the back of 2.6% growth in local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations, while total case volumes jumped 2.4%. Notably, local case volumes in this segment have been rising year over year for 16 consecutive quarters. Additionally, rising restaurant sales has been benefitting the company’s U.S. operations for a while.Also, Sysco has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base, and boost long-term growth. In this regard, Sysco closed its Kent Foods buyout deal during the third quarter and expects the same to bolster the U.K. and European business bandwagon. During the third quarter, the company also concluded the acquisitions of Hawaii-based HFM FoodService and Louisiana-based Doerle Food Service. Incidentally, the HFM buyout aided the company’s U.S. Broadline operations during the third quarter.Can It Sustain Past Record Sustain Amid Hurdles?Owing to the aforementioned upsides, favorable international segment results and lower taxes, Sysco retained its splendid record in its third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Both top and bottom lines grew year over year and the latter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This marked Sysco’s fourth straight quarter of earnings beat. In fact, the company’s bottom line has surpassed estimates in nine out of the past 10 quarters.However, Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year contraction in gross margin for the past three quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, gross margin contracted 9 basis points to 18.65%. The company continues to be negatively impacted by higher inbound freight costs, which stemmed from driver availability challenges in the industry. Segment-wise, during the third quarter, U.S. Broadline unit gross margin was marred by food cost inflation in categories like meat, dairy and produce.Additionally, the International segment was hurt by inflation that resulted from a combination of product costs and currency translations in the United Kingdom. Also, the company has been grappling with headwinds in the European region for a while now. During the third quarter, Sysco’s European sales were hit by winter storms, while high product inflation and reduced shipping days also posed concerns for the region.Despite these challenges, Sysco expects its upsides to continue in the forthcoming periods, thanks to its strong growth drivers. Analysts also seem to be confident about Sysco’s ongoing prospects, as earnings etimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 have gone up from 91 cents to 94 cents and from $2.97 to $2.99 respectively, over the past 60 days.Check Out These Solid Food StocksMEDIFAST INC (MED  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, delivered positive earnings surprises in the last three quarters.

179,SYY,"The Consumer Staples sector, which is considered to be defensive even in the times of economic disruptions, has been benefiting from the uptick in the U.S. economy. The sector looks well placed buoyed by rising consumer confidence, modest consumer spending and accelerating labor market. Also, the sector has a Zacks Sector Rank of #5 (out of 16).Despite the prospering Consumer Staples sector, Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is one stock that has been losing luster due to its dismal surprise history. The company’s sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for more than three years now, alongside delivering negative earnings surprise in eight of the last 10 quarters. As a result, the stock has declined 6.5% in a year’s time against the sector’s 14.7% growth.What’s Troubling Archer Daniels?Archer Daniels is experiencing the jolts of the tough operating environment in the Agricultural industry owing to fluctuating commodity prices and oversupply. This, in turn, has been largely weighing upon the company’s top and bottom lines while keeping margins strained. In third-quarter 2017, top line declined across all of the company’s segments while strained margins at the Agricultural Services and Oilseeds Processing segments hurt the bottom line.Agricultural Services segment was hurt by soft merchandising and handling results for North America Grain due to lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. Further, lower crushing margins as well as lower South American origination margins resulted in reduced margins at the Oilseeds Processing segment.Consumer Staples Space Still Has Some Solid PicksThough Archer Daniels looks troubled, the Consumer Staples sector still has stocks that are doing well and promise solid growth in the future.

180,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) appears to be investors’ preferred pick, as evident from its solid bull run. This distributor and marketer of food products has seen its shares gain 16.6% in the past six months, when the industry was down 0.6%. The company's impressive growth initiatives have been driving solid results over the past years.However, the company’s European business remains pressurized, thus posing a concern for Sysco’s international performance. Nonetheless, the company’s recently outlined core strategies for 2020 which reflect its strong prospects. So, let’s take a closer look at Sysco’s driving factors and see if they can help the company retain its solid record despite the hurdles.Core Strategies for 2020 Bode WellSysco recently outlined its key growth strategies at its New York Investor Day event, wherein it also highlighted its three-year financial goals.  Sysco stated that its four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimizing business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing its assortments, undertaking innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalizing its brands.Management believes that these game plans will help it achieve its financial goals for fiscal 2020. The company expects gross profit to rise in a range of 55-65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25%. Consequently, the company plans to achieve adjusted operating income growth of about $650-$700 million by fiscal 2020 end, reflecting a three-year CAGR of 9%. Moreover, the company envisions earnings per share to grow at a double-digit rate on an average, by 2020.Focus on AcquisitionsThe company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to grow its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. Other than sales growth, these acquisitions also enhance its presence in international markets and its product portfolio. In this regard, Sysco recently acquired Hawaii-based HFM FoodService, which will be added to the company’s U.S. Foodservice segment. Other moves in this regard include the buyout Supplies on the Fly; North Star Seafood, Gilchrist & Soames and 50% stake in Mexico-based Pacific Star Foodservice among others.Cost-Cutting Initiatives to Enhance MarginsSysco has been impressively managing expenses since the past few years. In the supply chain area, the company is witnessing positive momentum from its productivity initiatives and ongoing process improvements, which are driving efficiencies specifically in the warehouse. The company achieved $417 million operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.Splendid Surprise HistorySysco began fiscal 2018 on a strong note, as both top and bottom lines grew year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter. While this marked Sysco’s third straight quarter of sales beat, earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of the past eight straight quarters now. Results were mainly backed by strength in the company’s U.S. Foodservice Operations despite the dismal impact of hurricanes.European Weakness Raises Concerns for International PerformanceSysco’s International performance remained mixed in the first quarter, mainly due to softness in Europe — which is battling sluggish restaurant traffic and an overall slowdown in Food Away From Home in the United Kingdom. Moreover, weakness in pound sterling resulted in acute food cost inflation in the United Kingdom, thereby leading to pricing pressure. This, in turn hurt volume growth and gross margin in the first quarter. Unfortunately, management expects these headwinds to linger throughout fiscal 2018, which remains a threat to Sysco’s International performance.Further, Sysco generates significant business from its international operations, which are spread across Canada, Europe and Latin America. Evidently, sales from its International Foodservice operations constituted about 20% of the company’s total revenue in the first quarter. Thus, the company remains prone to the risk of unfavorable currency translationsNevertheless, management expects its domestic business to be buoyed by increased consumer demand and traffic. Given these factors, along with the progress of its cost-savings plan, this Zacks Ran #3 (Hold) company remains well placed to witness another solid year.Looking for More?

182,SYY,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) reported lower-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the top and bottom lines missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, the quarter marked earnings miss after four straight positive surprises, while sales lagged estimates after two consecutive beat.Q4 HighlightsBoston Beer’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents.However, earnings came in at $2.57 per share, including one-time items like gains of $1.72 from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and a tax benefit of 1 cent owing to the adoption of the new Accounting Standard – Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU 2016-09), effective Jan 1, 2017. The company posted earnings of $1.75 per share in the 14-week period ended Dec 31, 2016.Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) QuoteThe year-over-year rise in the bottom line mainly stemmed from favorable tax reforms along with higher gross margin, somewhat compensated with lower shipment volumes and increased investments in brands.On the contrary, revenues dropped nearly 6% year over year to $220.5 million. Excluding excise taxes, the top line decreased 5.9% year over year to $206.3 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $208 million. While, shipment volume was down 7.7%, depletions declined 10%.In the reported quarter, depletion volumes were impacted by the loss of a week’s depletions and persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, partly mitigated by growth in Twisted Tea, and Truly Spiked & Sparkling brands.However, depletions for the year-to-date period through the six-week period ended Feb 10, 2018 are estimated to have grown nearly 6% from the comparable year-ago period.Costs & MarginsGross profit inched up 0.3% year over year to $108 million, while gross margin expanded 330 basis points to 52.4% in the quarter. The improvement in gross margin can be attributed to better pricing, product and package mix along with cost-savings gains from the company-owned breweries. These were partly mitigated by adverse fixed cost absorption due to lower volumes as well as increased higher ingredients and packaging expenses.Furthermore, advertising, promotional and selling expenses jumped 26.8% to $73.4 million, mainly owing to higher investments in media and digital advertising, increased local marketing, production and market research expenses. The increase was somewhat offset by lower freight to distributors on reduced volumes and rates.General and administrative expenses grew 19.7% to $18.8 million. The upside was backed by the impact of $3.6 million from the reversal in stock compensation cost in the year-ago quarter, associated with the retirement of the company’s chief executive officer in 2018. The metric was somewhat offset with decline in consulting fees in the reported quarter.FinancialsAs of Dec 30, 2017, Boston Beer had cash and cash equivalents of $65.6 million and total stockholders’ equity of $423.5 million.In 2017, the company generated approximately $136 million of cash from operating activities.As of Feb 16, 2018, Boston Beer bought back about 179,000 shares worth roughly $31.9 million. With this, it had nearly $169.8 million remaining under its $931-million share buyback authorization.Growth PlanManagement remains committed toward a three-point growth plan. Firstly, revival of the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. It has launched new media campaigns for the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands as well. Additionally, the company remains optimistic about other innovative product launches like Sam '76, Samuel Adams New England IPA and Angry Orchard Rose. It also targets to retain momentum for the Twisted Tea brand and gaining leadership for Truly Spiked & Sparkling brand in the hard sparkling water category.Secondly, accelerated focus on cost savings and efficiency projects with savings directed for further brand development. Depending upon the current opportunities in 2018, management reiterated its gross margin expansion target, which is likely to grow on an average of roughly one percentage point every year through 2019.Thirdly, management remains committed to long-term brand innovations and maximizing the shareholder value. Boston Beer also remains optimistic about the craft beer and cider categories, going forward.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 32.3%, substantially outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.8%. We believe these initiatives to drive growth and retain the stock momentum going forward.GuidanceManagement updated its outlook for 2018. Depletions and shipments are likely to range from flat to up 6% compared with the earlier guidance of growth in low-single digits. Prices are expected to grow in the 0-2% band compared with 1-2% guided earlier. Gross margin expansion is anticipated to lie between 52% and 54% owing to the progress on the cost savings. Earlier, the company projected gross margin to grow between 52-53%.Investment in advertising, promotional and selling expenses are still envisioned to increase in the range of $15-$25 million. Management anticipates general and administrative expenses to grow within the $10-$20 million range, attributable to organizational investments as well as stock compensation expenses.For 2018, earnings per share are envisioned between $6.30 and $7.30. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $7.01 for the year.Moreover, adjusted effective tax rate guidance is anticipated to be roughly 28%, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09, versus 37% guided earlier. Capital spending is still envisioned in the band of $55-$65 million for 2018, which can increase per the requirements.Looking for Solid Stocks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Staples sector include Post Holdings, Inc.

185,SYY,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 2. The company has an impressive earnings history, having delivered a positive surprise in each of the past five quarters.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0.8% year over year.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the company’s earnings announcement. The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Clorox Company QuoteFactors at PlayWe note that Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter, which is likely to continue in the forthcoming period. Margin was strained due to escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of transportation market. Also, results were hurt by strategic investments for growth and cost savings initiatives, which might continue to increase expenses and hurt profitability in the quarter to be reported. Meanwhile, intense competition from well-established players in the consumer products industry remains a cause for concern.In the past three months, shares of Clorox have lost 17.5%, wider than the industry’s decline of 10.6%.However, Clorox remains committed toward brand management and improvement in margins through cost saving and productivity initiatives. Also, it makes strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities both in the physical world and online. Recently, management has agreed to buy Nutranext, the Florida-based dietary supplements leader, for $700 million. The deal is expected to expand Clorox's dietary supplements business, thereby accelerating growth of its top brands in the fast-growing categories, alongside focusing on health and wellness. Additionally, it remains well on track with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share.These tailwinds might contribute to the company’s top line and boost profitability. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues to come in at $1.51 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.In the light of these above-mentioned factors, let’s wait and see what lies ahead of Clorox in third-quarter fiscal 2018.What Does the Zacks Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Clorox’s Earnings ESP of -0.94% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicate there are little chances of an earnings beat in the ensuing quarter.As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #3.

This action is in sync with the company’s cost-savings plan and is likely to bolster the operational efficiency of the North American thermal network.The Toronto facility will be shut down in phases, within a period of about 18 months, resulting in 380 job cuts out of 600. Further, the Canadian headquarters and related commercial operations will be relocated to the Greater Toronto Area, with around 200 job positions. It will house a modern Food Innovation Center that will serve the community with soup and broth recipes, to suit Canadian tastes.The decision to close this facility stems from the company’s recent review of manufacturing operations, which indicates that the plant is no longer competitively viable due to its age and size. This facility was opened in 1931 and happens to the company’s oldest plant in the thermal plant network.As mentioned above, the winding down of the Toronto plant is in accordance with the company’s cost-savings plan, which was announced in fiscal 2015. Campbell has been progressing well with this initiative and anticipates cost savings worth $450 million by the end of fiscal 2020. Notably, the company generated savings of $20 million in first-quarter fiscal 2018, bringing the savings to $345 million as of Oct 29, 2017. Additionally, the company expects the cost savings program to deliver $60-$70 million of savings in fiscal 2018 that is incremental to the productivity gains from ongoing supply chain initiatives.We believe that the company’s strategy of concentrating on supply chain efficiencies, along with curtailing costs and reinvesting part of these savings in areas with high growth potential is likely to drive growth.Stock PerformanceCampbell has lagged the industry in the past year due to dismal top and bottom-line trends in recent quarters.

187,SYY,"With acquisitions and efforts to boost online business rolled up in its sleeves, Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) seems well on track to augment market share in the world of beauty and cosmetics. In fact, these factors have been fueling the top line performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company for a while.However, a major obstacle in Coty’s growth path is the sluggishness in the Consumer Beauty segment. This has been denting the company’s organic sales performance. So, let’s see if Coty’s growth drivers can help the company to tide over obstacles and sustain its growth in the forthcoming periods.Acquisitions: A Vital Growth DriverImproved consumer confidence has not only been favoring higher spending on food and beverage items, but has also increased spending on personal care and cosmetic products. Such trends have been boosting Coty’s Luxury and Professional segments performance and have also encouraged the company to engage in business expansion through buyouts.In fact, Coty has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its rich line-up of brands. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s top line improved more than 100% year over year, mainly driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout and positive synergies from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Other instances include the buyout of 60% stake in LLC and the takeover of international license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare.Other Efforts to Boost PerformanceFurther, Coty is boosting end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce across its divisions and regions. The company has been making great strides in this regard, which has driven e-commerce sales growth in Consumer Beauty and Luxury segments in the first quarter. Notably, through the peer-to-peer social selling platform Younique, Coty has been able to establish improved connectivity with customers. Further, the company is making progress with COVERGIRL brand through Custom Blend app. The app enables customers take a digital, social and influencer-led go-to-market approach as well as personalize and customize it as per desire.Additionally, Coty is committed toward enhancing cost structure. This is indicated from the fact that the company’s gross margin has been expanding for a while now. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the adjusted gross margin increased 280 basis points, courtesy of supply-chain efficiencies; procurement synergies and contributions from buyouts. Also, the adjusted operating income jumped 17% to $195.1 million, driven by Coty’s stringent financial discipline.Aided by such upsides, shares of the company have surged 32.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 22.1%.Can Strategic Plans Offset Headwinds?Lately, persistent softness in Consumer Beauty segment has been a worry for the company. The segment has been struggling against underlying challenges in North America, thanks to changing consumers’ preferences and a highly competitive environment. Soft market trends in major cosmetics categories and reduced shelf space for few brands (in the United States and Europe) have been acting as deterrents for the segment. Evidently, organic sales in this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter, following declines of 10% and 6% in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Nevertheless, Coty’s strategic business expansion and efficiency-building endeavors have helped the company to develop a robust brand line-up. We expect such efforts to help the company overcome the aforementioned headwinds.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

This will bolster the company’s foothold in the rapidly-growing enzymes business.Archer Daniels’ PerformanceArcher Daniels has been struggling against a tough operating environment in the Agricultural industry due to fluctuating commodity prices and oversupply. This has been largely denting the company’s top and bottom lines while keeping margins strained.

189,SYY,"There is a long list of popular averages and ranges that investors like to use while looking at stocks, and that includes the 52-week low and 52-week high metrics. It’s great to find stocks right before they surge towards new highs, but it can be difficult for some to establish a new and consistent range.With that said, investors typically become interested in stocks as they breach 52-week highs because that momentum can oftentimes continue until a new range is established. If a stock is strong in a variety of key categories, it certainly can keep climbing well above that old 52-week high, and we can find those strong stocks using our Zacks methods.Here at Zacks, we place an emphasis on earnings-related data, especially earnings estimate revision activity, and this can definitely be applied to stocks approaching their 52-week highs. One way to ensure continued upward momentum is solid earnings momentum, so we can use the proven Zacks Rank system to identify companies that are impressing in this regard.Using this strategy, we have found five stocks that are seeing positive estimate revision activity and are hovering near their 52-week highs. Check them out now:1.       Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $77.90 / 52-Week High: $77.91After surpassing earnings estimates by five cents in its most recent quarter, Target witnessed several positive estimate revisions for its upcoming quarters. In fact, our consensus estimate for its upcoming fiscal year has gained more than $1.00 over the past 60 days. Meanwhile, shares have climbed roughly 25% in just 12 weeks. The stock is taking off like a rocket on the back of an improved outlook, and investors will not want to miss the gains that could come if Target can post another strong quarter. 2.       Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $62.22 / 52-Week High: $62.79Food distribution giant Sysco is experiencing strong momentum in the wake of its tenth-consecutive quarter or matching or surpassing earnings estimates. Shares of the company have soared about 14% over the past 12 weeks, lifting the stock toward the 52-week high it is hovering at today. But earnings estimates are improving for the current quarter and next quarter, so shares should keep climbing as Sysco’s outlook improves. Our consensus estimates are calling for the company’s bottom line to improve by 12% and 22%, respectively, over the next two quarters. 3.       CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $132.91 / 52-Week High: $133.31Earnings estimates are moving higher for both the current and next fiscal year for CBOE, an options exchange based in Chicago. This revision activity has been a driving force for the stock, which has now gained more than 20% over the last 12 weeks. Still, impressive top and bottom line growth in the current quarter should inspire even stronger momentum, and a rising rate environment over the next few years should help that momentum continue into the long term. 4.       Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $112.90 / 52-Week High: $115.89Much has been made about the death of brick-and-mortar retail, but times have perhaps never been better for discount retailers like Dollar Tree. The company is riding high after two solid earnings beats, and the stock has moved more than 23% over the past 12 weeks. Meanwhile, our consensus estimate for Dollar Tree’s upcoming fiscal year earnings has gained a whopping 60 cents within the past 60 days. The company’s bottom line outlook is improving significantly, and investors will hope that this improvement inspires continued momentum. 5.       FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $272.25 / 52-Week High: $273.16Shipping behemoth FedEx is bouncing back strongly after a concerning down period. The company beat our consensus earnings estimate by more than 10% in the most recent quarter, and shares have soared more than 20% within the past 12 weeks. That surge has lifted FedEx to these 52-week high levels, but the stock should break higher soon on the back of its improved earnings outlook. Our consensus estimates are soaring thanks to a tidal wave of positive revisions, so investors should be able to capitalize soon. Bottom LineAll of these stocks are quickly approaching their 52-week highs, and that means they should be on your radar. Each stock is also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) based on its strong earnings-related data, including recent positive estimate revisions. While there are no guarantees on the stock market, these five companies definitely appear to be well-equipped to establish new ranges soon.Want more analysis from this author?

191,SYY,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) has done exceedingly well and emerged as a strong contender to be an investment choice. This is quite evident from the stock’s surge of 30.5%, compared with the industry’s growth of 19.8%. We believe there is still momentum left in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is reflected in its VGM Score of A. Let’s delve deeper. Protein Packed Brands — A Bright SpotTyson Foods actively responds to consumers increasing preference for protein-packed meat and chicken products. Notably, sales volume in the chicken segment inched up 1.6% and 4.1% during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Encouraged by such growth, the company has undertaken several efforts to expand poultry production capacity, especially in Tennessee. Along with the chicken segment, the company’s beef unit grew 0.4% and 3.3% in the past two quarters. Robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports have been the primary catalysts in this segment.Further, Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to strengthen protein-packed portfolio. In this regard, the company’s AdvancePierre buyout favorably impacted the Prepared Foods segment’s performance in the last two quarters. To enrich Prepared Foods category, the company also announced the buyout of Original Philly Holdings in November 2017. Management continues to expect positive synergies from these acquisitions.Robust Global Foothold & Product PortfolioTyson Foods has a significant presence in markets outside the United States. During fiscal 2017, the company sold its products in approximately 117 countries, with major sales from markets of Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, Middle East, South Korea and Taiwan. Notably, fiscal 2017 sales to customers in foreign countries totaled $4.5 billion, of which $3.9 billion were related to export sales from the United States.Moving to its product portfolio, Tyson Foods offers a wide array of meat products and commands a strong presence in beef, pork, chicken as well as processed and fresh meat food products categories. This acts as a buffer to the company’s sales and margins — if one category fails, the others can aid recovery. Also, Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line-up. For fiscal 2018, the company plans to test line-up of meal kits and add more products to Hillshire snacking.Valuation PerspectiveA brief glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that Tyson Foods has enough room to run in bourses.Tyson Foods with a price to sales ratio of 0.8 compared with that of industry’s 1.1 indicate that the stock has enough upside potential. The stock also looks attractive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 13.7x compared with industry’s 14.6x. A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. Tyson Foods holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 10.1 lower than 11 for the industry.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookUnited Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2.3% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Rank #2 company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

192,SYY,"On Jan 11, we upgraded Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) by a notch to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Going by the Zacks model, companies with a Zacks Rank #2 have chances of outperforming the broader market in the next two to three months.It goes without saying that major food companies are having a tough time due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic food. The industry woes have also been hurting Mondelez’s stock price performance for quite some time now, gaining only 3.3% in the past three months compared with 4.3% of its industry. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the company’s focus on innovation and brand building, cost savings and productivity gains.Also, upward estimate revisions further optimism regarding the stock’s prospects. Earnings estimates for 2018 moved up 0.4% over the past 30 days. This signifies that analysts are optimistic about this stock’s near-term performance. Earnings are expected to increase 10.3% and 11.1% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Growth InitiativesProduct innovation is an important part of Mondelez’s growth strategy, given the changing consumer preferences. The company regularly refreshes its brand portfolio through innovation and reaches its brands to new geographies and platforms. Recently, the company teamed up with the third-largest cereal company in the United States, Post Consumer Brands, to create two cookie-inspired breakfast cereals.  Mondelez plans to offer more good-for-you snacks and expects 50% of its product portfolio to comprise “well-being” items by 2020, instead of the current one-third. Apart from simplifying the ingredients and improving nutritional benefits of the existing products, the company will continue to develop products to meet the growing consumer demand for healthier and natural items.It is also improving its presence in high-growth channels like e-commerce, discounters, convenience stores and traditional trade.  Mondelez inked an e-commerce partnership with China’s leading online and mobile commerce company, Alibaba Group. It expects to generate $1 billion in annual revenues by 2020 from the e-commerce platform. Notably, e-commerce net revenues were up more than 70% in the first nine months of 2017.Mondelez has been focusing on driving margins through cost savings and productivity improvement. In February 2014, the company announced a $3.5-billion restructuring plan (2014-2018 Restructuring Program) which is expected to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by the end of 2018. Savings from the program are being used to fund marketing investments and expand capacity to boost the top line and market share. The company is also working to drive advertising cost efficiencies by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media costs and shifting spending to lower-cost digital media outlets.The company also focuses on expanding its business through acquisitions. Major buyouts include LU biscuit, Cadbury and certain intangibles from Burton's Biscuit Company. Mondelez plans to make other acquisitions, mainly in developing countries.Mondelez has been regularly divesting non-core underperforming businesses in order to streamline its operations. In April 2017, the company completed the sale of several manufacturing facilities in France and the license of several local confectionery brands.In July 2017, the company completed the divestiture of a major part of its grocery business in Australia and New Zealand to Bega Cheese Limited. These deals are expected to increase the Power Brand mix, improve growth rate and expand margins.Bottom LineThough challenging industry conditions hurt to some extent, we expect Mondelez’s focus on innovation, brand building, cost savings and productivity improvement along with acquisitions and divestitures to work in favor of the company.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same industry include Ingredion Incorporated (INGR  -  Free Report), Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report).

193,SYY,"The ongoing earnings season has unveiled a rosy picture so far with many companies reporting better-than-expected earnings. According to the latest Earnings Preview, 78.6% of the 341 S&P 500 companies that have reported thus far have outperformed earnings estimates.This is highly encouraging as an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation. Investors like to add outperformers to their portfolios, which can fetch them handsome returns.Markets Narrate a Different StoryDespite the impressive Q4 performance, the U.S. equity market has been witnessing a roller coaster ride. Both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 entered into the correction territory on Feb 9, down more than 10% from the all-time high reached in January.The steep sell-off was due to stronger-than-expected job additions along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years. These factors, in turn, triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected.The heightened volatility is reflected in the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)Proper Guidance - A Must in this ScenarioWith market participants gripped by fears on the one hand and robust earnings numbers on the other, selecting potential winning stocks is a difficult task.Furthermore, with a huge number of stocks available in the market at any point of time, spotting potential outperformers is by no means an easy task for individual investors. In the absence of proper guidance, identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for ‘a needle in a haystack’.Additionally, with time at a premium these days, it is next to impossible for investors to go through the extensive process. Given this backdrop, it is in the best interest of investors to seek guidance from “experts in the field."" The concerned experts are brokers.Broker Advice to the RescueThe “experts” in the field of investing are brokers who are equipped with detailed knowledge about the space. Brokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. To attain their objective, they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations. Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Earnings Estimate RevisionsSince brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. The estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.For example, an earnings beat by a company generally leads to upward estimate revisions with prices moving north. Similarly, lackluster earnings often lead to stock price depreciation.

194,SYY,"Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week low of $43.50 on Feb 6, closing a notch higher at $45.14. Also, the company shares have been losing investors’ confidence in a year’s time due to dismal top- and bottom-line trends in the recent quarters, amid a volatile operating environment. Evidently, the stock plunged 28.8% in a year, much wider than the industry’s decline of 6.8%.Moreover, the company’s VGM Score of C indicates that troubles for this convenience food products company are not over yet.Let’s delve deeper to analyze the factors hindering this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in the recent times.What’s Hindering the Stock?Of late, Campbell Soup looks troubled which is well reflected in its dismal top- and bottom-line trend. With the three consecutive quarters of earnings miss, it has delivered an average negative surprise of 3.75% in the trailing four quarters.  Moreover, revenues lagged estimates in the four straight quarters.Campbell’s earnings declined due to the rise in cost inflation and higher carrot costs, which have significantly hurt the performance of its Campbell Fresh (C-Fresh) division. Additionally, the rise in transportation and logistics costs due to the recent hurricanes impacted the bottom line in first-quarter fiscal 2018.Also, sales continue to be plagued by the volatile operating environment characterized by evolving retail sector and increased competition in the food industry. The food industry is prone to changing consumers’ tastes and preferences as well, which is in turn weighing on the company’s overall performance.Furthermore, Campbell’s margins remain under pressure due to the aforementioned cost inflation and higher carrot costs. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates gross margin to be comparable to last year, which is below previous expectations. This is likely to be impacted by higher transportation and logistics costs as well as the cost impact of lower carrot yields. Driven by the lowered gross margin forecast, the company projects adjusted EBIT to decline in the range of 2-4% versus earlier guidance of decrease of 1% to increase of 1%.Not only this, the company has earlier trimmed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. While sales growth is expected to range from negative 2% to flat, adjusted earnings guidance is slashed to remain in the band of $2.95-$3.02 per share, representing decline in the range of 1-3%.That said, we believe the stock is likely to display a subdued performance in the near term.Still Interested in This Space?

195,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) inked a deal to buy Kent Frozen Foods, a leading foodservice provider in the United Kingdom, with distribution facilities in Aylesford (Kent) and Witney (Oxfordshire). The buyout deal is currently subject to approval from the Competition and Markets Authority.A Win-Win Strategy for BothUpon approval of the deal, Kent Frozen Foods will form part of Sysco’s U.K. and European business bandwagon, which already includes popular names such as M&J Seafood, Fresh Direct and Brakes. Per the norms of the deal, although Kent Frozen Foods will continue to function as a separate entity, it is set to gain from Sysco’s superior hold and brand image in the foodservice market. Further, the deal will enable Kent to establish closer ties with other businesses of Sysco in the U.K. and European regions.From Sysco’s point of view, acquisitions have always been profitable and aided in augmenting its market share and distribution network, thereby boosting long-term growth prospects. Notably, the company expects to achieve 0.5-1% sales growth through acquisitions, in the long run.Looking back, in 2017, Sysco acquired HFM FoodService and the remaining 50% stake in Mayca Distribuidores. Apart from that, Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in 2016 has been benefiting the company significantly and is expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually.That said, we expect Sysco’s latest venture of adding Kent Frozen Foods to its business portfolio to result in boosting its international presence. In addition to augmenting product offerings, Sysco is expected to reap gains from Kent Frozen Foods’ focus on independent customers.Other Growth Oriented Moves of SyscoSysco outlined some key growth strategies at the New York Investor Day event on December 2017, wherein it also highlighted its three-year financial goals. Sysco’s four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience, optimizing business, stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficiency.

Notably, the company has been gaining from cost-saving and revenue-management efforts for quite some time now, as evident from its impressive past record.These efforts, along with constant focus on buyouts have helped Sysco gain 13.2% this year, as against the industry’s decline of 6%. So let’s delve deeper into Sysco’s plans to achieve its financial targets for fiscal 2020, and see if it can spur further growth of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Sysco’s Core StrategiesSysco stated that its four core strategies include enhancing consumers’ experience; optimising business; stimulating power of its people and achieving operational efficacy. In this regard, the company remains focused on enhancing assortments, making constant innovations, ensuring food safety and revitalising brands.Further, to evolve with the changing consumer preferences, Sysco remains committed toward investing in technology and enhancing e-commerce operations.Moreover, the company plans to improve supply chain, increase transparency through technological advancements, enhance deliveries and attain operational efficiency. Clearly, the company intends to keep customers interests at the centre of business.Well, Sysco’s focus on undertaking innovative technologies to fuel efficiency is clear from its recently announced investment in Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report). Incidentally, the company revealed that it reserved 50 new fully-electric Semi tractors at Tesla to introduce alternative-fuel vehicles to its fleet. This move will not only be environment friendly, but is also likely to curtail Sysco’s fuel and transportation expenses considerably.Financial TargetsMoving back to the company’s four core strategies, management believes that these will help it achieve its financial goals for fiscal 2020. The company expects gross profit to rise in a band of 55-65%, while it anticipates reducing administrative expenses by 20-25%.

197,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 6. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this global food products maker and distributor will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 5.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 73 cents, which reflects a year-over-year rise of about 9%. The earnings estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days. Also, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $14,457 million, up roughly 3.5% from the year-ago quarter.Buyouts & Solid Cost Management Bode Well, Competition a Worry  Sysco has been witnessing year-over-year growth in top and bottom lines for quite a few quarters now. This has also helped its shares to gain 16.6% over a year, as against the industry’s downside of 9.1%. The company has been gaining from buyouts, customer-centric approach and focus on expense management. Notably, Brakes Group’s acquisition had a significant contribution in boosting Sysco’s top and bottom line in fiscal 2017, which remains a growth driver for fiscal 2018 as well. Also, the company’s focus on new product developments, value-added services and improved e-commerce capabilities has enabled growth with local customers.While Sysco generated a major chunk of revenues from its U.S. Foodservice Operations in the last quarter, sales at the segment dropped 3.8% to $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter. However, on a comparable 13-week basis, sales jumped 3.6%, driven by higher volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues from this segment is currently pegged at $9.8 billion, compared with $9.5 billion reported in the year-ago period. On the other hand, sales at Sysco’s International Foodservice Operations almost doubled to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, largely backed by Brakes Group acquisition. For the current quarter, the consensus mark for revenues is $2.8 billion, up from $2.6 billion in the same period last year.Additionally, we commend the company’s cost-management efforts, which has helped it witness gross margin expansion for nine consecutive quarters now. Also, the company is making progress in enhancing SG&A expenses and supply chain, and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income target of nearly $600-$650 million through the end of FY18.However, the company continues to battle industry headwinds like stiff competition, aggressive promotional environment and reduced store traffic, all stemming from consumers’ evolving preferences and the growing online rage. Also, a shift from a deflationary to inflationary environment may pressurize the gross margin. Nonetheless, the company’s focus on customers, benefits from buyouts and its aforementioned cost management initiatives remain noteworthy and are likely to boost sales and earnings this quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Syscois likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

198,SYY,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) has been gaining from strategic initiatives like management of business portfolio, Project Readiness, focus on cost-savings program and a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Recently, it reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 earnings wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year.However, these initiatives were not enough to reverse the company’s dismal sales trend that has been lagging estimates for more than three years now. Moreover, fourth quarter sales also declined year over year due to soft sales across most segments. The drab performance history can be attributed to the fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins. This, in turn, has weighed upon the company’s share price movement. The stock has lost 5.6% in a year, narrower than the industry’s decline of 8.8%. Post fourth-quarter earnings, the stock gained 1.7% fueled by robust earnings. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 for 2018 and $2.88 for 2019 has moved up by 5 cents and 8 cents, respectively, in the last seven days.Going into 2018, Archer Daniels remains encouraged on delivering growth through its strategic initiatives like increasing capabilities, product innovations, maximizing shareholders’ value and solid international foothold. Let’s see whether these initiatives are enough to cushion this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock and reverse the dismal sales trend.Deeper Insight of Strategic InitiativesArcher Daniels has been undertaking several strategic initiatives to manage its business portfolio. These initiatives are expected to help the company realize value and invest the same in the best possible resources to enhance returns. Further, to streamline its portfolio, the company has undertaken few divestitures as evident from the recent agreement to sell its oilseeds operations in Bolivia to Inversiones Piuranas S.A.Additionally, the company is progressing well with cost savings, a key component of its long-term strategy. Archer Daniels targets $550 million in additional run rate cost savings over the next five years, including cost savings of $350 million from operational excellence and process enhancements, and about $200 million in incremental purchasing savings. Impressively, the company has generated run-rate cost savings of $285 million in 2017 and plans to achieve $200 million in run-rate savings by the end of 2018.Moreover, Archer Daniels has long been enhancing operational efficiency at its production and supply chain networks to curtail costs. Also, the company is on track with business transformation, under its 1ADM program. Together, these aforementioned initiatives come under the company’s single strategic plan called Project Readiness. Management expects this project to drive business improvement, standardize functions and enrich consumers’ experience. Notably, it rolled out its 1ADM business transformation project in various regions as well as businesses in 2017 and remains on track with further 1ADM rollouts in 2018.Archer Daniels has also maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy, focused on making investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks. Recently, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 4.7% to 33.5 cents per share compared with prior payout of 32 cents.Looking for Solid Stocks?

200,SYY,"The Consumer Staples sector is home to daily-use products that makes it to an extent immune to economic headwinds. In fact, the sector is considered defensive and is currently benefiting from buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence, despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil.Despite belonging to the sector, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report), the manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products, has been struggling to find place in investors’ good books. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s shares have declined 23.6% so far this year, wider than the industry’s loss of 10.2%.A Deeper Insight Into Campbell’s PerformanceWe note that Campbell’s top and bottom-line results have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last two quarters. Moreover, the company has reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.2% in the trailing four quarters.Furthermore, the company’s top-line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in nine of the trailing 10 quarters, and hasn’t witnessed a single quarter of year-over-year top-line growth for a while now. As Campbell is known for its canned foods, much of its sales debacle could be attributed to consumers’ changing eating patterns and their evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Also, the company’s Campbell Fresh division has just witnessed slight recovery in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, before which it was marred by lingering constraints from the Bolthouse Farms Protein PLUS drinks recall in June 2016.Moving ahead, the company expects the operating environment to remain tough in fiscal 2018, wherein it also expects to witness cost inflation. Well, management stated that it anticipates the first-half results to remain significantly soft, which clearly remains a concern in the near term.Additionally, the company faces intense global competition for nearly all its key products. Consequently, excessive pressure from competitors is likely to cause Campbell to incur greater marketing and other costs or reduce prices, all of these are likely to hurt the company's overall performance.How is the Consumer Staples Sector Positioned?Though Campbell is plagued with problems at the moment, there are many stocks in the Consumer Staples space that seems to be gaining from the improving economic situation. A look at the sector’s performance shows that it has gained 10.1% year to date, narrower than the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 13.8%. Nevertheless, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #3 (out of 16), placing it at the top 19% of the Zacks classified sectors.4 Trending PicksWhile Campbell deals with the aforementioned challenges, here is a look at the four food companies that carry a strong Zacks Rank and look well-positioned to benefit from the current scenario.

201,SYY,"Shares of SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) tumbled 13.7% yesterday, after the company reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 results. While the bottom-line topped estimates and improved year over year, the top line crushed its three-quarter long positive surprise trend. Sales were marred by persistent softness in the retail segment, which has long been grappling with mounting competition and a tough pricing environment in the grocery space.In fact, the dismal retail business performance has been weighing on investors’ sentiment for a while now. This is evident from the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock’s plunge of 45.4% over a year, in comparison with the industry that has remained flat over the same time frame. So, let’s delve deeper into the third-quarter numbers and see where this grocery company is headed. Q3 in DetailThe company reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 61 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 48 cents and jumped considerably by 74.2% year over year. Earnings in this quarter included a roughly 30 cents impact from a discrete tax benefit. Apart from this, earnings were driven by higher sales in the Wholesale business, efficient expense management and lower interest costs.SUPERVALU’s net sales advanced 31.1% year over year to $3,938 million, attributable to higher wholesale unit sales which in turn was mainly driven by contributions from Unified Grocers (acquired in June 2017). However, the retail segment continued to struggle, leading the top line to miss the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 4,002.3 million.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. Quote Adjusted gross profit amounted $411 million that depicted a 1% upside from the prior-year period. However, adjusted gross margin contracted 310 basis points to 10.5%, owing to unfavorable business mix, as Wholesale accounted for a bigger portion of total sales and gross profit and gross margin from Unified Grocers remained soft.    During the quarter, SUPERVALU’s operating earnings came in at $39 million, significantly higher than $1 million in the prior-year period. This stemmed from lower selling and administrative expenses.Segment DetailsWholesale: Net sales at Wholesale business surged 52% year over year to $2,888 million, mainly driven by the sales contributions from Unified Grocers, sales to new customers and greater sales to new stores run by existing customers. These were partially offset by reduced military sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU.The segment’s adjusted operating income totaled $48 million, down from $52 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, the adjusted operating margin contracted 100 bps to 1.7% due to lower margins from Unified Grocers and elevated logistic expenses.Retail: Net sales at Retail dropped 4.1% to $1,017 million, on account of store closures and a 3.5% dip in identical store sales, which has been declining year over year for 11 straight quarters now. This was partly compensated by sales from acquired and new outlets.Further, the segment reported adjusted operating loss of $3 million, in as against adjusted operating earnings of $2 million in the year-ago quarter. The downside was a result of lower sales and reduced gross margin.Corporate: During the quarter, fees earned under services agreements were down 10.8% to $33 million. Further, the segment gerated adjusted operating earnings of $2 million, down 50% year over year.Financial UpdateThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $46 million, long-term debt of $1,700 million and total stockholders’ equity of $400 million as of Dec 2, 2017.Further, the company’s year-to-date net cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations amounted to $44 million, as compared with cash generated from operating activities of $150 million during the comparable year-ago period.OutlookWhile the SUPERVALU’s retail business remains pressurized, management remains impressed with the underlying growth of its Wholesale business and the strategies it is undertaking to fuel the same. Incidentally, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers in the beginning of the fourth quarter, which along with efficient integration of Unified Grocers underscores the company’s focus on strengthening its Wholesale business.Though addition of new businesses in various distribution centers led to greater-than-expected rise in costs, management remains encouraged with its efforts to handle these expenses. Also, it remains dedicated toward making further investments in its Wholesale business to boost future growth. The company has also been working hard toward achieving a turnaround in its retail segment, through e-commerce innovations; new divisions and increased focus on private brands.For fiscal 2018, management envisions net earnings from continuing operations to range from $(20) million to $2 million. This includes a non-cash of roughly $35-$45 million, which is likely to be incurred in the fourth quarter in association with the latest tax reforms.For fiscal 2018, management expects adjusted EBITDA (including Unified Grocers) in a range of $475-$485 million, compared with the previous expectation of $475-$495 million. The narrowed view reflects the impact of greater-than-expected trucking and logistic expenses incurred at the Wholesale segment in the third quarter.Done with SUPERVALU?

202,SYY,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $15.0 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year.

The fund has returned 19.0% in a year and 16.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $7.3 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year.

203,SYY,"Markets closed higher on Friday after the U.S. economy added a substantially high number of jobs, which indicated that the U.S. labor market remains robust. Meanwhile, the Congress approved a two-week government funding Bill which would keep the government running through Dec 22. Moreover, investors also cheered news of progress on Brexit negotiations. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 posted weekly gains, the Nasdaq declined for the second straight week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 0.5%, to close at 24,329.16. The S&P 500 Index (INX) rose 0.6% to close at 2,651.50. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,840.08, gaining 0.4%. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,833 to 1,004.

The CBOE VIX decreased 3.5% to close at 9.80.Job Additions SurgeThe U.S. economy added an impressive 228,000 new jobs, indicating that the labor market is at its strongest since the start of the 21st century. This reading on non-farm jobs surpassed the consensus estimate of an increase of 199,000. This also marks the second straight month that more than 200,000 jobs were created within the United States, which is indicative of a rebound from the lull that the economy hit after being pummeled back to back by two powerful hurricanes in September.Majority of job additions came from manufacturing companies followed by construction firms. While construction companies added 23,000 new jobs, manufacturers added 31,000 jobs.The unemployment rate in the United States remained unchanged at 4.1% in November. This figure was in line with the consensus estimate for the period and continues to linger at a 17-year low. Also, average hourly earnings increased 0.2% or 5 cents to $26.55 per hour.Two-Week Funding Approved, Government Shutdown Fears EbbThe Congress approved a two-week Bill on Thursday which extends the government funding through Dec 22. This prevents a possible Federal government shutdown the likes of which President Trump had threatened in August this year.The Bill would now be presented to President Trump to be signed, effectively allowing Trump and his team of lawmakers to plan a possible extension of the Bill.Investors Cheer as Brexit Negotiations Progress               Investor sentiments were boosted on Friday following encouraging progress on Brexit negotiations. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission announced on Friday that ‘sufficient progress’ was made on Brexit. Moreover, the Brussels team negotiating the deal, has recommended the EU leaders to progress to the second phase of the deal in their meeting the next week.Moreover, experts have stated that after this deal the United Kingdom would stay closely linked with single markets ‘in perpetuity’ and also the customs union. This boosted broad based gains for both European and U.S. stocks.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow amassed 117.68 points to finish in the positive territory. The S&P 500 added 14.5 points, also to end in the green. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, 10 ended in the positive territory, with healthcare leading the advancers. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) gained 1.1% on Friday. Gains for both the Dow and S&P 500 were largely broad-based.Meanwhile, the Nasdaq gathered 27.24 points to finish in the green. Such a rally was buoyed by a surge in shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), shares of which gained 0.2%, 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 gained 0.4% and 0.4%, respectively. The Nasdaq declined 0.1% last week, to post the second straight weekly decline. U.S. Senate Republicans finally approved the tax cut Bill over the last weekend which boosted bank stocks that eventually helped the Dow to touch new highs. Meanwhile, investors speculated over the possible effects of retaining the alternate minimum tax in the final tax Bill.The ISM Service Index for November declined from the 12 year high it had hit a month earlier. The S&P 500 posted four straight sessions of declines — its longest stretch of losses since March. Finally, investors maintained a close watch on any developments related to the Republican Tax Bill.Stocks That Made HeadlinesCan Sysco's Key Strategies for 2020 Spur Further Growth?Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) recently outlined its key growth strategies at New York Investor Day event, wherein it also highlighted its three-year financial goals.

204,SYY,"Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein the bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line missed the same. With this, the company retains its more than three-year long trend of sales misses.Following the quarterly results, the company’s shares dipped 1.2% in the pre-market trading session. Moreover, Archer Daniels has underperformed the Consumer Staples sector in a year due to its negative surprise history. Evidently, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has declined 8.9% against the sector’s growth of 8%.Q4 HighlightsThe company’s fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 82 cents per share increased 9.3% year over year and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents.On a reported basis, Archer Daniels’ earnings were $1.39 per share compared with 73 cents in the prior-year quarter.However, total revenues of $16,070 million declined 2.6% year over year on lower sales across most of its segments. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,350 million as well.Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Archer-Daniels-Midland Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Archer-Daniels-Midland Company QuoteGoing by segments, quarterly revenues at Archer Daniels’ Agricultural Services segment were down 6.8% year over year to $7,517 million, the Corn Processing segment’s revenues dipped 0.3% to $2,509 million and the Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment’s revenues fell 3.3% to $526 million. Conversely, the Oilseeds Processing segment's revenues grew 2.7% to $5,424 million, while revenues at the Other division remained flat at $94 million.Operational DiscussionArcher Daniels reported adjusted segment operating profit of $793 million in fourth-quarter 2017, down 4.1% from the year-ago quarter. On a GAAP basis, the company’s segment operating profit declined 9.1% year over year to $733 million.On a segmental adjusted basis, adjusted operating profit for the Agricultural Services segment climbed 22.9% to $301 million owing to robust merchandising and handling results. The improvement was also fueled by sturdy performance in Global Trade, solid destination marketing gains as well as insurance and other income, which somewhat compensated the lack of competitiveness of U.S. grain exports. While, Milling and Other operations were weak due to reduced volumes and soft margins, Transportation results were impacted by diminished barge loadings as well as freight values.Archer Daniels' Corn Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit improved 2.4% to $261 million. Results benefited from enhanced results at both North America, and EMEA Sweeteners and Starches. However, Bioproducts results were hurt by soft ethanol margins partly offset by favorable risk management.The Oilseeds Processing segment’s adjusted operating profit decreased 15.5% year over year to $202 million. In spite of robust crush volumes and persistent growth in demand, results were hurt by soft crush margins as well as lower South American origination margins. Together, these factors hampered Crushing and Origination results. Additionally, soft biodiesel results hurt Refining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other operations. However, the decline was somewhat mitigated by sturdy refining and packaging results. Further, results in Asia continued to gain from Wilmar’s contributions.The Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients segment’s adjusted operating profit surged 47.4% to $56 million owing to double-digit rise in WILD Flavors’ operating profit driven by soli sales in all regions. Also, the results at the Specialty Ingredients division witnessed a year-over-year growth.FinancialsArcher Daniels ended the quarter with $804 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of Dec 31, 2017, long-term debt including current maturities was $6,636 million. Shareholders’ equity at quarter end was $18,322 million.In 2017, Archer Daniels generated $2,211 million of cash from operating activities. Further, the company’s trailing four-quarter average adjusted ROIC came in at 6.4%.Additionally, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2017, in the form of share repurchases and dividend payments, remaining well on track with its balanced capital allocation plan.Concurrent to this earnings release, management has declared a dividend hike of 4.7% to 33.5 cents per share compared with prior payout of 32 cents. The new dividend is payable on Mar 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as on Feb 20.Looking AheadManagement remains pleased with its results, supported by cost and capital initiatives, earnings per share growth and increased returns. Going into 2018, Archer Daniels remains encouraged to deliver growth through its strategic initiatives like increasing capabilities, product innovations, maximizing shareholders’ value and solid international foothold.Interested in Consumer Staples Space?

205,SYY,"A series of curious events occurred last Friday morning, which continued — Rube Goldberg-like — throughout the day and, it may be argued, even into this morning’s pre-market trading action. Friday’s Dow closed down 673 points, or -2.57%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 hived off roughly 2% each. The Down looks to open down another triple digits, although we’ve seen some early buying back from how low we started this morning.The first thing to have happened was the non-farm payroll report Friday morning, which posted another very strong month for employment gains (+200K). Average Hourly Earnings also gained another third of a percent, meaning wage growth is showing signs of adding to overall inflation in the U.S. And talk of a fourth interest rate hike in the next 12 months from the Fed when incoming Chairman Jay Powell takes over added to the already +50% likelihood of three rate hikes, beginning next month.From there we saw the 10-year bond yield spike up past 2.8%. As Zacks Strategist Tracey Ryniec remarked in real time on Friday, “A strong economy and inflation means no more free money.” Zacks’ Dave Bartosiak reacted, “Perhaps this is the bond market telling the US, ‘We’re a little concerned with that debt situation you’ve got now that you’ve cut those tax rates.’” And Senior Strategist Kevin Cook looked at the VIX and said, “Volume still looks tame, no huge fear. Spot VIX is acting like 1% moves could be normal again. Futures are hardly panicked.”Cook also points out that last week was the worst week… of one of the best two-year rallies we’ve ever seen. Markets are up 65%, so this correction is a mere pittance by comparison. Especially considering — if you can remember back to January 2016, not all that long ago — we saw a sell-off of 6.2%. Right now, even with Monday futures again in sell-off mode, we’re only looking at around -5%. Not really in the same ballpark, at least not yet.Earnings Estimates Going UpIf you’re still concerned about markets swooning to start this new week, a good tonic for you might be Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian’s latest Earnings Preview, where he points out not only is Q4 earnings season the best we’ve seen in years, but future earnings guidance is shooting up for future quarters. So while we do see some near-term pressure on valuations — which outgoing Fed Chair Janet Yellen did mention was somewhat of a concern going forward — the name of the game is still earnings, and those are only pointing north.Q4 Earnings RoundupLast week saw a host of marquee names posting quarterly earnings reports, with mostly good results. In fact, the only bottom-line misses we saw stemmed from tax-related write-downs, which are essentially near-term in nature, and not a result of missed expectations (Apple’s [(AAPL  -  Free Report)] lower-than-anticipated iPhone X sales notwithstanding). This week, we see just as many reports hitting the tape, even if they are not quite the same household names as last week.Foodservice giant Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines this morning, with 78 cents per share on $14.41 billion surpassing the 65 cents per share and $14.19 billion in revenues expected. Earnings results for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company rose 34.5% year over year. For more on SYY’s earnings, click here.British pharma major Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) also topped expectations, beating on the bottom line by a penny to 68 cents per share, and quarterly sales of $5.45 billion outpaced the $5.31 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Guidance was ratcheted up a bit, but still within the Zacks consensus. For more on BMY’s earnings, click here.And Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report), the engineered products segment that formerly belonged to aluminum giant Alcoa (AA), easily outperformed both sales and earnings estimates. The company saw 31 cents per share on $3.27 billion in revenues, ahead of the 24 cents per share and $3.07 billion we had been expecting. Guidance on the top-line rose past the Zacks consensus, while full-year earnings remain in-range. For more on ARNC’s earnings, click here.

206,SYY,"Markets ended in negative territory on Friday following the addition of a staggering number of jobs to the U.S. economy. The report led to a surge in interest rates, resulting in benchmark 10-year yield rising to their highest levels since 2014. All the major benchmarks ended in the negative territory, with Dow posting its sixth biggest daily decline since inception.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 2.5%, to close at 25,520.

Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 7.70 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.90-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow nosedived 666 points on Friday to end below the below the 26,000 mark in the negative territory. Such a decline marks its sixth largest drop in terms of points since inception. Moreover, this was also the first time since June 2016 that the blue-chip index plummeted more than 500 points in a single session. Losses for the Dow were rather broad based, with all of its 30 components ending in the red.The S&P 500 lost 60 points to close in negative territory.

This boosted the yearly average to 2.9% — the highest since June 2009. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained at a 17-year low of 4.1%.Such staggering figures led to a surge in interest rates, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising as much as 2.9% to hit a four-year high. Such an increase in interest rates weighed on investor sentiment and led to broad based losses for the markets.On the economic data front, total vehicles sales for January increased 17.1%; lower than the consensus estimate of 17.2%.

Expectations of an increase in growth and inflation boosted yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, following which sectors like real estate and utilities that are considered as alternatives to bonds declined. An increase in U.S. shale production led energy stocks downward.Moreover, rising bond yields had a broad-based negative impact on all the three key indexes. Markets also lost some of their gains after the Fed’s stated that inflation was likely to reach its desired level in the medium term and projected gradual increase in key rates. Finally, investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014.Stocks That Made HeadlinesChurch & Dwight Beats on Q4 Earnings, Guides for FY18Church & Dwight Company, Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) posted mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein earnings topped estimates while sales lagged.

Gross profit expanded 3.8% to $1,986.2 million, while the gross margin remained nearly flat year over year.

Nonetheless, the operating income jumped 4.8% to $781 million.International Foodservice OperationsSegment sales increased 6.4% to $2,903.3 million. Adjusted operating income tumbled 8.3% to $95 million.

209,SYY,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will be introducing seven products this month, that include cheesecakes, juice concentrates, organic chicken and shrimp amongst others. These products are designed to suit the health and wellness of consumers as well as save labor.The products are set to be launched under the company’s Cutting Edge Solutions platform, designed to aid Sysco in constantly innovating new products, backed by extensive research on consumer tastes and preferences. The products developed under this initiative focus on using natural ingredients and plant-based proteins. The next launch under this platform is targeted to be in early 2018.Sysco has always been focusing on expanding its top line through new product developments and innovation, thereby creating a strong product portfolio across a wide array of business segments. Such initiatives aid the company to remain competitive and evolve itself, amid changing industry environment and consumer preferences. Further, the company’s focus on value-added services and improved e-commerce capabilities has enabled growth with local customers.Other Growth DriversIn addition to new product launches, Sysco has also been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to expand distribution network, customer base and boost long-term growth. Sysco’s acquisition of London-based, Brakes Group, in July 2016 has benefited the company significantly during fiscal 2017 and is expected to generate sales of approximately $55 billion annually. Other noteworthy acquisitions of Sysco include Supplies on the Fly, North Star Seafood, Pacific Star Foodservice, Tannis Trading and Gilchrist & Soames that have aided improving its market share.In an effort to improve margins, Sysco has been undertaking process improvement initiatives, particularly in its warehouse operations and supply chain area. The company achieved $417 million operating income growth since fiscal 2015. It remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600 million to $650 million by the end of fiscal 2018. Improving gross margin is another key driver of Sysco achieving its three-year targets.Notably, the food/grocery business is witnessing stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment. Amid such a scenario, Sysco’s efforts to remain competitive through new product development, acquisitions and to reduce operating expenses in order to drive margins are quite noteworthy and have been yielding results.

210,SYY,"The grocery industry is going through a rough patch currently. The industry has grappling with challenges like stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment. Traditional grocery companies are facing competition from rivals, who are strengthening their franchises and are offering alternative outlets for food and other staples. Customers are also becoming more inclined toward private label products as they are low-cost alternatives to national brands, which are hurting the food companies.The problems worsened when e-Commerce major Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced an all-cash $13.7 billion deal on Jun 16 to acquire the natural and organic foods supermarket chain Whole Foods Market Inc. . On Aug 28, Amazon closed the Whole Foods deal, following Federal Trade Commission’s approval last week.The deal’s impact can be clearly seen in lowered grocery prices of Whole Foods, creating apprehensions at several grocery store chains like Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report), Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. (SFM  -  Free Report) of pricing pressure, squeezed margins and dwindling customers. It is also expected to further increase the competition in the industry.Given this backdrop, let’s try to ascertain which of these two key food players – Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) and McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), is presently in good shape and can make for a better investment option. We note that both Sysco and McCormick carry the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), highlighting the fact that they are likely to perform in line with the broader market over the next one to three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sysco’s market capitalization is $27.4 billion, while that of McCormick is $11.8 billion. Going by its business size, Sysco is undoubtedly a winner. Though Sysco’s massive scale of operations better position it in the long term, short-term industry headwinds are likely to adversely impact both the companies.Business OperationsSysco’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, which have been primarily attributed to its continued focus on acquisitions, volume growth, rewarding shareholders and margin improvement through cost savings. Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in Jul 2016 has benefited the company significantly.Sysco has also been impressively managing expenses since the past few years. The company is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain and as a result, the company achieved $417 million operating income growth since fiscal 2015 and remains on track to achieve the high end of the three-year adjusted operating income growth target of approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.Though stiff competition and aggressive promotional environment remain a concern, Sysco’s efforts to boost sales and margins are paying up, as the company has delivered positive gross margins in the last nine consecutive quarters, after declining consistently for the last few quarters.Like Sysco, McCormick’s earnings have also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, on the back of rising demand for spices, herbs and seasonings over the last few years. Product innovation, brand marketing support and expanded distribution, as well as pricing actions are also fueling sales growth. However, higher material costs remain its headwinds.Prices of raw materials such as vanilla, garlic, cinnamon, oregano and rice, as well as packaging costs have been steadily increasing, and thereby affecting McCormick’s margins. Though McCormick is working on its expense structure and remains hopeful to accelerate its margins in the remainder of fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits for fiscal 2017.VGM ScoreWith the help of our new style score system, it is easy to pick the winning stocks. In order to screen out potential value stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A or B. However, if we consider stocks with a Zacks Rank #3, we should opt for a better grade.Sysco seems to outpace McCormick on VGM Score as well, as Sysco’s score of A is favorable than McCormick’s VGM Score of D. Hence, we should consider it a favorable investing option.Price PerformanceThe food industry has been struggling from quite some time now. However, the concerns aggravated after the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, which is well reflected in the share price performance of the companies as well as the industry. If we look into the last three months performance of these stocks, we note that while the industry declined 8.6% in the said time frame, shares of McCormick slipped 8.5% in the last six months. On the contrary, shares of Sysco declined 4.0% in the same time frame.Estimate RevisionsUpward estimate revisions are indicative of positive investor sentiment about a stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Sysco has inched up 0.7% for fiscal 2018 and 1.4% for fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days, owing to its solid fourth quarter results. However, the same has gone down 0.3% for fiscal 2017 over the last 30 days for McCormick, reflecting negative outlook on the stock. Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up 2% for McCormick.Sysco’s earnings for the current fiscal year 2018 ending June 2018 are expected to grow 11.7%, while McCormick earnings per share are projected to grow at a lower rate of 7.7% in its current fiscal year 2017 ending November 2017.Valuation MultiplesNotably, Sysco has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 18.9, which compares favorably with industry’s average of 20.2 and S&P 500 average of 19.3. McCormick, on the other hand, has a higher forward PE of 23.4. So it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Sysco stock in the near term too, as you can see in the chart below:Valuation MultipleSYYMKCIndustryS&P 500P/E F118.923.420.219.3P/S0.52.71.93.1 If we look into another key metric Price/Sales ratio, we note that right now, Sysco has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the industry average of 1.9 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.1 right now. On the contrary, McCormick has a P/S ratio of 2.7.The above arguments clearly states that Sysco is better pick investors.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

212,SYY,"The Senate has finally passed the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018, ironing out difficulties in the path of President Trump’s historic tax reform plan. Trump believes that such an opportunity to benefit the middle class by slashing corporate tax rates comes once in a lifetime. Markets rallied after this development as investors believe that a tax cut will boost the U.S. economy over the long term.Tax Reforms to Boost GDPThe latest report from Trump’s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) reveals that the new tax plan will drive the economy to new heights. According to the report, a cut in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% will lift the annual GDP growth rate to as high as 5%; the projected range lies between 3% and 5%.As per Business Insider, the U.S. GDP growth rate was 7.4% in 1984, after which it never touched 5%. In fact, since 1980, the rate crossed the 4.5% mark only thrice. It should be noted that with a lower corporate tax rate, companies will accumulate more disposable income to invest in the domestic market and thereby create more jobs. This will pave the way for further economic growth.Tech & Bank Bigwigs Set to GainAccording to Moody's, as much as $1.3 trillion in cash has been stored by U.S. firms overseas in order to avoid paying the stiff corporate tax rate. The five top cash hoarders in the country — Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. , Cisco Systems, Inc  and Oracle Corp. (ORCL  -  Free Report)  — have stockpiled 88% of their cash outside the country, notes CNNMoney. A cut in rates will encourage these companies to repatriate cash, boosting the U.S. economy substantially.Banks also bear a huge tax burden. Among all the sectors representing the S&P 1500 index, financials contribute 25% of tax liabilities, per KBW Research. The investment banking firm believes that the tax rate cut will help Bank of America Corp. (BAC  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report) boost their earnings by 20%.Per Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices, the consumer staples sector paid the second highest taxes in the S&P 500 index last year — at a rate of 29.1%. Thus, lower taxes will massively benefit consumer staples companies like Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Unilever PLC (UN  -  Free Report) and Sysco Corp.  (SYY  -  Free Report). Tyson Foods sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tax Plan Might Increase Debt BurdenThere has been a prolonged debate on whether the baby boomers generation will become a major burden for the Social Security system. Baby boomers are all those who were born between 1946 and 1964, accumulating almost 76 million people at present, according to media resources. Media reports also claim that this generation will make it to the list of full retirement benefits by 2031.Meanwhile, CNBC claims that Trump’s tax reform will lower revenues by $1.5 trillion in the next 10 years for the U.S. government. Investors should know that, according to The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, out of $3.9 trillion spent in fiscal 2016, more than $3.3 trillion was funded by the government. Hence, only a nominal amount was borrowed.However, in the coming years, the government will need to borrow more to support Social Security. In other words, Trump’s tax plan to stimulate the domestic economy will increase the debt burden considerably, raising questions about its sustainability.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

213,SYY,"The food industry’s performance has been dismal for quite some time now due to the prevailing pricing and competitive pressure. Evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms have been plaguing the industry. A shift in consumer preference toward non-genetically modified, organic, and gluten free products is also hurting business. The acquisition of Whole Foods by online giant Amazon.com has further made competitors skeptical and raised concerns.Despite industry-wide issues, Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been on a growth trajectory over the last few months. We believe Sysco’s impressive earnings history and solid growth strategies are making the stock a viable bet. Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what’s taking this food company higher.Why Invest in Sysco?Favorable Rank and VGM Score: Sysco, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) flaunts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. We note that the VGM Score is a comprehensive tool that will allow investors to filter through the standard scoring system and choose better winning stocks. In order to screen out potential winning stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 and a VGM Score of A or B.Share Price Performance: Sysco has exhibited a bullish run in the past six months gaining roughly 4.6% as against the industry’s decline of 7.4%. The industry is currently placed at the top 35% of the 265 Zacks Classified industries. The stock also exceeded the Consumer Staples sector, which gained only 3.8% in the said time frame.  Further, we believe there is still much momentum left in the stock, which is quite evident from its low beta of 0.52 and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%.Rising Estimates: Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the stock over the last 60 days with estimates moving up. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at 73 cents, up from 72 cents per share in the said time frame. Similarly for fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased from $2.75 per share to $2.77, over the same time frame.Impressive Earnings History: Sysco delivered positive earnings surprises in six of the past seven quarters, with in-line results in one. Acquisition and margin improvement has been driving the company’s earnings. We note that Sysco has been consistently witnessing an improvement in sales, driven by acquisitions and volume growth. The buyouts of London-based Brakes Group and Supplies on the Fly e-commerce platform are encouraging. Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in July 2016 has benefited the company significantly. In fiscal 2017, Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in UK and it recorded earnings of 14 cents per share, exceeding its EPS estimates. Brakes is also making good progress in its supply chain transformational efforts, which is helping them to be efficient and will ultimately improve overall service and reduce costs.Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation Quote Improving Margins: Sysco has been impressively managing expenses since the past few years and is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain, which is reflected in higher operating income growth.Further, Sysco delivered positive gross margins in the last nine quarters, after declining consistently since the last two fiscal. Modest inflation will also lead to margin improvement. Sysco was under deflationary pressure for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters, and the trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation from the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Meat prices are abating, and dairy and produce prices have also begun to rise.Valuation Multiples: If we look into the company’s P/E and P/S multiples, we note that the company generally trades below its industry average.Sysco has a forward PE ratio of 19.6. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 is 22.5. Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified industry’s PE ratio, which is pegged at 20.3.
