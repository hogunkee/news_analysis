Hormel Foods (HRL) is one of the top stocks in the meat products…

3,HRL,"If the market launches a new uptrend that works, defensive stocks are likely to give way to stocks that tilt toward growth.With that thought, let's look at the dividend stocks that offer growth potential.We sifted IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, culling for the best earnings growth expected in 2016. (Not all those stocks appear on the table in the paper.) We considered only stocks with upward earnings revisions. The top five:Brinker International (EAT): The Street expects the owner of Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants to boost earnings 16% in the fiscal year ending in June. Pretax margin hit at least a nine-year high in fiscal 2015.On Feb. 2, Brinker declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from 28 cents a share to 32 cents. The annualized yield is 2.6%.Campbell Soup (CPB): Recently the soup maker has been acting more like a growth stock than a dividend stock. Analysts expect earnings to jump 14% the fiscal year ending in July, which would be the best annual growth since 1999.Campbell hasn't raised the dividend since 2013. The quarterly payout is 31.2 cents a share for an annualized yield of 2.1%.Air Products & Chemicals (APD): The Street is pegging earnings growth at 13% for the year ending in September. In 2015, Air Products raised its dividend for the 33rd year in a row. Look for another increase to be declared sometime in March. The  yield is 2.5%.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN): Analysts see earnings growth at 13% this year. That's up from 11% last year but below the three-year growth rate of 15%.  Dunkin' declared a dividend increase early this month. The quarterly payout was raised from 26.5 cents a share to 30 cents. The yield is 2.8%.CME Group (CME): EPS are expected to rise 13% this year. The company recently raised the quarterly dividend from 50 cents a share to 60 cents. The yield is 2.6%.Honorable mention: Hasbro (HAS) 12% EPS growth; Hormel Foods (HRL), 11%; and Clorox (CLX), 10%.

4,HRL,"When the economy is entering a recession, stocks in consumer staples, health care and telecoms ""are the best places to hide,"" said Barclays' Jonathan Glionna, who names tobacco giants Philip Morris International (PM) and Reynolds American (RAI) and drug giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Meanwhile, he includes General Electric (GE) among the stocks to buy for a recovery.He doesn't see a recession in the near term, but there are red flags such as the collapse of oil prices, the 10% retreat in the S&P 500 so far this year and slowing growth in global No. 2 economy China.In a report Monday, Glionna joined a growing number of analysts providing lists of recession-resistant stocks. But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%. Campbell Soup climbed 1.7%, while Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble ended flat.Glionna said of his Recovery Playbook: ""The best performing sectors in previous periods of economic recovery -- using the exit of a recession as indicative of a recovery -- have been energy, materials, industrials and consumer discretionary.""Among stocks on that list: Ford Motor (F), General Electric, General Motors (GM), Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Viacom (VIA).Ford ended down 2%, and GM lost 2.8% Tuesday. GE ticked up 0.4%. Harley-Davidson fell 1.5%, and Viacom plunged more than 21% on worse-than-expected results for the December-ended quarter.Meanwhile, Cowen analysts put out their own list of recession stocks Tuesday, saying, ""We believe stocks that appeal to the low-end consumer and have minimal global exposure appear well-suited to weather an economic downturn.""Among their top picks: off-price clothing retailer Ross Stores (ROST) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Ross Stores climbed 2.25%, and Wal-Mart fell 1.6%.
"
5,HRL,"Tyson Foods' (TSN) quarterly profit far outpaced estimates, with the company also raising its full-year earnings estimate, driving its stock to a new all-time high.The parent of Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, State Fair and Aidells brands said fiscal-first-quarter earnings per share minus one-time items shot up 49% to $1.15, beating analysts' forecasts by 26 cents a share.It's the third quarter in a row that the company has beaten Wall Street projections. The meat producer posted record margins for both its Chicken and Prepared Foods segments in Q1.Tyson raised it full-year profit forecast to $3.85 to $3.95 per share, up from $3.15 in 2015 and well above analyst estimates for $3.63.However, revenue fell 15.4% to $9.15 billion, while consensus was for $10.07 billion.President and CEO Donnie Smith said in a written statement, “Our ongoing efforts to invest in and grow our Core 9 product lines are paying off, as sales volume for the most recent four-week period was up 4%."" The company defines its Core 9 as its strongest brands with the highest growth opportunities.Tyson Foods shares gapped up by as much as 13% Friday morning before closing up 9.9% at 57.10 on the stock market today. The stock rose above a month-long flat base and is now above a 54.52 buy point.The Springdale, Ark.-based company forecast that U.S. chicken, beef, pork and turkey industry production will increase 2% to 3% from 2015, and there will be moderate export growth. Increased supply could pressure meat prices this year, Tyson said.As a result, it forecast its total sales this fiscal year will be about $37 billion, down from its previous estimate of $41 billion, due to the declines in prices. The revised guidance is below the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $39.83 billion.The Food-Meat Products group is ranked a near-best 6 on IBD's list of 197 industries.Among other large companies in the group, Hormel Foods (HRL), which will announce fiscal Q1 results Feb. 16, rose 0.65%. Pilgrims Pride (PPC), which will release Q4 earnings Thursday, dipped 0.2%. Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), which reported lower-than-expected revenue and EPS in December, fell 3.85%.Sanderson Farms (SAFM), which is slated to report earnings Feb. 25, climbed 1.8%.
"
6,HRL,"The meat products industry group has emerged as the No. 1 group out of 197, as of Thursday's IBD. The rise could be partly defensive, with money managers shifting to companies showing steady growth in the belief they will hold up better than high fliers as the market turns lower.But companies in the group have seen have seen solid earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Five of the nine stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 90 or above.Supply and demand have driven the story in several of these stocks. Commodity prices have been falling, making feed cheaper. Cattle herds are growing after several years of declines. One factor is the years of Western drought, which forced cattle ranchers to reduce herds but now may be coming to an end as El Nino brings rains.The No. 2 stock in the group by Composite Rating is Hormel (HRL), the maker of Spam, Jennie-O Turkey, Skippy peanut butter, Black Label Bacon and Muscle Milk. The company noted in recent presentations and in its most recent earnings report that its grocery products and refrigerated foods products business were benefiting from input-cost deflation.Growth in China has also been a factor.Tyson Foods (TSN), the nation's largest meat packer by sales, forecast another year of record profits in its Nov. 23 earnings report.""Our chicken business is strong, pork continues to do well, and we think the worst is behind us in beef,"" Chief Executive Donnie Smith said in a conference call.Chicken producers have weathered an outbreak of avian flu that forced the destruction of large flocks.Hormel reported sales declines of its Jennie-O turkey because of bird flu, but it said the product has become the ""clear category leader"" and is being embraced by health-conscious millennials.While that hurt some producers, it helped Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), the nation's largest egg producer and top-ranked in the meat products industry group, which was unscathed in the disease outbreak.It benefited as the price of eggs soared. Over the last two quarters, year-over-year earnings growth was triple-digit, while sales grew at 71% and 44% clips. After-tax margins were north of 40%. But analysts see the good times coming to an eventual end. They forecast a 31% EPS decline in fiscal 2017.Cal-Maine's stock has given up ground in recent weeks and is now trading below its 200-day moving average.Acquisitions have also been a factor in the industry group. Tyson recently bought Hillshire Brands, which has given it a bigger footprint in the packaged food business.Hormel Foods last year paid $775 million to buy organic processed meats maker Applegate Farms. Hormel says it's the No. 1 organic and natural producer by market share in value-added proteins.

18,HRL,"Tyson says the acquisition fits with its strategic growth plan to shift toward higher-margin foods, a segment that Hormel is also pursuing with acquisitions such as its 2014 purchase of Muscle Milk producer CytoSport International Holdings.

39,HRL,"Sector rotation is pretty much a done deal, if the Big Cap 20 is any guide. Last spring and summer, the medical sector was providing a third to a half of the names in the Big Cap 20.The summer leaders' charts now look sad. Biogen (BIIB) is 40% off its high. Illumina (ILMN) is 33% off its high. (It plunged after hours on preannounced Q3 revenue and full-year guidance that missed views.) Regeneron (REGN) is 23% off its high.In Tuesday's Big Cap 20, only one medical stock made the list.Heart-valve maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) is on the list, despite a couple of breakouts that offered meager gains. A breakout on March 16 yielded a 9% gain in five sessions, then the stock consolidated. A breakout in July yielded an 8% gain in about three weeks before the stock consolidated.Small gains do not give individual investors much of a chance to make money.Edwards is now forming a new consolidation, but is it good news? In Monday's IBD, the medical sector was No. 19 of 33 sectors after being in the top four most of the year through September.If the medical sector is finished as a leader, what has replaced the medical stocks? An investor might just as well ask what hasn't replaced the medical stocks.The Big Cap 20's leadership is now more diverse than it has been all year.Its stocks are from many sectors, including retail, software, tobacco and leisure.Many are in early-stage patterns, thanks to resets or breakouts that didn't advance 20% or more.A reset occurs when a stock's low undercuts the low of its previous base, which resets the count at one. A first- or second-stage base has a better shot at success than a later-stage base.The following Big Cap 20 stocks feature first-stage bases:Software sector play Salesforce.com (CRM) is working on a first-stage consolidation. The stock has regained its 200-day and 50-day lines, and is only 4% off a new high.Breakouts this year led to gains of 9% and 10%. The stock hasn't posted a gain of 20% from a breakout since August-November 2013.Retail sector stock Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is working on a first-stage pattern. The stock is 4% off its high and is battling to retake its 50-day line.Breakouts this year led to gains of 15%, 4% and most recently 4%.Tobacco sector stock Reynolds American (RAI) cleared a 44.24 buy point Monday, but strong volume was missing. A valid breakout usually delivers a volume spike of at least 40% above average. Strong volume is the mark of institutional activity.Food and meat stock Hormel (HRL) rushed past a 64.23 buy point Monday. Volume was 130% above average.

149,HRL,"Justin Gold is not your typical corporate founder type. Long, tight curls spill out from under his baseball cap as he throws his head back and howls delightedly in selfies with nut-butter enthusiasts who approach him in a steady stream. One woman stops to tell Justin that her mother is a big fan.At food trade show Natural Products Expo West, where alternative meats and other health-conscious products reign supreme, everyone wants to say hi to the creator of Justin's Nut Butter. You probably can't say the same about the makers of Skippy.Such is the marketplace for natural foods now. Once the hippy-dippy niche of places like Whole Foods, the arena in 2018 is stacked with players hawking Greek yogurt and kale chips and high-protein everything on shelves at Walmart (WMT) and Kroger (KR).""It's a lot more competitive, but now there's more (shelf) space that's available,"" said Gold of the changes to the industry over the years. Larger retailers like Kroger, Target (TGT) and Walmart are looking to put more organic products on their shelves, he said.The interest means that Big Food heavyweights — such as General Mills (GIS), Nestle and PepsiCo (PEP) — have been snapping up natural and organic food startups, a trend that NPD's food and beverage industry analyst, Darren Seifer, does not see stopping.Acquisitions give legacy packaged-food companies entry to the natural and organics market with a brand that has ""believability,"" said Seifer.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportJustin's Nut Butter, for its part, was acquired by Hormel (HRL) in 2016. That brought the almond- and cashew-butter company under the same umbrella as Spam, Hormel Chili and peanut butter stalwart Skippy.The added resources of a food titan like Hormel gave Justin's the fuel to ensure that all of its products' secondary ingredients could also be organic, something that Justin's could ""probably not"" have accomplished by itself, said Gold.But that doesn't mean every new food company out there is looking to ultimately be acquired.The idea of being acquired ""would worry me, at this stage,"" said Snow Monkey co-founder Rachel Geicke. Snow Monkey, a plant-based, nut-free, vegan ""superfood ice treat,"" lists banana puree as its first ingredient. It is sold in about 300 stores across a dozen states and comes in flavors such as passion fruit, goji berry and cacao.""We've technically only been on the market for about 14 months, so it's still very new, and I think what's really important for a young company is ensuring we're shaping culture and as we grow we never forget why we started,"" she said.Better-for-you ice creams were popular at this year's Expo West. Not surprising, given that indie brand and Expo alum Halo Top managed to outsell freezer staples Ben & Jerry's (owned by Unilever (UN)) and Haagen-Dazs (owned by Nestle) in the supermarket pint category last year.""Companies like Halo Top are sort of what the industry needed,"" Snow Monkey co-founder Mariana Ferreira told Investor's Business Daily at the expo. ""It needed a little bit of a shake, to show the big guys you can't be comfortable. You can't put out the same thing all the time.""Smaller brands are the ones bringing the innovation, she added, something that ""isn't fast enough with these big companies.""Nevertheless, they aren't ruling out the possibility of M&A down the road. An acquisition could provide strategic advantages, and ""there could be some really great big partner for us to do that with,"" said Geicke.Either way, the current eating trends are good for business.""What's really promising for us to see is that health has never been so mainstream, and it continues to be,"" said Geicke. ""When you walk into Costco and you're seeing products that you would usually only find at Whole Foods, that's amazing to see the industry shift.""

164,HRL,"When health care behemoth Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) decided last year to use Veeva Systems' (VEEV) software for gathering data from clinical trials needed to get a new drug approved, Veeva's rivals took notice.For good reason. Thanks to J&J, it wasn't long before Veeva's content management application turned the heads of its potential customers as well.""They (J&J) said we're going to standardize this globally, and within 12 months we had 6 customers (among the 20 biggest drugmakers) do the exact same thing,"" Veeva Chief Financial Officer Timothy Cabral told a Stifel technology conference in June.In this case, though, imitation wasn't just the sincerest form of flattery; it was pretty much according to plan. The cloud-based software company's insiders call it ""the Veeva way.""By that, they mean rapidly developing industry-specific applications with functionality that is miles ahead of the legacy offerings. Then they use positive customer outcomes to take the market by storm.When Chief Executive Peter Gassner left Salesforce.com (CRM) to start Veeva in 2007, he launched the company with one primary goal in mind -- replace biopharma companies' legacy systems with cloud-based software designed to make their painstaking regulatory requirements a lot less painful.Veeva's first product was a customer relationship management offering for pharma sales reps. Then it started targeting the research and development side of the business with its clinical trial content management application. Now, after a rapid six-month development period, it's launching a new application to track quality control processes for drug manufacturing.Veeva's drug and biotech customers ""are in a race against time -- in two directions,"" Gassner told Investor's Business Daily. On one hand, they need to expedite regulatory approval to bring their cures to market and keep people from suffering or dying. Then there are the business-driven reasons for fully capitalizing on a market opportunity before patents expire.That race has become even more critical over time. The cost of developing a new drug has soared to $2.6 billion, up from about $1 billion in 2000 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Because the stakes are so high, more large drug developers have decided in rapid succession to junk their prior technology investments and embrace Veeva as a critical ally in their race against the clock.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is ramping up adoption of Veeva's customer relationship management product among all its 20,000-plus drug sales team members. Most customer relationship deployments aren't yet global in scale, but most big drug and biotech companies are now Veeva customers.The company has about 16% of what is roughly a $2 billion market providing customer relationship solutions to 450,000 global sales reps. Those reps are tasked with teaching 20 million doctors how and when to prescribe their drugs effectively. If all its customers embrace Veeva across their sales geographies, the company's market share could approach 70%.One relatively new customer relationship feature from Veeva is called Approved Email, which allows drug sales reps to send marketing and educational materials to doctors by email. That had been rare because of regulatory concerns until Veeva provided templates that let the communication happen in a compliant way.As dominant as Veeva's customer relationship product looks on track to become, management thinks the company's Vault content management platform has an even bigger advantage over the competition.A pharmaceutical giant might have 10,000 people, both inside and outside the company, collaborating on clinical trials for 20 different drug candidates at a time. Sharing, commenting on, updating and record-keeping of all the actions involved in a trial and drug application used to involve couriers, multiple file-sharing systems and document repositories.Those were hard for some participants to access. Now, Vault makes it possible to have a central hub in the cloud where everyone can connect in a way that streamlines regulatory compliance.Vault launched in 2013, generating $9 million in subscription revenue in 2014. This year, Vault should generate $52 million in subscription revenue, doubling to $104 million in 2017, according to William Blair analysts Bhavan Suri and Alper Tuken.""They're winning because of better usability,"" Suri told IBD. He noted that Vault revenues are growing so fast that the Veeva may continue to see revenue growth accelerate a little.Overall revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $119.8 million in the first quarter, Veeva announced in May. About 80% of revenue now comes from ongoing subscriptions. Adjusted earnings rose 23% to $21.2 million. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to 15 cents a share from 12 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Veeva Systems surged on its May 27 earnings news, breaking above a long basing pattern, though they remain below levels hit just after the 2013 IPO. Shares are still close enough to a buy point to merit consideration. For a closer look at the right timing for buying a stock after a breakout, see this Investor's Corner.""We are more confident than ever that we are on track to achieve our stated revenue run rate target of $1 billion in 2020, selling just our current solutions within life sciences alone,"" Gassner told analysts on Veeva's first-quarter earnings call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Shares broke out well past 30 in late May, built a base and then surged again to eclipse the 35 mark in early July. At the close Monday, shares were up incrementally to 38.27.The key to Veeva's success is that it has brought together enterprise software expertise with industry-specific expertise. That expertise and their applications don't just permit regulatory compliance with the FDA but with regulatory bodies around the world. About 45% of Veeva revenue comes from outside the U.S. Now the company is just beginning to expand its industry expertise beyond life sciences.""We have a tremendous platform involved and we can build applications on it rapidly as we've done with QMS (Veeva's drug manufacturing quality management application), and many of those applications are applicable outside of life sciences,"" Gassner said.Gassner announced on the latest earnings call that Veeva has a small team now dedicated to selling Vault to other industries.""We plan to undertake this new effort in the Veeva way with growth, profit and customer success,"" he said.Because Veeva's strong suit is ease of use in a heavily regulated industry, a lot of investors think it may have a future providing cloud-based applications to the financial services industry, including the brokerage business, Needham & Co. analyst Scott Berg told IBD.But Berg sees more near-term potential in industries ""the FDA actually works with,"" namely food manufacturing, which is vulnerable to costly and reputation-damaging recalls. He mentioned Hormel Foods (HRL) and Cargill as two possibilities.Suri sees Johnson & Johnson, because of its existing relationship with Veeva, as a candidate to adopt its Vault platform for managing quality in other regulated industries. Baby food manufacturers such as Nestle also would be a natural market for Vault to penetrate, Suri said.

165,HRL,"Campbell Soup's (CPB) troubles continued as fiscal-third-quarter sales missed Wall Street's estimate, driving its stock down early Friday.Earnings per share rose 4.8% to 65 cents, a penny better than analysts' consensus and the company's fifth straight quarter of better-than-expected earnings growth. Revenue fell 1.6% to $1.87 billion, vs. analysts' $1.91 billion target, as sales of its Simple Meals business -- mainly condensed and ready-to-serve soups and beverages -- fell 3% to $999 million.But the company expects results to improve as it has expanded its product portfolio last year into fresh and organic foods, including bags of fresh carrots and organic soups.

Campbell fell 9.4% for the week, also hurt by Hormel (HRL).

Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years.

Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car. But it also suggests a shift in Apple's lifecycle from a growth company to a value play.Apple stock rose 5.2% for the week after hitting a 23-month low in the prior week.Playing catch-up, Alphabet's Google introduced a voice-activated Wi-Fi speaker system with built-in search.

Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts.

But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain.

Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain.

Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus.

But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

169,HRL,"JBS, the biggest meat producer, made an unsolicited $5.6 billion bid for Hillshire Brands — $6.4 billion including assumed debt — seeking to expand its sausage lineup and derail the company's acquisition of Pinnacle Foods.
"
170,HRL,"JBS' Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) offered 45 a share. The deal is contingent on Hillshire (HSH) scrapping its $4.8 billion agreement to acquire Pinnacle (PF). Pilgrim's said it met with Hillshire in February and that it ""has long been our desire to acquire the company.""Brazil's JBS, which spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past decade to overtake Tyson Foods (TSN), is resuming its takeover campaign less than a year after its last major deal. CEO Wesley Batista told Bloomberg News last week that JBS will keep expanding via more purchases as opportunities arise.In the U.S., JBS bought Smithfield Foods' beef-packing business in 2008 and took control of chicken processor Pilgrim's in 2009.Pulling For PorkJBS' ""Holy Grail"" is ""to have exposure to all three segments of meat: poultry, beef and pork,"" said Bloomberg Industries analyst Ken Shea. ""Today's unsolicited bid, if effected, would give JBS the third leg of a stool — a big piece of the pork market.""Hillshire said in a statement that it will review the Pilgrim's offer and that it believes in the merits of the Pinnacle deal.Pilgrim's hadn't made an offer until now because it was focused on improving its operations and paying down debt, a person familiar with its thinking said.Pilgrim's and JBS believed promised cost savings for the Hillshire-Pinnacle deal were aggressive — especially considering Pinnacle's private-equity owners had already made cuts, according to the person.Shares of Hillshire, which makes Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs, rose 22% to 45.19. Pilgrim's climbed 2% to 25.52. Pinnacle fell 5% to 31.48.Ricky Sandler, CEO of Eminence Capital, said Hillshire should engage with Pilgrim's and that today's proposal is superior to the Pinnacle transaction. Hillshire should see if there are other bidders and that interest may come from Tyson, Hormel Foods (HRL) and China's WH Group, he said. Sandler last week criticized the Pinnacle deal as expensive and said that his firm, a Hillshire holder, would vote against it.Pinnacle owns brands from Vlasic pickles to Wish-Bone salad dressings to Birds Eye frozen vegetables. Blackstone (BX) bought it for $2.2 billion about seven years ago and took it public again in March 2013.Pilgrim's would get a ""pretty good deal"" with Hillshire, said Craig Sterling, analyst at EVA Dimensions in New York. Hillshire has a 6.3% profit margin vs. 4.2% for Pilgrim's, he said.

171,HRL,"Tyson Foods (TSN) is slated to disclose fiscal second-quarter earnings early Monday, and investors will be looking to see if the company can post a fourth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.The meat, poultry, pork and prepared-foods company is projected to record a 5% increase in revenue to $8.84 billion.Consensus of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for earnings per share to leap 75% to 63 cents.Tyson's strong results over the past year have come despite challenges, including fresh outbreaks of bird and hog viruses in China and elsewhere.Not everyone is convinced Tyson can stay on the fast-growth track. BMO Capital Markets on Tuesday downgraded its rating from outperform (buy) to market perform (neutral). The bank cited what it considers Tyson's high valuation. Tyson stock has risen about 56% from a low of 27.33 on Nov. 4.On the company's first-quarter earnings call in late January, CEO Donnie Smith cautioned that Tyson faces headwinds this year.Smith told analysts that although consumers are becoming less defensive in spending, ""I don't know of anyone who thinks that consumers will go back to their pre-2008 spending habits any time soon.""Investors will look for clues on current pricing trends in the company's earnings report.""Record high beef prices should continue through 2014,"" offsetting lower consumption, Smith said earlier this year. ""Pork prices will also remain high due to lower supply. Chicken should continue to be the winner.""Allianz Global Investors analyst Bryan Agbabian said in a report Wednesday that Tyson is a solid play on the increase in demand for chickens in the U.S. and globally, especially in China, the world's largest consumer market.""Tyson is developing an in-country, in-China integrated production of chicken so that Tyson can then sell to not only the local market there, but also to the U.S.-based restaurants that are doing business there such as (Yum Brands (YUM)-owned) Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's (MCD),"" Agbabian said in the report.Tyson shares were up nearly 1% in Friday afternoon trading in the stock market. Its stock price hit an all-time high 44.01 on March 31 and has consolidated since in sync with a market correction.Among other large meat producers, highly rated Hormel Foods (HRL) was unchanged. Hormel sports a 92 IBD Composite Rating, which means it has outperformed 92% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Fresh and frozen chicken products-maker Sanderson Farms (SAFM) climbed more than 2%.

West Texas Intermediate oil dipped slightly, holding above the $35.50 mark.The iShares Gold Trust (IAU) gapped up 1% in below-average trade after finding support at its 50-day line for the previous two sessions.

187,HRL,"Cal-Maine (CALM) topped third-quarter profit expectations by 34 cents Monday morning, sending shares up sharply.Earnings popped 27% to $1.33 per share on 3% revenue growth to $449.8 million, well above analyst forecasts for 99 cents a share and $463.6 million in revenue. Sales were primarily driven by higher average selling prices.The country's largest shell egg producer, Cal-Maine makes specialty brands Egg-Land's Best, Land O' Lakes, Farmhouse and 4-Grain.The industry's supply was hit by avian influenza last year, though it is ""steadily"" recovering, said the company.""Industrywide, retail demand trends for shell eggs have been favorable in spite of the supply disruptions; however, egg prices have been negatively affected by increased egg supplies due to demand erosion for egg products, increased egg imports and reduced egg exports,"" said CEO Dolph Baker in a statement.""Egg inventories have continued to build, and we expect market prices will remain volatile until the industry has more clarity on future supply levels.""As consumers demand more natural food options such as cage-free eggs, Cal-Maine's specialty egg volume grew 13.7% from the prior-year Q3.Shares closed up 8.8%, climbing back above their 200-day average. Shares of grocery shelf peers Tyson Foods (TSN) and Hormel (HRL) rose 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively.RELATED:Protein For The Facebook Generation: They Want It Convenient And Clean.Image provided by Shutterstock.

188,HRL,"Bulked up with acquisitions along with favorable financial results, Hormel Foods is whetting the appetite of investors seeking juicy returns.The stars are aligned in favor of Hormel (HRL) on a few fronts. Low hog prices in its core pork business have helped lift profit margins. Demand for protein products is strong.Plus, Hormel has made a number of acquisitions that have broadened its reach, such as the 2015 purchase of Applegate Farms, the No. 1 brand in the natural and organic value-added prepared meats category. The buy has helped the company tap into growing demand for natural and organic foods from millennials to aging baby boomers, and expanded its retail channel scope.Add to that double-digit profit gains in all but one of the past 10 quarters and you have a tasty recipe for success for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Spam lunch meats and Jennie-O Turkey. Hormel has seen its stock price soar more than 45% since its Sept. 22 low of 29.93. After a recent breakout, it now hovers in the low 40s.""The stock is performing well,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Joseph Agnese told Investor’s Business Daily, noting he has a hold rating on the stock. ""The commodity environment overall is very favorable with feed costs very low for the turkeys they raise and prices for hogs are down significantly. And they’re very well positioned in the food market (where there’s) strong demand for protein.""BB&T Capital Markets analyst Heather Jones added: ""A key driver of earnings upside and, thereby, the shares has been very significant margin expansion primarily driven by favorable input cost trends in their core pork business, their biggest segment, which sells fresh pork; bacon; pepperoni, etc. into retail and food service; and in their grocery products business with products like Spam.""Although Hormel’s turkey business was negatively impacted by the avian flu last year, it did a ""phenomenal"" job shifting products and selling them at a high margin as a result, Jones added.Recent acquisitions have helped buoy results. They include the $700 million purchase of the Skippy peanut butter business from Unilever (UL) in 2013 and the $450 million purchase of CytoSport Holdings, the maker of Muscle Milk products in 2014.Its latest buy, the $775 million purchase of Applegate Farms, was Hormel’s biggest to date.""The acquisition was perfectly aligned with our interest in adding brands that resonate with consumers that are younger and more socially engaged,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger on the first-quarter conference call with analysts. ""This acquisition has also expanded our distribution into the natural and specialty foods channel that’s provided a faster path to creating a significant presence in this high growth, high margin segment.""Jones says the acquisition will help the bottom line.""But what’s important is the acknowledgment that a certain segment of the population is now focused upon where their food is coming from and how those animals were raised,"" she told IBD. ""The wellness trend, in a holistic sense, is not going away. To change a culture and build a brand and credibility in that space would have taken a lot of time and money. It was more expedient to buy a company in that space than to do it on a greenfield basis.""Agnese says, however, the Applegate buy wasn’t a game changer as much as a milestone marking where Hormel is headed.""The game changer is the company has shifted to making acquisitions of value-added products to diversify away from the historical pork and turkey commodity business and more toward a diversified packaged foods company with more stability,"" he added. ""With wider margins and more stability comes a bigger valuation multiple.""Applegate’s products are sold mostly through natural and organic foods specialty stores such as Whole Foods Market (WFM) while Hormel products are sold through traditional outlets.""Hormel can leverage the newly acquired relationship (with Applegate) to try to sell products in the natural and organic foods specialty channel,"" said Agnese. Having the Applegate brand under its umbrella will help Hormel sell products like Muscle Milk and the Hormel brands in the specialty channel, he adds.Hormel has been serving up some tasty financial results, though not all has gone smoothly. For its fiscal 2016 first quarter ended Jan. 24, earnings climbed 23% from a year earlier to 43 cents a share. Profits were up in all segments except its Jennie-O Turkey Store, which saw operating profit slip 2% from a year earlier as it continued to recover from the impact of the highly pathogenic bird flu that hit Hormel farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota midway through 2015, the company said.Total company revenue for the quarter fell 4% to $2.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 18% to $1.56 a share. They see a 5% gain in 2017 and a 9% rise in 2018.Agnese expects full-year 2016 revenue to rise 4.7% from 2015, on benefits from recent acquisitions, including Applegate Farms, he noted in a report. He estimates Applegate sales will total over $350 million in 2016.In a recent report to clients, Jones projected “relatively modest” earnings growth in 2017.""Barring a sizeable acquisition, we have difficulty discerning what factors could drive more substantial earnings growth,"" she noted.But Jones told IBD she expects Hormel to do more acquisitions.""I think they're very disciplined allocators of capital,"" she said. ""I don’t think they'll do an acquisition just to grow. It has to fit into their strength and it has to be the right price. They have challenges in growing volumes in their core business and have an excellent balance sheet. I think they'll do more acquisitions over the next few years.""

192,HRL,"Hormel (HRL) served tasty fiscal first quarter profit growth in all segments except its Jennie-O Turkey Store products, driving its stock to a new all-time high and lifting the food products group.Hormel's Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Specialty Foods and International & Other categories all posted higher profits for the quarter. But Jennie-O Turkey Store products profit was down 2% on a 15% plunge in sales after the latest outbreak of avian flu culled turkey flocks.Overall, U.S. turkey production is expected to be up 5% to 6% this year if there are no further outbreaks of avian flu, Hormel said. The highly pathogenic bird flu hit Hormel farms in Wisconsin and Minnesota in mid-2015, impacting volumes in the back half of the year.The processed meats and shelf-stable food products maker reported $235.1 million net earnings in fiscal Q1, or 43 cents per share minus one time items, a 22.9% jump compared to the same quarter a year earlier, beating by 6 cents. EPS for the maker of Skippy peanut butter, Spam lunch meats and other products has topped profit estimates five quarters in a row. Profit growth has accelerated for the last two quarters.But revenue fell 4.3% to $2.29 billion in fiscal Q1 on the avian flu impact, unfavorable currency rates and weak global sales of pork products, below the $2.4 billion analysts expected. Sales have fallen for the last three quartesr.Hormel raised its full-year EPS guidance to $1.50 to $1.56 from $1.43 to $1.48. The revised outlook is well above analyst consensus for $1.47.Hormel shares surged 7.1% to 44.44. Its stock is up about 48.5% from a Sept. 22 low of 29.93, and it has a near-best 97 IBD Composite Rating, which means that it's outperformed 97% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.""They have been having strong earnings upside,"" BB&T Capital Markets analyst Heather Jones told IBD. ""Investors have flocked to their shares. They have a really good management team (and) balance sheet, and very little international exposure."" Jones has a neutral rating on Hormel, citing premium valuation for its shares.S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Joe Agnese kept a hold rating on Hormel but raised his 12-month price target to 47 from 37, saying in a report that he expects improvement in the second half of fiscal 2016.Hormel has made a series of large acquisitions recently, including the $775 million purchase of natural and organic  meats producer Applegate Farms in July 2015.Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Ettinger told analysts on the earnings call those acquisitions are paying off. ""We  did make a couple of changes in our mentality toward acquisitions,"" he said. ""Our company is getting bigger, and in order to move the needle, we realized we needed to look at bigger opportunities.""Further spotlighting strength in the food category, Campbell Soup (CPB) late Tuesday said fiscal Q2 EPS likely was 87 cents, crushing views for 71 cents.

195,HRL,"Today's Weekly Review is well mixed with representation from many sectors, but it's the food stocks where a lot of charts are looking interesting.Four food-related industry groups were in the top 21 groups in Thursday's table of 197 industries that IBD tracks. The food sector was No. 3 out of 33 sectors.To be sure, there are some favorable trends to explain that.Nomura noted those, which are occurring globally, in a report Monday. One of those is ""better-for-you"" foods, a trend that is accelerating in food and beverages.""Although the exact root cause of this is difficult to ascertain, the shift is a fundamental one,"" wrote analyst David Hayes.Growth in snacks is another key theme, as busier lifestyles drive demand for on-the-go options. Also, there's an emerging ""desire for smaller formats among most cash-constrained consumers.""Hayes says cost cutting remains an important focus for companies seeking to drive margin expansion.There's another trend favoring food companies, one that investors may have noticed at the grocery store: Food commodity prices keep falling. That helps food producers with lower input costs.Nut-products maker John B. Sanfilippo & Son (JBSS) is in buy range after clearing the 66.10 buy point of a cup with handle.The stock has had periods of fast appreciation. Last year, for instance, shares soared nearly 75% from an August 2014 breakout to a peak at the start of 2015. A company needs superior profit growth to achieve that type of ascent, and John B. Sanfilippo has done that: EPS increased 27% to 76% the past four quarters.Omega Protein (OME) is forming the right phase of a new base with a potential buy point at 25.32. The pattern is the third in a yearlong advance, so there's a bit more risk with a breakout than with earlier ones. Acquisitions have been a crucial factor in the company's growth.Hormel Foods (HRL) broke out of a flat base Feb. 1 -- one of the earliest movers in the food sector. It is now extended from the 40.49 buy point.Performance Food Group (PFGC) is a new issue in the food industry.

196,HRL,"In his classic ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" IBD founder William J. O'Neil writes that as much as ""37% of a stock's price movement is directly tied to the performance of the industry group the stock is in.""IBD's Your Weekly Review, a unique screen of highly rated stocks published each Friday, is built with the fruits of that research in mind.Your Weekly Review lists up to 120 minicharts of stocks, and all of those stocks are graded in descending order by the relative strength of the industry group to which they belong.Thus, studying Your Weekly Review (starting on page A5 of Friday's print edition) enables any serious investor to isolate quickly those stocks that appear in the very top performing groups, out of the total 197 such groups that IBD identifies and ranks based on six-month price action every trading day. Use the accompanying column written by IBD's market writers and editors as a map to navigate through the list and find promising candidates to buy in a healthy market uptrend.No matter how weak or strong a stock’s industry group fares, the screen includes only stocks having EPS and Relative Strength ratings of at least 85 out of a possible 99. That's why the screen is sometimes referred to as the 85-85 Index.In a roaring bull market, you will see 120 stocks appearing week after week in Your Weekly Review, with perhaps dozens more waiting in the wings that didn't qualify only because of space limitations. Alternatively in a bear market, the list will shrink considerably.In fact, to determine the overall health of the market, make a habit of counting how many stocks appear in Your Weekly Review. During rough markets, you might notice a sharp drop in little time. For instance, in the Dec. 4, 2015, edition, the section contained four full pages' worth of minicharts and 177 stocks in the tables. By the end of January this year, the list shriveled to 56 names. Since then, the list has recovered mildly.To make the screen, all stocks must sell for at least $10 a share, trade within 15% of their 52-week highs, and show a minimum average volume of 10,000 shares a day. Investors should be wary of such thin traders. Focus on more liquid stocks with an average daily volume of about half a million. As an adjunct to the charts, the table in Your Weekly Review features the name of one A-rated mutual fund with a large position in these stocks. This supplies evidence of the I in IBD’s CAN SLIM investment acronym, which stands for institutional sponsorship.Your Weekly Review's accompanying table gives readers a sense of the market's defensive mood. Performance Food Group (PFGC), Hormel Foods (HRL) and Chesapeake Utilities (CPK) are the third highest-ranked in the Feb. 19 edition of Your Weekly Review. In other words, the market is prizing businesses in food distribution, pork supply and natural gas utility above more high-growth sectors.Dividend-rich real estate investment trusts such as CoreSite Realty (COR), Agree Realty (ADC) and Kimco Realty (KIM), all of which sport a Composite Rating of 98 or 99.

238,HRL,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), on May 28. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but flaunts an attractive VGM Score of A. Strong demand for on-trend branded products is supporting the company’s growth, however, prevalent turkey market challenges remains a headwind.Let’s dig deeper into the basic fundamental factors affecting the stock.Factors Favoring the StockImproving demand for popular brands like Hormel Black Label bacon, SPAM, Muscle Milk and Wholly Guacamole dips is currently driving Hormel Foods revenues. Moreover, the company expects that the Make the Switch campaign this summer will bolster sales of its value-added businesses in the second half of fiscal 2018.The company also intends to strengthen its business on the back of strategic acquisitions. Successful integration of the Fontanini and Columbus buyouts are expected to strengthen Hormel Foods’ business portfolio, going forward.Hormel Foods has been boosting its liquidity on the back of reduced corporate tax rates. In first-half fiscal 2018, the company generated operating cash flows of $443 million, up 58% from the year-ago period, on grounds of lower taxes. Notably, Hormel Foods narrowed its fiscal 2018 tax rate to 17.5-19.5%, from the prior fiscal’s 33.2%, and anticipates to generate cash flow benefit of $100-$140 million in the current fiscal. The company intends to finance its new marketing and capital investment projects with these proceeds.Over the last three months, Hormel Foods shares have rallied 10.8%, as against the 2.1% loss recorded by the industry.Existing SetbacksTurkey market challenges have been hurting revenues and profitability of Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store segment for the past few quarters. The company noted that a supply glut has been affecting the prices of turkey and cold storage meat. Notably, soaring freight expenses and elevated advertising costs also weighed over the segment’s bottom line in second-quarter fiscal 2018. The company stated that surge in fuel prices and scarcity of trucks will continue to escalate freight costs until fiscal 2019.Hormel Foods’ margins are also vulnerable to input price fluctuations. For instance, inflation in the prices of pork bellies and beef trim marred the company’s profitability in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. In addition, volatilities in the prices of beef, hog and hog sport trim pulled down its margins in first-quarter fiscal 2018. In the fiscal second quarter, Hormel Foods experienced inflation in beef prices and anticipates the same to persist through the remaining of the current fiscal. Moreover, uncertain impact of tariffs on the pork industry remains a major cause of concern.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are listed below:B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 0.68% in the past four quarters.

239,HRL,"After months of rhetorical tariff threats between Washington and Beijing, the world’s two largest economies have declared a trade war. This is especially true as Trump’s 25% tariff on $34 billion in Chinese goods, including auto, electric cars, aerospace, communications tech, new materials and robotics became reality at 12:01 A.M. on Jul 6 and another $16 billion is expected to go into effect in two weeks.China also hit back with the same scale and strength, slapping charges on American goods targeting heartland staples like soybeans, corn, pork and poultry. The United States has violated World Trade Organization rules and ignited the largest trade war in economic history,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. With retaliation from Beijing, Trump has issued warnings of additional tariffs on $500 billion in Chinese goods.The latest move marked the escalation of the trade war from threat to reality and would result in a global recession. It would hurt global supply chains, increase costs for businesses and consumers and slow down investments. Canada, Mexico and Europe are also engaged in tit-for-tat tariff exchange with the United States. As a result, the ongoing development suggests that the worst, which could send shockwaves across stock markets, is yet to come.Against such a backdrop, there are a few places where investors can stash their cash in the stock world and a few that should be avoided.Best ZonesGoldIn difficult market environments, gold is considered a great store of value and hedge against market turmoil. Acting as a leveraged play on the underlying metal prices, metal miners tend to experience more gains than their bullion cousins in a rising metal market. Hence, mining stocks could outperform in the current trade turmoil. As such, Yamana Gold Inc. (AUY) seems a lucrative pick as it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. The stock has risen 8.1% over the past month.Consumer StaplesThe consumer staples sector is defensive as it includes a variety of items like food & beverages, non-durable household goods, hypermarkets and consumer supercenters that are every-day essentials. These products see steady demand even during an economic downturn due to their low level of correlation with economic cycles. As such, these generally act as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty. Among these, B&G Foods Inc. (BGS) has gained 12% over the past one month. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Momentum Score of B.Small CapsSmall-cap stocks have been the winners amid trade and tariff threats, and are likely to continue their outperformance. This is because small-cap stocks have less international exposure and generate most of their revenues from the domestic market. These pint-sized stocks are less vulnerable to a trade war or any other political issue and could better insulate investors from Trump’s protectionist stance. Rent-A-Center Inc. (RCII) having a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A is among the biggest gainers in a month’s time, rising 42.5%.  High DividendThe dividend-paying securities are the major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from the equity market are at risk. These stocks offer the safety in the form of payouts and stability in the form of mature companies that are less volatile to the large swings in stock prices. The companies that offer dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty and provide downside protection by offering outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis. While there are several top-ranked options available in the space, Arbor Realty Trust (ABR  -  Free Report) looks impressive given its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and one-month return of 13.5%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Worst ZonesFarm BeltU.S. farmers and food producers are in the crosshairs of a global trade conflict. Tariffs were already imposed by Canada on beef and by Mexico on pork and ham imports. Another round of tariff from China on soybeans and pork also come into effect in response to Trump’s latest tariff implementation. Soybean exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) and meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) would be hit. ADM has a Zacks Rank #2 and added 3.6% in a month while the other two has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). TSN is down 2.3% and HRL is up 1.7%.AutoThe potential tariffs on cars and auto components are the greatest threats to the auto industry. Global Automakers President and CEO John Bozzella warned “tariff hikes would raise prices, make it more expensive to produce cars and trucks in the United States. He said the tariffs could cause a slowdown in sales and production, which would not be good for either American consumers or autoworkers.” BorgWarner Inc. (BWA  -  Free Report) shed 13.9% in a month and has a Zacks Rank #3.SemiconductorsTrump’s import tariff on Chinese products will compel American semiconductor companies to pay duties on their own products. This is because chips are manufactured in the United States but are shipped to the Asian nation for assembly, testing and packaging due to its favorable labor costs, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Some of the worst-hit chip stocks include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report). INTC, MU and TXN were down 12.9%, 12.9% and 5.9%, respectively. However, these stocks have a favorable Zacks rank.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The company declared that it has merged its Specialty Foods segment with the Grocery Products segment for driving revenue growth and securing increased cost savings, going forward. However, the company perceives that its Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment will continue to face persistent challenges in the quarters ahead.Based on the current fundamentals, Hormel Foods anticipates generating revenues in the range of $9.4-$9.8 billion for fiscal 2018. Earnings are anticipated to lie in the band of $1.60-$1.70 per share for the same period.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

"
241,HRL,"On Nov 29, Zacks Investment Research upgraded Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We perceive that the upside is primarily stemmed by the company’s robust fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a bullish Zacks Rank of 2 have higher chances of performing better than the broader market over the next two to three months.Last month, shares of the company have returned 13%, outperforming the industry’s 11.2% gain.Existing ScenarioHormel Foods reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended October). Quarterly earnings and revenues both surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates.Sturdier demand for on-trend branded products such as SKIPPY and SPAM would likely boost Hormel Foods’ revenues going forward. Also, a diversified product portfolio and initiatives to expand production capacity will likely prove advantageous in the quarters ahead. Per the company, consolidation of its Specialty Foods segment into the Grocery Products segment will assist in delivering revenue synergies in the long term.The company also intends to boost its competency on the back of latest business acquisitions. Earlier in August, the company acquired the Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc. and the Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol. While the Fontanini buyout has strengthened the company'sBurke Pizza toppings and food service businesses, Ceratti acquisition has solidified the company's South American business footprint. Notably, the newest Columbus Manufacturing, Inc. acquisition (announced in October) will likely fortify the company's deli businesses going forward and is expected to drive its earnings from fiscal 2018 onward.Hormel Foods is even committed toward its shareholders and hopes to augment their returns through lucrative dividends. On Nov 21, 2017, the company announced a 10% hike in annual dividend rate, marking the 52nd successive yearly upsurge in its payouts.Moreover, the company tries to improve its brand status by conducting several social welfare maximizing activities. In sync with this strategy, the company finances various donation programs that address social issues including hunger relief and education. Efficient brand promotion drives the buyers' loyalty toward the company's brands and products.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks within the same space are listed below:The Boston Beer Company, Inc.

242,HRL,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) on Nov 22.Existing Scenario  Hormel Foods reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (write when it ended) results. The company intends to boost its near-term profitability on the back of stronger demand, new investments and latest business acquisitions. Increased sales of popular brands such as Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel Natural Choice, Justin's, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, Spam and SKIPPY are expected to reinforce the company’s top-line performance in the near term.Meanwhile, the $130-million capital investment planned to expand the vacant facilities in Kansas (anticipated to be accomplished by December 2018) is likely to help in boosting Hormel Foods’ near-term revenues by capturing the growing market demand for bacon.Even so, Hormel Foods believes that the strategic acquisition of the Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc (Aug 17, 2017) and the Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol (Aug 24, 2017) might boost its revenues and earnings in the quarters ahead.Also, it stated that Columbus Craft Meats buyout (announced in October 2017) will continue to boost its earnings from fiscal 2018 onwards. Notably, for fiscal 2019, whole-year accretion is projected to lie between 6 cents and 8 cents per share.Additionally, the company believes that consolidation of its Specialty Foods segment into the Grocery Products segment (from fiscal 2018 onward) will assist in delivering increased revenues and cost synergies in the long haul.However, we notice that Zacks Consensus Estimate for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has moved south for fiscal 2018 (ending October 2018), over the last 60 days. Over the last three months, Hormel Foods shares have gained 1.8%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 12.7%. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store segment’s revenues and profit dipped nearly 10.4% and 24%, respectively. The decline was owing to the fall in turkey prices that weighed over the segments’ performance. In fact, the turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness price hike in the upcoming quarters.Meanwhile, lower sales of MUSCLE MILK products led to a 9.2% decline in revenues in the Specialty Foods segment. Even so, spin-off of the Farmer John business was primarily responsible for 5.7% year-over-year downfall in the Refrigerated Foods segment. Hormel Foods perceives that lower turkey prices will continue to hurt its Jennie-O Turkey Store business in the quarters ahead.Furthermore, Hormel Foods’ margins are frequently subjected to input price fluctuations. Supply-demand inconsistencies also make the market prices of these inputs highly volatile. For instance, the company’s margins were severely hurt due to significant inflation in the prices of two major inputs — pork bellies and beef trim — in the reported quarter. Going forward, the company expects that elevated costs of these two inputs would continue hurting its profitability.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are The Boston Beer Company (SAM  -  Free Report), Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report). While Boston Beer and Pilgrim's Pride sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Craft Brew Alliance carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  Boston Beer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 63.35% in the last four quarters.

244,HRL,"Tuesday, November 21, 2017So the rhetoric appears to have actions backing it up, after all: upon the event of a massive $85.4 billion merger between AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner , the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said “no way.” This came a bit out of left field, as the deal was assumed to be vertical — not to encroach on monopolistic terrain, as the companies do not directly compete with one another — and thus considered viable by the business community, and especially shareholders of AT&T and/or Time Warner stock.Considering that media companies are now competing on a massive scale with entertainment content providers like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), this merger appears to make sense in that it ups the ante for both media and telecommunications players going forward. In fact, some analysts saw this merger leading to M&A deals elsewhere across these industries, changing the entertainment access landscape radically, and for the foreseeable future.Yet that’s not what we’re seeing now that the DoJ has gotten involved. Initially, those close to these companies assumed this was perhaps a rift between President Trump and Time Warner entity CNN, which the President has very vocally critical of both during the election campaign and during the first year of Trump’s term in office. But what the DoJ argues today is that consumer costs are likely to spike as AT&T would be able to charge “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks.” Basically, the DoJ is officially taking issue with antitrust laws, and that this merger may be in violation of them.AT&T, for its part, maintains its vertical merger stance, pointing to the routine passage of such agreements in other industries without unraveling any antitrust issues. During the previous administration, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) was allowed to purchase NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) in 2011. We have yet to hear from President Trump on this matter today, but should tweets abound regarding CNN’s supposed “fake news” in response to AT&T’s pushback on this lawsuit — AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the suit “defies logic and is unprecedented” — we’ll know where the President stands personally on this matter.Q3 Earnings RoundupCampbell’s Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) missed earnings estimates by 5 cents per share to 92 cents ahead of today’s opening bell, while revenues of $2.16 billion also came up short of the $2.18 billion expected. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company also ratcheted down earnings guidance going forward, and we are seeing Campbell’s shares selling off more than 7% in early trading. Shares are down more than 16% year to date. For more info on CPB’s earnings, click here.Fellow processed food manufacturer Hormel (HRL  -  Free Report) beat bottom-line estimates by a penny to 41 cents per share. Quarterly sales were also better than expected, forking in $2.49 billion as opposed to the Zacks consensus $2.39 billion. The company also issued fiscal 2018 guidance from $9.40-9.80 per share (today’s reported quarter was for Q118). For more info on HRL’s earnings, click here.Home improvement retailer Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) also beat consensus estimates for its Q3 earnings report, putting up $1.05 per share on revenues of $16.77 billion that outpaced the $1.02 per share and $16.57 billion expected. This amounts to the first positive surprise in the past 3 quarters for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, with comps up 5.7% in the quarter. Shares are trading up in the pre-market roughly 2% at this hour. For more info on LOW’s earnings, click here.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

247,HRL,"Increasing revenues have been a big challenge for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) for the last few quarters amid lower demand for carbonated soft drinks or CSD.The beverage giant is leaving no stone unturned to boost revenues. The company is working on strategic initiatives in order to make its portfolio a total beverage company. This is mostly via improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins. However, the top line needs to show sustained improvement.Meanwhile, the company’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The stock has returned 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.3%.Innovations, Productivity Improvements and Cost-Saving Efforts Bode WellCoca-Cola’s total sales decreased 14% in the first nine months of 2017. In fact, the company’s total sales decreased 15% year over year in the third quarter, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.Sales of the company’s carbonated beverages are suffering due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Accordingly, Coca-Cola is trying to reinvigorate the category by providing increased marketing support through innovations and strong integrated campaigns. Coca-Cola is also pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.The recent approach in this field by Coca-Cola has been the launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, replacing Coke Zero, in the United States in Aug 2017. Coke Zero Sugar globally grew high single digit in the third quarter.Again, Coca-Cola made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States in the third quarter of 2017.Apart from these sales building strategies, Coca-Cola has been doing well to boost its profit level on the back of improved productivity and better market execution. Despite generating lower profits, the company’s earnings of 50 cents per share in the third quarter improved 2% year over year, helped by ongoing productivity efforts. Lower SG&A expense (down 20%), higher gross margin (up 170 basis points or bps), and higher operating margin (up 404 bps) helped it come up with better numbers.Moreover, the company is on track to achieve total annualized productivity saving target of approximately $3.8 billion by 2019 from the initiatives takes under this program since its beginning.Additionally, Coca-Cola had a nice dividend yield of 3.23% (as of Nov 29) that grew regularly. The company has increased its dividend for 55 consecutive years, including the 8%, 6% and 6% dividend hikes in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Share buybacks continue to be significant, as it helps companies increase earnings per share with a reduced share base.Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector are Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Tyson Foods, Inc.

248,HRL,"Three prominent U.S. restaurant chains made big announcements over the last two days, helping the food industry jump to the front of many investors’ minds.Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report) announced its search for a new CEO on Wednesday, and news broke on Tuesday that Arby's Restaurant Group is set to acquire Buffalo Wild Wings .Shares of Chipotle climbed after Steve Ells, the chairman, CEO, and founder of the company, announced that he intends to step down from his role as chief executive. Chipotle is now on the lookout for a new CEO to lead the struggling fast-casual burrito chain after a rough two-year stretch (also read: Why Did Chipotle Mexican Grill Stock Jump Today?).Similarly, the Arby’s and Buffalo Wild Wings deal comes at a time when the chicken wing giant has slumped due to a multitude of factors (also read: Why Buffalo Wild Wings Stock Soared Today).These two significant moves coincide with shifting U.S. eating habits that have left the restaurant industry somewhat in flux, leaving chains to fight among themselves to try to keep pace and standout. However, while individual chains and restaurants struggle, food wholesalers are still in demand.With that said, let’s take a look at three food industry stocks that present diversified exposure to the restaurant world at a time when picking individual restaurant stocks can prove challenging.Performance Food Group Company (PFGC  -  Free Report)This food wholesale powerhouse, which delivers food to restaurants, vendors, and more, is the parent company of Vistar, PFG Customized, and Performance Foodservice. Performance Food Group is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and boasts an overall “A” VGM score.PFG also scored a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company’s full-year sales are expected to surge over 7% to hit $17.95 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. On top of that, PFG’s EPS is expected to jump 20.69% this quarter and 16.94% for the full year.Along with its top and bottom line growth projections, PFG’s current cash flow growth of 9.01% blows away the “Food – Natural Foods Products” industry’s 1.17% average and helps demonstrate the company’s growing cash position.What’s more, the food distributor is currently trading at 20.21x earnings, which marks a discount compared its industry’s average and looks decent compared to the S&P 500’s average. PFG’s “B” Value grade is further supported by its 0.18 price to sales ratio, which also beats its industry’s average.Shares of PFG gained over 1.30% on Wednesday to hit a new 52-week high. This is part of a year-long run that has seen its stock price climb nearly 32%.Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report)Shares of this chicken giant, which sells to grocery stores and delis, as well as local and national restaurant chains, popped on Wednesday to hit a new 52-week intraday trading high. Shares of Pilgrim's Pride have soared over 88.36% since the start of the year.Earlier this month, Pilgrim's Pride posted third-quarter revenues of $2.79 billion, which marked a 12% year-over-year jump. On top of that, the company’s EPS skyrocketed 138%.For its upcoming fourth-quarter, Pilgrim's Pride sales are expected to jump nearly 33% to hit $2.57 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the full-year, the company’s revenues are projected to hit $9.48 billion, which would mark a 19.55% gain from last year.Also in Q4, Pilgrim's Pride earnings are expected to skyrocket 94.44%, while full-year EPS growth is projected to hit 62.71%.What’s more, Pilgrim's Pride boasts an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. This is supported by the company’s current 0.99 P/S ratio, which marks a discount compared to some of its competitors such as Hormel (HRL  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms (SAFM  -  Free Report). Pilgrim's Pride is also currently trading at 12.56x earnings, which fairs well against the S&P 500 and marks a discount compared to its industry’s average.Pilgrim's Pride is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an overall VGM Grade of an “A.”Farmer Bros. Co. (FARM  -  Free Report)This wholesale coffee company, which sells coffee to hotels, restaurants, and fast food chains, is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Based on our consensus estimates, Farmer Bros’ earnings are projected to climb 50% next quarter, while its revenues are projected to gain 19.45% to hit $166.1 million. For the full-year, the company’s earnings are expected to hit $0.72 per share, which would mark a 2.89% gain. On top of that, Farmer Bros’ full-year sales are projected to surge 16.11% to reach as high as $628.7 million.Furthermore, Farmer Bros scored a “B” for Value in our Style Scores system. The company’s 1.05 P/S ratio is strong, while Farmer Bros current price to book ratio of 2.63 is very respectable.Shares of Farmer Bros have gained 2.42% over the last 12-weeks and surged over 1.60% on Wednesday. Lastly, the coffee wholesaler has topped our Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings in each of the last two quarters by a wide margin.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

249,HRL,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), which has been trying all means to increase focus on protein-rich products, revealed that it is looking for potential buyers for its pizza crust business, TNT Crust. The idea behind this planned divestiture is to focus more on the company’s key growth area — protein-packed offerings.Well, Tyson Foods has long been riding on this strategy, given the escalating consumer demand for protein products. Prior to this, the company had undertaken divestiture of several other non-protein business such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s so as to focus more on the growing protein-packed food arena.Thus, the sale of its pizza crust business would be another step in this path. We note that this business forms part of Tyson Foods’ Prepared Foods segment, which recorded a 21% surge in revenues to $2,292 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. However, much of this is attributable to contributions from AdvancePierre, which was acquired last year with an intent to bolster the company’s protein-packed offerings. This, in itself speaks volumes about the surging preference toward this food category.Divesting Pizza Crust: Another Solid Growth Strategy Coming back to yesterday’s development, management stated that the divestiture of TNT Crust will involve the sale of Tyson Foods’ pizza crust venture of flat breads, self-rising crusts and partially baked crusts. Also, it will include the sale of two manufacturing facilities in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Thus, the deal is likely to be promising to any potential buyer, as it will include the transfer of the entire pizza crust business, both facilities as well as the team members. However, Tyson Foods will continue to hold the tortilla production from these manufacturing facilities, with plans of using them in other parts of its business.Further, the company remains focused on aligning its growth efforts toward the profitable protein-rich arena. Markedly, rising demand for protein products have been one of the primary growth drivers for Tyson Foods for a while. This is evident from the fact that sales volumes across the company’s Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Encouraged by the increasing consumer preference for meat and chicken products, Tyson Foods has long been undertaking measures to expand protein-packed brands and sustain the growth momentum in these segments. The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples in this connection.In fact, Tyson Foods’ investment in Beyond Meat indicates the company’s efforts to venture into the meat substitutes market. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat without any added hormones or antibiotics.The company also invested $84 million (in August 2017) and $300 million (in November 2017) to expand poultry production capacity in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated focus on augmenting protein-packed food products.Clearly, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been firing on all cylinders to exploit the rising protein demand, which has helped it rally 21.6% in a year, easily crushing the industry’s 13% growth. We believe that such dedicated efforts in this connection, as underscored by the aforementioned announcement, is likely to drive the stock further.Looking for More?

250,HRL,"The consumer staples sector is often regarded as an abode of defensive stocks. It is one of the most trusted even when economic conditions are not congenial. Thus, adding stocks from this basket usually lends more stability to investors’ portfolio.We believe impressive labor market scenario and rising consumer confidence will benefit consumer staples stocks in the near future. Notably, Trump’s latest tax policy is anticipated to provide a big push to consumer goods companies and boost their investments.Among the numerous potential gainers, adding Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to your portfolio will be a promising investment move at the moment. Over the last six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 6.5%.Hormel Foods Corporation Price  Hormel Foods Corporation Price | Hormel Foods Corporation QuoteThis stock not only carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) but also flaunts an attractive VGM Score B.Why to Grab the Stock?Rich Product Portfolio: Elevated demand for on-trend brands such as Hormel Black Label bacon, SPAM, Muscle Milk and Wholly Guacamole dips and SKIPPY will likely bolster Hormel Foods’ near-term revenues. The company’s organic sales inched up nearly 1% in first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended January 2018) on the back of strong sales of these popular brands.Sound Marketing Moves: Hormel Foods expects that its near-term market share and aggregate sales will improve largely due to the company’s marketing initiatives. For instance, on Feb 26, the company launched the BE SMOOTH LIKE SKIPPY campaign in a bid to portray the deliciousness and smoothness of its peanut butter brand — SKIPPY. Through various videos, the campaign will showcase the recently-rolled out products under the brand, such as SKIPPY P.B. Bites.  Acquisitions: Hormel Foods intends to fortify its business on the back of well-planned business acquisitions. In the fiscal first quarter of 2018, Hormel Foods’ revenues and profitability were largely boosted by its previously-made buyouts like CytoSport Holdings, Inc. (August 2014), Justin’s, LLC (June 2016), Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc. (August 2017) and Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol. (August 2017) and Columbus Manufacturing, Inc. (November 2017). Notably, the company expects that the Columbus buyout will drive its earnings in the upcoming quarters of 2018.  Innovation: Ongoing efforts to enhance its product portfolio with innovative products will benefit Hormel Foods in the near future. The company recently introduced a deli division in its Refrigerated Foods segment. Hormel Foods stated that the division will primarily focus on inventing new on-trend deli branded products. The company estimates that this division currently possesses a capacity to generate nearly $1-billion yearly sales and will act as the next growth driver.Profit Making Prospects: In the fiscal first quarter of 2018, Hormel Foods secured one-time tax benefits of 12 cents per share. The company believes implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (in December 2017) will largely reinforce its commercial competency.

251,HRL,"This week was an eventful one with some of the major developments having a positive or negative impact on the global stock market. Below we discuss some of the biggest events that dominated the headlines and influenced the market:Trump-Kim DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years. This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Peace talks have pushed the defense stocks down after the summit. Major defense players -- Raytheon RTN, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) -- saw rough trading on the day following the announcement of denuclearization. Of these, NOC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while BA and RTN have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AT&T-Time Warner ApprovalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA. The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while FOX downgraded to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Hawkish FedAs expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision has led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels last seen in August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly, leading to a decline in net margins. Still, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A seems an excellent pick as its earnings are expected to grow 33.13% year over year this year.Dovish ECBThe European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European stocks, which are poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, some of the top-ranked European ADRs are poised to outperform in the coming months. Statoil ASA EQNR with a market cap of $89.2 billion and SAP SE SAP with a market cap of $148 billion have a Zacks Rank #1 and 2, respectively.World Cup Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the high expectation of driving growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Some of the top-ranked (#1 or 2) stocks in these spaces include Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG  -  Free Report), and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report)  that could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event.Trump TariffTrump has approved of a plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move if enacted could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. TSN and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL could take a hit. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

252,HRL,"On May 15, we issued an updated research report on the premium consumer goods company Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report).Over the past month, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 13.6%, wider than the 2.7% loss recorded by the industry. Let's dig a little deeper into the stock for gaging the prevailing problems affecting its performance.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.Ailing FactorsIncreased demand for plant-based protein products has cast a pall over the global meat-product market. Per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, supply for poultry (including broiler, turkey and others) in 2018 is estimated at 49,666 million pounds, roughly 0.1% below the previous projection, while demand will likely be 40,789 million pounds, down 0.1% from the prior forecasts.Escalating regulatory controls and numerous promotional moves, introduced by the medical community in favor of vegetarian sources of protein, might hurt revenues and profitability of meat-product companies like Pilgrim’s Pride, Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL  -  Free Report), Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report) and Flowers Foods, Inc. (FLO  -  Free Report).Moreover, it should be noted that Pilgrim’s Pride’s profitability is highly sensitive to market price, as well as the availability of certain products such as soybean meal, corn and sorghum.Any supply-demand imbalance or fluctuations in the prices of these intermediate products might significantly escalate the company’s operational expenses in the quarters ahead.Also, other headwinds like stiff industry rivalry, outbreak of a livestock disease or impact of unfavorable climatic conditions remain causes of concern for the company.Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s earnings moved down 1.3% to $3 for 2018 and 2.9% to $3.01 for 2019.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

253,HRL,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report) or FEMSA is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this major beverage company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 293.7%. However, it has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding three quarters. Nonetheless, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 61.9% for the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price and EPS Surprise  Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price and EPS Surprise | Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. QuoteWhat to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.08, reflecting year-over-year improvement of over 20%. We note that earnings estimate for the quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6.55 billion, representing growth of 18.2% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayFEMSA remains plagued with soft margins for over a year due to strained margins at Coca-Cola FEMSA and lower-margin businesses growth at FEMSA Comercio. Consequently, impacting the company’s gross and operating margins in the preceding quarter as well. Additionally, margins were hurt by increased freight and labor expenses, consolidation of Coca-Cola FEMSA’s results in the Philippines and margin contraction at FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division.The company predicts operating margin to remain strained due to lower margins at FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division. It anticipates operating margin for the segment to decline slightly compared with the previous forecast of flat margins.Additionally, the company remains cautious about the rest of 2017 as well as 2018 due to bearish consumer sentiment and increased fuel prices, thanks to the high inflation rates. FEMSA also lowered sales outlook for fourth-quarter 2017 and 2018, after three years of robust growth. Apart from the high inflation, other factors that hurt the outlook are Mexico's 2018 presidential election and continuing talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), a keystone of Mexico's economy.Consequently, shares of FEMSA have declined 6.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s loss of 3.2%.While these factors pose a threat to the company’s upcoming performance, FEMSA is well poised for long-term growth through its strategic actions including expansion of store base, diversification of business portfolio and focus on core business activities.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that FEMSA is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.FEMSA has an Earnings ESP of +18.52%, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is we caution against sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) which should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.94% and a Zacks Rank #3.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pinnacle Foods, Inc.

254,HRL,"Premium meat products company Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended October, 2017) results on Nov 21, before the market opens.Over the last four quarters, the company recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 4.28%. Dismal performance of the Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment has been hurting the company’s revenues and profitability for the past several quarters.However, our proven model shows that Hormel Foods’ earnings will likely beat estimates in the quarter under review. Notably, on a month-to-date basis, Hormel Foods’ shares have yielded a return of 5.7%, outperforming 5.2% growth recorded by the industry. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Hormel Foods has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Hormel Foods has an Earnings ESP of +2.52%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 41 cents comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hormel Foods’ favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with a positive ESP, predicts a likely earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Hormel Foods anticipates that elevated demand for its popular branded products, including Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel Natural Choice, Justin's, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, Spam and Skippy, will bolster the company’s aggregate revenues, going forward.The company also believes the strategic acquisition of the Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc (August 2017) and the Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol (August 2017) will likely drive its top- and bottom-line results in the quarter to be reported.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the Hormel’s Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods segments are currently pegged at $478 million, $1,102 million, $472 million and $199 million respectively for the fiscal fourth quarter, higher than the corresponding tallies of $422 million, $1,087 million, $369 million and $197 million generated in the preceding quarter.Nevertheless, Hormel Foods fears that continued inflation in the prices of major inputs such as pork and beef trim or challenges in the Jennie-O Turkey Store business might dent its bottom-line performance. Notably, the company has lowered its fiscal 2017 earnings guidance to $1.54-$1.58 per share from the prior projection of $1.65-$1.71 per share.However, we believe that the above-mentioned headwinds will likely be offset by robust top-line performance expected in the quarter to be reported.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.23%.MGP Ingredients, Inc. (MGPI  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +16.00%.United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) also carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.33%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

255,HRL,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) or P&G’s board of directors declared a 4% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to 71.72 cents per share, in a bid to impress investors. The dividend will be paid on or after May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Apr 20, 2018. The new figure will add up to an annual dividend of $2.8688 per share.This consumer goods giant has consistently increased its dividend and has been paying dividends for 128 years, ever since its incorporation in 1890. In fact, the latest increase marks P&G’s 62nd consecutive year of dividend hike that reflects the company’s commitment to add value to shareholders, reflecting its confidence in business growth.P&G is considered to be one of the dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 Index, given its consistent increase in dividends each year in its span of operations of more than 100 years in business. This, along with a dividend yield of more than 3% (3.53% as of Apr 10, 2018) helped P&G to attain the position.P&G generates strong cash flow annually. The company generated operating cash flow of $7.3 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with $6 billion a year ago. The company spent $1.9 billion as capital spending in fiscal 2018 so far. Thus, the company was left with a significant free cash flow of $5.4 billion versus $4.7 billion in the year-ago period. This allows management the opportunity to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and brand development, in addition to regularly paying dividends and repurchasing shares. In the first six months of fiscal 2018, the company returned $7.9 billion of cash to shareholders via $3.6 billion of dividend payments and $4.3 billion of common stock repurchase.P&G is known for strong brand recognition, diversified portfolio, impressive product development capabilities and marketing prowess, as well as strong cash flow productivity. The company remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging and marketing initiatives, and productivity cost-savings plan.Additionally, growth from emerging markets like China and India is expected to make 2018 another strong year for P&G. For fiscal 2018, P&G expects earnings per share growth of 5-8%, a modest improvement from the prior expectation of 5-7% growth.Investors should keep in mind that P&G's shares have lost around 13.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with 3.5% decline of its industry. The 13.2% decline also compares unfavorably with the broader Consumer Staples sector’s decrease of 1.9%. Earnings estimates have remained stable for fiscal 2018 over the last 30 days.The recent dividend hike is expected to bolster investors’ confidence in the company’s financials, improve its market position against competitors and lend upside to the stock.  Zacks Rank and Key PicksP&G carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Tyson Foods, Inc.

Predominant as an abode of defensive stocks, this space primarily includes companies that offer products and essentials used in daily lives.However, China’s aggressive stance of slapping 25% tariffs over American imports on Apr 1 has affected the U.S. agricultural, meat products, as well as farm equipment companies, congregated under the consumer staples sector.Nevertheless, the operative date for the imposition of these tariffs has not been disclosed yet.Per our latest Earnings Preview (Apr 6, 2018), the first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues of consumer staples stocks in the S&P 500 group will likely climb 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively, year over year.Among the numerous potential gainers within the sector, adding Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to your portfolio will bear fruit.Over the last month, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has gained 4.9%, as against the 2.2% loss incurred by the industry. Reasons for the Bullish RunRevenue Growth: Consumers’ loyalty toward popular brands, such as Skippy, Spam, Hormel Black Label bacon, Muscle Milk and Wholly Guacamole dips, is anticipated to bolster Hormel’s revenues in the quarters ahead.

However, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, its adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHormel anticipates that elevated demand for its finest brands, such as Spam, Dinty Moore, Skippy, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, Natural Choice, black label bacon, Hormel Pepperoni and Justin's, will have bolstered revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company’s focus on making diligent marketing and advertising moves from the beginning of this calendar year is expected to have helped improve top-line results in the fiscal second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fiscal second-quarter net sales of the company’s Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods segments are currently pegged at $646 million and $1,189 million, higher than the respective tallies of $432 million and $1,027 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fiscal second-quarter operating profit of the company’s Grocery Products and Refrigerated Foods segments are currently pegged at $108 million and $139 million, higher than the respective tallies of $77 million and $130 million reported in the yea-ago  quarter.Hormel Foods also believes reduced corporate tax rates will have aided in boosting free cash flow in the quarter under review.However, prevalent turkey market challenges are feared to have affected Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store segment’s revenues and profitability in the quarter to be reported. The turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness price hike in the near term.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fiscal second-quarter net sales and operating profit of the company’s Jennie-O Turkey Store segment are currently pegged at $380 million and $52 million, lower than the respective tallies of $388 million and $64 million recorded in the year-earlier quarter.Moreover, high volatility in prices of major inputs like pork bellies and beef trim might have depressed Hormel Foods’ profitability in the fiscal second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hormel Foods will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Hormel Foods currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are pegged at 45 cents per share.Zacks Rank: Hormel Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +7.14%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.73%.Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.43%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

260,HRL,"The Consumer Staples SectorThe sector is currently at the bottom of the Zacks sector list. Year to date, it has declined 12.4%, against 2% gain recorded by the S&P 500.As of May 9, roughly 86.7% of the Consumer Staples companies in the S&P 500 group reported their results. Earnings collectively have grown 8.9% with a beat ratio of 73.1% while revenues have increased 3.9% year over year with a beat ratio of 69.2%.In addition to the food industry, companies from the funeral services, textile, agriculture, beverage, soap and cleaning materials and others are included in the Consumer Staples sector. For the January-March quarter, earnings of this sector are predicted to increase 8.7% on revenue growth of 4.2%. For full-year 2018, earnings are anticipated to grow 8.2% and revenues to decrease 5.1%.We here focus on the food industry, which is currently enjoying several tailwinds despite risks. The food industry has immense growth potential on the back of rising population, growing disposable income and higher standard of living. Also, rise in international trades is a boon for this industry. Growing desire for high quality and healthy products among consumers is driving the food companies to work on new and innovative products as well as maintain greater transparency in terms of ingredients used and nutritional benefits of their products.On the flip side, growing preferences for low-calorie and vegetarian foods can be concerning for companies dealing in meat and chicken products. These companies are also at risk of an outbreak of livestock diseases, which might create sudden supply chain challenges. In particular, the turkey market is grappling with an oversupply situation and depressed turkey prices. Also, conflict in international trade policies among nations can hurt demand for food products.Per the latest World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report issued by U.S. Department of Agriculture, total supply of red meat (including beef, pork and others) in 2018 is predicted to be 59,920 million pounds, down 0.7% from its forecast issued in April. However, the demand for red meat is expected to stay low at 49,659 million pounds, down 0.9% from the earlier projection. Also, supply for poultry (including broiler, turkey and others) in 2018 is projected to be 49,666 million pounds, roughly 0.1% below the previous projection while demand will likely be 40,789 million pounds, down 0.1% from the previous estimates. However, demand and supply for both red meat and poultry products are projected to strengthen in 2019.Zacks Model to Judge the StocksInvestment decisions, especially during an earnings season, can be addressed by using some of Zacks models. A popular way is to opt for stocks that possess a combination of favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings.By Zacks rule, this combination suggests that a stock has a high probability of beating estimates in the to-be reported quarter. An investor can try and optimize portfolio returns through this method.We have zeroed in on three stocks that can be a great investment option for investors interested in the U.S. food industry. A brief discussion on these favorable stocks is provided below:Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report): The company is one of leading manufacturer and marketer of meat and food products in the United States and internationally.

Calendar-year to date, the company’s stock has lost 0.4% versus 12.2% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum.The company is scheduled to release its results on May 24, before the market opens.Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report): The company is primarily engaged in manufacturing and selling chicken-based products. Available in fresh, frozen and marginally cooked forms, these products adheres to high standards for consumer safety.With roughly $2.6 billion market capitalization, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Its Earnings ESP for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended April 2018) is +18.48%.

261,HRL,"On Nov 15, we issued an updated research report on the premium consumer goods company Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report).Over the last month, we notice that shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock have yielded a return of 16.7%, outperforming 6.8% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, the stock currently carries an attractive VGM Score of A.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bullish Factors at PlayThe United States Department of Agriculture predicts that the chicken industry in the county will record remarkable growth in 2018. Moreover, demand for organic and antibiotic-free chicken products is anticipated to shoot up, going forward. We believe these positives will boost the revenues and profitability of all chicken product-offering companies in the United States, such as Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report).However, Pilgrim's Pride is poised to boost its competency on the back of a unique portfolio strategy. Through this strategy, the company intends to capture the market upside, minimize business risk and widen margin. In sync with this, Pilgrim's Pride maintains a well-balanced portfolio of multiple bird sizes and expands business in diversified geographical end markets.Pilgrim's Pride believes favorable prices (backed by stronger overseas exports) and elevated demand will bolster its U.S. revenues in the quarters ahead. Also, rising per capita income levels and improving dietary habits of individuals will likely strengthen the company’s Mexican business in the near term.Furthermore, the latest Moy Park buyout (September 2017) will fortify the company’s European business going forward.Also, Pilgrim's Pride stated that the successful integration of GNP Company (January 2017) will continue to drive sales and generate additional synergies, going forward. Notably, Pilgrim's Pride currently estimates to realize annualized synergies of $40 million as a result of this buyout, which is higher than the prior projection of $30 million.The company is also optimistic about its latest product launches and even believes that investments incurred to improve its production capability will prove beneficial over the long run.    Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock moved up for both 2017 and 2018, reflecting positive market sentiments.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

262,HRL,"With a major chunk of the earnings releases behind us, the quarter seems to have fared quite well so far. While the number of overall positive surprises has been greater than previous periods, the revenue picture has been particularly impressive – in regard to both year-over-year growth as well as beat percentage.Though several sectors are nearing the last leg of their reporting cycle, we are yet to see results from quite a few food stocks that form part of the Consumer Staples sector that is currently placed among the bottom 38% out of all Zacks sectors. Per the latest Earnings Trends, the sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 3.3% on a 1.5% rise in revenues.How is the Food Space Placed?The food Industry has been grappling with several issues of late, including stiff competition, sluggish traffic and an intense promotional environment stemming from consumers’ changing preferences. Moreover, the food space is battling soft volumes and inflated input prices. Back-to-back hurricanes also had a detrimental impact on food stocks with operations spread in the affected regions.While these factors make us jittery about the performance of food stocks in the quarter to be reported, we expect the companies to keep gaining from their focus on acquisitions, packaging methods and innovations, which have long been their growth drivers. Evidently, benefits from buyouts fueled top and bottom lines of Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) and SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) in their recently reported results. Also, food companies have been undertaking efforts to expand in the fast-growing organic goods space to resonate with the changing consumer demand. These factors, along with stringent cost-saving initiatives should cushion the food stocks from industry headwinds.Another factor that works in favor of food stocks is that they are relatively less vulnerable to adverse economic conditions, though they’re sure to step up during economic recovery when higher disposable income increases the demand for food. That said, we also remain encouraged about food stocks’ performance, given the favorable economic indicators like improving employment scenario and higher consumer confidence. Incidentally, Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years in this October.How to Pick Prospective WinnersAmid these mixed signals, we used the Zacks methodology and identified food stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this earnings season. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That said, investors can count on these stocks which are most likely to top estimates.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), which is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 13, is a solid bet. The company’s Earnings ESP of +1.28% and Zacks Rank #2 make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise. We expect the company to continue gaining from rise in demand at the beef and chicken segments. Rising preference for protein rich brands in the prepared foods category is also expected to favor Tyson Foods’ performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.37.Another stock worth considering is The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report), which has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #3. This consumer food and beverage products, and pet food and snacks manufacturer is scheduled to post second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 16. J.M. Smucker’s consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $1.89. Notably, the company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.6%.We also suggest investing in Nomad Foods Limited (NOMD  -  Free Report), which is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 28. This manufacturer and distributor of frozen foods has an Earnings ESP of +8.70%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at 23 cents. Further, the company, which has delivered back-to-back positive earnings surprises in the past two quarters, sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Another viable option is Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), a leading manufacturer and marketer of various meat and food products in the United States and international markets. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.52%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 39 cents. The company, which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.3%, is slated to announce fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21.Investors can also place bets on United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report), which is expected to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results next month.  This leading distributor of natural, organic and specialty food and non-food products has an impressive earnings surprise history, and a long-term earnings growth rate of 5%. Notably, United Natural Foods’ Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +6.33% indicate that the company is likely to maintain its solid surprise trend. We expect the company’s diversified portfolio and synergies from acquisitions to aid the beat. The current consensus estimate for the quarter is pegged at 59 cents.Well, these five stocks are not the only ones to bet on. With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener and some permutation and combination, you can also discover other consumer staples stocks that have the potential to deliver a positive earnings surprise.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

263,HRL,"Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) will soon acquire California-based Columbus Manufacturing Inc. (Columbus) in a bid to fortify its retail deli business going forward. This $850-million deal marks Hormel Foods’ third buyout this year and is so far, the company’s largest acquisition.Columbus is an eminent millennial-focused brand and produces various forms of deli, salami and Italian specialty meat products. Moreover, of late, the company has been offering on-the-go and snacking product categories such as salami-and-cheese trays and prepackaged charcuterie platters. The company’s products are primarily targeted for the youth. Columbus currently generates revenues of roughly $300 million on an annualized basis and anticipates a 5% growth going forward.Post the completion of Columbus acquisition, Hormel Foods will win control over two state-of-the-art processing plants of Columbus in California. The newly acquired business will be integrated with the Refrigerated Foods segment of Hormel Foods.Inside StoryHormel Foods is strengthening its business on the back a balanced business model that seeks to form a diversified product portfolio and expand production capacity over time.In addition to this, the company has gained a robust reputation for integrating its acquired assets and has also secured increased value out of its previous acquired brands. Prior to the Columbus buyout deal, Hormel Foods completed two big acquisitions in 2017. On Aug 17, it acquired the Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc., for $425 million. Further, on Aug 24, the company announced that it would soon buy Ceratti brand from Brazilian meat producer — Cidade do Sol. It expects to close the Columbus acquisition deal the end of this year.However, we notice that over the last month, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company lost 5.6%, wider than the 2.2% loss incurred by the industry.The company perceives that issues such as lower turkey prices, extensive competition and escalating operating expenses would continue to hurt its Jennie-O Turkey Store segment’s performance in the quarters ahead. Also, other headwinds such as input price inflation or stiff industry rivalry remain causes of concern.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Energizer Holdings, Inc. (ENR  -  Free Report) has an average positive earnings surprise of 23.02% for the last four quarters and currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

264,HRL,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) on Oct 16.In the past three months, Hormel Foods’ shares have lost nearly 4%, as against 9.3% growth recorded by the industry.  Notably, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s earnings per share are expected to dip nearly 5.1% year over year for fiscal 2017, as against 29.3% growth estimated to be accrued from the industry.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock moved down for both fiscal 2017 and 2018, over the last 60 days, reflecting negative sentiments.Inside StoryHormel Foods had reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) results. Quarterly revenues and earnings missed the respective year-ago figures by 4.1% and 5.6%.The company noted that the top-line results primarily dipped year over year due to the dreary performance of the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. Fall in turkey prices, mounting competition and elevation in overall operating expenses have been weighing over this segment's results for the past two quarters.Hormel Foods also stated that turkey prices (especially turkey breast meat) dropped during the fiscal third quarter. The turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness any price hike in the upcoming quarters.On the other hand, operating cost of the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment has been escalating due to the poor yield accrued from certain plant operations and maintenance required for bio-security measures.In addition, intense competition has been putting pricing pressure on the Jennie-O Turkey Store business’ food service, retail and daily business chains.Hormel Foods mentioned that apart from the dismal Jennie-O Turkey Store segment’s performance, inflation in the prices of major inputs, such as pork bellies and beef trim, hurt the bottom-line results in the last reported quarter. The company expects that elevated costs of these inputs will continue to dent its profitability in the near term as well.Notably, the company trimmed its earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2017 from the $1.65-$1.71 per share range to the $1.54-$1.58 per share range, due to the aforementioned issues.Furthermore, we believe a stronger U.S. dollar might mar Hormel Foods’ international revenues and margins, going ahead. Additionally, outbreak of livestock diseases is expected to give rise to sudden supply-chain challenges for the company going forward.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.  has an average positive earnings surprise of 3.64% for the last four quarters and currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

265,HRL,"So the rhetoric appears to have actions backing it up, after all: upon the event of a massive $85.4 billion merger between AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Time Warner , the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said “no way.” This came a bit out of left field, as the deal was assumed to be vertical — not to encroach on monopolistic terrain, as the companies do not directly compete with one another — and thus considered viable by the business community, and especially shareholders of AT&T and/or Time Warner stock.Considering that media companies are now competing on a massive scale with entertainment content providers like Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), this merger appears to make sense in that it ups the ante for both media and telecommunications players going forward. In fact, some analysts saw this merger leading to M&A deals elsewhere across these industries, changing the entertainment access landscape radically, and for the foreseeable future.Yet that’s not what we’re seeing now that the DoJ has gotten involved. Initially, those close to these companies assumed this was perhaps a rift between President Trump and Time Warner entity CNN, which the President has very vocally critical of both during the election campaign and during the first year of Trump’s term in office. But what the DoJ argues today is that consumer costs are likely to spike as AT&T would be able to charge “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks.” Basically, the DoJ is officially taking issue with antitrust laws, and that this merger may be in violation of them.AT&T, for its part, maintains its vertical merger stance, pointing to the routine passage of such agreements in other industries without unraveling any antitrust issues. During the previous administration, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) was allowed to purchase NBCUniversal from General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) in 2011. We have yet to hear from President Trump on this matter today, but should tweets abound regarding CNN’s supposed “fake news” in response to AT&T’s pushback on this lawsuit — AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the suit “defies logic and is unprecedented” — we’ll know where the President stands personally on this matter.Q3 Earnings RoundupCampbell’s Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) missed earnings estimates by 5 cents per share to 92 cents ahead of today’s opening bell, while revenues of $2.16 billion also came up short of the $2.18 billion expected. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company also ratcheted down earnings guidance going forward, and we are seeing Campbell’s shares selling off more than 7% in early trading. Shares are down more than 16% year to date. For more info on CPB’s earnings, click here.Fellow processed food manufacturer Hormel (HRL  -  Free Report) beat bottom-line estimates by a penny to 41 cents per share. Quarterly sales were also better than expected, forking in $2.49 billion as opposed to the Zacks consensus $2.39 billion. The company also issued fiscal 2018 guidance from $9.40-9.80 per share (today’s reported quarter was for Q118). For more info on HRL’s earnings, click here.Home improvement retailer Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) also beat consensus estimates for its Q3 earnings report, putting up $1.05 per share on revenues of $16.77 billion that outpaced the $1.02 per share and $16.57 billion expected. This amounts to the first positive surprise in the past 3 quarters for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, with comps up 5.7% in the quarter. Shares are trading up in the pre-market roughly 2% at this hour. For more info on LOW’s earnings, click here.

267,HRL,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, Initial Jobless Claims results hit the tape, as they do every Thursday morning. And as we’ve seen for the past several weeks — and in broader terms for the past several years — weekly claims numbers keep falling lower. Last week tallied just 222K new claims, a drop of 7000 from the previous week’s downwardly revised 229K.These are almost astonishingly low numbers. You’d have to go back to before American culture knew who John Travolta was to find fewer relative jobless claims than we see right now, and the labor market looked vastly different back then than it currently does.Continuing claims were equally as impressive: from the previous week’s roughly 1.95 million to last week’s 1.875 million, for a metric that hasn’t seen 2 million continuing claims on a regular basis since the early era of the Great Recession. We thought this was a tight labor market when the last non-farm payroll report came out? It’s even tighter now.Back when that employment report came out early this month, it sent shockwaves through the stock market — first with a spike in 10-year bond yields, then to speculation of higher and more frequent Fed interest rate hikes in 2018, which triggered the Volatility Index (VIX). The month of February is on track to be the worst trading month in 6 1/2 years.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 are trying to fight back from two straight down trading days; the Nasdaq has been in the red three straight sessions. That said, even though early market futures showed the trading indexes in the red yet again, we currently see some modestly green pastures a half-hour ahead of the bell.Q4 Earnings ContinueOklahoma-based fracking major Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines this morning, posting a 5-cent beat to 30 cents per share, on revenues of $1.26 billion which surpassed the $1.23 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock (which also has a Value-Growth-Momentum score of A) gained 8% in early trading on the news. For more on CHK’s earnings, click here.Processed food giant Hormel (HRL  -  Free Report), however, put up mixed Q1 2018 results this morning. The Zacks Rank #3 company posted 56 cents per share, ahead of the 44 cents expected, on quarterly sales of $2.33 billion which failed to reach the $2.40 billion we were looking for. Full-year guidance was in-line for revenues and increased modestly for earnings per share.

268,HRL,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 26.Last quarter, the company reported earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, Dean Foods has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 15.2%.Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise | Dean Foods Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Dean Foods will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 26 cents per share, reflecting a 31.6% decline year over year. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.95 billion, down 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, the stock has declined 14.6% in the past month, wider than the broader Consumer Staples sector’s loss of 6.6%.Factors at PlayDean Foods’ top line has been plagued by challenges related to soft volumes, higher raw milk costs and loss of share in U.S. fluid milk volumes. Moreover, the company’s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Hence, any rise in the price of these commodities is likely to hurt margins.In third-quarter 2017, raw milk costs were up about 10% year over year and nearly 7% on a sequential basis, which impacted sales. Meanwhile, the milk category remained soft as the fluid milk volumes dipped 2.2% year over year, on a quarter-to-date basis. Additionally, Dean Foods' share of U.S. fluid milk volumes contracted 50 basis points. These adverse fluctuations in raw material prices pose threats to Dean Foods’ operating results.However, Dean Foods looks well-poised with its smart volume initiative, which aims at improving top line, building margins and creating operating efficiencies. In third-quarter 2017, the company’s results gained from overall solid sales execution and stringent progress on its smart volumes initiative, which helped in wining some new business for 2018. This is likely to produce roughly 40 million gallons on an annualized basis for numerous key customers. The company anticipates starting shipping this volume by end of this year and into early 2018. Going forward, the company expects to bring more smart volumes into its system to aid top-line growth.Additionally, Dean Foods’ initiatives to strengthen brands and diversify portfolio bode well. While the company is seeing core dairy-related business growth from products like ice cream, flavored milk and sour cream, it is also optimistic about opportunities in juices, teas and other beverages.Going into 2018, the company expects to build brand equity on DairyPure through new product innovation and improved marketing. Moreover, the company’s efforts to grow in the organic space, including recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley as well as the acquisition of Uncle Matt's juices, should strengthen its portfolio. In the meantime, Dean Foods’ remains focused on improving profitability through cost reduction initiatives.Despite top-line constraints, the company’s endeavors look promising to boost its performance in the near term.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Dean Foods is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

269,HRL,"Premium meat products company Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended January 2018) results on Feb 22, before the market opens.Over the last four quarters, the company recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 3.12%. A supply glut in the turkey market and inflation in the prices of some major inputs such as pork bellies and beef trim have been weighing over Hormel’s performance for the past few quarters.However, it should be noted that the company’s adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Notably, our proven model shows that Hormel’s earnings will likely beat estimates in the quarter under review.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Hormel has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks Rank & ESP: Hormel’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with an Earnings ESP of +10.94%, predicts a likely earnings beat.Hormel Foods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Hormel Foods Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Hormel Foods Corporation QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Hormel anticipates that elevated demand for its finest brands, such as Spam, Dinty Moore, Skippy, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, Natural Choice, black label bacon, Hormel Pepperoni and Justin's, will bolster revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, the company’s focus on making more diligent marketing and advertising moves from the beginning of this calendar year will likely help improve top-line results in the fiscal first quarter.Hormel also believes that the strategic acquisition of Columbus Manufacturing, Inc. (completed in November 2017), Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc (completed in August 2017) and the Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol (August 2017) will drive its top- and bottom-line results in the quarters ahead.Furthermore, the company’s decision to consolidate the Grocery Products and Specialty Foods segments from the beginning of fiscal 2018 is anticipated to generate additional revenues and cost synergies going forward.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hormel’s Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products segments are currently pegged at $1,226 million and $432 million respectively for the fiscal first quarter, higher than the corresponding tallies of $1,123 million and $418 million generated in the prior-year quarter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Boston Beer Company, Inc.

270,HRL,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.77%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 4.05%.Let’s See How Things are Shaping Up for Q1Sluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes are the pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as other non-alcoholic beverage companies. PepsiCo’s CSD volumes declined 5% in 2017 in the North America Beverages business.Consumer taste is rapidly shifting from CSDs to non-carbonated beverages. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier alternatives. To this end, the company has stepped up its innovation efforts and investments toward e-commerce, R&D and social/digital marketing/design for enhancing its top line.PepsiCo has delivered organic revenue growth in the past four quarters, banking on significant innovation, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution.If we look back at PepsiCo’s Q4 performance, the company’s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2.3%, driven by 2% pricing on 2% volume growth in food/snacks, offset by a 2% volume decline in beverages. However, its total revenues remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Notably, results of North America Beverages (NAB) segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in Q4. The company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.Segment DiscussionNorth America Beverages or NAB business (which includes beverage businesses in the United States and Canada) accounts for about 33% of PepsiCo’s total revenues. Revenues at the segment declined 6% in the fourth quarter, 3% in the third quarter and remained unchanged in the first two quarters of 2017. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the to-be-reported quarter as well. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NAB segment revenues is pegged at $4.39 billion, implying a decline from $$5.9 billion in Q4 and $4.46 billion in the year-ago quarter.For Frito-Lay North America or FLNA business (accounting for 25% of revenues), the company had a good balance of volume growth, net price realization and operating margin expansion. However, the segment’s revenues decreased 1% last quarter but increased 2% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $3.64 billion, implying a decline from $4.83 billion in the prior quarter but an increase from $3.5 billion in the year-ago period.Quaker Foods North America segment revenues decreased 5% in the fourth quarter and 2% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $605 million versus $774 million in the fourth quarter and $598 million in the first quarter of 2017.Europe Sub-Saharan Africa segment revenues grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 8% in 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.6 billion, implying an increase from $1.4 billion in the prior-year period but a decrease from $3.7 billion last quarter.Latin America segment revenues grew 6% in the prior quarter as well as 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues is pegged at $1.1 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2017 and $$2.4 billion in the fourth quarter.Asia, Middle East and North Africa segment revenues remained unchanged year over year in the fourth quarter but decreased 5% in 2017. The segment’s revenues are likely to improve to $1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 from $970 million registered in the year-ago period, per the consensus estimate. However, it is likely to decline from $1.9 billion in the prior quarter.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PepsiCo’s total revenues stands at $12.4 billion, implying a 3% year-over-year increase.Other Factors to Influence PepsiCo’s First-Quarter Performance:Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had earlier indicated that as commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2018, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectations in the last eight quarters. The company’s productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion. PepsiCo’s productivity programs are on track to achieve annual $1 billion target.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at 92 cents, reflecting a 2.1% year-over-year decrease.Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts:PepsiCo does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of -0.97%.Zacks Rank: PepsiCo carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc.

271,HRL,"The consumer staples sector has been drawing investors’ attention lately, as an improving economy and rising consumer confidence is doing the trick for this sector. Labor market optimism, strong GDP numbers and a resurgent housing market have played crucial roles in raising buyers’ confidence and suggest that the economy is in good health.However, North Korea’s latest nuclear test has spurred global tensions and unnerved investors, who seem to remain unsure of Trump’s policies. Nevertheless, we believe these are short-term headwinds and can be well taken care of. At this juncture, it may be a good idea to buy consumer staple stocks, as there are signs of continuing strength in consumer confidence which in turn will lead to higher consumer spending and fuel growth in the near term.However, despite the prevailing optimism around the sector, there still remain stocks which are not capable of delivering desired returns, probably due to headwinds like pricing pressure, highly promotional environment or unfavorable currency. So let's find out which consumer staples stocks are underperforming and are not fit for your portfolio currently.How to Identify Underperforming Stocks?This is where our VGM Score comes into play.

274,HRL,"Premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 31, 2017) results on Aug 24, before the market opens.In the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 0.79%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayIn the last three months, Hormel Foods’ shares lost 3.6%, as against 7.9% gain incurred by the industry.Fall in turkey prices, extensive competition and increase in overall operating expenses have weighed on the Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment’s performance in the preceding two quarters. The company perceives these headwinds to persist and in turn depress the top and bottom-line performance even in the second half of the fiscal year.Moreover, other adverse headwinds such as a stronger U.S. currency, price inflation of major inputs (such as beef, pork and poultry) or outbreak of any livestock disease are likely to weigh over its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarters.However, amid the aforementioned negativities, Hormel Foods is poised to boost its near-term revenues on the back of stronger demand for popular brands like Skippy and Justin's. Moreover, the company’s ongoing $190 million capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2017 is likely to generate benefits moving ahead.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hormel Foods is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Trump is seeking a further tariff of $100 billion against China in addition to the already proposed $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods, targeting robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.Earlier this week, Washington planned to slap a 25% tariff on 1,300 China-made products, which include a wide array of products including raw materials, construction machinery, agricultural equipment, electronics, medical devices and consumer goods. These goods belong to industries, such as aerospace and agricultural equipment, which were the key growth areas of China over the next seven years.The new taxes came a day after China hit back with likely 25% duties on 106 American goods including soybeans, corns, aircraft, and vehicles worth an estimated $50 billion, against Trump’s similar threat in response to alleged intellectual property theft. The second-largest economy has already imposed a duty on 128 American food products, including meat, fruit, pork, dried fruits, wine and aluminum scrap, worth $3 billion effective Apr 2, in retaliation against Trump’s severe tariff of 24% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports.The round of sanctions and retaliation could trigger a global trade war, hurting worldwide economy and corporate profits at big U.S. exporters. As such, several corners of the broad market and various industries are in distress. In particular, large-caps stocks, which derive most of their revenues outside the United States especially China, appear vulnerable. On the other hand, small caps, which provide true domestic exposure, should be safe and better plays in case the tit-for-tat situation turns into a full-blown trade war.So let’s pick a couple of stocks from industries on China’s hit list for a match up to see which one is in the line of fire and which is guarded well enough to survive the tariff onslaught.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) versus Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report)Boeing would be hit hard from the proposed Chinese tariff, as it is the top U.S. exporter to China and will buy about $1 trillion worth of its aircraft over the next 20 years. On the other hand, NOC would remain unscathed by the dispute. Boeing has shed 4.6% in a month while NOC has gained 4.4%. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Deere & Co. (DE  -  Free Report) versus Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report)Farming equipment maker Deere could be among the biggest losers as the proposed China tariff on agricultural products would reduce demand for the related machines while packaged food companies like Hormel could see a boost resulting from cheaper commodity prices, including soybeans and corns, on weak Chinese demand. Both stocks have a Zack Rank #2. Shares of DE are down 3.6% over the past month while HRL has climbed 6.8%.DowDuPont Inc (DWDP  -  Free Report) versus Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report)DowDuPont’s agriculture unit is expected to be hurt by price declines in soybeans. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). On the other hand, Archer Daniels Midland could benefit from reduced prices. American agricultural producers export about $20 billion worth of products to China each year. Of this, $14.6 billion comprises soybeans and the rest include cotton, wheat and corn. ADM has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) versus H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report)Caterpillar is vulnerable to the trade dispute as it has heavy exposure to China. Meanwhile, H&E Equipment Services is a small-cap stock and does not do business in China. CAT has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while HEES has a Zacks Rank #2. Both stocks were beaten down over the past month.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report)) versus Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report)American automakers would be the worst hit from the proposed tariff and a potential trade war. In particular, China has been General Motors’ largest retail market for six consecutive years as the automaker sold four million vehicles in 2017 for the first time ever. Meanwhile, Tesla also seems to be the biggest loser as China has threatened more import tariff on electric cars. Out of the two, GM still seems attractive with a Zacks Rank #1, while Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report): A Wild CardAs Tyson Foods is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, it is likely to be impacted by China’s 25% tariff on pork and pork products. Notably, China is the third-largest consumer of U.S. pork and bought about $1.1 billion worth of pork products from the United States last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. However, a possible duty on soybean would reduce the price of the commodity due to large supplies and thereby result in reduced cost for meat companies like Tyson. As such, Tyson is both a beneficiary and a loser in this series of tariff attack. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a top VGM Score of A.Bottom LineAll the buzz has resulted from the Trump administration, which is seeking to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China by $100 billion. Last year, the United States had a record $375-billion trade deficit with China, while China reported a U.S. trade surplus of $276 billion.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

277,HRL,"The tariff war between the United States and China have caused worries for several agricultural and meat exporting companies, including Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report). Recently, China hiked duties on several U.S. export items, including a 25% tariff on pork, in retaliation to the latter’s tariff stance. Incidentally, this caused the company’s shares to drop almost 6.2% on Apr 2.Per sources, China is one of the largest markets for U.S. pork exports both in terms of value and volume. Analysts pointed that the raised tariff rate is expected to cause significant loss of market in China for several meat exporters, marring revenues for Tyson Foods and other prominent players in the meat industry such as Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report).While China’s tariff rates have caused dark clouds to hover on the meat industry, Tyson Foods has many reasons to stay optimistic, courtesy of its rich portfolio of protein-packed brands, well yielding acquisitions and steadily surging demand for protein products in several markets. That said, let’s take a closer look at some of the factors aiding the company’s performance.  Rising Demand Bodes WellTyson Foods has been steadily gaining from enhanced sales across its Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods owing to rising demand for protein-packed products. Management projects consistent rise in demand for such products and has plans to exploit opportunities in this space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production to rise roughly 3% year over year. Such positive market scenario has driven Tyson Foods to make several investments, especially in expanding poultry production. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, courtesy of consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without added hormones or antibiotics.Acquisitions Aid GrowthAdditionally, Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to expand its portfolio. In fact, the AdvancePierre buyout has been favoring the Prepared Foods segment. The acquisition led to a 2.4% and 9.5% rise in sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, while in first-quarter fiscal 2018 sales volume jumped 11.6%. Further, the company expects additional sales of approximately $1.1 billion from AdvancePierre during fiscal 2018.  Financial Fitness ProgramToward the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, directed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel bottom-line growth. Incidentally, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter. Further, the company aims to generate savings from this program, through synergies from AdvancePierre’s integration along with incremental cost optimization. These efforts are anticipated to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018 and roughly $600 million by 2020.Final ThoughtsWell, it is yet to be seen whether China’s raised tariff rates on pork will have negative impacts on Tyson Foods’ performance. Moreover, the company’s robust portfolio, strong geographic reach in approximately 117 countries along with its strategic buyouts and investments to meet the rising demand for protein-packed products are expected to counter the challenges stemming from the China market. In fact, such well-planned initiatives have aided this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong buy) company’s shares gain as much as 10.6% in a year, almost in-line with the industry’s rally of 10.7%. On that note, we are confident that Tyson Foods will be able to maintain its position as one of the prominent players in the food industry and counter challenges strategically.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

278,HRL,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) savings initiatives have been an aspect of cheer lately. Further, the company is focused on making investments as well as undertaking effective restructuring plans to induce efficiency and enhance market share.However, softness in North American consumer products and the diaper segment as well as rising input costs have been posing concerns for a while. These factors have caused the company’s shares to drop 4.7% in the past six months, while it fared better than the industry's fall of 9%.Nevertheless, lets weigh both the sides and see if the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth initiatives can help it uplift the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereEnsuring Fuller Pockets With Savings & RestructuringKimberly-Clark is aggressively cutting costs through its Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere, or FORCE Program. The program has successfully generated higher cost savings each year with record amount of $450 million in 2017.The company projects savings of $400 million in 2018 and more than $1.5 billion over the four-year period from 2018 to 2021. This will be achieved, courtesy of management’s focus on enriching productivity at manufacturing facilities, optimizing design and raw material expenses as well as attaining distribution efficiencies.Further, the company’s adherence toward maximizing savings and inducing operating efficiencies is evident from the 2018 Global Restructuring Program. In fact, the program is considered as one of the largest restructuring initiatives undertaken by the company. It primarily focuses on enhancing underlying profitability for better competition and provides greater flexibility to undertake growth-oriented investments.Delving deeper, we note that the program is expected to simplify Kimberly-Clark’s overhead organization and manufacturing supply chain structures. Notably, management expects cost savings of $50-$70 million from this program in 2018.Further, as part of enhancing efficiency, Kimberly-Clark plans to divest some low-margin businesses, mainly concentrated in the consumer tissue unit. On a combined basis, Kimberly-Clark expects cost savings of more than $2 billion from the FORCE program and 2018 Global Restructuring Program, over the next four years. Focus on Innovation Being a popular name in several consumer product categories, Kimberly-Clark regularly undertakes innovation to sustain its brand positions and market share. Over the near term, the company has a number of innovations lined up for launch in North America, including upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes, Pull-Ups training pants, Depend and Poise in adult care and new Kleenex wet wipes.Hurdles to Be Crossed Kimberly-Clark has been witnessing rising input costs of late. Evidently, increased input costs on account of hiked rates of pulp and other raw materials caused adjusted operating profit to fall 2.7% in the fourth quarter.  In 2018, management expects input cost inflation of about $300-$400 million, primarily in international markets. Additionally, softness in North American consumer products and high competition in the diaper segment have been posing concerns. Final Thoughts  Wrapping up, Kimberly-Clark’s continued emphasis on reducing costs and making growth-oriented investments are expected to offset the aforementioned challenges. Also, management expects tax reforms to favorably impact its bottom-line and cash flows during 2018. Banking on such positives, management envisions adjusted earnings per share to grow roughly 11-16% year over year in 2018.All said, we expect the company’s robust initiatives and a positive outlook to help it overcome persistent challenges in the forthcoming periods.Looking for More?

279,HRL,"Thursday, February 22, 2018Ahead of today’s opening bell, Initial Jobless Claims results hit the tape, as they do every Thursday morning. And as we’ve seen for the past several weeks — and in broader terms for the past several years — weekly claims numbers keep falling lower. Last week tallied just 222K new claims, a drop of 7000 from the previous week’s downwardly revised 229K.These are almost astonishingly low numbers. You’d have to go back to before American culture knew who John Travolta was to find fewer relative jobless claims than we see right now, and the labor market looked vastly different back then than it currently does.Continuing claims were equally as impressive: from the previous week’s roughly 1.95 million to last week’s 1.875 million, for a metric that hasn’t seen 2 million continuing claims on a regular basis since the early era of the Great Recession. We thought this was a tight labor market when the last non-farm payroll report came out? It’s even tighter now.Back when that employment report came out early this month, it sent shockwaves through the stock market — first with a spike in 10-year bond yields, then to speculation of higher and more frequent Fed interest rate hikes in 2018, which triggered the Volatility Index (VIX). The month of February is on track to be the worst trading month in 6 1/2 years.Both the Dow and the S&P 500 are trying to fight back from two straight down trading days; the Nasdaq has been in the red three straight sessions. That said, even though early market futures showed the trading indexes in the red yet again, we currently see some modestly green pastures a half-hour ahead of the bell.Q4 Earnings ContinueOklahoma-based fracking major Chesapeake Energy (CHK  -  Free Report) outperformed estimates on both its top- and bottom-lines this morning, posting a 5-cent beat to 30 cents per share, on revenues of $1.26 billion which surpassed the $1.23 billion in the Zacks consensus. Shares for the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock (which also has a Value-Growth-Momentum score of A) gained 8% in early trading on the news. For more on CHK’s earnings, click here.Processed food giant Hormel (HRL  -  Free Report), however, put up mixed Q1 2018 results this morning. The Zacks Rank #3 company posted 56 cents per share, ahead of the 44 cents expected, on quarterly sales of $2.33 billion which failed to reach the $2.40 billion we were looking for. Full-year guidance was in-line for revenues and increased modestly for earnings per share.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

280,HRL,"Wall Street and the White House are jittery as repercussions related to fears of a trade war with China, possibilities of three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year, and tech stock concerns regarding data privacy and antitrust risks continue to do the rounds. However, the Chinese government’s retaliation to the Trump administration’s levy of 25% tariffs on 1,300 imported goods from China topped the headlines.China’s president, Xi Jinping, recently levied up to 25% tariffs on 106 U.S. imports, including soybeans, cars, chemicals and more. With this, both countries are targeting about $50 billion tariffs on imports from each other.Signs of a U.S.-China trade war further became prominent with Trump’s intention to strike another $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods. This has certainly sent shock waves across the entire global economy.The new tariffs framed by China's Ministry of Commerce are expected to hurt a host of U.S. industries, including consumer electronics, food, beverages, aircrafts and automobiles, among others. According to experts, the tariff is likely to be higher than anticipated, with the U.S. agricultural industry being the prime target.The tariffs will also affect meat-exporting companies, with the levy of 25% tariff on pork. Per sources, China is one of the largest markets for U.S. pork exports in terms of value and volume. Consequently, the hiked tariffs are expected to cause significant loss for China’s meat exporters and in turn, hurt their profitability.However, the effective date for the imposition of these tariffs has not been disclosed yet. While the United States stated that the tariffs will take effect after a public comment and consultation period lasting for about two months, China said that the imposition depends on Trump’s decision.Alleged intellectual property violations by Chinese companies led to a U.S. trade deficit of $504 billion with China, which sparked the trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. To force changes in China’s intellectual properties practices, the Trump administration at first imposed a tariff of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports, particularly on steel and aluminum. In response, China retaliated by imposing tariffs worth about $3 billion on 128 American exports.Key U.S. Sectors at StakeAs is clear from the above discussion, the recently levied tariffs are likely to erode the profit margins of players in the Consumer Staples sector. This sector, which mainly comprises food, meat, beverages and agriculture stocks, is likely to be at risk after the imposition of the aforementioned tariffs.Generally, Consumer Staples stocks are considered most defensive, owing to their nature of fulfilling the basic necessities of daily lives. However, how these stocks will battle the current turmoil remains to be seen.Currently, Consumer Staples ranks among the top 50% of all Zacks sectors (8 of 16).Let’s take a closer look at some of the prominent players in Consumer Staples, highlighting their current position and ability to sail through the trade war scenario.Starting with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report), this leading food processing company remains on track with the accomplishments related to operational excellence and readiness program. Further, management remains encouraged to deliver growth through cost-saving efforts, enhanced capabilities, product innovations and global strength. Notably, the company has corn processing facilities in China and entered a joint development agreement with the China-based Qingdao Vland Biotech Group Co., Ltd to develop new enzymes for animal feed applications.  This exposure may call for troubles for the company if the trade-war intensifies. Nevertheless, the Illinois-based company sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report), also a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has been witnessing rising demand across the Beef, Chicken and prepared foods segments. Moreover, its Prepared Foods category has been delivering solid growth in particular, courtesy of rising demand for protein-packed brands and synergies from the AdvancePierre’ buyout. However, the company continues to incur higher wage and freight costs due to tightening market conditions. Also, raw materials price volatility remains a threat. Though the US-China conflict should have little impact on the company at present due to its modest exposure in China, the war may stall its chances to expand in the Chinese market.Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), the major manufacturer and marketer of various meat and food products in the United States and international markets, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company believes that marketing programs and elevated demand for on-trend branded products will continue to boost its revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, its near-term results are anticipated to improve on the back of the recently made acquisitions. However, its Jennie-O Turkey Store segment remains soft owing to excess meat stock in cold storage and fall in turkey prices. The company has a strong business in China and operates through exports, joint venture and licensing partnerships. Further, Hormel Foods is enhancing its global footprint with higher capital investments in China, which might be at stake due to improved tariffs.Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is progressing well with its cost savings plan. This is evident from the raised annualized savings target of $500 million. Also, the company remains keen on making acquisitions to enhance its brand portfolio and boost growth. The company’s recent buyout of Snyder’s-Lance is likely to aid Campbell in fortifying its snacking brands’ portfolio, thus making it a snacking leader. Moreover, the company’s Kelsen brand has been delivering solid performance in China, which might be hampered due to the proposed changes in tariffs. Nevertheless, Campbell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report), the major producer and distributor of premium alcoholic beverages in the world, continues to gain from solid growth in underlying sales, persistent momentum at its focus categories and strength in Jack Daniels. This Zacks Rank #3 stock remains optimistic on growth at its premium American whiskey and tequila brands. Looking ahead, management sees higher growth potential in China as it accelerates investments in this area. However, any adverse changes to the US-China relations may stall the company’s aspirations to grow in the region.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

283,HRL,"Shares of Campbell Soup (CPB  -  Free Report) got canned on Thursday after the company reported both fourth quarter and full-year sales declines. Campbell’s poor performance also helped send the rest of the packaged food industry lower, nearly across the board.Campbell’s fourth-quarter revenues fell by 1% from the year-ago period to $1.664 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.689 billion. The company also failed to meet our earnings estimates, posting earnings of $0.52 a share against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55.The canned soup giant’s full-year sales dipped by 1% to $7.890 billion, based mostly on an overall drop in organic sales due to lower volume and greater promotional spending. Campbell’s now projects that full-year revenues could fall by as much as 2% next year.“The operating environment for the packaged foods industry remains challenging due to shifting demographics, changing consumer preferences for food, the adoption of new shopping behaviors and the dynamic retailer landscape,” Campbell’s President and CEO Denise Morrison said in a statement. “In these times, sales growth remains a challenge.”The CEO noted that drastically changing consumer shopping trends have greatly impacted the company’s non-refrigerated canned and bottled goods sales, which are now seemingly outdated. Morrison also pointed to the rise of self-cooking delivery companies, such as Blue Apron (APRN), as well as an increase of private label brands, as major reasons for Campbell’s poor sales.Campbell’s biggest business sector, its soup and juice division, saw its sales sink 3% in its fourth-quarter. Sales of its packaged snack segment, including Pepperidge Farm and Goldfish, were flat. On the bright side, Campbell’s Bolthouse Farms fresh food sector experienced a 1% gain.Still, Thursday’s report marked Campbell’s 11th straight quarterof falling sales. Campbell’s stock tanked by over 7% and touched a new two-year intraday trading low of $46.43 a share.Packaged Food Industry  Campbell’s rough day helped send the rest of the packaged food industry down overall, as the soup maker’s predicament is hardly unique. With companies such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Costco (COST  -  Free Report) growing larger, brands hold less and less leverage in price negotiations.“Right now, the retailers, they’re doing better in this round of the fight,” Warren Buffett said in a recent interview with CNBC.Buffett, an investor and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) board member, saw shares of the packaged food powerhouse fall 1.72% on Thursday. Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report) stock dropped by 2.03%, while shares of Conagra Brands (CAG  -  Free Report) dipped 0.82%.Shares of General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) both sunk to new 52-week intraday   lows.

284,HRL,"Premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) recently enhanced its foodservice portfolio, on the acquisition of the Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc. (Capitol Wholesale Meats), for $425 million. This move is anticipated to reinforce the company’s acquisition-based growth strategy and boost its near-term performance as well.Chicago, IL-based Capitol Wholesale Meats is a premium producer of authentic Italian sausages and meats. It is also the manufacturer of other types of quality meat products, including meatballs and pizza toppings. Fontanini is a popular Italian meat and sausage brand of the company. Notably, Capitol Wholesale Meats owns a new state-of-the-art production facility in McCook, IL.Foodservice is a high-margin business of Hormel Foods. The company noted that its foodservice business is rapidly growing on the back of the expanding portfolio of customers in the restaurant, lodging, healthcare and academic sectors.Hormel Foods also stated that the strategic buyout of the Fontanini brand will accelerate the current growth rate of its foodservice business. Moreover, the ownership of the Capitol Wholesale Meats’ high-tech facility in McCook will likely augment the company’s competency.Post the buyout, Fontanini will continue operations in its existing facility located in the Chicago metropolitan area. However, it would report its operations under Hormel Foods’ Refrigerated Foods segment.Why Should You Put the Stock on Hold?Dismal turkey prices, extensive business rivalry and escalating operating expenses are expected to thwart the near-term margins of Hormel Foods’ Jennie-O Turkey Store segment. Also, outbreak of livestock diseases, input price inflation or a stronger U.S. dollar might adversely affect the company’s performance, moving ahead. Over the last month, shares of the company yielded a return of 3.80%, underperforming 9.49% growth recorded by the industry.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock believes that the increased sales of major brands (like Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni and Hormel Natural Choice), diligent innovation investments and greater operational efficacy will likely bolster the company’s near-term results.In addition, Hormel Foods has been fortifying its product portfolio on the back of a number of acquisitions for the past few years. For instance, the buyouts of premium brands like Skippy (in January 2013), Muscle Milk (August 2014) and Junstin’s (June 2016) have largely supported the company’s top- and bottom-line growth, so far.

285,HRL,"We issued an updated research report on premium meat products company, Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.Inside StoryHormel Foods’ top- and bottom-line results in second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Apr 30, 2017) were largely hurt due to challenges faced by the Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment. Fall in turkey prices, extensive competition and elevation in overall operating expenses have been weighing over this segment's results.Hormel Foods noted that turkey prices (especially turkey breast meat) went down during the fiscal second quarter. The turkey market has been facing an oversupply situation and is unlikely to witness any price hike in the upcoming quarters.On the other hand, operating cost of the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment has been escalating due to poor yield accrued from certain plant operations and maintenance required for certain bio-security measures.In addition, Hormel Foods conducts its business in a highly competitive market. Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report), Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report) are some major business players of the industry. Intense competition has been putting price pressure on Jennie-O Turkey Store business’ food service, retail, as well as daily business chains.Hormel Foods expects the aforementioned headwinds to depress its overall fiscal 2017 performance. Notably, the company currently estimates to report earnings at the lower end of the $1.65–$1.71 per share range for fiscal 2017.Furthermore, we believe that a stronger U.S. dollar might dent Hormel Foods’ international revenues and margins, moving ahead. Moreover, prices of various raw materials used by the company, such as beef, pork and poultry, are exposed to market fluctuations due to supply-demand inconsistencies.Additionally, outbreak of livestock diseases is expected to give rise to sudden supply-chain challenges for the company in the near term.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

286,HRL,"In the spirit of Thanksgiving, Im going to talk a little turkey. There are three companies within the Zacks Rank universe1 that provide turkey products: Hormel Foods (HRL  -  Free Report), Smithfield Foods (SFD) and Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report). None of these companies are turkey pure plays, however, as there is not a company within the Zacks Rank universe that focuses solely on the big birds. 
"
287,HRL,"This morning, HRL reported fourth-quarter profits of 64 cents per share, topping expectations by a penny. Revenue growth of 5% was paced by the companys specialty foods segment, as well as by grocery products and refrigerated products. Jennie-O Turkey Store generated 1.5% sales growth, but experienced an 11.7% decrease in operating profits because of higher meat prices. Hormel expects live turkey production to increase in 2007. 
"
288,HRL,"The company guided for fiscal 2007 profits to be in a range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share. Analysts are presently forecasting earnings of $2.19 per share, though this could change following todays conference call. HRL is a Zacks #2 Rank stock.
"
289,HRL,"Smithfield Foods is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings on Nov 30, before the market opens. The company has missed expectations three times during the past four quarters. Analysts are expecting the company to report profits of 47 cents per share, a penny below the forecast of 60 days ago. SFD is a Zacks #3 Rank (hold) stock.
"
290,HRL,"Last week, Tyson reported an adjusted loss of seven cents per share for its fiscal fourth quarter; analysts were expecting a two-cent loss. The miss was the third in four quarters for the largest meat and poultry producer. Tysons guidance for fiscal 2007 profits of 50 to 80 cents per share was viewed as being disappointing by analysts, who quickly cut their forecasts. The new consensus estimate for profits of 64 cents per share is 10 cents below the pre-earnings release forecast. TSN is a Zacks #5 Rank (strong sell) stock.
"
291,HRL,"Conditions this year have not been favorable to the meat and poultry producers. Earlier in the year, there was an oversupply of chickens. The chicken market appears to be stabilizing. Feeder and live cattle futures have been under pressure over the past few months, however, and this could be causing some overhang. Conversely, pork bellies are trading near 52-week highs.
"
292,HRL,"The day after Thanksgiving is referred as Black Friday, because traditionally it is the day when retailers achieve profitability. For consumers, however, it may be better known as Bargain Friday with many stores offering steep discounts.
"
293,HRL,"There are two trendy retailers that are attracting customers without having to rely on door buster promotions: American Eagle Outfitters (AEOS) and bebe stores . Both are Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stocks.
"
294,HRL,"American Eagle Outfitters, which targets young men and women, beat analysts profit expectations by a penny as third-quarter revenues and earnings set new record highs for the 11th consecutive quarter. Sales at stores opened at least a year rose 13%, contributing to total sales growth of 20%. (The company recorded revenues of $696.3 million.) Earnings reached 66 cents per share, thanks in part to improved gross margins. Gross profits widened to 49.2%, from 46.4% a year ago. AEOS guided for fourth-quarter profits to be in the range of 94 to 96 cents per share, positively surprising analysts. Over the past seven days, nearly all of the covering analysts have adjusted their forecasts, causing the consensus estimate to rise eight cents to 97 cents per share.
"
295,HRL,"BEBE, which sells womens clothing, generated fiscal first-quarter profits of 22 cents, two cents above expectations. Same-stores sales rose 12.8%, contributing to an overall increase in revenues of 24.5% (to $157.1 million). Gross margins widened to 50.5% as the company was able to push through higher initial prices and reduce the volume of markdown merchandise sold. Following the report, analysts adjusted their fiscal 2007 forecasts upwards to $1.01 per share. 
"
296,HRL,"Both AEOS and BEBE are classified within Retail-Apparel/Shoe. This group contains a total of four Zacks #1 Rank stocks and 15 Zacks #2 Rank stocks.
"
297,HRL,"The total number of earnings estimate revisions for companies within the Zacks Rank universe appears to have peaked continued to increase. Using a four-week rolling period, there were decrease in the number of estimates for both this and next fiscal year. The ration of positive to negative estimates held fairly steady, however, which is a good sign.

300,HRL,"The re-emergence of trade war fears has sent tremors across the Wall Street. This is because China has targeted about $3 billion in American exports in retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariff on steel and aluminum import (read: Trump Tariffs Put These Sector ETFs & Stocks in Focus).The second-largest country has slapped a duty on 128 American food products effective Apr 2. Of these, 120 products, including dried fruits, sparkling wine and stainless steel pipes, saw a new tariff of 15% while eight commodities, including pork products and aluminum scrap, saw a 25% tax hike. The new tariffs went into effect on Apr 2.The move would hurt several American food producers and exporters. In particular, farmers and the pork industry have been on the forefront of damage, as American farmers shipped nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. China is the third-largest consumer of U.S. pork and bought about $1.1 billion worth of pork products from the United States last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.The tariff would also severely impact the apple and wine industry. Washington growers exported nearly 1.8 million 40-pound boxes of apples to mainland China last year and another million to Hong Kong, according to data from the Washington State Tree Fruit Association. Meanwhile, China is one of the fastest growing wine markets in the world and is the sixth-biggest wine importer following France, Australia, Chile, Spain and Italy. U.S. wine exports to greater China (including the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong) were up 10% last year to $197 million. Notably, the value of U.S. wine exports (97% from California) to China has increased 450% in the past decade (read: China Had a Strong Start in 2018: ETFs to Buy).Per money.cnn.com, China makes up for 6% of American fruit exports, 5% of wine exports, 3% of nuts exports and 40% of all ginseng exports.Given this, we have highlighted several ETFs and stocks that are likely to be hit hard and are in focus in the weeks ahead:Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report)Tyson Foods is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, the second-largest food company in the Fortune 500 and a member of the S&P 500.

301,HRL,"China is avenging President Donald Trump’s tariffs worth $60 billion on steel, aluminum and other products by imposing import duties on as many as 128 U.S. items including agricultural products, pork and fruits. Undoubtedly, the tariffs imposed by China’s Ministry of Finance, effective Monday, heightened fears of an ensuing trade war.Trump’s tariffs, which were cheered by domestic steel and aluminum producers, were opposed by producers of finished products. Automakers, apparel and shoe manufacturers, which belong to this ilk, will be severely affected by the newly imposed import duties. And if this was not enough, China’s retaliatory tariffs on imports worth $3 billion will only make matters more difficult for a number of U.S. companies, whose revenues depend on bulk exports to China.Naturally, the only option left for these exporters is to cut down on production, which will definitely hurt their revenues unless if these looks for avenues to channelize their exports to other countries. However, it is too early to predict how U.S. exporters will survive the tariff war and think of alternate export routes.Trump Instigates Tariff WarIn late February, Trump raised fears of a trade war when he announced his plans of 25% and 10% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, respectively. In March, the import duties were finally put into motion.The move, which Trump believes will help in rebuilding the domestic steel and aluminum industry that has been treated unfairly by other countries for decades, was cheered by U.S. steelmakers. It saw shares of major steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corp (AKS  -  Free Report) U.S. Steel Corp X, Nucor Corporation NUE and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) surging immediately. Also, shares of aluminum producers Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) and Alcoa Corp. (AA  -  Free Report) increased.Manufacturing Blue Chips SufferHowever, the decision drew flak from other quarters that utilize a significant amount of imported steel. Shares of major automakers like General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report), heavy equipment makers such as Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) and airline manufacturer The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) witnessed a sharp decline. Specifically, shares of General Motors have declined 2.9% in the last months, while Boeing and United Technologies have decreased 4.9% and 3.2%, respectively.Following this, in March, Trump announced plans of slapping tariffs on about $60 billion worth of China imports following an investigation by his administration into the theft of intellectual property from U.S. companies operating in that country. The decision was once again vehemently opposed by retailers and apparel and shoemakers, who rely heavily on imports or have manufacturing units in China.Quite obviously, Trump’s target is China, as a number of U.S. trade partners like Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina have been exempted from the tariffs. Given this scenario, China’s backlash was only a matter of time.China Tariffs to Affect U.S. ExportersChina finally raised import duties on 128 U.S. goods that include pork, aluminum scrap and other agricultural produces on Monday, thus escalating fears of a trade war. China increased tariffs by 25% on eight products that include pork and aluminum scrap, while a 15% import duty has been set for 120 products including apples and almonds. The affected U.S. goods, which include products like pork, wine, fresh fruits, steel pipes, modified ethanol and ginseng, had an import value of $3 billion in 2017.Naturally, this is going to have a negative impact on the bulk exporters of U.S. livestock and agricultural produce. U.S. farmers exported nearly $20 billion of goods to China in 2017. According to the U.S. Meat Export Federation, in 2017, China purchased about $1.1 billion of pork from the United States, making China the third-largest market for U.S. pork. It goes without saying that meat products companies like Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report), Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (SAFM  -  Free Report), which exports huge quantities to China, will feel the pinch because of the new tariffs. Hormel Foods has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, per the Renewable Fuels Association, China was the third-largest importer of ethanol from the United States in 2016, accounting for almost 20% its total exports. The recent tariffs now put an additional 15% duty along with the existing 30% duty on denatured ethanol imports from the United States. This will only worsen the situation for U.S. exporters.  Also the U.S. apple industry, which exports around 2.5 million cartons of apples to China, is likely to face a major blow with the imposition of tariffs.Interestingly, the dragon has breathed fire on goods that are primarily produced in the U.S. heartlands primarily comprising mid and mid-west states, which had mainly voted for Trump in 2016.  This certainly will not make Trump loyals too happy.In ConclusionAlthough, it is too early to gauge the impact of China’s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, it will certainly leave the huge cohort of exporters, which have so long been earning a chunk of their revenues from that country, feeling uneasy. Moreover,  Trump’s voters might be dissatisfied and complaining. The tariffs definitely have escalated fears of a trade war and exports needs to look for new options to survive this onslaught. Let’s see how they to channelize their exports to countries that have been exempted from tariffs.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

303,HRL,"Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company delivered organic sales growth of 2.9% (in local currency).A glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying for the last six months. Shares have rallied 37.4% over the said time frame, outperforming the Zacks categorized Soap & Cleaning Materials industry’s 13.1% gain. Notably, the industry is part of the top 3% of the Zacks Classified industries (7 out of the 256).Unilever currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and we believe there is much value in the stock which is quite evident from its VGM Score of ‘B’.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What’s Driving the Stock?The Anglo-Dutch company Unilever has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews, aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.The consumer products giant is divesting its underperforming businesses and has reportedly decided to sell its unprofitable spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter, in April. Furthermore, the company announced that it would buyback shares, hike dividends, raise cost savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses.Unilever has also undertaken a program called Connected 4 Growth to reduce costs, under which individual expenses are reviewed during each accounting period rather than rolled over. The company is also consistently focusing on product improvement through innovation. Moreover, it has set a target for net debt of two times EBITDA, which would mean enough flexibility for acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders.Notably, Unilever has entered into many deals to fortify its position in home care and personal care products. These acquisitions will strengthen its portfolio and generate substantial revenues. Unilever is reportedly battling with meat producer Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to buy the foods division of British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser.Meanwhile, the company continues to struggle with declining volumes in Brazil. Further, it is witnessing softness in the developed markets in North America and Europe with little sign of recovery. Nevertheless, the company remains focused on boosting sales in the emerging markets which accounts for about two-thirds of the company’s total revenue. Though these markets are generally volatile, they offer robust long-term prospect.Unilever NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever NV QuoteStocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

304,HRL,"Thanksgiving week is typically a slow period for the markets. Many professionals take the entire week off and earnings season is over. Plus, the markets operate on a holiday schedule. The major U.S. stock exchanges will be closed on Thursday and trading will end early on Friday (1 p.m. ET).
"
305,HRL,"The Conference Board will release its October consumer confidence index on Monday. The University of Michigan will release its final October sentiment numbers on Thursday. And outside of the weekly initial jobless claims numbers, thats basically it on the economic front.
"
306,HRL,"As of this morning, there are just 38 confirmed earnings reports for next week, nearly all being released on either Monday or Tuesday. Most of the profit reports will come from retailers, including Lowes (LOW  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) and GameStop (GME  -  Free Report). The latter company is notable because it is the only major retail chain to solely focus on the video games. Many analysts will be listening to the conference call to hear what GME has to say about the PlayStation 3 (released today) and the Wii (to be released on Sunday).
"
307,HRL,"During the next several weeks, the number of companies featured as having the possibility to issue a positive or negative surprise will be limited. This is because of a seasonal lag in earnings reports.
"
308,HRL,"Companies That Could Surprise During the Week of Nov 20-24
"
309,HRL,"GameStop (GME  -  Free Report) will be attracting a good deal of attention because of the PlayStation 3 and the Wii. During the past month, third-quarter estimates have been revised upwards by a penny to 23 cents per share. U.S. supplies of the PlayStation 3 are limited to just 400,000 this weekend and one million by Christmas. This said, full-year earnings estimates for multiple video game makers have been rising. Therefore, what GME says about its outlook will have major influence on how the stock trades after it releases earnings data. GME has topped expectations during three of the last four quarters, most recently matching second-quarter forecasts. GameStop will report on Tuesday, Nov 21, before the open of trading.
"
310,HRL,"Last week, Hormel Foods (HRL  -  Free Report) raised its guidance for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to a range of 63 to 65 cents per share. The new forecast was above both the companys prior guidance and analysts projections. (The consensus estimate has been adjusted upwards to 63 cents per share, with the most recent consensus at 64 cents per share.) CEO Jeffrey Ettinger credited an exceptional finish for HRLs Specialty Foods segment as well as better-than-expected results for pork and turkey. Ettingers fiscal 2007 earnings guidance, of $2.15 to $2.25 per share, was also above analysts forecasts. HRL has topped expectations during three out of the last four quarters.
"
311,HRL,"Analysts raised their forecasts on Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report) following favorable October same-store sales data. The upscale department store chain saw sales at existing stores increase 10.7% last month. As result, the consensus estimate for third-quarter earnings was revised upwards by three cents to 50 cents per share. The most recent consensus is even more bullish at 51 cents. JWN has topped expectations during each of the past five quarters. Nordstrom will report on Monday, Nov 20, after the close of trading.
"
312,HRL,"Payless ShoeSource (PSS) recently guided for third-quarter earnings that were above analysts forecasts. Based on October same-store sales growth of 5.2%, the company predicted that third-quarter profits from continuing operations would be in a range of 43 to 46 cents per share. Both of the covering analysts responded by raising their forecasts to 45 cents per share. PSS missed second-quarter earnings by five cents per share, but topped expectations during the previous three quarters. Payless ShoeSource will report on Tuesday, Nov 21, after the close of trading.
"
