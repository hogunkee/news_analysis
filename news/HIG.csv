"
13,HIG,"When an industry isn't new, small enhancements can pay off big. And with no single player in that sector taking control, those little things can be magnified even more. Just ask Surgery Partners (SGRY), an operator of ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs.
"
14,HIG,"""The top chains account for ownership of less than 20% of the facilities, with the largest chain only owning 5% to 6%,"" Stifel analyst Chad Vanacore said in an interview with IBD. ""So it's a big field to play in and we should see greater consolidation in that industry.""
"
15,HIG,"Vanacore figures that Surgery Partners, with 13% to 14% revenue growth in 2016 and 10% to 12% same-facility growth, has potential to take advantage of that.
"
16,HIG,"""I think they can grow faster than the industry and be a consolidator in the industry,"" he said.
"
17,HIG,"ASCs have been around since the 1980s. Instead of getting a surgical procedure done at a hospital, patients can get faster and better service, while physicians can work in an attractive and more efficient environment, and the cost is lower for insurers. The ASC industry has a strong payer profile, with 55% of revenue coming from private insurance and just 38% from government payers.
"
18,HIG,"It's also a growing market, with roughly 5,400 ASCs in the U.S, up 64% from the 3,300 that existed in 2000, notes Vanacore in a research report. The market is expected to grow by 19% to 6,400 by 2023.
"
19,HIG,"A $23 Billion Industry
"
20,HIG,"Annual industry revenue is estimated at $23 billion, with 23 million surgeries done each year.
"
21,HIG,"""It really has some attractive attributes on a lot of different levels and from almost anybody's perspective,"" said Frank Morgan, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
"
22,HIG,"Across 28 states, Surgery Partners operates 99 facilities, of which 94 are ambulatory surgical centers and five are surgical hospitals.
"
23,HIG,"It also runs a network of 43 physician practices and provides services annually to over 500,000 patients affiliated with over 4,000 physicians. It has a strong presence in Florida and Texas.
"
24,HIG,"The company's current structure was formed largely through two large acquisitions made in the past four years. Last year it bought Symbion, a privately owned operator of surgical facilities, for $772 million.
"
25,HIG,"This added 49 ASCs and six surgical hospitals to its facility mix and greatly expanded its geographic footprint. Most of Symbion's top executives were retained as part of its management team.
"
26,HIG,"In 2011, Surgery Partners acquired NovaMed, a publicly held operator of primarily ophthalmology and optical services.
"
27,HIG,"This added 37 ASCs to the mix.
"
28,HIG,"Merger Record
"
29,HIG,"Morgan notes that the company has a proven track record of executing and delivering synergies from acquisitions, and now has high visibility from the Symbion purchase.
"
30,HIG,"""The highly fragmented ASC market presents a strong pipeline of bolt-on acquisition opportunities for Surgery Partners, which plans four facility acquisitions for 2016 and five for 2017,"" Morgan said.
"
31,HIG,"Part of Surgery Partners' growth trajectory is acquiring smaller facilities that it can convert from single specialty to multispecialty.
"
32,HIG,"Only 37% of the ASCs in the industry are multispecialty.
"
33,HIG,"Roughly 70% of its surgical facilities function as multispecialty centers, offering services in the areas of ophthalmology, gastrointestinal, pain management, orthopedic, ear, nose and throat, and general care. The company typically maintains a majority ownership, with an average equity stake of 57% in each facility.
"
34,HIG,"Going Outside The Box
"
35,HIG,"In addition to mergers, Surgery Partners is trying to provide a variety of ancillary services not available elsewhere. While many operators typically specialize in one health care area and provide no ancillary services to patients, Surgery Partners tries to separate itself on that front.
"
36,HIG,"While 90% of its revenue comes from surgeries, the remaining 10% comes from ancillary services such as diagnostic laboratory, physician practice management, anesthesia, urgent care, optical and specialty pharma services. Those ancillary services offer higher margins and are one of its growth catalysts.
"
37,HIG,"Another growth driver for the ASC industry is innovation in the health care sector, population growth and the government's medical overhaul.
"
38,HIG,"""There are more procedures that can be performed on an outpatient basis than ever before. Surgical advances, advances in anesthesiology, all those things are helping the size of the industry to grow,"" said Morgan.
"
39,HIG,"Cutting Costs
"
40,HIG,"Reimbursement is another driver, with consumers sharing more in health care costs. With overhead higher at hospitals, the overall procedure cost can become a smaller burden on patients as well as insurers by using ASCs.
"
41,HIG,"Surgery Partners takes that a step further. It typically uses two-way agreements between the company and the physician, thus bypassing hospitals completely and cutting extra fees. Physicians also get an equity stake in the business, another motivating factor to partner up with an ASC.
"
42,HIG,"""The company's centralized corporate infrastructure relieves physicians of the administrative and regulatory burdens that draw physicians' attention away from care delivery,"" Morgan said in a note.
"
43,HIG,"Finally, recent government medical changes have increased the number of those covered by insurance, explains Stifel's Vanacore.
"
44,HIG,"""Over the past two years, we've seen a lot of new volumes flowing through the system. If you were uninsured before, you probably weren't seeking any health care services,"" Vanacore said. ""Now you have some sort of insurance, so you're a higher utilizer of the system. So what we saw was increased volumes and better payer mix shift.""
"
45,HIG,"Surgery Partners was founded in 2004, but went public only a few months ago at $19 a share. Private equity firm HIG Capital owns about 54% of the company's stock.

97,HIG,"Canadian life insurer Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF  -  Free Report) estimates a reduction of $130 million in tax expenses owing to the new tax law. This will further boost the company’s net margin.President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. The tax reform policy, an overhaul of the tax code after 31 years, lowers the corporate tax burden to 21% from 35% this New Year onward. The $1.5 trillion tax cut will likely be conducive to economic growth. The tax reform, inclusive of the lower domestic tax rates on repatriation of income stashed offshore, will serve the foreign insurers well, who had earlier moved abroad  to avoid the high US taxation. Now the same companies might opt to return to the home turf courtesy of the new amended tax policy.However, due to reduced tax rates, insurers are writing down deferred tax assets that in turn will adversely impact their risk-based capitalization levels and also lower net income. Sun Life estimates a $200-million charge for the fourth quarter of 2017 due to U.S. corporate tax reform on actuarial liabilities, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities plus a one-time tax charge on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.Recently, Arch Capital Group Ltd. (ACGL  -  Free Report) expected to write down a portion of its deferred tax asset by about $15-$20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) announced that this rate cut is anticipated to affect its net deferred tax asset position and expects fourth-quarter results to witness a reduction of nearly $850 million. RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.’s (RNR  -  Free Report) write-down of its deferred tax assets will lower the net income by $40 million during the period wherein the tax bill will be enacted.Though this is an initial blow to be borne by the companies, the long-term effect however, remains attractive. This is because a lower tax rate will always lessen a company’s tax burden, aiding its margin expansion in the process as well as boosting the bottom line.  Shares of Sun Life have outperformed the industry in the last three months.  While the stock has gained 6.3%, the industry has increased 5.3%. The stock has also seen he Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved 1.7% north in the last 60 days.Sun Life is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 14. Though its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -1.24% makes surprise prediction inconclusive per our proven model as we always need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Nonetheless, the company’s concerted efforts to expand globally and thus intensifying its approach toward the Asian market, business mix changes and expansion of the Global Asset Management business should help it post solid numbers in the to-be-reported quarter.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

98,HIG,"Arch Capital Group Ltd (ACGL  -  Free Report) has announced estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as the impact of the recently revised tax cut.The company projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $60 million and $75 million for the period. The losses stemmed from wildfires of Northern California as well as other catastrophic events.Being a property and casualty insurer, Arch Capital could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Last quarter was also bruised by $319.8 million cat loss, having stemmed from a devastating hurricane activity; inducing an underwriting loss of $142.2 million. Combined ratio deteriorated 2430 basis points. Through the first nine months of 2017, the company’s underwriting income declined 26.3% from the same period in 2016.Among other property and casualty insurers, XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss of $250 million while RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe loss of $90 million from the California wildfires.President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. This resulted in slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective from January 2018 onward. As a result, Arch Capital expects to write down a portion of its deferred tax asset by about $15-$20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.Also, Arch Capital projects effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income between 17% and 20% for the fourth quarter. This, in turn, is likely to boost the bottom line.Recently, Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) announced that this rate cut is anticipated to affect its net deferred tax asset position, based on its current accounting guidance as well as net deferred tax assets at the end of the first nine months of 2017. This is also likely to hit its risk-based capitalization levels. The company expects fourth-quarter results to witness a reduction of nearly $850 million due to the impact of the tax cut.Shares of Arch Capital have lost 11.4% versus the industry’s increase of 8.3% since the onset of the fourth quarter of 2017. Nonetheless, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved north 1.3% over the last 30 days. Robust premium growth on a compelling product portfolio, expansion of U.S. Mortgage Insurance business, solid inorganic growth and a strong capital position should help the stock bounce back. Arch Capital carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 12. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.28 per share on revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting a 13.3% year-over-year bottom-line growth and an 11.7% increase in the company’s top line.  Our proven model shows that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter per an ideal combination of the two strong ingredients: a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +1.02%, which makes us confident of a likely positive earnings surprise.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

99,HIG,"The Hartford Financial ServicesGroup, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) recently estimated the impact of the recent U.S. corporate tax law and catastrophe losses on the financial results of fourth-quarter 2017, to be reported after the market closes on Feb 8, 2018.The company expects the results to witness a reduction of nearly $850 million due to the impact of tax cut and a decline of $117 million (after tax) owing to catastrophe losses.Tax-Cut ImpactPresident Donald Trump signed the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" into law on Dec 22, 2017, as a result of which, statutory tax rate slashed from 35% to 21% effective January 2018. Notably, this drop in business tax will likely be conducive to economic growth. However, insurers might have to endure some short-term pains before enjoying the benefits.Hartford expects this rate cut to affect its net deferred tax asset position based on its current accounting guidance and net deferred tax assets at the end of first nine months of 2017. This is also likely to hit its risk-based capitalization levels.Despite anticipating a reduction in the net deferred tax asset position, Hartford expects a net favorable future economic impact from both the lower corporate income tax rate and the repeal and refunding of the corporate alternative minimum tax credits.Although the near-term impact of this tax cut on insurers like The Hartford, Renaissance Holdings Ltd (RNR  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group, Inc (CNO  -  Free Report), MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) and many more is not all positive, the long-term effects would definitely be more attractive. A lower tax rate would favor the bottom line and aid margins directly. Apart from boosting margins, the tax-rate reduction will also make U.S. insurers more competitive globally.In addition, the tax reform, which includes lower domestic tax rates on repatriation of income stashed offshore, will well serve foreign insurers that moved abroad the profit generated in the United States to avoid tax.Impact From Catastrophe LossesBeing a property and casualty insurer, Hartford is substantially exposed to catastrophic events, which weigh on its underwriting results. In 2016, catastrophe losses of $416 million had increased 25% year over year largely due to higher losses from wind and hail events. Again for the first nine months of 2017, catastrophe losses totaled $657 million, up 85% year over year. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company expects to incur catastrophe losses of $117 million (after tax), primarily in the Personal Lines segment and from wildfires in California.Share Price PerformanceShares of Hartford have gained 13.1% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 10.6%.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHartford carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

(The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Quote Total operating revenues came in at $4.5 billion, up 9.7%. This upside was primarily caused by higher earned premiums and higher fee revenues, both on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly Segment ResultsProperty & CasualtyCommercial LineDuring the quarter, the segment’s total revenues were $1.9 billion, up 4.1% year over year.Net income of $286 million and core earnings of $282 million increased 8.3% and 3%, respectively, year over year.The segment’s underlying combined ratio was 93%, a deterioration of 480 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. This was primarily due to increase in the expense ratio, rise in the current accident year loss ratio before catastrophes, largely on higher workers' compensation and general liability losses, increase in policyholder dividends due to favorable workers’ compensation loss experience in the recent accident years, partly offset by an improvement in the commercial auto loss ratio.Personal LinesPersonal Lines total revenues were $1 billion, down 2.6% year over year.This segment generated net loss and core loss of $74 million and $46 million, respectively.

101,HIG,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing, with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 64.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry Sneak PeekThe insurance industry, as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third quarter. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide, estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017, reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Feb 8.American International Group Inc.

105,HIG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) has announced that it would sell its Talcott Resolution unit to a group of investors led by Cornell Capital LLC, Atlas Merchant Capital LLC, TRB Advisors LP, Global Atlantic Financial Group, Pine Brook and J. Safra Group.The deal worth $2.05 billion also involves an equity interest of Hartford Financial in the acquiring company that would allow it to participate in Talcott Resolution’s continued success. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and is presently subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.The company is assessing opportunities to deploy proceeds from the divesture. Presently, it expects to use around $400 million for debt repayment in addition to the $500 million it previously announced it would repay in 2018.This divestiture would complete its exit from the life and annuity business. The Talcott Resolution unit has remained a drag for quite some time owing to lowered earnings from divested businesses and continued run-off of the annuity block. Hartford Financial decided to offload annuities in 2012 after the business took a massive hit during the financial crisis. Continuing the previous trend, in the first nine months of 2017, the unit’s core earnings declined nearly 9.5% principally due to lower Limited Partnerships income and lower fee income with the runoff of the block.The divestiture would help the company to focus on growing market-leading core operations like Property and Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses. Hartford Financial expects an improvement in its future return-on-equity, earnings performance and financial flexibility. It further expects to receive $300 million in a pre-closing dividend from Talcott Resolution that will reduce the level of its long-term debt by $143 million. However, the company estimates a GAAP after-tax net loss of about $3.2 billion from the sale of Talcott Resolution that is expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.Year to date, shares of Hartford Financial have gained 18.6% while the Zacks Multi Line Insurance industry  rallied 11.2%. Management believes that the transaction would further instill shareholders’ confidence in the stock by boosting the company’s overall return-on-capital.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHartford Financial currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Radian Group Inc.

107,HIG,"MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG  -  Free Report) recently announced its June 2018 operating business statistics. Insurance in force was $200.7 billion, up 7.2% year over year. Delinquency loans (loans that failed to pay back) at MGIC Investment declined on a year-over-year basis. Delinquent inventory decreased 12.8% year over year to 36,037.MGIC Investment has been severely hit by the financial crisis in 2008.  Nonetheless, the company has been witnessing improvement in new business written owing to strengthening of purchase mortgage market, improving persistency and the company’s growing market share (measured by new insurance written). The company envisions 19-20% market share in the industry it operates in.Given the strong purchase market and potential share gain from Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the company anticipates writing $50 billion new insurance in 2018. Such level of new business combined with expected rise in persistency will lead to increased insurance in force for 2018. MGIC Investment is well-poised to benefit from improving housing market fundamentals.Also, considering the declining pattern of claim filings, we expect paid claims to further decline. Also, lower loss and claims will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and improve its financial profile.Shares of MGIC Investment have lost 4.8% in a year, wider than the industry’s decrease of 1.7%. We expect the improving housing market and the fall in delinquency to boost the company’s earnings in the coming quarters and help the shares retain momentum.MGIC Investment is set to report second-quarter results on Jul 19. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings is pegged at 35 cents, reflecting a year-over-year improvement of 12.9% on 1.7% higher revenues.

109,HIG,"A favorable operating environment has set the stage for insurers to perform well through the second half of 2018. Though macro factors like interest rate hike, trade tariffs, rise in oil prices and inflation rate should continue to render volatility in markets and sectors, the insurance industry is expected to push limits, banking on inherent strength cushioned by a beneficial operating environment.Driving ForcesStrengthening of the U.S. economy has propelled the Federal Reserve raise rate from its near-zero level. In its June meeting, Federal funds rate was projected at 2.4% for 2018. Though insurers have lowered their exposure to rate sensitive instrument, yet given the accelerated pace of rate hikes, they stand to benefit.Employment statistics instill optimism as a solid labor market reflecting lower unemployment level and higher wages increases the disposable income, thus widening scope for more policy writings. Fed officials anticipate a 3.8% unemployment rate while GDP is expected to grow 2.7% in 2018.Also, increased frequency of catastrophe events has impelled an increase in coverage policies.The tax rate overhaul, amounting to $1.5-trillion lower tax burden, slashed the rate to 21% from 35%. A lower tax incidence broadens chances of effective capital deployment as well as margin expansion. Insures have already started to see benefits of this lower tax incidence.  The first half of 2018 escaped the brutal blows of nature but given the unprecedented nature of catastrophes, none is sure what lies ahead. The second half of 2017 witnessed the merciless wrath of nature turning the year into the costliest phase in terms of catastrophe loss. While Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in August, Irma and Maria devastated parts of the United States in September. And further adding to the woes, were two consecutive earthquakes in Mexico in September. Also, there were California wildfires during October affecting many.Catastrophic occurrences weigh on insurers’ underwriting profitability. Nonetheless, price hikes by the industry players following a series of cat events, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and taking reinsurance covers should help insurers withstand the deficits.While greater demand for insurance (particularly with the emergence of new insurable risks including cyber threats) will keep the business of P&C insurers afloat, their willingness to negotiate on policy terms and ample capital strength will intensify the competition for grabbing a sizeable market share in the quarters ahead.Given an all-time high capital level, mergers and acquisitions are arresting attention of late. While these should help curb competition, consolidations should enhance insurers’ portfolio.Robust reserves, all-time high capital level, focus to boost the top line while improving the bottom line should help insurers emerge winners going ahead.Stocks Trading CheapYear to date, the insurance industry has declined 6.9% compared with the S&P 500 index’s gain of 2.6%.However, given a favorable operating backdrop and solid fundamentals of the industry, it seems apt to add insurance stocks to investors’ portfolio now as the valuation looks cheap now. Price-to-book ratio (P/BV), the most appropriate multiple for valuing insurers because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, is 2.15, lower than the S&P 500 index’s 3.85 as well as the Finance sector’s reading of 2.47.Stocks to Add to PortfolioWith the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we shortlisted an array of insurance stocks with a bullish Zacks Rank supported by upward estimate revisions over the last 60 days and an impressive Value Score of A or B.

110,HIG,"Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.’s (MMC  -  Free Report) subsidiary Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC (“MMA”) recently announced that it has closed the acquisition of Klein Agency, Inc., a St. Paul, MN-based surety and property/casualty agency with expertise in the field of construction activity. However, terms of this buyout were not disclosed.Klein Agency is a third-generation family-run entity with experience of more than 50 years. It helps construction companies with their surety bonding, personal and business insurance needs. The agency’s employees and the top brass will join Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC and would continue its operations outside Klein’s current office.With this transaction, MMA believes that its abilities will be expanded for delivering high-quality surety services to the exiting construction clients in Minnesota and upper Midwest.The unit also informed that it has purchased Insurance Associates, a Rockville, MD-based independent insurance agency, specialized in construction industry. Terms of this transaction were also kept under wraps.Insurance Associates has been providing commercial property/casualty insurance, surety and employee health and benefits solutions to clients across the Mid-Atlantic since 1956. With 59 personnel, the company operates out of four offices across Maryland in Rockville, Laurel and Towson apart from Fairfax, VA.MMA expects to penetrate into the greater Washington DC region and enhance its construction capabilities with the aid of Insurance Associates.Continuous acquisitions have always been a core growth strategy for Marsh and McLennan.

111,HIG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc (HIG  -  Free Report) is one of the major multi-line insurance and investment companies in the country. The shares of Hartford Financial have rallied nearly 39%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 27% in last one year. This reflects the company’s strong foothold in the property and casualty market.Interestingly, the company’s well-executed strategic dispositions of its legacy run-off businesses have improved its risk profile. Also, divesture of its non-core businesses along with strategic acquisitions and alliances have helped it to concentrate on its U.S. operations.Hartford Financial also displays intelligent capital management by regularly returning excess capital to shareholders via share buybacks and dividend payments.On the back of recent interest rate hikes, net investment income of the company started improving. In fact, it further increased 1% to $1.4 billion in first-half 2017 owing to higher investment income on Limited Partnerships.Additionally, Hartford Financial’s second-quarter 2017 earnings not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also grew year over years driven by a reduction in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.Nevertheless, being a property and casualty insurer, the company also remains exposed to numerous catastrophic events, which often results in earnings volatility.Its Personal lines segment has also incurred considerable amount of auto liability loss. Continuing the previous trend, the segment’s revenue declined 4% year over year in the first half of 2017. Also the Talcott Resolution segment has been a drag for quite some time. In the first half of 2017, the segment’s operating revenues also decreased 1.3% year over year.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s valuation looks expensive at the current level. Looking at the company’s trailing twelve months’ price-to-earnings ratio, investors may not want to pay any further premium. Currently, it has a one-year P/E ratio of 13.3, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 11.8.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks from the insurance industry include First American Corporation (FAF  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group, Inc.

112,HIG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted operating earnings of $1.04 per share. The figure not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents but also grew over three times from the previous quarter’s earnings of 31 cents. The upside was mainly driven by a reduction in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, which was a result of the company’s share repurchase program.However, Hartford Financial reported a net loss of $40 million in the second quarter that compares unfavorably with net income of $216 million in the last-year quarter.Total operating revenue of Hartford Financial came in at $4.77 billion, up 1.5% year over year. The top-line improvement was primarily driven by an increase in earned premiums and fee income, both on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly Segment ResultsProperty & Casualty (P&C):Commercial LineDuring the second quarter, Commercial Lines operating revenues were $2 billion, up 5.3% year over year.Commercial Lines net income of $258 million and core earnings of $238 million rose 9% and 8%, respectively, year over year due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net investment income on LPs (Limited Partnerships), partially offset by decreased current accident year underwriting results, excluding catastrophes.The Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio was 90.9%, a deterioration of 110 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to higher current accident year auto and property losses and higher expenses.Personal LinesPersonal Lines total revenue was $1 billion, down 4% year over year.Personal Lines net income of $24 million and core earnings of $20 million improved materially from a net loss of $50 million and a core loss of $52 million, respectively, year over year due to a favorable change in PYD, lower catastrophe losses and improved underlying underwriting results.The Personal Lines underlying combined ratio was 92.6%, an improvement of 160 bps from second-quarter 2016, driven by improved auto losses and lower expenses due to reduced AARP direct marketing and agency commissions. The improvement was, however, partially offset by higher Homeowners brand losses due to elevated non-catastrophe weather losses.Group Benefits:Group Benefits’ total revenue grew 1.4% to $925 million year over year.This segment generated net income of $69 million that increased 25% from second-quarter 2016 and core earnings rose 33% to $61 million year over year.

Core losses of $52 million increased 4% from the year-ago quarter due to the favorable impact on second-quarter 2016 insurance operating costs and other expenses of the reversal of a legal accrual. This was partially offset by lower interest expenses in second-quarter 2017 as a result of debt repayments over the past year.Hartford Financial Services Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

113,HIG,"The second-quarter earnings season is picking up pace with 26% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reporting quarterly numbers already. Per the latest second-quarter scorecard, the performance of 128 index members (accounting for 36.1% of the index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 7% on 4.2% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 77.3% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 70.3% outperforming on the top-line front. (For more information, please consult our Zacks Earnings Analysis).The Finance sector’s results (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) have not been very impressive, but aren’t too disappointing either. Of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index, 54.1% that have reported quarterly results show 7.4% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 82.9% for bottom line and 68.6% for top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The insurance industry is part of the broader Finance sector. Let’s see how the second quarter has turned up for insurers.Results of insurers exposed to catastrophe losses will witness a dent in underwriting margins on account of several catastrophe losses that occurred during the quarter under review. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Some insurers have estimated catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. projects $627 million (pre-tax) in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Another component of insurer’s top line, net investment income, has witnessed improvement, but still remains below historical levels, owing to still-low interest rates.Nevertheless, the recent increase in interest rates by the Fed should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should benefit from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Top line may also benefit from an improving economy and revived consumer sentiments which may lead to increased demand for insurance products.On the flip side, pricing woes linger. Insurers having fat capital reserves are fighting hard to gain business in a highly competitive environment and one of the most common ways to achieve underwriting targets is by lower pricing. Certain lines of insurance – commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability are mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, mergers and acquisitions and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase are like to benefit insurers.Let’s peek into these five insurance companies that are gearing up to report their second-quarter results on Jul 27.Aflac Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.63 is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The company will, however, incur high cost on account of its Japan branch conversion (read more: Will Changing Business Strategy Aid Aflac Q2 Earnings?).Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Aflac Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Aflac Incorporated QuoteThe Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

115,HIG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.(HIG  -  Free Report) will release first-quarter 2018 financial results on Apr 26, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.46%.  Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q1 ExpectationsHartford Financial’s Commercial Lines and Personal Auto businesses have been delivering strong results over the past many quarters. The company also expects a solid performance from the Commercial Lines in small and middle markets. Notably, these two segments have contributed substantially to the company’s top-line appreciation.Moreover, the company’s Group Benefit and Mutual Funds segments are likely to have delivered robust results, reflecting the company’s claims of improvements made in its book of business over the years.Additionally, the company’s strategic investment in products, distribution, data and analytics as well as digital capabilities, aimed at customer acquisition and retention, are estimated to boost revenue growth.Hartford Financial has also been enhancing shareholders value through frequent share repurchases, which might improve the bottom line in the first quarter, limiting the outstanding share count.However, higher auto loss costs are anticipated to have affected the underwriting margins, repeating the trend from the previous quarters.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hartford Financial is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Hartford Financial has an Earnings ESP of -1.29%.

Price and EPS Surprise The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Quote Zacks Rank: Hartford Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. Thus, this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies from the Finance sector that you may want to consider as these have the right combination of elements to  surpass estimates this time around:Aflac Incorporated (AFL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.73% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nasdaq, Inc.

(CNOB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company is set to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 25.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

117,HIG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc (HIG  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the U.S. group life and disability business of Aetna Inc. (AET  -  Free Report) for a cash consideration of $1.45 billion. The transaction is expected to culminate in November 2017.This buyout aims to expand Hartford Financial’s Group Benefits distribution capabilities and ramp up its technology strategy.Transaction DetailsThe purchase consideration of $1.45 billion comprises a ceding commission which will be paid by Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Company, the primary Group Benefits insurance operating subsidiary of Hartford Financial.The transaction also includes an exclusive, multi-year collaboration deal per which Aetna will be offering Hartford Financial’s group life and disability products through its medical sales team.Aetna’s book of group life and disability insurance, which had premiums of approximately $2 billion in 2016 will be reinsured by Hartford  Financial on an indemnity basis. Post takeover, most of the Aetna Group Insurance employees across the country will be transferred to Hartford Financial.    Financing the TransactionHartford Financial intends to finance the cash consideration by deploying dividends from its insurance affiliates and holding company resources, including $273 million under its 2017 share repurchase plan. The company does not expect any share repurchase authorization in 2018.Hartford Financial does not expect to issue any debt or equity for financing the buyout.Rationale of the TransactionThis transaction will help Hartford Financial to emerge as the second-largest group life and disability insurer. Group life and disability, banking on its stable risk profile, lucrative returns and strong long-term growth prospects, is a significant business for Hartford Financial.Joining forces with Aetna will strengthen Hartford Financial’s foothold as a leader in the large employer market and expand its presence among midsize employer clients. Moreover, Hartford Financial will be able to grab new opportunities to distribute complementary products to a customer base of more than 20 million to be insured by the combined business.This transaction will also be beneficial to both entities’ shareholders and customers, and help them focus in a personalized manner to improve member health. The transaction will be accretive to Hartford Financial’s 2018 earnings per share.With this acquisition, the acquirer will be able to leverage the industry-leading digital assets and an integrated absence management platform to improve customer experience.Aetna, on the other hand, intends to utilize the sale proceeds for various purposes, including but not restricted to internal investments, share repurchases and debt repayment. Though the transaction will not affect its 2017 bottom line, it will be slightly dilutive to the 2018 bottom line.Hartford Financial continues to utilize data and advanced analytics across workers’ compensation and disability to drive better results for clients across group life and disability lines. As the nation’s second-largest workers’ compensation insurer and group disability insurer, this buyout improves Hartford Financial’s competitive position in the market and enhances its capabilities for future product offerings in the line of absence management.A.M. Best Jumps Into ActionFollowing the announcement of the acquisition, A.M. Best commented that the credit ratings of Hartford Financial and its affiliates remain unchanged.The rating agency expects the financial leverage and coverage measures at the holding company to remain within levels that support the current ratings. Further, it expects the risk-adjusted capitalization of the entities to remain at adequate levels.Insurers Opting the Inorganic RouteMergers and acquisitions not only add capabilities to a portfolio but also expand geographical footprint of companies, thereby expanding their growth profile. Hence, acquisitions rage the insurance space. Earlier this month, White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (WTM  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a 50% stake in DavidShield to gain a premier spot in the accident and health insurance market. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (AJG  -  Free Report) recently acquired Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Reynolds & Rodar Insurance Group, Inc to expand its presence in New Mexico. Zacks Rank & Share Price MovementHartford Financial carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

119,HIG,"Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report) has recently joined forces with HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) to launch an integrated set of cyber risk management solutions for customers.  The new collaborative solution is expected to be launched in fall 2018. It will be initially offered directly by HP as well as through its channel partners in the United States. From next year onward, the solution will be available outside the U.S. too.What Does the Collaboration Offer?The offering includes hardware-level security protection, comprehensive risk assessment and remediation, rapid incident response and options for enhanced cyber insurance coverage. HP Device as a Service (DaaS), the main carrier of the solution provides multi-OS device management support to the businesses along with assistance of advanced analytics and proactive management capabilities. Aon's cybersecurity professionals will evaluate a company's cybersecurity status and provide suggestions to improve defenses with the help of Aon's proprietary assessment tool.HP DaaS enables businesses to provide employees with access to appropriate hardware, accessories and lifecycle services to counter the cyber threats. In addition, the chief solution provider's aid of analytics and proactive management service help proactively address security risks before the users’ performance gets affected.By providing admittance to Aon's comprehensive broking resources, HP DaaS and Aon's Cyber Resilience Evaluation jointly facilitate businesses to qualify for enhanced cyber insurance coverage. With the assurance of in-time support from Aon's incident response team, this joint effort further ensures best-in-class pricing and deductibles to manage the financial perils.  Need for the OfferingIn the continuously evolving platform of cyberattacks, the number of devices and operating systems used by enterprises is also drastically increasing. The failure to protect information of clients and customers costs insurers millions in terms of fines and other expenses. This not only hurts a company’s underwriting results but also induces loss.HP estimates that by 2020, there will be nine billion commercial devices worldwide with an average of four devices per user,  incurring extra costs and complexity for businesses. 82% of IT teams states that it's enormously challenging to secure data and devices within this environment.Management’s TakeManagement remains optimistic about the alliance with HP, which it believes to further bolster Aon's unique and industry-leading approach toward cyber risk management. It is of the opinion that the comprehensive solution would help organizations manage the technical aspects of endpoint security and business continuity. It is also expected to remain favorable toward overall security posture along with mitigating financial exposure.On the other hand, HP thinks that coupling Aon's expertise in cybersecurity capabilities and risk management solutions with its renowned security features and device management capabilities will successfully meet customer demand in the rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats.Initiatives by Other PlayersWith the rising cost of data breach, insurers are proactively adopting new technologies to protect their clients and customers.Earlier this month, leading insurance broker Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (WLTW  -  Free Report) a launched the latest version of its innovative Cyber Risk Profile Diagnostic tool, allowing organizations to identify and analyze risk prone areas of cyber exposure and vulnerability by measuring the respective current cyber maturity.Earlier this week, Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc (HIG  -  Free Report) also launched an admitted cyber liability product named CyberChoice First Response to address the cyberattacks suffered by the businesses.Share Price PerformanceAon’s relentless endeavors to ensure customer satisfaction have therefore helped it gain shareholders’ appreciation.

120,HIG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) has recently launched an admitted cyber liability product named, CyberChoice First Response to address the cyberattacks suffered by the businesses. This initiative comes with an objective to lower the damages caused to the company’s profitability and reputations due to a spate of cyberattacks.The New OfferingCyberChoice First Response helps businesses combat cyberattack challenges like data privacy and network security, media, ransomware and business interruption with complete opportunity of customization.

For customers, Hartford Financial offers a digital cyber risk management portal called The Hartford Cyber Center, which equips customers with tools, training materials and suggestions on best practices to mitigate the cyber intrusion risks.Rationale Behind the LaunchThe failure to protect information of the policyholders costs insurers millions in terms of fines and other costs. A report by Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) states that insurance companies experience 113 cyberattacks on an average every year with one out of three successfully inflicting serious data violation. This not only hurts a company’s underwriting results but also causes loss.Management at Hartford Financial believes that CyberChoice First Response is a comprehensive insurance solution to provide insurers and their clients with complete coverage on the rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats.The responsibility of the new product does not end once the claim is resolved but it also offers post-incident coverage to enable a business improve its overall security position prepared beforehand against possible cyberattacks.Initiatives by Other PlayersWith the average cost of a data breach exceeding $3 million, insurers are proactively adopting new technologies to protect their clients and customers.Earlier this April, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (WLTW  -  Free Report), a leading insurance broker, launched the latest version of its innovative Cyber Risk Profile Diagnostic tool, which allows organizations to identify and analyze risk prone areas of cyber exposure and vulnerability by measuring the respective current cyber maturity.Last December, American International Group, Inc.

(HIG  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 27, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company witnessed a negative earnings surprise of 1.96%.  Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing this QuarterWe expect Hartford Financial’s results to be supported by improved performance of its Personal Auto business.Commercial Lines in small and middle markets are likely to perform well, boosting both top-line and bottom-line, continuing the previous quarter’s trend.We also expect the Group Benefit and Mutual Funds segment to deliver a solid performance, reflecting the company’s claims expertise and the improvements made in its book of business over the years.Hartford Financial’s strategic investment in products, distribution, data and analytics, as well as digital capabilities, aimed at customer acquisition and retention, are likely to contribute to  revenue growth.The company is also expected to enhance shareholders’ value during the quarter through share repurchases, which might impact the bottom-line by limiting the outstanding share count.However, higher auto loss costs are expected to have adversely affected underwriting margins.In addition, as the company is a multi-line insurer, it incurs considerable catastrophe losses. This is also likely to adversely impact earnings in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hartford Financial is likely to beat on earnings in the quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Hartford Financial has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

125,HIG,"The insurance industry is well-poised for growth on a gradually stabilizing operating environment, Fed rate hikes and benefits of the tax overhaul. Taking these factors into consideration, it will be a prudent move to consider The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) stock seems a profitable stock to hold on to, given its underlying strength and good growth prospects.     The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 5.7% upward over the past 60 days, indicating analysts’ optimism about its earnings growth potential.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 2.5% in the past year against the industry’s decline of 4.1%.  Here are a few other factors that make the stock a good investment option.Top Line Regaining Growth Streak: We are encouraged by the company’s top line resuming its growth momentum since 2016. Prior to this, the metric witnessed a weakness for many  years. Going forward, we expect positive trends in revenues as the company is experiencing pricing trends in commercial lines and higher rates in property as well as liability lines.Strategic Initiatives: We view a number of favorable strategic initiatives, likely to improve the company’s risk profile from a number of well-executed tactical dispositions of its legacy run-off businesses.Some of these deals comprise the sell-off of its U.K. property & casualty run-off subsidiaries and the reinsurance deal with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.Earlier this year, the company acquired Aetna Inc’s U.S. group life and disability business to deepen and enhance its Group Benefits distribution capabilities as well as develop its technology platform. Last month, it completed the divestiture of its Talcott Resolution unit. This move would further help the company focus on the growing market-leading core operations like Property and Casualty, Group Benefits and Mutual Funds businesses.Improving Interest Rate: Hartford Financial’s net investment income is gradually increasing after having suffered on account of low interest rates from the past many years. Moving ahead, we expect investment results to improve on the back of an expected interest rate hike by the Fed. This in turn is expected to favor the company’s investment income in the coming quarters.Effective Capital Utilization: Hartford Financial’s capital appreciations, repayment of government funds and measures to de-risk its balance sheet have cemented its financial strength. It also has an intelligent capital management strategy, featuring share buybacks and dividend hikes. The company’s payout raise has witnessed a five-year CAGR of 20% and currently yields 1.9%, better than the industry average of 0.8%.Declining Debt Level:  Hartford Financial has also been successfully reducing its debt burden over the past several years. In the last four years (2012-2016), the company’s long-term leverage decreased by 33%. Although in 2017, the debt ratio had slightly inched up by 1.8%, the same declined 1.3% at first-quarter 2018 end.Hartford Financial’s efforts to improve its risk profile are likely to be effective going forward. The company is on track to lower its outstanding debt by about $320 million by the end of the second quarter and thus lower the average coupon rate and total annual fixed charges. A fall in the debt level will reduce the company’s interest expense by about $2 million before tax in the second quarter and then decline by an additional $8 million before tax per quarter from the third quarter onward.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space are Alleghany Corp. (Y  -  Free Report), HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) and NMI Holdings Inc. (NMIH  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Alleghany surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 17.6%.HCI Group beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 1.57%.NMI Holdings exceeded estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 24.6%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

126,HIG,"The rate hike announced in the recently concluded FOMC meeting comes as expected. With the latest raise of one-quarter percentage points at the last held FOMC meeting, the interest rate now stands at 2%. This decision was unanimously favored by all eight members of the regulatory body.In fact, the odds for four hikes this year has increased. Media reports stated that odds for December hike followed by the one likely in September, increased to 58%, up from 50% according to traders. Federal funds rate is now projected at 2.4%, up from March projection of 2.1%.For 2019, interest rate is estimated to be 3.1%, up from 2.9% projected at its May FOMC meeting while the same is expected to reach 3.4% at 2020 end.Major indexes, namely S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average have lost in yesterday’s trading session.Strengthening of the U.S. economy propelled the Federal Reserve’s rate raise from its near zero level. The recent increase marks the seventh hike since the financial crisis.The Fed also provided an optimistic unemployment outlook. Per Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment rate in May was 3.8%, lowest in 18 years.  Fed officials continue to expect the employment rate at 3.6% for 2018, 3.5% for both 2019 and 2020, down from 3.9% for 2018 and 2019, 4% for 2020 and 4.6% over the longer-term, predicted in its March 2018 FOMC meeting. However, 4.5% unemployment rate over the long run still remains so. A spurt in employment shows an average of 0.2 million jobs growth over the last three months.Encouraging economic data instills hopes. The Fed now estimates GDP to gain at 2.8% in 2018, up from the March forecast of 2.7%. Expectations thereafter remain in line with the March projections of 2.4% in 2019, 2% in 2020 and 1.8% over the long term.  However, inflation might remain slightly above the targeted 2% through 2020, though the same will stay at 2% thereafter. Inflation is estimated at 2.1% till 2020.Although an improving rate environment comes as a piece of good news for some, while for others, it descends as bad news. Capital intensive industries worry as cost of capital rises. Meanwhile, banks and insurers remain major beneficiaries of a rising rate environment because of their sensitivity to interest rates.With the progressing rate environment, investment income — an important component of insurers’ top line — is also exhibiting an upward trend. This apart, tax rate overhaul, advancing economy, encouraging employment data and stringent underwriting standards infuse confidence in the stock among investors.Insurance Stocks in FocusAmid an improving macro backdrop, investors always look eagerly to add stocks with strong fundamentals, which are likely to generate better yields.It’s an intimidating task to zero in on underpriced stocks with a high-growth offer.

127,HIG,"Credit rating giant Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.’s (HIG  -  Free Report) long-term debt ratings from senior to Baa 1 from Baa2. This followed the company’s announcement of its completion of Talcott Resolution’s sale to an investor group.The agency has also affirmed that its Prime-2 short term debt rating, A1 insurance financial strength ratings (IFS) of its principal US property/casualty insurance subsidiaries along with the A2 insurance financial strength rating of Hartford Life & Accident Insurance Company are unaffected. The outlook of the ratings remains stable.Ratings RepresentationThe upgrade of the property and casualty insurance leader’s long-term debt ratings by the credit rating agency shows its enhanced credit profile after the Talcott sale. The transaction has been able to ease organizational complications as well as decrease exposure to stress-case scenarios, which should fortify the company’s capital and earnings in the future.With increasing financial leverage due to the loss incurred from the sale of Talcott, the company’s management announced its intension to use $400 million of sale proceedings for additional debt repayment along with $500 million in previously announced debt clearances.The Hartford's Baa1 senior debt rating is a notch lower from the IFS ratings of the main operating units, which is largely driven by the A1 IFS rating of the P&C group.The factors that could probably lead to the company’s rating upgrade are the enhanced IFS ratings of lead operating P&C and/or life companies, a long-term decrease in gross underwriting leverage and the financial leverage in mid to low 20% range with restricted cash flow leverage of interest of 6x and above. Also, consistent returns on capital with reduced concentration on worker’s compensation might also influence this upside.On the flip side, factors leading to a downgrade include decline in the IFS ratings of the company’s leading operating P&C and/or life companies, restricted gross underwriting leverage more than 4.5x, decrease in shareholders’ equity, which is greater than 10% over a year’s time period, as well as the financial leverage, sustained above 30% with a cash flow coverage of 4x or lower level of interest.Sale of Talcott ResolutionThe company recently closed its Talcott Resolution sale, its run-off life and annuity business, for $2.05 billion to an investors’ group. The transaction was executed on May 31, 2018. It has also retained around $700 million in tax benefits. The new entity will operate under the name of Talcott Resolution.The sale enhanced the company’s flexibility as well as its business mix. However, the investment management team still maintains a five-year pact for managing a significant portion of its investment portfolio.The transaction was wrapped up through cash, pre-closing cash dividend, debt and a 9.7% ownership interest in the new company by the Hartford.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 6.15%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 2.36%. Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the multiline insurance sector are Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report), MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) and Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Cigna is a health services organization, providing insurance and related products and services in the United States and around the globe.

128,HIG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) (HIG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.9% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HIG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Hartford Financial's Q4 Earnings Surpass EstimatesHartford Financial reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted operating earnings of 81 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents by 9.46%. The bottom line also increased 5% year over year on lower share count.Total operating revenues came in at $4.5 billion, up 9.7%. This upside was primarily caused by higher earned premiums and higher fee revenues, both on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly Segment ResultsProperty & CasualtyCommercial LinesDuring the quarter, the segment’s total revenues were $1.9 billion, up 4.1% year over year.Net income of $286 million and core earnings of $282 million increased 8.3% and 3%, respectively, year over year.The segment’s underlying combined ratio was 93%, a deterioration of 480 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. This was primarily due to increase in the expense ratio, rise in the current accident year loss ratio before catastrophes, largely on higher workers' compensation and general liability losses, increase in policyholder dividends due to favorable workers’ compensation loss experience in the recent accident years, partly offset by an improvement in the commercial auto loss ratio.Personal LinesPersonal Lines total revenues were $1 billion, down 2.6% year over year.This segment generated net loss and core loss of $74 million and $46 million, respectively. Both the metrics were wider than the respective year-ago loss of $15 million and $14 million. This downside stemmed from higher current accident year catastrophe loss.Current accident year Personal Lines catastrophe loss totaled $200 million, stemming from the California wildfires.The Personal Lines underlying combined ratio improved of 870 bps from fourth-quarter 2016, owing to improvement in current accident year loss ratio before catastrophes.Group BenefitsGroup Benefits’ total revenues of $911 million increased 43% year over year.This segment generated net income and core earnings of $109 million and $67 million, up 73% and 14%, respectively from fourth-quarter 2016.The total loss ratio of 76.1% improved 60 bps over the year-earlier quarter. This was driven by improvement in the group disability loss ratio.Mutual FundsMutual Funds operating revenues grew 14.1% year over year to $210 million.Hartford Financial reported Mutual Funds net income and core earnings of $33 million and $37 million, rising 94% and 118%, respectively year over year, driven by state tax benefit and higher fee income.Average AUM increased 22% to $99.1 billion.CorporateThe Corporate segment recorded net loss of $4.1 billion against with net income of $13 million in a prior-year quarter. Core loss of $51 million compared favorably with the core loss of $57 million from the comparable quarter, last year.Financial UpdateBook value per share as of Dec 31, 2017 dropped 22% from Dec 31, 2016 to $35.29.Core earnings’ return on equity rose 150 bps to 6.7%.Share RepurchasesIn 2017, Hartford Financial repurchased 1 billion common shares and paid $341 million in dividends, returning $1.4 billion to shareholders.Business UpdateOn Dec 4, 2017, Hartford Financial announced a definitive agreement to sell Talcott Resolution, its life and annuity run-off business, which it expects to close by Jun 30, 2018.GuidanceCommercial Lines combined ratio is expected in the range of 93.0-95.5%. Personal Lines combined ratio is anticipated in the 96-98% band. P&C current accident year catastrophe loss ratio is estimated at about 3.6%. P&C net investment income is projected between $1,125 million and $1,175 million. Group Benefits net income is predicted between $275 million and $295 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended upward during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 6.2 % due to these changes.Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.

129,HIG,"China Life Insurance Co. Ltd (LFC  -  Free Report) continues to benefit from revenue growth backed by surging level of premiums, especially in its Life Insurance business.The recent interest rate hikes have aided China Life along with other companies like The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc (HIG  -  Free Report), CNO Financial Group, Inc (CNO  -  Free Report), Renaissance Holdings, Inc (RNR  -  Free Report) by boosting their investment results. In the first half of 2017, on the back of interest rate hikes, China Life increased its allocation in fixed income assets and increased equity investments.The company has the most extensive distribution and service network among all insurance companies operating in China. This helps China Life to better serve its  customer  through an operationally efficient value chain.In addition, constant product upgrades and new launches continue to help in sharpening its competitive edge.However, the company’s rising level of expenses continues to hurt its bottom line. The increasing expenses ares primarily due to rise in costs associated with health insurance, accident insurance business, investment contracts, higher policyholder dividends, underwriting and policy acquisition costs, finance costs and administrative expenses. The same trend continued in the first half of 2017 as well.Moreover, as most of the company’s investments are limited to China, it is highly exposed to market risks stemming from the economic downturn in the Chinese economy. Further, the investments outside the country are also exposed to foreign exchange risks and volatility in concerned markets.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.
