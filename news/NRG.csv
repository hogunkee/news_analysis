2,NRG,"Russian hackers are attacking critical U.S. infrastructure, including the energy grid, nuclear power plants, and airports, according to U.S. government officials.XWater processing plants are among the other targets being repeatedly tested by rolling attacks. Last year, more than a dozen power plants in seven states were breached due to Russia's ongoing campaign of cyberattacks.Energy Secretary Rick Perry told the House Appropriations Subcommittee Thursday cyberattacks are ""literally happening hundreds of thousands of times a day. ... The warfare that goes on in the cyberspace is real, it's serious, and we must lead the world.""Such attacks were cited as being one of the reasons the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals Thursday. In a doomsday scenario, such attacks could leave millions without water and electricity.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUtility giant Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) was up 2.1% on the stock market today. Duke Energy (DUK) rose 1.1%, Sempra Energy (SRE) 0.7%, Edison International (EIX) 1.8% and Southern Co. (SO) 0.6%.An alert issued by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI Thursday laid out in more detail what the Russians have been targeting, and how they are going about it.""Since at least March 2016, Russian government cyber actors ... targeted government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,"" the alert said.The techniques being employed include sending spear-phishing emails from compromised legitimate accounts, host-based exploitation and the targeting of industrial control system infrastructure.Russian operatives are also using the hacks for credentials gathering and open-source and network reconnaissance.While the alert did not disclose how successful the attacks were, it said hackers ""targeted small commercial facilities' networks where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks."" They also tried to hide their activities by creating new accounts on the staging targets to perform cleanup operations.While information theft was one of the goals, a key prize would have been gaining control of systems used by infrastructure. They could then launch attacks that could leave millions without water and power.An even more worrying prospect would be hackers gaining control of a nuclear power plant. A sudden shutdown can trigger safety systems designed to disperse excess heat and prevent a meltdown, though safety systems themselves may be vulnerable to attack. However, the operating systems used at such plants are usually decades-old legacy controls that cannot be exploited by hackers.The Department of Homeland Security previously said cyberattacks on critical infrastructure are ""one of the most serious national security challenges we must confront.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:As Trump Sanctions Putin's Russia, Will Dems Revert To Their Fallback Position — Appeasement?

Inflation could be too high or too low, she said.Blue chips were about evenly split among winners and losers.

The minutes also showed the committee considering to begin winding down the Fed's $4.5 trillion stockpile of bond holdings amassed in its monetary stimulus, but probably not until later in the year — a reprieve for those who had begun expecting some action as early as September.Investors liked what they heard, sending the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq sharply higher just after the release. That left the S&P 500 a breath below its prior high of 2405 set May 16. The Nasdaq and the Dow also held below their prior peaks.Goldman Sachs (GS) surged 2% to lead the Dow industrials. General Electric (GE) dropped 1.6% after Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said the company would need to cut deeper into costs to meet targets in its ambitious restructuring. Goldman Sachs rose close to its 10-week moving average. GE's loss snuffed a four-day bounce from a 52-week low.Financial software brand Intuit (INTU) easily topped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, up 7% after strong fiscal third-quarter results late Tuesday. The gap-up left shares extended above buy points of 127.74 and 128.55.Clinching the No. 2 and No. 3 slots on the S&P 500 were utilities NRG (NRG) and AES (AES), up 5.5% and 3%, respectively. Rallying utilities sometimes signal a defensive shift among institutional investors.Jewelers took some of the day's hardest hits. Tiffany (TIF) suffered a 9% drop after delivering mixed first-quarter results. Signet Jewelers (SIG), scheduled to report first-quarter results before Thursday's open, tanked 7%.Aircraft components maker Triumph Group (TGI) spiked 30.5% after a big fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat, although full-year revenue guidance was below the consensus view. The gain hoisted shares back above the stock's 10- and 40-week moving averages, ending 62% above an early-May low.Among IBD 50 stock's, Stamps.com (STMP) rallied 5% to close within 3% of a 136.10 buy point in a cup base. Dave & Buster's (PLAY) jumped nearly 3%, ending just below a 67.93 buy point in a three-weeks-tight pattern.Dycom (DY) was the day's distress story, unraveling nearly 18% on weak current-quarter guidance.RELATED:Fed Is In No Rush To Shrink Balance Sheet, Markets Exhale3 Stocks In Or Near Buy Range: Investing Action Plan

17,NRG,"As Super Bowl LI takes its place in the history books — climaxing with a 34-28 victory by the Tom Brady-led New England Patriots over the feisty Atlanta Falcons, settled abruptly in overtime as the Patriots notched the biggest come-from-behind rally in the NFL championship game's annals — the Patriots and the Falcons probably were not the only teams you had a rooting interest in. Through mutual funds in which you are a shareholder, you likely had a financial stake in the annual sports and advertising extravaganza.More than 10,000 mutual funds hold shares in at least six companies that ran television ads during the game in NRG Stadium in Houston, which was expected to be watched by more than 100 million viewers. The ranks of those funds include some of the biggest names in the industry. That puts the odds in your favor that a slice of your portfolio may gain value, depending on the impact of ads during the game. The odds go up that your portfolio will be impacted when the pool of mutual funds is expanded to account for ads before and after the game as well, and game-related ads in additional media.Advertisers ranged from the very familiar such as Budweiser beer, whose parent company is Anheuser Busch InBev (BUD), and carmaker Mercedes-Benz, owned by Daimler (DDAIF), to lesser-known enterprise software company Wix.com (WIX).IBD'S TAKE: IBD reported Thursday that German automaker Daimler said that its fourth-quarter net profit rose 18%, but the firm offered only modest guidance for future earnings as it gets ready to spend on new models and advanced technologies such as autonomous driving.InBev shares were down 16% over the past 12 months, going into Friday. But Daimler was up 8% in that period. And Wix shares had soared 159%.Mutual funds owning a piece of advertisers in the big game included $104 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), $82.2 billion American Funds Investment Company of America (AIVSX), $40.9 billion MFS Value (MEIAX), $16.7 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX), $13.1 billion JPMorgan U.S. Equity (JUEAX), $12 billion Franklin Growth (FKGRX) and $8.5 billion Hartford Capital Appreciation (ITHAX).Other funds with players in the ad contest: $7.5 billion MFS Total Return (MSFRX), $6.8 billion Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX), $5.7 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth (SBLGX), $4.8 billion Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value (GCMAX), $4.6 billion AMG Yacktman Focused (YAFFX) and $3.3 billion Alger Capital Appreciation (ALARX).Those funds are among the stock owners in six publicly traded companies that advertised on TV during the Super Bowl: Budweiser, Intel (INTC), Mercedes-Benz, Mountain Dew (PEP), Victoria's Secret (LB) and Wix.com.Intel shares are up 23% over the past 12 months. The stock has a decent 82 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.PepsiCo shares are up 6% in the past year. Performing dismally, L Brands stock is down 38% in the past year.Altogether, 10,898 mutual funds held stakes in those six companies or their corporate parents as of Dec. 31. Their positions in the six amounted to 2.49 billion shares.Mutual funds held just 1.3% of total shares in Budweiser owner Anheuser Busch InBev. Mutual funds owned 40.7% of Wix.com, an Israeli company that offers customers a web development platform.Mutual funds held 39.1% of the shares in Victoria's Secret parent L Brands, 34.8% of Intel, 31.7% of Mountain Dew parent PepsiCo and 26.6% of Mercedes driver Daimler's ADRs.Additional publicly traded TV advertisers during the game included Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAY)-owned Audi and Kia.RELATED:Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stock Gains In 20172017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market Review

18,NRG,"“Revolutionary.” “State of the art.” That was how President Obama described what would become the Ivanpah solar power plant in the Mojave Desert in a 2010 radio address.When Ivanpah started operations in 2014, the Department of Energy hailed its “innovative power-tower technology” and credited $1.6 billion in federal subsidized loans — as well as hundreds of millions in tax credits — for making the 4,000-acre solar plant a reality.It’s been pretty much downhill for Ivanpah ever since.The latest problem for the plant — which is owned by BrightSource Energy Inc., NRG Energy (NRG) and Alphabet Inc.’s Google (GOOGL) -- came last week when it literally set itself on fire.Unlike other solar power facilities, that use photovoltaic panels, Ivanpah relies on 173,500 computer-controlled mirrors that focus the sun’s heat onto water tanks atop three 452-feet tall towers. The heat boils the water, and the steam turns the turbines.Turns out, some of those mirrors got misaligned, and pointing their heat rays too low, setting one of the towers on fire on Friday, which forced the tower to shut down.Embarrassing as this is, it is arguably the least of Ivanpah’s problems.Back in March, the plant faced the possibility of being shut down because it wasn’t delivering enough electricity to PG&E (PGC) as contracted. Ivanpah operated at about 45% of promised capacity in 2015 and 67% last year.California’s Public Utilities Commission decided to give the plant another year to meet is contractual obligations to the utility. But even then, the cost of electricity produced by Ivanpah is much higher than that from natural gas or even photovoltaic solar systems.Not only has Ivanpah turned out to be far more expensive than other sources of energy, but it's less green than advertised.Last summer, PG&E paid close to $200 per megawatt-hour for electricity from the plant, at a time when natural gas-powered plants cost about $35 a megawatt-hour.And because it depends on natural gas to preheat the boilers, Ivanpah emits 46,000 tons of CO2 a year, enough to require the plant to participate in California’s carbon cap-and-trade program.So, what we have is a power plant that can’t meet its quota for energy production, that relies on conventional sources of energy to operate, that can set itself on fire, and that is far more costly than other sources of electricity, and that is sucking up taxpayer dollars in the process.This isn't revolutionary. This is just a classic example of industrial policy at work.RELATEDEnvironmentalists Fight Huge Solar Plant On Behalf of 100 SheepMassive Solar Power Plant Emits 46,000 Tons of CO2The Dark Side Of Solar Power

22,NRG,"Lots of stocks on Your Weekly Review are near buy points, but after filtering out those in late-stage bases and companies with mediocre earnings growth, few are left.The ones that pass the tests are worth further consideration. So here are five leading stocks whose earnings in the latest quarter topped 25% and whose bases are first- or second-stage:Monarch Casino & Resort (MCRI) is forming a cup-with-handle base with a buy point at 21.01. Its base undercut an August-October base, which reset the base count.The stock dropped out of this week's Weekly Review.Monarch, which operates casinos in Reno, Nev., and Black Hawk, Colo., is lagging other casino leading stocks such as Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS), which have properties in the fast-growing Macau gambling area of China.Electronics for Imaging (EFII) is breaking out of a flat base. Shares this week topped the 39.97 buy point in heavy trading, but a reversal Wednesday sent shares back below the buy point. The stock, though, is near the entry.The maker of specialized printers and printer technologies posted accelerating earnings gains of 10%, 27% and 39% in the most recent quarters. Analysts expect a modest 5% EPS gain for the fourth quarter, however.NRG Yield (NYLD) is finding support at the 10-week moving average and may be forming a base-on-base pattern. The alternative-energy company has an EPS Rating of 99.Altisource Portfolio Solutions (ASPS) is forming a flat base with a potential entry at 171.10.The financial services provider notched a Q3 earnings gain of 31% as revenue increased 46%.BofI Holding (BOFI) is shaping a flat base with a buy point at 82.37. Technically the stock is in a first-stage base, but it has made a major advance since 2012.The online banking firm recorded a 27% increase in profit in the September-ended quarter.
"
23,NRG,"No. 2 residential installer Sunrun (RUN) could fortify against top rival SolarCity (SCTY) by acquiring NRG Energy's (NRG) rooftop business, a Credit Suisse analyst suggested Monday. But both Sunrun and SolarCity stocks were torched by the analyst's estimate cuts.On the stock market today, SolarCity stock fell 2.5%, but Sunrun stock, down as much as 4.9% early, ended up 1.1%, at 7.97.SolarCity and Sunrun are slated to report Q1 earnings on May 9 and May 12, respectively. Installations appear to be tracking in line, but bookings are below guidance and will likely jeopardize the companies' respective 44% and 40% growth guidance, said Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin.Jobin cut his price targets on SolarCity and Sunrun stocks to 62 from 89, and to 18 from 21, respectively. In a research note, Jobin said he expects SolarCity to have installed 178 megawatts in Q1, up 18% year over year, vs. guidance for 180 MW.""We believe we are being very conservative, a necessary measure as the company has missed guidance (in) three of the last five quarters,"" he wrote.Jobin expects Sunrun to hit installation views for 56 MW, down 18% vs. the previous quarter, on the exclusion of 12 MW in Nevada. Nevada recently cut payments to solar customers for energy fed back into the grid, and it retroactively applied the new rules to existing customers, prodding solar companies to exit the state.That Nevada net-metering decision, complicated by ""regulatory flux"" -- California and Massachusetts' rule-making and the Investment Tax Credit extension -- is the likely culprit behind slow Q1 bookings, Jobin wrote.For Q1, the consensus of 17 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters tips SolarCity to report $108.5 million in sales, up 61% year over year, and a $2.34 per-share loss minus items, widening from a $1.52 loss in the year-earlier quarter.Three months ago, SolarCity guided to a $2.55-$2.65 per-share loss minus items.Sunrun is expected to report $83.4 million in sales and a 53-cent per-share loss minus items. Sales would fall 16% from Q4, and losses would deepen from a 15-cent loss in the prior quarter. Sunrun made its IPO last August.Jobin cut his U.S. 2016 residential demand to 3 gigawatts, up 45%. Of that, he expects SolarCity to install 1.2 GW, and Sunrun to install 271 MW.NRG could prove a wildcard, Jobin said. A deal with Sunrun would make sense, given the firm's platform model.""NRG's residential business has been earmarked for a change -- potentially an imminent sale or partnership,"" he wrote. ""Whatever happens will be critical, as it could enable a weaker player or strengthen an incumbent.""

24,NRG,"Stocks took a broad step higher Friday, giving the Nasdaq a narrow gap above its 200-day moving average.The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq climbed 0.8% each. Small-caps outpaced the general market, sending the Russell 2000 ahead 1.2%.The stock market today wrestled with mixed trade. Volume rose 7% on the NYSE, relative to action at the same time Thursday. But the Nasdaq's advance came in weak support, with volume slipping 7% below Thursday's morning levels.In economic news, the Commerce Department reported businesses saw wholesale inventories contract 0.5% in February. That was a faster decline than the 0.2% slip seen in January, and worse than the 0.2% decline expected by economist consensus.Oil futures accelerated their early advance, with West Texas intermediate surging more than 5% to above $39 a barrel. Prices may see some impact from the Baker Hughes (BHI) weekly rig count, due out at 1 p.m. ET.NRG Energy (NRG), Murphy Oil (MUR) and Chesapeake (CHK) were early gainers in the S&P 500.Nearly a third of the Dow stocks posted gains above 1%. American Express (AXP) topped the group with a 1.7% advance.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) popped almost 3% to lead the Nasdaq 100. News reports said the Netherlands-based chipmaker was considering a sale of its standard products business, possibly to a Chinese buyer. Other chipmakers also boosted the Nasdaq, with Micron Technologies (MU) and Qualcomm (QCOM) each rising nearly 2%.Retail stocks were in motion, both good and bad.IBD 50 stock Ulta Beauty (ULTA) cracked a new high, jumping almost 4% in powerful trade. That put the stock out of buy range, more than 6% above a 188.58 cup base buy point. Ulta announced late Thursday it joins the S&P 500 index after the close of trade April 15.Gap (GPS) crumbled 11% in early trade. The apparel retailer reported late Thursday its March same-store-sales fell 6% compared with a 2% gain a year ago. Sales have now declined for 12 straight months. The loss put shares down 17% for the week. Nordstom (JWN) appeared to catch some of the downdraft, falling 4% in heavy trade. 
"
25,NRG,"Bankruptcy clouds shadow SunEdison (SUNE) this week, ahead of a Wednesday deadline to file its annual 10-K or, say analysts, default on $725 million in second-lien loans -- an inferno, at least two analyst say, that ties back to its yieldcos TerraForm Power (TERP) and TerraForm Global (GLBL).Late Tuesday, reports surfaced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission might be probing SunEdison's liquidity stance. The Wall Street Journal reported that SEC investigators are examining how much cash SunEd had on hand last year.SunEdison stock plunged 55% in the stock market today on the investigation rumor, dipping to an all-time low below 1.""I'd say (SunEdison is) kind of on life support as we speak,"" S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino told IBD on Monday. ""We have absolutely no visibility into the financial outlook of the company. It's obviously very worrisome.""SunEdison last held an earnings call in November, about two weeks before it fired Carlos Domenech, SunEd executive vice president and CEO of both TerraForms. According to TerraForm Power's proxy statement, Domenech first initiated communications with Vivint Solar (VSLR).On July 20, SunEdison announced its plan to acquire residential solar installer Vivint. The deal briefly got a warm embrace on Wall Street, but shares of SunEdison and Vivint Solar have plummeted a respective 98% and 84% since then. In December, SunEd cut its bid on Vivint to reflect the drop in stock price, and this month Vivint scrapped its sale to SunEdison, citing financial concerns about the acquirer. A major TerraForm Power investor had been angling to block the deal as well. The transaction would have dropped Vivint Solar's 523-megawatt rooftop assets down to TerraForm Power.Since then, SunEdison delayed its annual 10-K financial statement on Feb. 29 and March 16, citing an ongoing investigation into its liquidity stance. The investigation arose from allegations by former and current executives of financial misconduct.Yield company TerraForm Power blamed SunEd for its own late 10-K. TerraForm Power is facing Nasdaq delisting as well as a potential slew of investor class action lawsuits related to the insider trading and fraud portions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. TerraForm Power stock, down 8% early Tuesday, rallied to rise 1.7%, to 8.61.Zino maintains his hold rating on SunEdison stock, but over the past week investment banks Cowen and Stifel Nicolaus have dropped their coverage on SunEdison stock.Nine months ago, SunEdison was a different company, Zino says. In June, SunEdison's assets were valuable, the company had ready access to the debt financing and equity markets, and could tap its healthy TerraForm yieldcos. A yieldco is created to house assets, generate on-tap cash flow and yield tax-free dividends. TerraForm Power filed its IPO in June 2014. NRG Energy (NRG) followed in May 2015 with a superior strategy, T-Rex Group CEO Benjamin Cohen told IBD.T-Rex Group is an analytics-based advisory group for renewable stocks. NRG Yield (NYLD) held 71% non-renewable assets in conjunction with 29% renewable assets -- balancing older profitable assets with newer and more quickly-depreciating renewable assets.By appearing less profitable overall, the yieldco can pay less in taxes, Cohen explained. It's a completely legal strategy -- and investors ate it up. Soon, the yieldcos were producing more cash than the parent company could invest.""So they had to invest in unsecured assets,"" namely the pre-development stages of projects already dropped into the yieldcos. ""They were overpaying for assets . . . and that risk drove up the price of the assets.""The bubble burst.Days after announcing its plan to acquire Vivint Solar, SunEdison's TerraForm Global filed its IPO and launched on Wall Street at 12.44, 17% below its 15 IPO price. Shares dove 19% Tuesday, to 2.03.SunEdison may be the ""public poster child"" for the yieldco bubble burst, but SunEd's downfall isn't indicative of the broader solar market and asset class, Cohen says.""This is the failure of a capital market vehicle, as opposed to the failure of an asset class or the failure of one particular company,"" he said. But, he acknowledged, SunEd was slugged particularly hard in the yieldco blast and investors are leery of ongoing financial storms.""Equity investors are discounting the value of SunEdison because management hasn't proved its ability to execute on its strategy,"" he said. ""It seems overdone.""NRG Yield stock is down nearly 50% since its peak near 28 last June. The First Solar (FSLR)-SunPower (SPWR) jointly-owned yieldco, 8point3 Energy Partners (CAFD), went public last June at 21 and closed Tuesday at 14.27, down 1.2%.July 20 proved to be SunEdison stock's recent high point, at 33.45. Shares have traded around 1 since February.SunEdison was targeting aggressive growth via M&A and aiming to use yieldcos TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global to help pay for its investments, Zino says. Debt financing was available but more difficult, he says, considering SunEd's heavily-leveraged balance sheet.Investors worried that SunEdison's Vivint Solar acquisition was too much, too fast. Then, TerraForm Global opened far below its IPO price.""The fact SunEdison didn't have a fallback, the fact they were getting too aggressive with these M&A deals was part of the reason we saw the investment community sell off on these yieldco vehicles,"" Zino said.He added: ""Once they weren't able to tap the yieldcos anymore, that's what really put SunEdison in the situation it's in today.""Now, SunEdison is struggling to shop its assets around to third-party developers. In June, SunEd's yieldcos would have bought those assets. Not now. And lacking newer financial statements, no bank will touch SunEd, Zino said.""Until they are able to get a resolution to the 10-K filing, we wouldn't expect to see anything come out of the debt market, and it becomes problematic for the third-party market as well,"" he said. ""It becomes difficult for utilities to invest in SunEdison if they have no idea of the type of financial situation SunEdison is in.""And SunEd certainly can't tap the equity market.Said Zino, ""a precipitous decline in the yieldco prices had a direct impact on SunEdison stock and, as a result, we saw billions and billions (of dollars) in equity value wiped out from the yieldcos and SunEdison together.""

27,NRG,"This week marked an important anniversary: The current bull market is now seven years old. That's many, many moons of watching stock indexes march higher and pocketing sizable returns on your hard-earned investments.Caution returned to the market in 2015, as the S&P 500 started to trade sideways. Stocks are taking a bit of a breather this year too. Perhaps you're in need of one too.So take a moment to catch up on ETF winners of the current bull market. As the table below shows, they span a host of asset classes, from financials and preferred stocks to retail and midcaps.The very top performer out of 1,646 nonleveraged ETFs is -- are you ready for this? -- Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Value (RPV), an ETF that targets the cheapest third of the S&P 500 index.A bull market brings to mind higher beta positions, with a stronger growth skew. Yet in the past seven years, the market has rewarded value-oriented characteristics slightly more so than growth, said Guggenheim managing director William Belden. That's helped RPV outperform.Value ETFs are generally considered to perform well over longer periods of time. ""Their greatest appeal is when the markets have gone both ways,"" Belden said.A closer look at RPV may be timely, as the market seems to have arrived at an inflection point for value stocks.RPV produced an average annual 30% return from March 10, 2009, to March 9, 2016. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gained an annualized 19% over the same period.SPY was also outpaced by Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), with an annual average return of 22.4%.For investors seeking to make a style-focused bet on the markets, six Guggenheim ETFs offer style purity. They invest in only those stocks in the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600 with the strongest value and growth characteristics.Traditional cap-weighted growth or value indexes generally have some overlap between growth and value stocks.Guggenheim's ""Pure Style ETFs"" avoid the muddle in the middle, as Belden likes to say. They also weight stocks by the strength of their growth or value characteristics.With $693.9 million in assets, RPV holds a mere 111 stocks from the S&P 500. They're selected based on metrics such as price-to-book, price-to-sales and price-to-earnings ratios.Top holdings now include electricity supplier NRG Energy (NRG), tech business HP Inc. (HPQ) and seeds processor Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan cautions that this is a risky ETF investing strategy.""The S&P 500 Pure Value Index was about 47% more volatile than the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 Value Index, which tracks the cheaper half of the S&P 500, during the past decade,"" he wrote in October 2015. ""It has also tended to underperform during market downturns.""Belden points out RPV has rewarded investors willing to take on a little higher volatility.""It has a good risk-adjusted profile,"" he said. The expense ratio is 0.35%.Most investors tend to combine RPV with an S&P 500 ETF such as SPY to overweight value stocks. But RPV can also be combined with its sibling Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) for broad and well-diversified exposure to large-cap stocks.Growth investing and value investing are generally seen as being in favor in alternating periods. But the ""Pure Growth"" and ""Pure Value"" strategies have the potential to outperform at the same time, according to Guggenheim.""The combination of both might be an attractive core position as opposed to one that's more tactically oriented,"" Belden said.It's worth noting that all six Guggenheim's ""Pure Style"" ETFs ranked in the 100 top-performing nonleveraged ETFs in this current bull market.Image at top provided by Shutterstock.

28,NRG,"Electricity provider NRG Energy (NRG) and coal producer Consol Energy (CNX) became the latest energy companies to scale back their dividends on Monday amid a massive commodity-price slump, while Signet Jewelers (SIG) raised its own dividend.Consol said that it would suspend its regular quarterly dividend after completing a $420 million deal to sell its Buchanan mine in Virginia and other coal reserves. The sale of those assets, to coal producer Coronado IV, is expected to close in the first quarter.The moves will help Consol pay off debt and are intended ""to further reflect the company's increased emphasis on growth,"" a Consol press release said.Consol shares closed up 10.1% in the stock market today.NRG Energy cut its yearly dividend by 12 cents a share to 58 cents per share after reporting a $6.4 billion net loss for last year.The dividend reduction ""will allow NRG to reallocate approximately $145 million annually and provides additional flexibility to create shareholder value through all commodity, credit and development cycles and seize market opportunities,"" the company said.NRG shares closed down 2.7%.Many companies in the energy and mining sector have pulled back on dividend payouts to prop up their finances following years of debt-financed expansion when commodity prices were higher.Oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy (CHK) said last month that it had suspended its quarterly preferred stock dividends, following similar plans from Linn Energy (LINE) and affiliate Linn (LNCO), announced last year, to suspend payouts.Signet Jewelers, meanwhile, OK'd an 18% boost in its quarterly cash dividend, to 26 cents per share from 22, for fiscal 2017's first quarter.Signet shares gapped up more than 9% after the company issued strong preliminary fourth-quarter results.

In afternoon trading on the stock market today, 8point3 stock was up 6%, near 15.50.But shares are down 9% for the year, and 8point3 was part of the yieldco downtrend in 2015 that also slammed Terraform Power, Terraform Global and NRG Yield. 8point3 stock began trading in June at 21, and closed the year 23% off its IPO price.For its fiscal Q4 ended Nov. 30, 8point3 reported $16.3 million CAFD, up 143% sequentially and beating the high-end of the company's guidance by $1.1 billion.Revenue of $4 million rose 29% sequentially but missed the consensus of 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $5.2 million, and also missed the company's guidance for $4.9 million to $5.1 million.During Q4, 8point3 distributed 22 cents per share, up 3.5% sequentially and in line with guidance.For the current quarter, 8point3 sees $14.5 million to $15.5 million CAFD, $6 million to $7 million in sales and another 22 cents distribution per share. Sequentially, CAFD would be down 8% and sales would be up 62.5% at the midpoints of guidance. The sales guide missed expectations for $11.3 million.8point3's fiscal Q1 will always be its smallest CAFD quarter, Boynton said.""December is the Winter Solstice, which is the shortest day of the year,"" he said. ""So our revenues rise and fall with the sun. ... The winter quarter is roughly 10% of the annual yield, so there is definitely seasonality to solar.""As a yield company, 8point3's objective is to generate free cash flow for shareholder distributions, Boynton said. The yieldco is structured so that distributions are tax-free until after a shareholder sells the stock.Wall Street is still coming around to the idea, he said. It's definitely not a day-trader's game, he says.""Some investors really understand why solar is lower risk (but) it's not really into Wall Street yet,"" he said. ""You put solar out there and it performs, it has very low risk. ... You typically don't have a lot of variability with the sun; it's not like the wind.""IBD's 22-company Energy-Solar industry group closed 2015 up 1%, but suffered peaks and valleys as Congress debated the Investment Tax Credit on solar and states tackled the net-metering issue. Although Congress extended the ITC in an 11th-hour deal, Nevada and Hawaii shut down their net-metering programs. SolarCity (SCTY) and Sunrun (RUN) exited Nevada.Oil prices, although unrelated to solar wares, played a part too, Boynton said.""In times like this when oil prices are down and volatility is up, I think investors have been running for cover,"" he said. ""Over time, they will see it really is a safe haven and that of the companies that are yield-oriented we are at the top of the class.""Shares of SunEdison's (SUNE) Terraform Power (TERP) and Terraform Global (GLBL), and NRG Energy's (NRG) NRG Yield (NYLD) exited 2015 slightly more haggard than 8point3 stock. Terraform Power stock closed the year down 57%, Terraform Global fell 63% off its IPO price and NRG Yield sliced 40% off its IPO.Boynton credits 8point3's dual sponsorship for its performance. During Q4, 8point3 completed its first drop-down project acquisition, a 20-megawatt Kern County School District project. The company's 432-MW initial portfolio is expected to generate $70 million in annual CAFD over the average 22-year contract term.""With two sponsors, we really don't have to raise money,"" he said. ""We have a very conservative structure and two sponsors who have long and distinctive track records.""

50,NRG," Stocks rallied across much of the session Friday, as a strong November jobs report overpowered a sharp pullback in oil prices and many energy stocks. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both popped 2.1%. Preliminary data showed those moves carrying in weak trade.The gains took back the losses from Thursday, triggered by a disappointing monetary policy decision from the European Central Bank.For the week, the results left the Nasdaq up 0.3%, while the S&P 500 was a fraction higher and back above its 200-day moving average.Before the open, the Labor Department's payroll report showed a bigger-than-expected jump in November payrolls, backing views that the economy is on an even and mending keel, appearing to clear the path for a Fed rate hike at the Dec. 15-16 meeting.The Dow ended Friday up 2.1%, unanimously positive. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) topped the index, each with 3% gains.Gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) led the S&P 500, up more than 9%. Troubled utility NRG (NRG) staked out the index's low end with an 18% decline.Among leaders, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) easily topped the IBD 50 list, surging 13% after posting strong Q3 results late Thursday. The gap-up gain snapped shares past an early 175.88 buy point in a three-month base. The stock ended less than 5% above the entry.Fellow IBD 50 stock Alaska Air (ALK) soared 5% in fast trade, marking a new high. The stock is still in buy range from the 82.88 buy point of a late-stage flat base initially cleared Wednesday. Hawaiian (HA) lifted 3%.China-based NetEase (NTES) also rocketed 5%, seizing a fresh high and ending 16% past a 154.62 buy point.Among new issues, Fitbit (FIT) jumped into action with a 10% surge in twice the usual pace. It rallied 14% for the week as it continues to move off its Nov. 23 intraday low. Fitbit shipped 4.7 million units worldwide in Q3 to remain the top vendor of wearables, which include smartwatches and fitness tracking devices, according to an IDC report released Thursday.For next week, the earnings calendar continues to lighten, with United Natural Foods (UNFI), Mattress Firm (MFRM), H&R Block (HRB) and HealthEquity (HQY) scheduled to report Monday. The economic calendar also gets a quiet start, with a speech by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard marking the high point for day.

70,NRG,"Canadian Solar (CSIQ) stock plunged 18% Wednesday after the solar panel maker revealed late Tuesday that market ""volatility"" might force the company to abandon its yieldco spinoff plans.The company also guided down for Q3, citing resources that may need to be held back should the yieldco ultimately launch. The yieldco is on track for late 2015 or early 2016, CEO Shawn Qu said during the Q2 earnings conference call.If its yieldco advances, Canadian Solar will join the ranks of several solar companies that have already done such dividend growth-oriented spinoffs that hold operating assets, including SunEdison (SUNE), NRG Energy (NRG), First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR).SunEdison was first to the yieldco model with its TerraForm Power (TERP) in July 2014. NRG followed with NRG Yield (NYLD) in May. First Solar and SunPower teamed up to create 8point3 Energy Partners (CAFD) in June.During Canadian Solar's Q2 earnings conference call, CFO Michael Potter acknowledged the volatility surrounding the yieldco market. In general, TerraForm, NRG Yield and 8point3 shares have largely declined since their IPOs.""We recognize that the market has recently experienced volatility around yieldco valuation,"" he said. ""As such we have alternative plans in place to a yieldco, if needed, to monetize our utility-scale solar power plant assets.""In lieu of a yieldco, Potter said, Canadian Solar could benefit from selling projects outright or finding a strategic partner.Mixed EarningsCanadian Solar's Q2 earnings were a mixed bag.In terms of revenue, the solar panel maker beat its year-earlier quarter and Wall Street's forecast with $636.7 million in sales, up 2% vs. Q2 2014.The company also announced earnings per share ex items of 31 cents, which beat the consensus forecast of 13 cents but fell short of the year-earlier quarter, when Canadian Solar posted 95 cents EPS.For Q3, Canadian Solar guided to a range of between $570 million to $620 million in revenue, which would be down 6.5% from Q2 at the midpoint.Analysts expressed concern over the floundering yieldco discussion.Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer lowered his price target on Canadian Solar stock to 40 from 45 and reiterated a buy rating. Like Potter, he noted the notoriously volatile solar market and rivals' recently struggling yieldcos.""The recent yieldco downward spiral does little to bolster sentiment or valuation around Canadian Solar's pending yieldco,"" he wrote in a research report. ""In fact, we question whether current investor demand for yieldcos will be enough for the company to go to market with a yieldco.""Paul Coster, a JPMorgan analyst, dropped his price target on Canadian Solar stock to 36 from 39 and reiterated his overweight rating. He, too, craved more information regarding the company's possible yieldco, which could ""provide a catalyst.""Canadian Solar stock closed at 20.20 Wednesday.Rival Trina Solar Also BeatsCanadian Solar rival Trina Solar (TSL) suffered a drop in the stock market today too. Trina Solar stock traded at a seven-month low, closing down 9% for the day at 9.40.Like Canadian Solar, Trina Solar bested Wall Street's forecast. In Q2, Trina Solar reported on Tuesday that it made $722.9 million in revenue, up 39.2% vs. Q2 2014. Earnings per American depositary share grew 200% from the year-earlier quarter to 42 cents, beating the consensus for 25 cents.Trina Solar didn't provide a financial outlook for Q3 but did hint that a downstream spinoff might be in the works. That spinoff would require a $1 billion investment, CFO Teresa Tan said during the Q2 earnings conference call.First, Trina Solar must weigh investors' interest, she said.""We need to evaluate not only the appetite from the investor perspective, but also the future financing options and possibilities for our downstream business as well,"" she said.S&P Capital analyst Angelo Zino maintained his 17 price target on Trina Solar stock and reiterated his buy rating.Zino noted Trina Solar's robust demand in China and other Asia-Pacific countries. In Q2, a record high 37% of the company's volume shipped to China, Tan said.""We look for global solar installations to increase at a modest pace and are encouraged by stabilization in module prices,"" Zino wrote in a research report. ""TSL's aggressive pricing and increasing conversion efficiencies will lead to market share gains.""However, Zino sees revenue growth slowing from 29% in 2014 to 16% in 2015 and down to 2.8% in 2016.Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov reiterated a market perform rating on Trina Solar stock, noting that ""what Trina delivered is a textbook beat-and-raise.""Still, he remained unsure of the profitability of Trina Solar's model.""The main concern that we have about Trina — and more broadly, the commodity module arena — is that this remains ... a commoditized, low-margin business,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Profitability metrics are choppy and not especially robust.""Connect with Allison Gatlin: Twitter | Facebook.

71,NRG,"SunEdison (SUNE) and Advanced Microgrid Solutions announced Wednesday a 50-megawatt solar energy storage deal that will supply power to Southern California Edison.

"
73,NRG,"Advanced Microgrid Solutions will develop storage systems in commercial and industrial buildings. Southern California Edison will use the battery storage systems to help shift electrical load during peak times. The utility also will use the electricity stored in the buildings to partially offset power once produced by the decommissioned San Onofre nuclear power plant and other soon-to-be retired gas-fired plants, SunEdison said.

112,NRG,"Solar-generated electricity is becoming cheaper than the grid in more cities, prompting residential solar installers to look for growth in more markets.Electricity from rooftop solar systems is now cheaper than local utility rates in 42 of the 50 U.S. largest cities, according to ""Going Solar in America,"" a report that North Carolina State University's College of Engineering released in January.Yet most folks still view solar as a ""technological luxury,"" says the report, by Jim Kennerly and Autumn Proudlove of the college's North Carolina Clean Energy Center.""In 46 of America's 50 largest cities, a fully financed, typically sized solar PV (photovoltaic) system is a better investment than the stock market, and in 42 of these cities, the same system already costs less than energy from a residential customer's local utility,"" said the report. ""Of the single-family homeowners in America's 50 largest cities, we estimate that 9.1 million already live in a city where solar costs less than their current utility rates if they bought a PV system outright — and nearly 21 million (93% of all estimated single-family homeowners in those cities) do if low-cost financing is available.""Neighbors Are Best 'Sellers'Solar companies are racing to get out that message. A separate report out this fall by researchers at the University of Connecticut and Yale University says that the No. 1 factor driving solar installations is whether neighbors are going solar.The growth potential is big.To date, a mere 0.3% of U.S. homes incorporate solar, says Andrew Pontti, a spokesman for San Francisco-based residential solar installer Sunrun.In January, SolarCity (SCTY) expanded into El Paso, Texas, where solar-powered electricity costs have fallen below local utility rates. SolarCity offers solar panel installation with no upfront costs and with monthly payments as low as $35, including design, installation, financing, insurance, monitoring and a performance guarantee.""We typically will expand into a new market when we can offer solar at a discount to utility rates at scale, not for just a few homes in perfect circumstances but to homeowners broadly,"" said SolarCity spokesman Jonathan Bass. ""Many people don't realize that costs have come down and financing options have expanded such that it's possible for millions of customers to pay less for solar electricity than they pay for power from utilities — from day one.""SolarCity expanded into western Massachusetts in December and is adding 20 new operations centers in seven states. It has partnered with more than 110 homebuilders to install solar in a dozen states.The past year, SolarCity has hired as many as 350 people per month across its 65 operations centers, Bass said.Vivint Solar (VSLR) expanded into Arizona this summer and hired about 100 employees for its two offices in Phoenix. The Utah-based residential installer has operations in seven states and Washington D.C. In Q3, it installed solar panels with more than twice the megawatts of panels installed in the previous three years combined.Vivint Solar plans to add 20 sales and operations offices in 2015.The NRG Home Solar unit of NRG Energy (NRG) says that within three years, solar will become competitive with utility rates in 17 states where NRG operates, vs. 10 states now.In July NRG Home Solar launched operations in Connecticut and four months later expanded operations in California with new offices in Merced and San Diego, adding about 175 employees. NRG Home Solar expects to install 250 megawatts of home solar systems this year, 875 MW in 2017 and 2,400 MW in 2022.Nationwide, solar industry employment soared 86% over the past five years, reaching 173,807 workers as of November, says the Solar Foundation industry group, which says that one of every 78 new U.S. jobs created over the past 12 months was in the solar industry.SunPower (SPWR) deployed 92 MW of residential solar in Q3, including 38 MW in North America, 42 MW in the Asia-Pacific region and 11 MW in Europe, company CFO Charles Boynton told IBD.A major factor spurring residential solar growth is how rapidly the costs have declined for rooftop photovoltaic solar systems, says North Carolina's Kennerly.Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory says the median cost of residential solar plummeted to $4.70 per watt in 2013 from $12 in 1998, thanks mostly to declines in manufacturing and PV hardware costs.In the U.S., solar companies installed 1,354 megawatts of solar systems in homes and business in Q3, in more than 49,000 installations, up 41% over Q3 2013, GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reported in December. The installations brought the cumulative solar PV capacity to 16.1 gigawatts, with nearly 600,000 U.S. homes and businesses having solar systems.For the first three quarters of 2014, solar represented 36% of the new electricity capacity that came online, up from 29% in 2013 and 9.6% in 2012, GTM Research and the SEIA report.One factor boosting U.S. projects, though, is a tax credit deadline. A 30% federal investment tax credit falls to 10% for commercial installations and to zero for residential at the end of 2016. The trade group Solar Energy Industries Association says the tax credit has been instrumental in boosting solar installation growth by a compound annual growth rate of 76% since it was implemented in 2006.The tax credit deadline isn't helping solar stocks, which await firmer footing and more profits before heating up. IBD's 20-company Energy-Solar industry group ranks just No. 167 out of 197 groups.Vivint stock debuted at 16 on Oct. 1, rose above 18 its first day and closed Wednesday at 8.53. But it could rise Thursday after posting its Q4 earning late Wednesday. SolarCity was a hot IPO in December 2012, peaked a year ago at 88 and closed Wednesday at 50.05.Deutsche Bank analyst Vishal Shah says that solar stocks have tumbled along with plummeting oil prices, but not because of souring prospects for residential solar companies. He's bullish, telling IBD, ""increasing parity will occur, and solar penetration rates are set to ramp up worldwide.""Less than 1% of the electricity generated in the U.S. and China relies on oil nowadays, he says, and less than 5% worldwide. So oil prices don't have a fundamental impact on solar demand, Shah says.More Options AvailableHe expects solar power system costs to fall 5% to 15% annually over the next three years, resulting in grid parity in roughly half of global target markets.Solar companies are spurring growth by providing homeowners with more options, including allowing those who don't want to own the system to lease the equipment, Raymond James analyst Carlos Newall told IBD. Others who want to own and are comfortable with a loan can get one, too.""This compares to the option of either using an auto loan to purchase a car or leasing it,"" Newall said.Solar companies also have been able to get more financing options of their own, thereby reducing the cost of capital and enabling them to cut operating costs and pass savings on to homeowners.With financing from several big financial institutions, SolarCity has amassed funds to finance more than $5 billion in solar projects, Bass said.SolarCity plans to cut its costs even further, following its acquisition last year of solar module maker Silevo. In September, it broke ground on a new 1 GW fabrication plant near Buffalo, N.Y.

156,NRG,"Government Failure: Another Obama green energy project is looking like it was wired up wrong. This time it's a giant mirror in the California desert. Its owners are now looking for a federal bailout to pay off their federal loan.The Ivanpah solar power facility in the Mojave Desert southwest of Las Vegas covers 4,000 acres and has 173,500 heliostats used to turn the sun's energy into electricity.It has the distinction of being the world's largest solar thermal power station, a headache for pilots who have been blinded by its bright reflective power, and an executioner of birds that have been scorched by the 1,000-degree heat it sends back toward the sky.Ivanpah also has the honor of being an enormous pain in the backside of taxpayers.The $2.2 billion project was built using a $1.6 billion federal construction loan. Supporters bragged that it would provide electricity to 140,000 California homes when working at full capacity. Its largest investor, NRG Energy, promoted Ivanpah as a source of ""clean energy"" that will remove ""400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year"" from the atmosphere, the equivalent of taking 72,000 vehicles off the road.The facility opened earlier this year to great praise, naturally, because we've been told over and again that green energy, such as solar power, is the future.But now its owners — NRG, Web giant Google and BrightSource Energy in Oakland, Calif. — are hoping to secure a $539 million federal grant to help pay off their $1.6 billion federal loan. That shows these moneyed companies have more brass than they do dollars.It shouldn't be too much to expect the owners to pay back their crony loan with the profits they make from their glorious project.But maybe that's the problem. They know it's a losing proposition, a toy with Solyndra-esque troubles, and there won't be enough revenue to repay the taxpayers.Simply put, Ivanpah has not delivered.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, it's produced only a quarter of the power it was promised to generate.This is the profound flaw with solar power. The sun doesn't always shine, and the electricity that is produced can't be stored for a cloudy day.Meanwhile, gas- and coal-fired power plants keep churning out cheap electricity. They don't need the sun to do their jobs. Or taxpayer subsidies.

189,NRG,"After re-emerging from bankruptcy in October 2012 as a smaller and leaner company, Dynegy is powering up again.The Houston-based independent power producer increased its capacity by around 50% in early December. That's when it acquired 4,000 additional megawatts of power through five coal-fired power plants in Illinois, bringing its total to more than 13,000 megawatts of power in six states.And it's looking to buy more. Still, what it owns today is a fraction of what it owned in its heyday, before Enron imploded in 2001 and caused credit to dry up and the industry to spiral downwards.Dynegy (DYN) logged nearly $1.5 billion in revenue in 2013, down from $42 billion in 2001.The company had previously owned power plants in about a dozen states and several foreign countries. It also ran gas-processing plants, pipelines, a utility and an energy-trading business.Dynegy stumbled from ""ill-timed strategic decisions and cratering power prices,"" Morningstar analyst Andrew Bischof said in a note.A Power ShiftIn 2011, the board hired Robert Flexon to lead restructuring efforts and then named him CEO. He previously worked as chief finance officer at utility operator UGI and NRG Energy (NRG), a much larger rival.Dynegy now provides wholesale power and capacity to utilities, cooperatives, municipalities and large industrial customers.The company owns nine coal plants in Illinois, including the five acquired in December from power company Ameren Corp. (AEE), which wanted out of the deregulated state of Illinois to focus more on its regulated businesses. But it was the kind of business Dynegy liked.""We felt we were in a position to operate them more effectively and efficiently since we have similar facilities also located in Illinois,"" said Katy Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Dynegy.Those acquired coal plants are broken out in financial reports as Illinois Power Holdings, or IPH.In California, Dynegy still has a natural-gas fired plant in Monterey County, Calif., and a small fuel-oil plant in Oakland. It recently retired an older natural gas-fired plant in Morro Bay, but is exploring renewable energy opportunities at the site. In the Northeast, it has three small natural gas fired plants — in upstate New York, Bangor, Me., and Reading, Pa.""Management has done a great job in fleet (plant) performance,"" Bischof said in a phone interview.In the first quarter, a key financial metric in Dynegy's industry, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped to $152 million from $43 million a year earlier. The gain was driven by improved spark spreads (a metric for estimating profitability) in the natural gas segment, higher energy prices for coal and the new IPH segment, with its five coal plants.Management kept adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2014 at $300-$350 million, even though executives have said they expect to exceed that forecast.Resources For RevenueThe company is currently in a ""sweet spot,"" Bischof said. Natural gas prices have risen to around $4, making cheaper coal ""more competitive."" Meanwhile, tougher environmental regulations have caused coal-plant closures. As coal capacity tightens, power prices rise.Dynegy gets paid for the electricity its plants generate and also for their capacity, or their ability to produce power when needed.Power companies are paid via regional transmission organizations that manage supply and demand. In Illinois, the company's dominant market, Dynegy is mostly paid by a system operator known as MISO.A year ago, the auction clearing price for capacity in the 2013-14 planning year was 3 cents per kilowatt per month, but this year in the annual MISO auction in mid-April the price spiked to 50 cents for the 2014-15 planning year. Planning years for MISO run June to May.The price jump ""serves as a signal that markets are tightening,"" Sullivan said. ""So we can enter into agreements with utilities or large industrial customers for higher prices.""Readying For Price HikesEven before the recent auction, in anticipation of higher prices, Dynegy had been entering into bilateral transactions as high as $2 to $2.50 per kilowatt per month for planning years from 2015 to 2019, she says.The transmission organization PJM Interconnection completed an auction last week that also resulted in sharply higher prices, increasing revenue potential for power companies in its covered region. Dynegy has a small portion of its assets under PJM's domain (one plant in northern Illinois and one near Reading, Pa.) but is interested in exporting some energy and capacity from MISO to PJM.Its IPH segment recently secured 240 megawatts of transmission into PJM, effective for the 2017/2018 planning year.Meanwhile, Dynegy is actively looking to gain more power via additional acquisitions. Since its hands are full managing plants in Illinois, they'll likely be in or near other areas where Dynegy operates.""There is a handful available or expected to be available over the next several months and we will evaluate those opportunities as they come to market,"" Sullivan said.In a note on May 8, UBS analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith said there's a ""50% deal probability"" with Duke Energy (DUK) and various co-owned Duke assets.Deal With Duke?Duke, the largest electric power holding company in the U.S., said in mid-February that it intended to exit its volatile Midwest commercial generation business, which includes ownership interest in 13 power plants. Eleven are in Ohio, one is in Illinois and one is in Pennsylvania.Dumoulin-Smith also sees potential candidates among many diversified utilities as they seek to reduce their exposure to commodity swings, as Ameren did with its Illinois coal plants.The five coal plants now in Dynegy's hands have necessary environmental controls, Sullivan says. But Dynegy is spending $250 million to finish a scrubber project at one to curb release of the pollutant sulfur dioxide, a regulated emission.The prior owner had already spent $250 million on the project, which is expected to be completed in 2019.""Regulations change and become stricter. To meet future compliance we have to make that investment,"" Sullivan said.Top executives were unavailable for comment. CEO Flexon said in a May 8 conference call that Dynegy is actively looking to make more acquisitions, but said he didn't expect a deal to close this year. The UBS analyst expects a deal to close in the first quarter of 2015, whether with Duke or another party.

225,NRG,"NextEra Energy, Inc’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, NextEra Energy Resources, recently announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report). Per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the partnership will acquire 300 megawatts (MW) of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, TX.Notably, in February 2018, the partnership struck a similar PPA worth 520 MW from two wind farms located in Texas and Oklahoma. Cumulatively, these two consecutive PPAs will deliver 820 MW of wind power, which will supply electricity to more than 372,000 homes per year.Economic Benefits of the PPAsPer management, these wind projects will bolster the overall economic growth of the states by boosting the employment rate. In particular, these projects will boost construction jobs by 1,000.Along with creating job opportunities, these projects are estimated to generate property tax revenues worth $190 million for local communities and lease payments of more than $167 million to landowners.Transition in Utility Space to RenewablesThe utility sector is currently undergoing a notable transition as the primary fuel source — coal — is gradually being replaced by natural gas and clean energy. Considering the need for a cleaner environment, consumers have rapidly increased the adoption of alternative energy sources nay renewables, over the last decade.Consequently, the outlook for the renewable energy industry is favorable. Evidently renewable energy sources are set to represent almost three quarters of the $10.2 trillion investment made worldwide  in new power-generating technology by 2040 (according to Bloomberg New Energy Outlook). To benefit from this rapidly expanding industry, utilities are increasingly shifting to renewables. NextEra Energy, being no exception, is following a similar trend.The company’s current renewal energy development program aims to bring 10,100-16,500 MW of new renewable projects (including wind repowering) online in the 2017-2020 period. Other electric utilities like NRG Energy Inc (NRG  -  Free Report) and Dominion Energy Inc (D  -  Free Report) are also focusing on cleaner sources to produce electricity.Why Wind?An EIA report shows that wind power generation will surpass hydroelectricity in 2018. Although changes in weather patterns affect wind generation, the forecast for wind power output is more dependent on the capacity and timing of new wind turbines coming online. In this line, EIA expects wind capacity to increase  by 8.3 GW in 2018 and 8 GW in 2019.According to the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017, demand for wind energy is likely to rise 7.2% by 2021. Meanwhile, the cost of wind turbines is the single largest component which makes up for 70% or more of the entire cost of a land-based wind project.Notably, wind turbine prices have fallen by around half since 2010. This has made the construction of wind power projects cheaper, thereby setting the stage for utility providers like NextEra Energy to make valuable investments in wind projects like the last one.   Zacks Rank & Price MovementNextEra Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.NextEra Energy’s shares have returned 12.9% in the past 12 months against the industry’s decline of 8.1%.

226,NRG,"The on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China took a new turn when President Trump imposed a fresh salvo of tariffs worth $50 billion on Chinese imports last week. This followed an immediate retaliation by China, which promised to match the scale of the trade restrictions on a vast array of U.S. goods. The flurry of events caused a mild slide in most of the benchmark indices as tensions brewed among the investor community.Although overall economic sentiments appear bullish with improving wages and promising labor market conditions prompting Fed to increase the interest rates, domestic trade concerns appear far from over and are likely to weigh on the equity markets.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm.

228,NRG,"CMS Energy Corp.’s (CMS  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Consumers Energy, recently announced the filing of an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). The crux of the plan is to reduce the company’s use of coal for generating electricity to null, by 2040.  Further, the proposed strategy includes Consumers Energy’s plans to fulfill Michigan’s growing energy demand through increased use of renewable resources and making its grids more energy efficient.Details of the PlanAs per the proposal, the company aims to increase renewable energy production from the current levels of 11% to 37% by 2030 and 43% by 2040. Further to meet its clean energy goal, it plans to reduce carbon emissions for electricity generation up to 80% by 2040. The proposition also includes shutting down of two aging coal-fired generating units at Karn Generating Complex in Hampton Township in 2023.Further, as per the plan, Consumers Energy would add 5,000 megawatt (MW) of solar energy throughout 2020’s, in addition to wind and battery storage. Per management, these efforts will help the company to reduce the state’s energy demand 22% by 2040 on heightened energy efficiency, owing to modernized grids. This will also benefit the customers by reducing their energy bills.CMS Energy’s Long-Term PlansWith the rise in the demand for renewable energy, several companies across the world are increasing their focus on energy efficiency and fossil fuel alternatives. CMS Energy is no exception in this regard, with the company focusing on effectively reducing its carbon footprint. We believe the latest proposal for increasing its renewable energy production is in sync with its agenda to provide a safer environment to its customers.In this regard, the company plans to bring online Phase III of the Cross Winds Energy Park in 2020, which will add another 76MW of clean energy in its production. Further, in the past five years, CMS Energy has taken a leadership position in reducing carbon emissions, water usage and saving landfill space. Till date, the company has successfully reduced carbon intensity by 38% and reduced water usage by 35% since 2005. It has also avoided over one million cubic yards of landfill disposal. This continued transformation to cleaner fuel sources is a major part of a long-term strategic commitment to protect the planet.It currently boasts of a strong capital expenditure plan for providing reliable services and infrastructural upgrades. Notably, it aims to invest nearly $18 billion during 2017-2026 for upgrading gas and electric infrastructure, and making significant renewable energy investments.The aforementioned plans along with the latest one will surely help CMS Energy in achieving its long-term goals, with respect to expanding its renewables portfolio, across Michigan.Price MovementCMS Energy’s stock has lost 10.4% in the last one year compared to the industry’s decrease of 9.7%.

229,NRG,"Dominion Energy, Inc.’s (D  -  Free Report) Atlantic Coast Pipeline recently hit a regulatory roadblock, as a few environmental groups filed a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to halt the natural gas pipeline’s construction.Environmental Safety is the Heart of the MatterThree environmental groups namely Sierra Club, the Defenders of Wildlife and the Virginia Wilderness Committee are the ones to oppose. They want construction work of the pipeline in West Virginia — which was authorized by FERC last month — to be stalled due to violation of the Endangered Species Act. The opponents claim that the federal appeals court refuted a required permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and allowed construction to proceed anyway. The environmental groups allege that the pipeline’s developer did not have a valid Incidental Take Statement, as the federal agency did not set specific limits on damage that can be done to endangered species during construction and operation of the pipeline.While the owners of the pipeline project deny that the court rulings debunk the Fish and Wildlife Service's approval, the environmentalists demand the construction to be suspended until a revised Incidental Take Statement is issued.The Mega $5 Billion Natural Gas Pipeline ProjectMaking good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending, President Trump signed an executive order in January 2017 to accelerate the environment review process and approvals for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. While the FERC greenlighted the pipeline project last November, it has been facing opposition on environmental, health and safety concerns.The project is a joint venture between Dominion Energy, Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Piedmont Natural Gas Company and Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report), with Dominion Resources being the majority stakeholder and chief operator of the pipeline.The 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline would transport gas from Marcellus and Utica shales to West Virginia, Virginia and eastern North Carolina. Evolving technologies like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing or fracking have led to a boom in natural gas production in the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The pipeline would transport around 1.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas per day to North Carolina and Virginia. Increasing pollution from coal-fired plants has sparked off new environmental regulations and a radical shift toward clean burning fuels like natural gas. As such, Dominion Energy, banking on booming demand for natural gas, has started to rev up its natural gas distribution infrastructure by investing in new pipelines and expanding the existing ones.The Atlantic Coast Pipeline project will not only contribute to lower greenhouse gas and other emissions, but also lead to creation of jobs as well as revenues for state and local governments throughout North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.Zacks Rank and A Key PickDominion Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Dominion Energy Inc.

230,NRG,"NRG Energy Inc (NRG  -  Free Report) and Cypress Creek Renewables will jointly develop a 25 megawatt (MW) solar project in Texas. Per the agreement, Cypress Creek Renewables will develop and operate the project. The clean energy produced from the project will allow NRG Energy to cater to the demand of its commercial and industrial customers.Details of the Innovative PlanElectricity is traditionally distributed to customers through grids. NRG Energy, under the new innovative plan, will provide dedicated and locally-sourced electricity from renewable resource to meet the demand of customers in Texas.Cypress Creek will own and operate the solar energy facilities and supply the electricity customers, per the power purchase agreements.NRG Energy’s financial strength and expertise will aid the swift development of the project and provide renewable energy solutions for commercial and industrial customers.Importance of RenewablesFossil fuel, primarily coal, was used to produce a major volume of electricity, leading to increasing emission levels. In the past few years, renewables have witnessed significant growth, courtesy of higher emphasis on emission reduction. In addition, declining costs of solar and wind technologies as well as federal tax credits have resulted in increasing usage of renewables in the total generation mix. Per the recent reports of U.S. Energy Information Administration, usage of renewables will increase 3.8% in 2018 and will rise 3% in 2019.Price PerformanceShares of NRG Energy have surged 103.5% against the industry’s decline of 9.0% in the last 12 months. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksNRG Energy sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

231,NRG,"Exelon Corporation (EXC  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary, Constellation, along with United Renewable Energy LLC have completed a 1.8 megawatt (MW) solar generation project located at Hunter Farms, in Jakin, GA.This solar project will consist of 5,305 photovoltaic panels fitted in a tracking solar array and operate under a 30-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), with Constellation selling all energy and environmental attributes to Georgia Power.Constellation is focused on expanding its renewable energy generation in Georgia. It presently owns and operates nearly 17.8 MW solar projects in Georgia. Last year, the company along with United Renewable Energy completed a 1 MW solar project in Georgia, and its entire production had been sold to Georgia Power under a 30-year PPA.Rising Importance of RenewablesDespite efforts from the new administration to safeguard interest of the coal-fired unit, it is quite clear that demand for coal as an energy source is on the decline, and the void will be filled up by natural gas and renewable sources.The latest report from U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) indicates that energy consumption from renewable sources will increase 3.8% to 11.431 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 2.9% to 11.766 quadrillion Btu in 2019. Per the EIA report, production from solar power will also increase 19.9% to 0.928 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 18% to 1.095 quadrillion Btu in 2019.Focus on Storage FacilitiesUtility space in the United States is evolving and its emphasis on renewable generation is quite evident. Since the renewable sources like solar and wind were not able to produce electricity 24x7 like the conventional fossil or nuclear power plants, it has become essential to develop battery storage facilities.Battery storage facilities store power produced from renewable sources and supply them to the grid when there is high demand. Battery storage will increase reliability of the entire power distribution operation and lower dependence on fossil-fuel generation.Exelon has also invested in the new energy storage technology through Volta Energy Technologies. In addition, other large utilities like American Electric Power (AEP  -  Free Report) and Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) have also invested to develop energy storage facilities.Per an EIA release, the United States had 742 MWh of energy in operational large-scale battery capacity at the end of 2017.  Given the increasing production from renewables and decreasing cost to install storage facilities, we expect more such facilities to come up in the United States.  Price MovementIn a year’s time, Exelon has returned 10.8% against its industry’s decline of 9.6%.Zacks Rank & Key PickExelon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is NRG Energy Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

232,NRG,"Hawaiian Electric Industries (HE  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary Pacific Current has entered into an agreement with ArcLight Capital Partners to buy Hamakua Energy Partners' 60-megawatt (MW) power plant on the Big Island, Hawaii.The plant currently has a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) with Hawaii Electric Light Co. (“HELCO”). Power produced from the plant is being sold to HELCO, a subsidiary of Hawaiian Electric. The handover of ownership will not impact the rates or the PPA, which expires in 2030.The current purchase consideration is kept under wraps. HELCO had made an offer to acquire the plant on December 2015 for $84.5 million. The application was denied by Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (“PUC”), stating that direct ownership of the plant will not benefit the customers.What This Acquisition EntailsThis indirect ownership when completed will further strengthen Hawaiian Electric operation in the State of Hawaii. Hawaiian Electric supplies electricity to 95% of the states’ population.In addition, this acquisition will help in realization of the company’s goal to generate 100% electricity from renewable sources in Hawaii.Our ViewHawaiian Electric continues making systematic investments in utility infrastructure development projects, primarily adding new generation facilities, replacing aging infrastructure and restoring transmission and distribution assets. The company plans to invest nearly $470 million in 2017 to further strengthen its operation.At present, the company is awaiting the PUC’s decision on its Power Supply Improvement Plans, which outlined a detailed five-year plan charting the near-term actions that will provide a foundation to meet its 100% renewable goal by 2045. This 60 MW power plant purchase will be a positive move in that direction.Price MovementIn the last month, shares of Hawaiian Electric have gained 0.5% against a decline of 1.2% of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderHawaiian Electric currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

233,NRG,"After weeks of shaky trading, the Wall Street continued its second-largest bull run, dodging the list of woes including geopolitical tension, Washington turmoil, elevated valuations, the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey & Irma as well as rounds of downbeat economic data.In particular, the S&P 500 is in the spotlight, with the index breaching the 2,500 milestone for the first time, bringing its year-to-date gains to nearly 12%. According to Bloomberg, this rally overtook the 266% increase in the index during the 1949-56 bull run and added almost $20 trillion to the value of American equities. The journey of 100 points came in less than four months, suggesting strong complacency in the stock market.Renewed hopes for Trump’s tax reform by the end of the year is the main catalyst in driving the stock market to new highs. Additionally, steady economic fundamentals and strong corporate earnings added to the strength.

234,NRG,"NiSource, Inc (NI  -  Free Report) announced its finance subsidiary, NiSource Finance Corp., has completed the sale of $750-million aggregate principal amount of 3.950% Notes due 2048.NiSource Finance, will utilize the proceeds from this offering to finance the capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. The balance proceeds could be used to repay short-term borrowings.NiSource’s Capital Expenditure PlanNiSource previously announced plans to make planned utility infrastructure investments of about $1.6-$1.7 billion in 2017 and has identified long-term infrastructure investments worth $30 billion, with over 90% of it allocated to regulated pipes and wires.In addition to the above actions, the company is also taking commendable steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emission to keep up with peers like Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report), Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report), NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report) etc. All of these companies are striving to bring down their carbon footprint.According to the projected figures, its coal usage is expected to drop to 42% of its generation mix by 2023, from the current level of 78%. The company will do the same by retrofitting emission control equipment in its existing coal plants, retiring old plants and replacing the coal fired units by renewable sources.Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) continues to execute its seven-year, $845 million gas infrastructure modernization program to further improve system reliability and safety. NIPSCO is also working to execute its seven-year electric infrastructure modernization program, which includes enhancements to its electric transmission and distribution system designed to further improve system safety and reliability.Rising Debt LevelNiSource’s long-term debt was $6,777.4 million for the period ended Jun 30, 2017, compared to $6,058.2 million for the period ended Dec 31, 2016.The rise in long-term debt level is a matter of concern as it can lead to rise in interest expense and can erode the company’s profit margin. This newly issued debt will increase interest expenditure by approximately $30 million.Interestingly, during the second quarter the company was able to successfully refinance about $1 billion of near-term maturity debt with lower-rate debt. This would help in saving a good amount on interest expense in the next few years. NiSource also expects that its strategic investments will allow the company to deliver its targeted earnings and dividend growth of 5-7% through 2020.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of NiSource have gained 15.3% outperforming the Zacks categorized industry's gain of 5.1%.This outperformance could be attributed to NiSource’s consistent investment to strengthen existing infrastructure and focus on clean energy.Zacks RankNiSource carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

235,NRG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (“PSE&G”), proposed to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“BPU”) for additional investment of $2.5 billion on Energy Strong Phase 2 project. Operations related to electric and gas improvements, worth $1.5-billion and $1 billion, respectively, are expected to start in March 2019 post BPU’s approval.Details of Energy Strong Phase 2PSE&G is planning to implement several infrastructural upgrades over the next five years.

The next phase of Energy Strong will play a vital role to lower weather impacts and frequent power outages.Bills to RiseThe company expects that the planned investment will modestly increase the monthly utility bill of its electric and natural gas customers. A typical residential electric customer, who uses 750 kilowatt-hours per summer month, will find its electricity bill to increase by $4 per month.A residential gas heating customer, who uses 165 therms in a winter month will find its gas bill to increase by $5 per month. Even with the expected increase, the utility bills will be lower than what was charged in 2010.Regular Investment Is EssentialUtility companies require regular capital investments to maintain, upgrade and expand their regulated infrastructure. These investments increase reliability of their services and allow them to withstand the challenges of weather and natural disasters.Public Service Enterprise Group is also strengthening its existing electric and natural gas systems to provide quality services to their customers in New Jersey.Price PerformancePublic Service Enterprise’s shares have returned 16.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 9.6% in the past year.

241,NRG,"The U.S. equity markets seem to be bracing up for another roller-coaster ride after President Donald Trump flip-flopped on his trade policy with China and renewed threats to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods to retaliate against unfair trade practices. The volte-face could derail the trade negotiations between the two warring countries, reducing United States’ negative balance of trade, as China vouched to counter the move with similar trade restrictions.Although overall markets recovered from a sudden steep sell-off triggered by Italy’s political crisis (which threatened the stability of the eurozone) as two anti-establishment parties renewed efforts to form a government, domestic trade concerns appear far from over.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.Why ROE?ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Screening ParametersIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm.

243,NRG,"PG&E Corporation’s (PCG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) recently announced its five-year sustainability plan that aims at reduction of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions from the company’s operations by 1 million tons, through 2022. This newly set goal promotes the company’s progress toward creating a sustainable energy future.A Brief Note on the Five-Year GoalIn particular, the five-year plan, known as the Million Ton Challenge, aims at reducing methane emissions from natural gas operations, increasing clean vehicles and fuels, adopting environmentally responsible products with focus on electric substation equipment, and making the existing facilities more energy efficient and sustainable.By a reduction of 10% in the greenhouse-gas emissions, the company successfully extends its ongoing sustainability efforts and continues to provide safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy options to its customers.Initiatives Undertaken Toward Goal AchievementCalifornia has mandated the state-based energy companies to reach 33% of retail electric deliveries from eligible renewable sources by the end of 2017 to 2020. PG&E Corporation already achieved the mandated target in 2017 when 33.1% of its electricity came from renewable resources. Furthermore, in the same year, nearly 80% of total electricity provided by the company came from carbon-free sources.Such achievements, along with the latest planned initiatives, should definitely pave the way for PG&E Corporation in reducing a million ton of greenhouse-gas emission by 2022.To further promote clean energy adoption, the company has increased its focus toward the adoption of electric vehicle (EV) to support clean transportation in California, via its targeted EV programs. In this context, PG&E Corporation plans on installing 7,500 EV chargers at various locations across Northern and Central California, through its EV Charge Network program.Looking ahead, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act has mandated electric utilities to deliver 50% of their total annual retail sales by the end of 2028 to 2030, increasing the 33% mandate. Considering the new policy, we may expect to witness similar initiatives from PG&E Corporation, in terms of further reduction of its GHG emissions, over the long run.Price MovementPG&E Corporation’s shares have lost 34% in the last 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 0.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksPG&E Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry include NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), Ameren Corporation (AEE  -  Free Report) and Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.

244,NRG,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) announced that its subsidiary — Duke Energy Renewables — has finalized the acquisition of the Shoreham Solar Commons project from Invenergy. Located in Brookhaven, NY, the facility is one of the largest solar projects in New York and has a capacity to generate 24.9 megawatts (MW) of solar power.With this buyout, Duke Energy’s renewables business has set foot in New York, thereby expanding its footprint across 14 states of America. The facility came online on Jul 1, in sync with the company’s expectation to commence the project by second-quarter 2018. Duke Energy is selling the power generated from this facility to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) under a 20-year purchase power agreement (PPA).Benefits of the Project The Shoreham Solar Commons project is anticipated to generate annual tax revenues in the $0.7-$0.9 million range. Annually, the energy produced by this facility is expected to displace 29,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions and create nearly 1 million MW-hours (MWh) of clean energy over its lifetime.Moreover, the fact that this solar facility has been constructed on the grounds of a former golf course will eliminate the use of pesticides and fertilizers on the property. This, in turn, will protect Long Island's fresh water aquifer.Increasing Demand for Solar EnergyScientists are increasingly growing conscious about fossil fuel-fired energy generation and its consequences. According to them, greenhouse gases are causing global climate change and subsequent environmental hazards. As a result, renewable energies are increasingly gaining traction across the globe. A key area in the renewable space is solar energy.Now coming to the U.S. renewables industry, per the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report electricity generation from solar resources in the United States reached 77 million MWh in 2017. With this, solar energy surpassed annual generation from biomass resources for the first time, making it the third-most prevalent renewable electricity source in the nation, after hydro and wind. Going ahead, solar power generation is anticipated to increase 19.9% to 0.928 quadrillion Btu in 2018 and 18% to 1.095 quadrillion Btu in 2019. Such developments and projections surely reflect growth prospects for solar energy generation in the United States. This, in turn, should prompt companies like Duke Energy that are expanding their solar assets.What’s Ahead for Duke Energy?Realizing the expanding market for green energy, the company has invested more than $5 billion since 2007. Duke Energy intends to invest $11 billion to generate energy through renewables and natural gas as it moves to a low-carbon future. By retiring coal plants and adopting more natural gas and renewables, the company has already reduced its carbon emissions by nearly 30 % since 2005. In fact, the company has set a new goal to reduce its carbon emissions by 40% from the 2005 level by 2030. On completion of the Shoreham Solar Commons project’s acquisition, we believe that the company will move a step forward toward achieving this goal.As far as the solar market’s expansion in New York is concerned, one can conclude that the city is making a rapid progress in adopting solar energy as a desired option for its citizens’ electricity generation. In February 2018, New York’s governor announced that solar power therein increased more than 1,000% from December 2011 to December 2017, leveraging more than $2.8 billion in private investment into New York's growing clean energy economy. Notably, such huge investment came as part of the Governor's mandate that half of all electricity consumed by New Yorkers should come from renewable energy sources by 2030.Considering the fact, that the Governor is aiming to make New York as one of the national leaders in clean energy growth, there is an immense opportunity of solar power installation in New York. In this line, we expect Duke Energy to make more investments in the city’s solar facilities, in days ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Duke Energy has lost 4.4% compared with the industry’s 0.9% decline. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that the company is facing.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are NRG Energy, Inc.

245,NRG,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) recently announced that the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 93 cents per share on its common stock. This would mark a quarterly increase of 3.75 cents or 4.2%.Per the company, the dividend will be payable on Sep 17, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Aug 17. The estimated annual yield on the dividend is 4.3%.Regular Distribution HikesDuke Energy has been raising its cash dividend per share every year and this is the 92nd consecutive year, in which the company has continued with the same trend. In July 2017, Duke Energy announced a quarterly cash dividend increase of 4.1% on its common stock.Duke Energy has a stable dividend payment history. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalent worth $421 million compared with  $358 million as of Dec 31, 2017. The company has maintained its record of increasing its quarterly dividend rate every year since January 2007 on the basis of its growing financial strength.In the first quarter of 2018, Duke Energy paid dividend worth $599 million to its shareholders, almost in line with the payment in the year-ago quarter. It continues to target annual growth in dividend, while being consistent with its long-term 4%–6% earnings growth rate. Through 2022, the company is focused to maintain its long-term dividend payout ratio in the range of 70%–75% of its adjusted earnings per share.Factors Supporting Regular Dividend HikeDuke Energy has been making capital investments in its infrastructure and expansion projects across its service territories. Per its long-term plans, the company aims to spend $30 billion for electric utilities and infrastructure, and also reduce its capital expenditures by approximately $1 billion for the 2018–2022 period. These investments are expected to drive the company’s earnings base growth in the combined electric and gas businesses by approximately 6% over the next five years.The company’s additional generation projects, such as dual-fuel capabilities, and combined heat and power facilities to increase the flexibility of its system, are likely to boost its performance in the time ahead.Notably, we believe that such planned investments along with significant growth initiatives will enable the company duly achieve its long-term investment targets and in turn improve its shareholder value through such regular dividend hikes.Price MovementDuke Energy has lost 1.9% in the last 12 months against the industry’s growth of 1%. The underperformance may have been caused by the potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities that the company faces.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDuke Energy currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per an Energy Information Administration (EIA) report, total renewable energy consumption will increase 3.8% to 11.431 quadrillion btu in 2018 from the prior-year level. Higher utilization of renewable sources will reduce coal usage for electricity generation and lower emission.Many electric utility companies are investing or making agreements to increase the usage of alternate energy sources to generate power. Recently, NextEra Energy’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary — NextEra Energy Resources — announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) to acquire 300 MW of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, Texas.

248,NRG,"Investors in NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 15, 2017 $14.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NRG Energy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NRG Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 36% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.18 per share to $1.05 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NRG Energy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

250,NRG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, NRG Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.10, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.06. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, NRG Energy’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 17.22. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that NRG Energy has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 38.19, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for NRG Energy stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, NRG Energy has a P/S ratio of about 0.62. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.24 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, NRG Energy currently has a Value Style Score of ‘B’, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes NRG Energy a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though NRG Energy might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of ‘C’ and a Momentum score of ‘B’. This gives NRG a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of ‘B’. (You can read more about the Style Scores here >>) Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen one up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 13.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has moved up by 26%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:NRG Energy, Inc. Price and Consensus  NRG Energy, Inc. Price and Consensus | NRG Energy, Inc. QuoteEven though NRG Energy has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineNRG Energy is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.This proven stock-picking system is grounded on a single big idea that can be fortune shaping and life changing.

Revenues were $2,818 million in the quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,740 million by 2.8%. Higher electric sales volumes drove the company’s top line.However, stringent environmental regulations and fluctuations in commodity prices are growth deterrents.In a year’s time, the stock has gained 18.5% against the industry’s decline of 5.7%. What’s Driving Public Service Enterprise?Public Service Enterprise strives to optimize generation margins by improving cost structure and performance. Low-cost nuclear fleet and expanding generating capacity from renewable sources is expected to drive earnings.

259,NRG,"Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on July 27. Last quarter, this public utility company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe sign of economic improvement is prominent across Xcel Energy’s service territories, especially in Minnesota, compared with the nation as a whole. The consolidated unemployment rate in the company’s service territory was 3.2% in Dec, 2016, lower than the nation’s average of 4.7%.The optimism in the market continues to drive the company’s sales and is likely to boost top line in the second quarter.Additionally, the company has seen a consistent rise in the number of customers over the last few quarters. We expect this trend to continue in second quarter as well boosting its earnings.However, rising debt level remains a matter of concern for the company. Xcel Energy’s debt/capital ratio stands at 55.3% compared with the industry’s average of 49.7% and the S&P 500’s level of 41.9%. Moreover, the company’s current ratio stands at 0.71, so the rising interest rates do not bode well for Xcel Energy. This is because the resulting increase in cost of capital will escalate cost of operations, thereby denting its margins.Xcel Energy Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Xcel Energy Inc.

260,NRG,"Southern Company’s (SO  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Southern Power recently inked a deal to divest 33% stake in its solar portfolio, in a bid to further trim its debt woes. With demand of renewable energy picking up, Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd. — a retirement, life and reinsurance company — will be acquiring one-third stake of Southern Power’s solar assets for a total consideration of $1.175 billion. Per the deal, Southern Power will be the general partner in the partnership, being the chief operator of the projects.The acquired assets comprise 26 operating solar plants having 1.7 gigawatts of capacity that is sold to valued customers across the country under long-term contracts. These plants are spread across California, Georgia, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina and Texas, with the maximum number of projects in California and Georgia.Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Southern Company have moved up more than 1% to eventually close at $43.99 on May 23. In fact, shares of the company have been witnessing a steady increase since the last three days, on announcement of the $6.5 billion divestment deal with the U.S.-based wholesale electricity supplier, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) on May 21.Notably, the power giant Southern Company, which spent around $12 billion for the AGL Resources buyout in 2016 to expand and diversify its offerings, is heading toward the retrenchment road, weighed by its financial struggles. As of Mar 31, the company’s long-term debt stood at $44.4 billion, representing a debt-to-capital ratio of more than 63%.These divestment deals are likely to be a prudent strategy for Southern Company, which is grappling with elevated leverage along with cost overruns in two of its large construction projects, Vogtle and Kemper. These sale agreements will help Southern Company to streamline its portfolio, boost utility returns, along with raise cash to repay debts and pay for the new reactors for its Vogtle Project.

261,NRG,"When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits, one should explore another time-tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks. Translated, one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.At the core, momentum investing is buying high, selling higher. It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction than move against the drift. Thus, this strategy calls for hitching a ride on an already fast-moving train, without fretting about valuations or growth prospects. But why does the momentum strategy work?There is a simple reason behind this. It works because we are humans!There’s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases which most investors exhibit, and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason why momentum strategy works. For instance, there are investors who are anxious about booking losses and hence, hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in the prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early.Furthermore, investors initially tend to under-react to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they tend to go with the flow and overreact, causing dramatic price reactions.These behavioral problems extend trends, and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players. So basically, it’s a way to benefit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future.Momentum investing is, thus, based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs, i.e. before prices become rational again.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period of time and across market stages. So obviously, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price, which reflects some profit-taking in the stock.Screening ParametersPercentage Change Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This item selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get stocks which have appreciated the maximum over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.Zacks Rank #1: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors, including volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000, in terms of market value to ensure strong liquidity.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are four of the eight stocks that made it through this screen:Weight Watchers International, Inc.

262,NRG,"Ameren Corporation’s (AEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Ameren Missouri, recently announced that it has signed an agreement for acquiring a 400-megawatt (MW) wind farm in northeast Missouri. Notably, Ameren Missouri will purchase the farm following its construction.The transaction seems to be in line with the company’s goal to reduce carbon emissions up to 80% by 2050.Details of the AgreementThe wind farm will consist of 175 technologically-advanced wind turbines and electricity generated from these turbines will be sufficient enough to power an estimated 120,000 homes by 2020. Post construction, the wind farm will become the largest wind energy provider in Missouri.The transaction still remains subjected to a number of regulatory conditions, while the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Benefits of the BuyoutAmeren Missouri’s 20-year outlook plan pledges to expand clean energy in Missouri and possibly neighboring states with an investment of $1 billion in new wind generation projects. This venture is expected to produce at least 700 MW of new wind-generated energy by 2020. Impressively, Ameren’s latest buyout of the wind farm will enable the company to meet 50% of this planned capacity.Moreover, the company’s Mark Twain Transmission Project, which got the regulatory go-ahead this January, will aid the wind farm to distribute energy more seamlessly in Missouri with the former’s expanded transmission capacity. Indeed, energy from the new wind farm, together with the new transmission lines of the Mark Twain project, will enable Ameren to deliver greater energy reliability, economic growth and better access to clean energy sources to the residents of Missouri.Our ViewWind energy is one of the fastest growing forms of electricity generation from clean energy in the United States and thereby, plays a pivotal role in the country’s rapid expansion of low-carbon electricity generation. The U.S. wind power industry had a strong finish to 2017, with 7,017 MW of new wind capacity installed in the country, representing $11 billion in new private investment, as per a report published by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).Moreover, the pipeline of wind farms under construction or in advanced development totals 28,668 MW as of 2017 end, reflecting a 34% increase compared to 2016 end. Going forward the wind industry’s powerful growth is poised to continue in 2018 as well, delivering jobs and private investment to rural areas and factory towns and resulting in an overall economic growth.Such valued growth prospects of the wind industry must have encouraged Ameren Corp. to invest in the latest wind farm.  Missouri, being the national transportation hub for rail, river, road, and air shipments in the United States, has energy consumption per capita at the national median. Naturally, energy demand is high in the state that offers solid opportunities to electricity providers, like Ameren, to expand its footprint in there.Coming to its operational performance, the company witnessed a solid 48% year-over-year increase, driven by higher Ameren Missouri electric service rates and retail sales. Considering its latest expansion plans for wind energy in the state of Missouri, we may expect the company to deliver similar bottom-line growth in the coming days.Price MovementAmeren’s stocks gained 1.0% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s decline of 6.3%. The company’s modernized approach and focus on increasing customer reliability might have led to the outperformance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAmeren carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few top-ranked stocks from the same space are NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), TerraForm Power, Inc. (TERP  -  Free Report) and Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report).

263,NRG,"Public Service Enterprise Group Inc.’s (PEG  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), recently got the regulatory go-ahead to start operations for the next phase of its Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP II). The approval for the multi-party settlement was granted by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU).Under GSMP II program, the company plans on investing $1.9 billion for replacing and modernizing its existing gas systems.Details of the Infrastructure UpgradesPSE&G aims at implementing several infrastructural upgrades under the five-year program. It plans to replace 875 miles of aging cast iron and unprotected steel gas pipes with strong and durable plastic piping, reducing the potential for leaks and release of methane gas. Alongside, it will install flow valves in large numbers that would automatically deactivate gas flow when a service line gets damaged.The company also plans on modernizing infrastructural systems, limiting greenhouse gas emissions, maintain service reliability, create jobs and spur economic growth in the New Jersey region. PSE&G will begin neighborhood work related to GSMP II in early 2019.Our ViewThe growth prospect of natural gas continues to be favorable in the long run, as the commodity’s long-term demand is expected to soar due to the transition toward a low carbon future. In line with this, the EIA predicts global demand for natural gas to grow from 340 Bcf (Billions Of Cubic Feet) per day in 2015 to 485 Bcf per day by 2040. Such massive growth projections must have enticed natural gas providers, like Public Service Enterprise, to strengthen its position in the natural gas space by modernizing its existing gas infrastructure.Furthermore, the ongoing period of low natural gas prices along with the investments made by PSE&G provides a perfect opportunity for the company to replace and upgrade its gas system with minimal cost impact on customers. In fact, management expects that the GSMP II upgrades will keep customer bills low and the average annual bill for a typical residential customer is expected to increase by a mere less than 2% per year, during the five years. Such strategic investment programs are expected to help the company offer more reliable, resilient, cleaner and affordable energy to customers.Price PerformancePublic Service Enterprise Group has outperformed the broader industry in the past one year. During this period, the company’s shares gained 13.8% compared with the broader industry’s decline of 6.3%. The outperformance may have been caused by its solid portfolio of regulated and non-regulated utility assets that offer significant long-term growth potential. Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksPublic Service Enterprise Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few top-ranked stocks from the same space are NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report), TerraForm Power, Inc. (TERP  -  Free Report) and Atlantic Power Corporation (AT  -  Free Report).

264,NRG,"Investors in NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jul 21st 2017 $18.00Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NRG Energy shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NRG Energy is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 46% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, the stock has seen three upward versus no downward estimate revisions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved from 23 cents per share to 31 cents per share in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NRG Energy right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

265,NRG,"Southern Company (SO  -  Free Report) recently inked a deal to divest stakes in several of its Florida assets to the U.S.-based wholesale electricity supplier, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report), in a bid to strengthen its financials. Atlanta-based electric utility, Southern Company will sell its Gulf Power Company, Florida City Gas, along with interests in the Oleander and Stanton natural gas plants in a deal valued $6.5 billion.  Post the announcement of the deal, shares of Southern Company have moved up 1.66% to close at $43.44 on May 21. Meanwhile, shares of NextEra have edged up 2.41% to eventually close at $160.22. The deal seems to be a win-win for both the companies. While the move will help NextEra to expand and diversify its operations, it will address Southern Company’s leverage issues at the same time.Deal DetailsThe total transaction value is estimated at around $6.5 billion. This includes $5.1 billion in cash, which is expected to be financed by the issuance of new debt. Moreover, NextEra will also assume the $1.4 billion debt burden of Gulf Power, raising the total consideration to $6.5 billion.NextEra will be acquiring the Florida-based utility, Gulf Power, which serves around 450,000 customers in eight counties in Northwest Florida. Further, it will also purchase Florida City Gas, which supplies natural gas to approximately 111,000 residential and commercial consumers in four counties along the state’s East Coast.Apart from these holdings, NextEra will buy Southern Company’s entire stake in Oleander Plant — a 791-MW gas-fired simple-cycle combustion turbine power plant — which the latter purchased from Constellation Energy Group in 2005. The cash-starved Southern Company will also jettison its 65% stake in the Stanton Energy Centre — a gas-fired combined cycle plant — to NextEra. Both Oleander and Stanton Plants have dual fuel power, with distillate as the backup fuel.Subject to approvals from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Federal Trade Commission, the acquisition of Gulf Power and Stanton/Oleander facilities is set for closure in the first half of 2019. On the other hand, subject to Federal Trade Commission’s approval, the Florida City Gas buyout is likely to close by the third quarter of 2018.Deal Rationale for Southern CompanyThe deal is likely to be a prudent strategy for Southern Company, which is grappling with elevated leverage along with cost overruns in two of its large construction projects, Vogtle and Kemper. Notably, the company, which spent around $12 billion for the AGL Resources buyout in 2016 to expand and diversify its offerings, is heading toward the retrenchment road, weighed by its financial struggles. As of Mar 31, the company’s long-term debt stood at $44.4 billion, representing a debt-to-capital ratio of more than 63%.The company suffered a massive loss last year when Mississippi Public Service Commission ordered Southern Company’s subsidiary, Mississippi Power Company, to suspend all coal gasification operations in the Kemper project, thus converting it to a natural gas project. Originally estimated at around $3 billion, the project’s cost ballooned to $7.3 billion, affecting its commercial viability and balance sheet. The Vogtle project is also being bankrolled with more than $8 billion in federal loans and loan guarantees. The project’s cost is soaring to $25 million, thereby increasing its credit risk. With Southern Company winning Georgia PSC's nod for the construction of the Vogtle plant in December 2017, the divestiture deal will enable the company to sharpen its focus on the first U.S. nuclear project in decades.With the divestiture deal, Southern Company will also be able to streamline its portfolio, boost utility returns, along with raise cash to repay debts and pay for the new reactors. The sale eliminates the overhang of its equity needs by helping the company reduce $3 billion from the amount it is required to raise in the next three years. In fact, the company is planning to offload its interests in its solar projects as well as raise another $1 billion. It is also seeking $1 billion in third-party tax equity financing for its wind projects.Thus, apart from bolstering its financial strength, the deal will streamline Southern Company’s portfolio and enable the company to forge ahead with its Vogtle Project more effectively. With limited cash flow and large amounts of investment to make, the deal would provide some relief to the company.Deal Benefits to NextEraThe deal has enabled Next Era, America’s most valuable power company, to significantly progress with its strategic expansion. The deal will further enhance its long-term growth prospects in a space, in which it already has a command.The acquired assets, including the regulated electric and natural gas franchises, serve as a complementary fit to NextEra’s existing portfolio in Florida. The assets, which are a perfect geographic and strategic fit, will lead to several commercial, financial and operational synergies.Upon closure, the deal is likely to be immediately accretive to NextEra’s earnings.

Revenues Improve Y/YIn the quarter under review, COPEL’s net operating revenues were R$3,348.7 million ($1,030.4 million), increasing 1.6% year over year.The top-line improvement was primarily driven by growth of 16.3% in electricity sales to final customers and 23.8% in revenues from telecommunications.

267,NRG,"The equity markets continued to breathe easy as the U.S.-China trade concerns abated with President Trump pledging support for the beleaguered Chinese telecom firm, ZTE, and the Qualcomm-NXP merger review process getting a roll-on with urgency from the top administration of China. Although apprehensions related to the U.S. pullout from the Iran nuclear deal remained a subtle threat, overall markets appeared to be headed for a smooth sail.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they could benefit from ‘cash cow’ stocks that garner higher returns.However, singling out cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting its cash at a high rate of return.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE more than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow less than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report): Founded in 1908, Detroit, MI-based General Motors is a leading global automotive firm.

273,NRG,"The Q1 earnings season is past the halfway mark, with 267 S&P 500 members having already reported their quarterly results as of Apr 27.

This sector, along with 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, is likely to come up with improved year-over-year earnings. Currently, only the Auto, Tires and Trucks sector is likely to register an earnings decline.Utility sector’s earnings are expected to increase 13.9% year over year on 1.4% growth in revenues, thanks to stable performance by most of the utilities. The need for heating, stemming from cold weather conditions, and increased demand for electricity aided the utilities. Additionally, tax reforms also helped the utilities in lowering their tax burden substantially.Utilities, apart from investing in generation plants that produce electricity with low and negligible amount of emissions, are focused on improving and upgrading transmission and distribution networks. Utilities are also investing in power storage facilities and encouraging investors for efficient usage of electricity.  Rate-sensitive capital-intensive utility stocks have also accommodated the rate hikes. Notably, the Fed has now raised rates six times (latest in March 2018) since the first hike in December 2015.Let’s take a look at some Utility stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 3 and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.58% in the last reported quarter.

QuoteLet’s Take a Look at the Factors Affecting Q3 ResultsWeakness in Commercial Insurance Segment – The company’s Commercial Insurance business has been suffering for the past many quarters from challenging market conditions. Management has undertaken actions to restore profitability in this segment by shifting its mix of business to the more profitable ones. This has led to a reduction in U.S. casualty exposure, shrinking the gross book by a third from 2015. While business portfolio repositioning has reduced operating risk, the segment’s revenues continue to suffer from reduction in premium written from forgone business. The same is expected to be reflected in third-quarter results.The segment’s underwriting profitability is likely to suffer from nearly $3 billion of estimated catastrophe loss from hurricanes — Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico.We expect the segment’s profitability to suffer in the third quarter from high loss claims at a time when the segment’s top line is already weighed down by challenging market conditions.Lower Share Buyback – The company’s newly appointed CEO has made a shift in its capital utilization strategy in an effort to scoop up more profits. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, personal and life lines, and domestic middle market as opposed to significant capital used for share repurchases till now.Though the acquisitions to be made by the company will expand its business, these might not be immediately accretive to earnings. The bottom line will also be bereft of the support provided by significant buybacks till now. This might likely drain earnings in the third quarter.Strong Consumer Segment – This business represents roughly half of the company's core equity and is a valuable source of earning stability. The company enjoys a leading market position across many products and distribution channels, which allow it to maintain profitability in evolving markets. We expect improved contribution from Group Retirement and the Life Insurance line of business.In its Life Insurance sub-segment, the company recently introduced a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped its product suite, and substantially exited its U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. These steps were undertaken to enhance ROE from this line of business. The efforts were reflected in an increase in life insurance sales in the first half of 2017 and we expect to see further sales growth in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AIG is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

285,NRG,"Duke Energy Corporation (DUK  -  Free Report) an electric and natural gas utility based in Charlotte, NC, is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 0.98%. However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the past four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 1.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAt the onset of the third quarter, Duke Energy announced a 4.1% hike in its quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 89 cents per share. The dividend payment was scheduled for Sep 18, 2017, to stockholders on record as of Aug 18, 2017.This indicates that the company has been generating robust cash flow from various operations and the soon-to-be-reported quarter is poised to reflect that.On the flip side, Hurricane Irma led to catastrophic losses in Florida last month. The storm damaged the grid system of electricity providers like Duke Energy, which has extensive service territories in the region. This in turn led to disruption in distribution network and widespread outages.Duke Energy reported that its electrical system suffered significant damages in Hardee and Highlands County. The company took several initiatives to address these issues and initiated repair work which included rebuilding this system.Moreover, Duke Energy in September waived off late payment charges and estimated bills for 1.8 million Florida customers to restore power in the state.These must have increased the third-quarter expenses of Duke Energy, which we believe will weigh down on its bottom line.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects a decline of 7.8% year over year, whereas sales are anticipated to drop 1.1% to $6.75 billion.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not show that Duke Energy will beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Duke Energy lacks these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Duke Energy has an Earnings ESP of -0.91%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $1.53, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Duke Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Duke Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Duke Energy Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few utility stocks which have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NRG Energy, Inc.

The trend continued in the first half of 2017, which saw membership increasing by 3%. We expect to see increased membership on growth across all its Commercial market segments, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $963 million, up 10.9% year over year.Higher Premium in Health Care Segment: We expect to see an increase in premium and fees in the company's Health Care segment driven by customer growth and specialty contributions from the Commercial employer group. The Zacks Consensus for the same is pegged at $7.1 billion, up 4.3% year over year.Share Buyback: The company’s strong business generates sufficient cash flows from operations, which enables it to make strategic mergers and acquisitions, buy back shares and pay dividend.

Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 2.83%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the second quarter earnings call, Ameren declared that it expects to incur non-cash estimated charge of 6 cents per share in the third quarter, primarily at the parent company. This charge is the result of revaluation of deferred taxes owing to an increase in the Illinois corporate income tax rate, effective Jul 1, 2017.The company also stated that due to the change in timing of interim period revenue recognition in Ameren Illinois, its earnings will decrease by approximately 23 cents per share in the quarter under review. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ameren’s earnings reflects 9.9% decline, for the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is less compared with the national average. An improving economy is also likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Moreover, the company’s service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal temperatures during the quarter.

301,NRG,"CenterPoint Energy, Inc. (CNP  -  Free Report) will release third-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on Nov 3.In the last quarter, the company pulled off a positive earnings surprise of 38.10%. Moreover, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average earnings beat of 10.34%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the third quarter, one of the most devastating tropical storms in 50 years – Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, TX – which is the primary service region of CenterPoint .Harvey’s impact on the state’s properties hampered the smooth flow of electricity through the transmission lines, leading to widespread outages. Though the company didn’t announce any significant damage caused to its power plants, it is expected that the effect of the storm might weigh down on its profitability in the third quarter.On the brighter note, CenterPoint had witnessed increased customer count and throughput during second-quarter 2017, primarily due to acquisitions of Atmos Energy Marketing (AEM) and the Energy Services business. Going ahead, similar solid performance from Energy Services is expected in third quarter and beyond, buoyed by increased operating income.Moreover, the unemployment rate in Ameren’s service territories is better than the national average. An improving economy is likely to boost future utility demand in the state, thereby improving the company’s performance.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents for third-quarter earnings projects a decline of 1%.

The deal has received approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Per the aforementioned deal, proceeds generated will be utilized toward debt reduction purposes.What Caused Dynegy’s Debt Levels to Rise?Since 2013, Dynegy has increased scale and shifted portfolio mix, from a coal-based portfolio to a gas-based one, with the support of several acquisitions. All of these were funded through a significant portion of the company’s existing debt. This caused considerable stress to the company’s balance sheet structure.Since then, the company has been working consistently to reduce its outstanding debt level.  Additionally, it has been taking steps to maintain a diverse liquidity program to support ongoing operations and commercial activities by issuing notes.Focus on Debt ReductionGoing forward, Dynegy is primarily focused on debt reduction, which is anticipated mainly from operating cash flows. Further, PRIDE initiatives and asset sales will aid in maintaining a healthy balance sheet, while managing debt maturities and improving leverage position.The company exited with total long-term debt of $9.2 billion as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with nearly $8.8 million at the end of 2016.

304,NRG,"CMS Energy Corporation’s (CMS  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy recently announced that it will invest approximately $250 million to boost small businesses in Michigan over the next two and a half years, under the Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) initiative.About PMBCThe Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) developed by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) began as a multi-billion dollar public/private initiative in 2011. The initiative aims at connecting Michigan goods and service suppliers with corporate purchasers free of charge.Our ViewWe note that, being one of the founding members of PMBC, Consumers Energy has already spent approximately $2.9 billion with Michigan businesses under the initiative since June 2015. CMS Energy’s robust financial commitment toward the PMBC program not only reflects the solid financial flexibility it boasts but also is a testament to the company’s focus on expanding its business across Michigan.Moreover, PMBC’s commitment to generate new jobs is in line with the company’s aim of stimulating economic growth in the state. This in turn will aid small businesses to flourish.We believe CMS Energy aims at expanding customer base by boosting the small businesses. Indeed if business expansion takes place in the state, need for energy consumption will rise and CMS Energy being the largest energy provider in Michigan will surely benefit from that.As of 2015, Michigan is ranked 11th among the U.S. states in terms of energy consumption and with gradual growth in economy, the energy consumption is likely to grow. To tap this expanding market, energy providers like CMS Energy are taking varied initiatives to instil growth in the state and consequently enhance their business.Toward this, another utility provider, DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) has recently commenced operations in its Lapeer solar park — one of the largest utility-owned solar parks, located in Michigan. On completion, the park is expected to generate sufficient clean energy to power 11,000 homes. (Read more : DTE Energy (DTE  -  Free Report) Brings Lapeer Solar Park Online in Michigan.)

305,NRG,"DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) has recently started the commercial operation of its Lapeer solar park — one of the largest utility-owned solar parks, located east of the Mississippi River. The construction of the project started on the spring of 2016.Located in Lapeer, MI, the 200,000-panel array solar project covers over 250 acres. On completion, it is expected to generate sufficient clean energy to power 11,000 homes.Scope of Alternate EnergyRegulations pertaining to pollution control are becoming increasingly stringent, making it crucial for utilities to spend more on emission control infrastructure. Meanwhile, because of their clean-burning nature, investment in the alternate energy space could prove to be profitable over the long run. In particular, solar energy, which presently contributes to only 1.2% of the total electricity generation in the United States, represents ample scope of improvement in the days to come.Our ViewDue to declining costs of solar and wind energy producing technologies the global renewable energy market has been witnessing enhanced growth in the last two years. The trend to curb energy production from fossil fuel is gaining traction these days. DTE Energy is striving to position itself in this ever-expanding market.In an initiative to transform itself into a full-fledged renewable energy provider, DTE Energy in May announced its plan to get rid of all coal-fired units by 2040. The company is gradually trying to reduce carbon emissions by more than 80% by 2050 (compared to 2005 levels).Notably, the latest news was reported at a crucial time, when the United States slipped to the third position in the latest EY (Ernst &Young) Renewable energy country attractiveness index (RECAI). In fact, the new U.S. Government's decision to roll back many of the past administration's climate change policies, reviving the coal industry and repealing the U.S. Clean Power Plan has been hampering the growth trajectory of alternative energy industry.We believe that DTE Energy’s promise of sumptuous investment in the renewable energy space may uplift the nation on the RECAI. However, we remain on the sidelines considering the fact that President Trump has been calling the climate change a “Chinese Hoax” and has long been in favor of reviving the coal industry. It also remains a matter of question as to whether his newly made policies, if approved, will let energy providers like DTE Energy to wholly shift to renewable resources. In that case, the entire investment plan of DTE Energy will go down the drain, causing a loss for the company. The company has already spent more than $2 billion in wind and solar resources since 2009.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of DTE Energy have returned 16.9% outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.7%.The company’s focus on expanding its renewable portfolio and gradual recovery of Michigan’s economy has most likely boosted its performance.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderDTE Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

307,NRG,"WEC Energy Group (WEC  -  Free Report) has recently signed an agreement to acquire majority stake at the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center of Henry County, Illinois. Per the terms, WEC Energy will purchase 80% ownership of the wind farm for $148 million.Developed by Invenergy, the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center has a capacity to generate 132 megawatt (MW) of electricity and been in service since May 2018.  Utility’s Shift to RenewablesRising level of air pollution along with global climate change has prompted consumers to rapidly increase the adoption of alternative energy sources, nay renewables, over the last decade. Buoyed by declining costs of solar and wind technologies as well as rising demand for more carbon-constrained practices, utilities and corporations are shifting to renewables. Consequently, many electric utilities are investing or making agreements to increase the usage of alternative energy sources to generate power.Why Investment in Wind Power is Profitable?While utilities are shifting focus toward renewables, solar and wind are gaining significant traction in the renewable industry. The adoption of wind energy has increased, courtesy of lower cost of turbines. In this regard, the Renewable Energy: United States report of December 2017 stated that wind turbine costs have declined by around half since 2010.This, in turn, has made the construction and maintenance of wind power projects cheaper, setting the stage for utility providers like WEC Energy to make valuable investments in wind projects like the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. Also, demand for wind energy isimpressive, with the Renewable Energy: United States report estimating a rise in of 7.2% in demand by 2021.Moreover, the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and Investment Tax Credit (ITC) offered by the government have made investments in new wind project more productive. With these tax credits being extended through 2019, rising demand and declining turbine costs, we may expect to witness similar wind investments in the United States over the near term.This spectacular outlook for the U.S. wind energy space has prompted other utility providers to make notable investments in wind energy for expanding their clean energy portfolio. For instance, NextEra Energy, Inc’s (NEE  -  Free Report) subsidiary — NextEra Energy Resources — recently announced a renewable energy partnership program with AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report). Per the power purchase agreement (PPA), the partnership will acquire 300 MW of wind energy from two new wind farms in Wilbarger and Hardeman Counties, Texas.Similarly, to cater to the increasing demand for wind energy, NRG Energy Inc (NRG  -  Free Report) and Cypress Creek Renewables are set to develop a 25 MW solar project in Texas.Price MovementThe shares of WEC Energy have gained 5.0%, against the industry’s decline of 2.2% in last 12 months. Zacks Rank & Key PicksWEC Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
