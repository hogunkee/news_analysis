28,XRAY,"DENTSPLY SIRONA (XRAY  -  Free Report) has underperformed the industryin the last six months. The company’s shares have lost 27.9% comparing unfavorably with the industry’s gain of 5.1%. The current level is also significantly lower than the S&P 500 index’s return of 5.3%.A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, a sluggish first quarter, declining margins and foreign exchange headwinds are significant obstacles for the company.Battered by the above challenges, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter adjusted earnings is currently pegged at 60 cents, down 20% in the last two months. This also marks a 7.7% fall year over year. The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Below we take a sneak peek at the major issues plaguing DENTSPLY SIRONA.The company expects gross margins and operating margins to remain flat or slightly down on a year-over-year basis in the coming quarters. This is because underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions.Further, as the company is committed to delivering $100 million in operating cost savings by fiscal 2019, it expects more than half of the amount in 2018. Although the savings should result in increased margin over time, the same in2018 are likely to be affected.By the end of the first quarter of 2018, DENTSPLY SIRONA confirmed that it expects 2018 full-year operating margins to be down between 100 basis points (bps) and 150 bps on a year-over-year basis.In this regard, DENTSPLY SIRONA reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 45 cents in the first quarter of 2018, down 8.2% year over year. The metric beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.1%.  Net sales fell 1.1% year over year to $956.1 million on a constant-currency (cc) basis. However, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $944.7 million. Management expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous range of $2.70-$2.80. Revenues are projected to rise 2% at cc.DENTSPLY SIRONA has solid international presence. Therefore, a strong U.S. dollar, especially against the euro as well as emerging market currencies had a negative impact on results. We believe that currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018.The company faces significant pricing pressure due to intense competition. DENTSPLY SIRONA conducts its operations, domestic and foreign, under highly-competitive market conditions. The size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and regionally.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are ABIOMED, Inc.

32,XRAY,"The political gridlock over the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare has been making headlines in the MedTech space. Amid such political conundrum at the Capitol Hill, market watchers will be keeping a tab on the MedTech space.Of the recent developments, the GOP failure at Senate to repeal Obamacare is likely to cause tremors in the political circles once the August recess has ended. This is evident with Vice President Pence throwing his hat in the ring, vowing to end the “ObamaCare nightmare” at the Tennessee GOP 2017 Statesmen's Dinner on Thursday. Plans are also afoot from GOP senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy to redirect money, currently spent on providing coverage through ObamaCare. Per the plans, the amount will be distributed among states to spend accordingly.Amid such political conundrum at the Capitol Hill, market watchers will keep a tab on the Medical space. The fraternity worries whether the final ‘Trump-care plan’ will still include the MedTech tax repeal in its agenda. Meanwhile, the old template of the plan, which promised to eradicate the infamous 2.3% medical device tax and the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) was not a bad deal. Amid such uproar, the question that emerges is how medical product players stand to gain or lose.Q2 PerformanceNotably, 84% of the total S&P 500 companies in the broader Medical sector have released their second-quarter results, as of Aug 4. With a beat ratio of 87.0%, total earnings for these companies improved 7.1% year over year. Revenues for these companies also came up with a beat ratio of 69.6%. In fact, this encouraging trend is likely to continue as the latest Earnings Preview suggests that stocks in the much sought-after S&P 500 Index will witness 10% bottom-line expansion this reporting cycle.Further, there are some powerful long-term tailwinds in the medical space, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sector’s impressive performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities. Rising interest rates and the strengthening of U.S. dollar continue to act as dampeners for this industry.  How to Make the Right Pick?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings could be a daunting task.

Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Deal in DetailFinancial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps by DENTSPLY.Post the acquisition, the company will be able to provide an end-to-end digital workflow to dental professionals and address the increasing demands for aesthetics. The acquisition of OraMetrix is likely to strengthen DENTSPLY’s footprint in the global dental industry.Notably, the company announced its plans to broaden OraMetrix’ technologies and services post the buyout. For this, DENTSPLY is likely to incur additional investments and expenses which will be dilutive to overall earnings per share in 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, OraMetrix posted revenues of approximately $20 million in 2017.The acquisition is likely to bolster the company’s Technologies & Equipment segment. This segment consists of dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic products. In the fourth quarter of 2017, sales improved 10.4% to $630.2 million in the segment and 5.8% at cc.In fact, the acquisition will introduce a comprehensive orthodontic offering that will include a ‘full arch clear-aligner’ solution for DENTSPLY.ConclusionDENTSPLY has been one of the underperforming companies in the MedTech space. Lackluster margin trends, declining earnings and foreign exchange headwinds have been plaguing the company. However, per a research report by Technavio, the global dental CAD/CAM market will witness a CAGR of more than 8% by 2021. We believe that DENTSPLY is striving to overcome these problems with such deals.The company’s price performance has been dull as well. DENTSPLY’s shares have lost 15.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.3% in a year’s time. Interestingly, an uptick in its share price was witnessed post the announcement of OraMetrix’s buyout. Notably, shares of DENTSPLY have inched up 0.8% to close at $51.10 following the press release.Further, the company’s agreements with MedTech bigwigs like Patterson Companies in Canada are likely to drive sales. Recently, DENTSPLY witnessed a rebound in sales in Asia, particularly Japan, and strong growth in Russia.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDENTSPLY has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report), athenahealth, Inc.

38,XRAY,"In recent years, growing healthcare cognizance has led to continuous technological innovation in the dental equipment space. With time, it has emerged as the most favored sector for medical device investors looking for consistent and attractive returns. Let's delve deeper.Over the last 10 years, the dental supplies market has been faring better than the S&P 500 index. The market has gained 119.8% eclipsing the broader market's 101.4%.Per a Allied Market Research report, the global dental implants and prosthetics market is expected to catapult to a value of $12,743 million by 2023, at a CAGR of 8.8% from 2017 to 2023. And if we go by the estimates of the American Dental Association (published in Grand View Research), every year 5 million implants are carried out in the United States indicating huge market potential. In today’s fast paced times, implants are preferred over conventional removable dentures owing to comfort and convenience.Factors Driving Demand for Dental TreatmentHigh Demand Among Children and Teenagers: Per a Markets and Markets report, children and teenagers are expected to dominate the global orthodontic market in the coming years. A high number of patients with malocclusions and jaw disorders are likely to drive the demand. Also, rising need for fixed braces among children and teenagers will act as a major demand propeller. Notably, orthodontic treatments are more effective and successful in childhood or teenage.One of the noteworthy developments in this niche space is the launch of Align Technology’s clear Aligner solution for teen Class II correction — the Invisalign Technology Teen with mandibular advancement — in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in 2017.Cosmetic Needs: Growing awareness esthetic needs has also been a major growth catalyst for the dental prosthetic market. Per Markets and Markets, global cosmetic dentistry is expected to make $22,362.4 million by 2020, at a CAGR of 6.8% during 2015-2020. Moreover, an increase in disposable income gives rise to higher demand for cosmetic dental surgeries.Rise in Geriatric Population: An aging population has also been a significant contributor. Higher incidence of calcium deficiency in older people leads to teeth loss. According to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial research, more than 24% of adults aged above 74 years have lost all teeth. People on medication for chronic and metabolic disorders also reach an edentulous state.Other Factors: Poor lifestyle choices and unhygienic dental care lead to higher demand for dental procedures.

39,XRAY,"We expect Flowserve Corporation (FLS  -  Free Report) to beat earnings when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, after the closing bell.The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 25% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Flowserve has an average positive surprise of 3.6% for the trailing four quarters, marked by two earnings beats for as many misses.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Flowserve has the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Flowserve is +4.55% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 46 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Flowserve’s Zacks Rank #3, when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsFlowserve’s key strengths, including strong operational model, solid productivity, considerable aftermarket content and geographical diversity, are anticipated to drive results in the soon-to-be reported quarter. For the past few quarters, the company has been witnessing stabilization in core aftermarket activities concerning parts, services and repairs as markets return to regular maintenance schedules.Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Flowserve Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Flowserve Corporation QuoteWe believe the company’s top line in the second quarter is likely to benefit from modest natural gas investments in North America and Asia. Also, increased bidding activity in the desalination space is expected to boost sales. This apart, the company’s restructuring initiatives over the past few quarters are anticipated to prove conducive to second-quarter results.Currently, the company is pursuing a $400-million multi-year investment plan, which is expected to result in $195 million of savings in 2017. These initiatives helped the company garner savings of $28 million in first-quarter 2017. Further, Flowserve is planning to trim its workforce by 15–20% as compared to the 2015 levels, as well as shift manufacturing to lower cost regions. We believe savings from these restructuring activities will boost profits in the upcoming quarter.Also, under the restructuring program, Flowserve completed the divestiture of the Gestra AG business unit to Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc during the quarter. The sale is part of Flowserve’s broader strategy to improve focus on core business, and optimize its product portfolio as well as manufacturing footprint. In addition, relative stability of oil at around the $45–$50 level for the past couple of quarters is encouraging. Modest recovery in client spending also looks promising.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +33.33% and a Zacks Rank #3, is expected to release quarterly numbers around Aug 4.

40,XRAY,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) is one of the underperforming companies in the Med Tech space. DENTSPLY’s shares have lost 15.2% compared with the industry’s decline of 0.3%. Nine estimates moved south in the last 60 days versus no upward revision, indicating analyst pessimism. During the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share dropped 20% to 48 cents. The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates expectations of underperformance in the near term. Therefore, it is time to dump the stock from your portfolio.    Why Should You Offload? Declining Earnings: Last quarter, DENTSPLY reported adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents, down 22.4% year over year. Margins Likely to Contract: DENTSPLY expects gross and operating margins to remain flat or decline slightly from 2017 levels as underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by adverse foreign exchange and target inventory equipment reduction. Foreign Exchange Headwinds: The company has significant international presence. Thus, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, especially against the euro, as well as emerging market currencies negatively impact the company’s results. We believe that currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018. The company faces significant pricing pressure due to intensifying competition. DENTSPLY conducts its operations, both domestic and foreign, in highly competitive market conditions. The size and number of the company’s competitors vary by product line and from region to region. Key Picks A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are athenahealth, Inc.

41,XRAY,"Waters Corporation (WAT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 25.The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 9.8% in the last reported quarter. Overall, Waters Corp. has an average positive surprise of 5.8% for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates thrice.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?According to our proven model, Waters Corp. has the right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Waters Corp. has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.73 comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.72. This is a major indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.Zacks Rank: Waters Corp.’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Drive Better-than-Expected ResultsWaters Corp.’s key strengths include a dominant position in the biopharma end markets and thriving sales in emerging markets. Global pharmaceuticals business, in particular, is the company’s largest single market and has been a major profit churner for the Waters Division over the past few quarters. We believe the company’s second-quarter financials will benefit from steady demand from pharmaceutical business, growth in recurring revenue and modest recovery of industrial markets.Moreover, the company’s Industrial business, which has gained momentum in the past few quarters due to increasing demand for improved food quality and safety testing, is also likely to drive the quarter’s top line. In addition, demand for research intensive products, especially the company’s mass spectrometry solutions and liquid chromatography, has been on an uptrend lately and is likely to drive second-quarter sales.During the last reported quarter, Waters Corp.’s liquid chromatography benefited from the ACQUITY Arc System while mass spectrometry sales grew on the back of QDa and Xevo family of Tandem Quadrupole. We believe robust market traction of the ACQUITY, CORTECS and Xevo line of products will supplement the top-line performance of the soon-to-be-reported quarter. In light of the above catalysts, the company’s shares have appreciated 37% year to date, outperforming the industry’s average gain of 35.5%.Despite these positives, sluggishness in the company’s academic and government businesses are likely to restrict growth to some extent. Of late, unfavorable order timing and volatility associated with instrument-heavy business have played a spoilsport for the academic and government businesses. Also, weakness in the chemical industry on a global scale is likely to dampen sales performance for the to-be-reported quarter. Further, we believe that currency fluctuations will remain a risk to the company’s top line in the quarter under review as well.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Newell Brands Inc.

43,XRAY,"The medical device tax suspension up to Jan 1, 2020, is one of the very few amendments that have garnered the maximum number of bipartisan votes in the House.Since its enactment in 2013, the 2.3% tax has been quite a menace for the medical device industry. Per a statement by the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, the tax had a significant negative impact on medical innovation and employment. Considering this, the House placed a suspension on the tax from January 2016 to December 2017 only to bring it back on Jan 1, 2018.But recently, the House came up with a $31-billion bill on tax cuts, which included the abatement of the infamous medical device tax.While the MedTech fraternity has been cheering the latest repeal, the share price and net margin performance of the medical device manufacturers is showing a different story. Let’s delve deeper.How Glitzy is the Repeal for MedTech?Innumerable reports claim that the repeal will ramp up domestic production, increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation’s overdependence on offshore production.Further, MedTech bigwigs are expected to enhance the R&D, improve margins, launch products, reduce capital depreciation, invest in early-stage MedTech companies, execute clinical trials and in turn fuel the next generation of U.S. Medical-Device industry by reinvesting profits (tax savings).Notably, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) shelled out a lump sum $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Meanwhile, medical device giant Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) reported net earnings of $1.14 billion and paid approximately $229 million as medical device excise tax in 2015 — nearly 16% of earnings (data from a Med Device Online report). If the tax didn’t exist, analysts believe the companies could have used the cash to expand and improve their pipelines.This drew heavy criticism, compelling the Democrats and the Republicans to lift the tax.History Says a Different StorySince the tax was abolished in 2015-end, the companies were expected to rake in profits and also put up an impressive show on the bourses starting 2016. However, the price performance and margin trend contradicted expectations.In fact, the tax repeal news created quite a stir amongst analysts back in 2016, dealing a blow to shares of medical device manufacturers. Our data shows that the broader Medical-Products industry has underperformed the S&P 500 market in the last two years. The industry’s 31.3% cuts a sorry figure in comparison to the S&P 500’s 34.5%. Here we take a sneak peek at the net margin trend of companies since the last tax repeal. Although no single metric can determine the profitability of a business accurately, investors can count on net margin to get a fair idea of the amount of profit a company is making. A declining net margin post the tax repeal amendment throws light on the enormous risks and costs associated with the R&D and compliance requirements of MedTech manufacturers. This also raises a question on how will the tax repeal provide an impetus to the MedTech space, if it could do nothing significant two years back.5 Stocks Grappling With Declining Prices & Net MarginHere we have five MedTech stocks that have witnessed significant margin contraction despite the tax repeal in 2015.We would like to draw your attention to the share price and net margin performance of companies following the tax’s abolition in 2015.Over the past two years, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has been observed to underperform the broader markets. As per the latest share price movement, the stock lost 7%, comparing unfavorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 35.4%.The company has been facing escalating costs and expenses that are weighing on its margins. Also, the company’s reiteration of 2018 guidance despite the projection of favorable foreign currency translation fails to lift investors’ spirits. Over the past two years, Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has underperformed the S&P 500 index. The stock has lost 18.8%. We are disappointed with the continued deterioration in the company gross, operating and net margins, thanks to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, a tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure weigh on the stock.The U.S. healthcare products and service distribution industry is highly competitive and consist principally of national, regional and local distributors. In the North American dental products market, the company faces stiff competition from Patterson Dental business of Patterson Companies Inc. and Benco Dental Supply.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) share price movement has been disheartening over the past two years. The company has lost 7.1% in the period. A lackluster margin trend over the same time frame indicates the company’s failure to garner profits post the tax repeal.For the days to comeDENTSPLY expects gross and operating margins to remain flat to decline slightly from 2017 levels as underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by adverse foreign exchange and target inventory equipment reduction.Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. (MDRX  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two months. Notably, the stock has returned 5.2%, compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 35.4%. Further, the company’s margins have contracted significantly in the past two years.Allscripts also expects a modest increase in operating expenses. The company faces sluggishness in the international market and competition from larger players.Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two years. The stock has returned just 10.3%, much lower than the S&P 500 market. Further, the company’s margins have declined steeply in the past two years.Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses.Will the latest MedTech tax overhaul paint a different picture for these stocks?Will History Repeat Itself?Our analysis clearly shows that the broader industry hasn’t reacted positively to the tax repeal amendment that was legislated in 2015. If we consider the repeal’s effect on the MedTech space, the trend is expected to continue this time around as well!However, the MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This coupled with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, the strategic application of Artificial Intelligence in every sphere of healthcare can provide boost productivity in the MedTech space. Companies that have adopted AI technologies witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and are expected to record strong margin expansion as well.You never know, the current favorable trend might turn the tables for the MedTech industry!More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

45,XRAY,"Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 1. The company anticipates a decline in the Dental Supply segment — one of its major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings, an expected improvement in Animal Segment operating income should drive results.Notably, Patterson Companies reported adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Net sales fell 2.3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Let us take a look at how things are shaping up before the release.Dental-Supply Segment to Decline in Q3The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Dental Supply segment is $592 million for third-quarter fiscal 2018. This reflects a decline of almost 5.4% year over year.The loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona (XRAY  -  Free Report) forced the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning system to efficiently manage inventory. However, the system is creating short-term challenges. Undoubtedly, the termination of the contract presents new opportunities for Patterson Companies to expand distribution platform to a wider range of product offerings. However, the company continues to witness heavy initial impact from the loss of this deal.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Patterson Companies, Inc. Quote The company’s decision to end exclusive distribution will affect results through fiscal 2018. In fact, dental segment sales have been sluggish over the last couple of quarters. Management has provided a dull guidance for the coming quarters as well.In the last quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) fell 8.4% at constant currency (cc)  year over year to approximately $553.6 million. The downside was caused by lower sales of CEREC and digital technology products. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018, adding to the company’s woes.Other Factors at PlayEstimates & GuidanceFor the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at 51 cents, reflecting a decline of 12.1% year over year. Management anticipates headwinds in its technology equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018. This is primarily because of Patterson Companies’ initiatives to transit its sales model to an expanded technology product portfolio.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.38 billion, showing a decline of 1.1% year over year.In the last quarter, the company estimated adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $2.00-$2.10, way below the previous band of $2.25-$2.40. Patterson Companies expects deal amortization expenses of $25.3 million or 27 cents per share. The company projects integration and business restructuring expenses at $5.3 million or 6 cents per share.Animal Health SegmentAnimal Health is the second important contributor to revenues for Patterson Companies after the dental unit.Steady growth in this unit is expected to be a long-term growth driver. Management expects solid margin improvement in the segment on the back of enhanced partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Animal Health unit is pegged at $30.9 million, reflecting an improvement of 33.1% from the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is $786 million, reflecting a decline of 4.6% year over year.Our quantitative model does not show an earnings beat for Patterson Companies this quarter.

46,XRAY,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the market opens.The company is expected to see sluggishness in the Ex Precious Metal Segment — one of the major revenue components. This is expected to dampen fourth-quarter results, which might be compensated by improving revenues in other segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. revenues at the Ex Precious Metal Segment is $348 million, down 3.9% from the last quarter. Not just in the United States, the segment is likely to put up an unimpressive show in Europe and Rest of the World. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment in Europe is pegged at $404 million, showing a 6.3% drop from the figure reported in the previous quarter. Further, the consensus estimate for revenues in the segment from the Rest of the World is pegged at $274 million, showing a 6.2% decline from the reported figure in the last quarter.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Moreover, DENTSPLY has been performing unfavorably compared with the broader industry over the last year. The stock has gained 2.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 21.5%.However, DENTSPLY delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 0.93% in the trailing four quarters. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings of 70 cents per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Earnings also rose 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Why Dull Estimates for Ex Precious Metal Segment?Sales of the company’s precious-metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials, are subject to risks from fluctuations of precious metal prices.In the last quarter, revenues in Europe and Rest of the World at the Ex Precious Metal segment deteriorated on a sequential basis. In Europe, revenues declined 3.8% to $380 billion, while revenues in Rest of the World fell 0.4% to $258 million. The lackluster trend is likely to persist in the to-be-reported quarter as well.To avoid the impact of fluctuating prices, DENTSPLY reports net sales with and without precious metal content to show actual performance, independent of precious metal price volatility.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConsistent Efforts to Achieve Operational Excellence: DENTSPLY is poised to become one of the best operators in the dental industry in terms of cost, quality and overall efficiency. Management consistently focuses on operational expenses and is contemplating to cut an additional $100 million of costs in 2018 and 2019. Apart from plans of expense control, the company intends to drive revenue synergies well beyond this target. We believe that the company’s cost-control efficiencies will be accretive to fourth-quarter results.View for Q4 and 2017: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pinned at $1.06 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.05%.While reporting its third quarter, DENTSPLY narrowed its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 to the range of $2.65 to $2.70 from the earlier $2.65 to $2.75. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is pegged at $2.65, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 4.68%. However, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is 81 cents, showing year-over-year growth of 20.9%.Debt Dependence: DENTSPLY exited the third quarter with long-term debt of $1.6 billion. Large amounts of debt are likely to hamper the company’s prospects, in terms of product innovation.Plagued by the above headwinds, DENTSPLY is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively indicate earnings beat for DENTSPLY in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: DENTSPLY has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

47,XRAY,"Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) has had an unimpressive run on the bourses in the last three months, trading below the industry. Further, lackluster performance in the dental segment along with a downbeat guidance is a concern. The stock has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The estimate revision trend for Patterson Companies has been dismal. For the current year, eight analysts moved south compared with no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year earnings fell 9.2% to $2.09.What’s Not Right in the Dental Segment?Loss of Distribution RightsThe recent loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona (XRAY  -  Free Report) has forced the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to efficiently manage inventory. However, the system is creating short-term challenges. Undoubtedly, the termination of the contract presents new opportunities for Patterson Companies to expand distribution platform to a wider range of product offerings. However, the company also witnesses a heavy initial impact from the loss of this deal.Deteriorating SalesPatterson Companies’ decision to end exclusive distribution will affect results through fiscal 2018. In fact, the dental segment sales have been sluggish over the last couple of quarters. Management has provided a dull guidance for the coming quarters as well.In the last quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) declined 8.4% at cc year over year to approximately $553.6 million. The downside was caused by lower sales of CEREC and digital technology products. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018, adding to the company’s woes.Competition RifeCutthroat competition in the U.S. dental products distribution industry is a major dampener as well. Notably, Patterson Companies faces serious competition from at least 15 full-service distributors that include Henry Schein Dental, a unit of Henry Schein (HSIC  -  Free Report), and numerous small and local distributors.Shares Lack LusterA rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States, unfavorable price movements, a competitive dental products distribution industry and integration risks pose significant challenges. Patterson Companies’ price movement in the past three months has been disappointing. The company represented a negative return of almost 5.2%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s rally of almost 4.7%. In fact, the current level is lower than the S&P 500 index’s return of 7.3% over the same time period. Key PickA top-ranked stock in the broader medical sector is PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report). PetMed has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10%. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock has rallied roughly 76.8% in a year.

48,XRAY,"Align Technologies (ALGN  -  Free Report) has continued to develop its iTero scanner line and is fast expanding its footprint in the growing field of digital scanning. In sync with this strategy, the company has announced plans to advance its iTero Element intraoral scanner through the strategic partnership with Exocad GmbH.Per Align, this collaboration with CAD/CAM software provider, Exocad GmbH, will enable the Chairside CAD software (a chairside prosthetics design software application) to be specially integrated into Align's iTero Element intraoral scanner. With this integration, the Chairside CAD software will support same-day dentistry via the iTero Element scanner. The integrated system is expected to be marketed by the middle of 2018.Align claimed that within minutes after scanning, this new iTero Chairside CAD software has capacity to design and produce precision-fit tooth restorations for patients via connected, in-office milling systems.Additionally, this system has been claimed to deliver an enhanced patient engagement, showcasing 3D crown design, streamlined workflow between iTero Element scanners with integrated restorative design software and market-leading certified milling systems. Per Align, this technique will be an affordable option to perform same-day dentistry in the restorative practice.Interestingly, revenues from the Scanner and Service segment improved 25% in the last quarter. Moreover, the company saw an increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thus driving Invisalign utilization. Per a report by Research And Markets, the global market for 3D Dental Scanners is projected to witness a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2021 period.Considering the market potential of Align’s current developments in the Scanners and Services space, this collaboration seems to be a strategic one.We believe, an unhealthy lifestyle, rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the 3D Dental scanner market. However, this area is dominated by well-established players like DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report). Align has been gaining investor confidence from consistently positive results. Over the past three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has surged 45.5% compared with the broader industry’s 5.3% gain.

49,XRAY,"On Nov 20, we issued an updated research report on DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) — a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables and dental laboratory products.The New York-based company recently announced the renewal of an existing distribution agreement with Henry Schein Canada, Inc, which will continue till Dec 31, 2020. Henry Schein's agreement with DENTSPLY SIRONA was initiated in August 2005.The deal extension is a smart move by DENTSPLY SIRONA as the preexisting agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company will benefit from Henry Schein’s distribution network in Canada.Among the recent developments, the company announced the renewal of its partnership with Pacific Dental Services. This move strategic as Pacific Dental’s network consists of over 580 centers in 17 states. During the tenure of the present agreement, management expects the number of such offices utilizing DENTSPLY SIRONA’s technologies to exceed 800.DENTSPLY SIRONA’s dual branding strategy, product innovation, growth opportunities in emerging markets (especially Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa), diversified product portfolio and recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The company expects a solid guidance for 2017 projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65-$2.70.On the flip side, apart from a series of macroeconomic headwinds, currency fluctuation continues to be a major dampener. In fact, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Euro and other emerging market currencies has dented the company’s growth trajectory. Further, higher capital expenditure on product development is expected to keep margins under pressure.DENTSPLY SIRONA’s price movement has been favorable in the last three months. The company’s shares have gained 23.7% compared with the industry’s rise of 3.8%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksDENTSPLY SIRONA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) and Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report).

50,XRAY,"Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN  -  Free Report) recently signed an agreement with Glidewell Dental to distribute the iTero Element intraoral scanning system with the latest glidewell.io In-Office Solution in North America.The scanner will be powered with Glidewell’s fastdesign.io software. Notably, the glidewell.io In-Office Solution is a chairside restorative ecosystem that simplifies delivering and prescribing laboratory-quality dental restorations.Per management, the collaboration will widen iTero’s reach to more than 50,000 dentists using Glidewell services. Notably, the company aims a launch in the first-quarter of 2018. Moreover, the deal is expected to enhance the efficiency and accessibility of same-day restorations for the joint customers.Align Technology, which manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics and dental records storage, has been working hard to expand work flow options of iTero scanners. In this context, the company signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental, a business unit of Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report), in August.Per the non-exclusive agreement, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. In May, Align Technology had launched a software upgrade to its iTero Element intraoral scanner that is capable of comparing patient scans over time with the latest TimeLapse technology.Also, the company collaborated with exocad GmbH in March, whereby the integrated portfolio will result in high-tech workflow solution for efficient scanning, designing and manufacturing of in-house dental prosthesis. In February, the company announced the addition of digital workflow for Nobel Biocare implants to its iTero intraoral scanner portfolio.Interestingly, revenues from the Scanner and Service segment improved 25% in the last reported third quarter of 2017. Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions, especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Per a report by Research And Markets, the global market for 3D Dental Scanners is projected to see a CAGR of 10.2% over the 2017-2021 period.Considering the market potential and Align Technology’s current developments in the Scanners and Services space, this collaboration seems to be a strategic one.We believe an unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the 3D Dental scanner market.

51,XRAY,"With a market capitalization of approximately $10.17 billion, DENTSPLY SIRONA (XRAY  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings in the trailing three quarters. However, the company faces margin threats and foreign exchange headwinds.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 4.6% against the industry’s rise of 4.3% in a month’s time.Let’s take a detailed look at the company’s performance and operations to analyze why investors should hold this stock for now.Probable HeadwindsDENSTPLY SIRONA expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous projection of $2.70-$2.80. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings is currently pegged at $2.57 per share, significantly lower than management’s expectations.DENTSPLY SIRONA expects gross margins and operating margins to be flat to slightly down as underlying margin rate improvement in businesses is expected to be offset by foreign exchange effects and the headwind from the target inventory equipment reductions. By the end of the first quarter of 2018, the company confirmed that it expects full-year 2018 operating margins to be down between 100 and 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis.DENTSPLY SIRONA has significant international foothold, particularly in Europe. Therefore, a strengthening U.S. dollar, especially against the euro, as well as emerging market currencies negatively impacts the company’s results. We believe that the currency volatility will remain a headwind for 2018. The company also faces significant pricing pressure due to intensifying competition.What’s Favoring the Stock?DENTSPLY SIRONA's innovations have been consistently driving its top line. Per management, the company spends more than $150 million in R&D and thus has a robust pipeline. Furthermore, efforts of DENTSPLY SIRONA’s laser team in accelerating major innovations deserve a mention.The company’s commitment to clinical education is also praiseworthy. DENSTPLY SIRONA plans to open a state-of-the-art training center in Charlotte, NC that will help it reach more than 10,000 dental professionals per year. Moreover, its European center in Bensheim, Germany will be able to directly communicate to above 25,000 practitioners a year, supplementing its continuing education efforts. Notably, DENTSPLY SIRONA is coming up with its new Dental Academy, in the second half of 2018.Management is bullish about the recently completed the acquisition of OraMetrix. OraMetrix software uniquely integrates digital scanning, 2D and 3D x-rays to create customized individual treatment plans for orthodontic patients. Lately, at the American Association of Orthodontists, the company launched a full clear liner and integration of OraMetrix and Omnicam, which witnessed positive reviews.Bottom lineUnhindered by the persistent issues, analysts are optimistic about DENTSPLY SIRONA.For current-quarter revenues, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 3.8%.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

55,XRAY,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 results, scheduled for release on Nov 3, are expected to show lackluster performance by dental consumables and laboratories — one of the major revenue-generating components. While this could majorly impact third-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at other segments should help the company post solid numbers.Last quarter, DENTSPLY’s earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The quarter posted lackluster results in dental and healthcare consumables segment that comprises preventive, restorative, instruments, endodontic and laboratory dental products as well as consumable medical device products. Sales increased just 1.9% to $554.1 million in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for dental consumables and laboratories stands at $520 million for the third quarter. This reflects a decline of almost 6.5% from the last reported quarter. Notably, DENTSPLY has been grappling with issues pertaining to equipment inventory levels at certain distributor bases. Furthermore, unfavorable consumer trend is likely to mar sales at the segment. DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this release.View Upbeat: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for DENTSPLY’s third-quarter earnings stands at 67 cents per share, signifying year-over-year growth of 1.1%. For revenues, the consensus estimate stands at $978.4 million, up 2.5% year over year. The company has been witnessing a rebound in Asia, particularly Japan, along with strong growth in Russia. However, the company lowered its outlook for the year. In fact, DENTSPLY’s results in the first half of the year have lagged expectations.Domestic Market Holds Promise: We are upbeat about the gradual recovery in the U.S. market. The emerging markets provide significant opportunities for the company as these areas are vastly untapped with low dental product penetration. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the region stands at $335 million, up 1.5% year over year. Apart from the United States, Europe has been a significant revenue contributor, with internal growth of 2.3% in the last quarter.Buoyed by the bullish trends, our quantitative model shows an earnings beat for DENTSPLY this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. QuoteSegmental DetailsThe business is organized into two reporting segments — Dental & Healthcare Consumables and Technologies.Dental & Healthcare ConsumablesThe segment comprises preventive, restorative, instruments, endodontic and laboratory dental products as well as consumable medical device products.Net sales improved 6.2% to $447.8 million in the segment, while it declined 0.4% at cc.Technologies & Equipment segmentTechnologies consist of dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic products.The metric increased 6.1% to $508.3 million in the segment on a year-over-year basis. However, revenues were down 5.8% at cc.Geographic DetailsIn the quarter, sales in the United States fell 6.9% to $291.8 million year over year.

Operating margin in the quarter contracted 220 bps to 7.2% of net revenues.Guidance Management expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 in the range of $2.55-$2.65, down from the previous range of $2.70-$2.80. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $2.71 per share, significantly higher than management’s expectations.Revenues are projected to rise 2% at cc. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $4.23 billion.In ConclusionDENTSPLY exited the first quarter on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the counts. Robust performance by the company’s flagship dental implants, CAD/CAM systems, imaging systems, treatment centers and orthodontic product platforms hold considerable promise over the long haul. Emerging markets like Asia-Pacific & the Middle East offer healthy growth opportunities on a long-term basis, as they remain vastly untapped with low dental products penetration. The company’s agreements with MedTech bigwig Patterson Companies in Canada are likely to drive sales. DENTSPLY recently witnessed a rebound in sales in Asia, particularly Japan, and strong growth in Russia.On the flip side, a lowered guidance is indicative of looming concerns. The company's higher capital expenditure on product development and tough competition are expected to exert pressure on margins. Unfavorable foreign exchange rate and integration risks are major headwinds for the near term.Q1 Earnings of MedTech Majors at a GlanceA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Baxter International Inc.

57,XRAY,"On Oct 11, we issued an updated research report on New York-based DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) — a global leader in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of dental consumables and dental laboratory products.DENTSPLY recently announced the renewal of an existing distribution agreement with Henry Schein Canada, Inc, which will continue till Dec 31, 2020. Henry Schein's agreement with DENTSPLY was initiated in August 2005.We feel that the deal extension is a smart move by DENTSPLY as the preexisting agreement did not include the CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system and the Schick line of imaging sensors. By including the aforementioned lines of products, the company will benefit from Henry Schein’s distribution network in Canada.Among the recent developments, DENTSPLY announced the renewal of its partnership with Pacific Dental Services. The duo’s latest agreement extends for a period of five years which was signed in 2012.This move is also a strategic one as Pacific Dental’s network consists of over 580 centers across 17 states. During the tenure of the present agreement, management expects the number of such offices utilizing DENTSPLY technologies to exceed 800.DENTSPLY’s dual branding strategy, product innovation, growth opportunities in emerging markets (especially Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa), diversified product portfolio and recurring revenue base are key catalysts. The company expects a solid guidance for full-year 2017 projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $2.65-$2.75.On the flip side, apart from a series of macroeconomic headwinds, currency fluctuation continues to be a major dampener. In fact, strengthening of the U.S. dollar against Euro and other emerging market currencies has dented the company’s growth trajectory. Furthermore, higher capital expenditure on product development is expected to keep margins under pressure.Share Price & Estimate Revisions Lack LusterDENTSPLY's estimate revision trend looks unfavorable at the moment. For the third quarter, two analysts moved south, compared to no upward revision in the last two months. Notably, the current quarter estimates dropped 1.5% to 67 cents per share over the last 60 days.DENTSPLY’s share price movement has been unfavorable over the last three months. The company shed 11.7%, much higher than the industry’s decline of 4.4%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksDENTSPLY currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO  -  Free Report). Abbott, IDEXX Laboratories and Thermo Fisher carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Abbott has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10.7%. The stock has rallied roughly 35.2% over a year.IDEXX Laboratories has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 19.8%.

58,XRAY,"Over the past few months, the medical device space has been witnessing considerable upheaval owing to a confluence of factors. This has affected the fortunes of MedTech bigwigs like Cardinal Health Inc (CAH  -  Free Report), DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc (XRAY  -  Free Report) and Penumbra Inc (PEN  -  Free Report).The investment climate for medical device majors has become increasingly volatile due to political potshots in Capitol Hill, for and against Obamacare. This is due to the fact that the GOP is making one final push on an Affordable Care Act repeal bill. The legislation, commonly referred to as Graham-Cassidy, aims to convert the Medicaid and premium subsidy dollars into a block-grant structure giving freedom of spending to states.Past fortnight has witnessed extensive lobbying for and against the Graham-Cassidy bill by legislators to garner for and against the required 50 votes at the Senate. The trend is expected to continue till September 30. Earlier, Obamacare assured coverage to people with pre-existing ailments and restricted insurers from charging them based on health conditions.The Senate Bill, however, will allow insurers to provide less-than-required coverage in states that get waivers for essential health benefits. However, the changes would not take effect until 2020 but would slash Medicaid budgets to the tune of almost 25% by 2026.How Is MedTech Positioned?Though the space remains volatile, there are many stocks in the MedTech domain that promise growth. The question now arises that how to pick  safe stocks from the various industries of the MedTech space, in such a scenario. Within the Zacks Industry classification, it is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into important areas like Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products and Medical - Dental Supplies.Screening CriteriaIn this article, we have picked a winner from each of the aforementioned areas that have traded higher than the S&P 500 index through the past one year. Also, based on their strong fundamentals, strategic implementation, planned execution and certain positive catalysts, they carry a huge upside potential and a high probability of outperforming the S&P 500 index in the coming days.These stocks currently flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows investors to eliminate negative aspects of stocks and select favorable ones. Their market capitalization is in multi-billions, testifying to their strong liquidity.The 2017 estimate revision trend is significantly positive and earnings growth expectation is above the S&P 500. Finally, the industry’s lower-than-market positioning calls for more upside to offset any further volatility in Capitol Hill.Medical - Dental SuppliesThe Dental Supplies industry is currently ranked #185. It fell from last week’s #170. The industry has underperformed the S&P 500 by shedding 0.25% over the past month. The index, on the other hand, has gained 1.94%. By applying Zacks wisdom in this space, we are bullish on STAAR Surgical Company (STAA  -  Free Report).Monrovia, CA-based Staar Surgical develops, manufactures and distributes products used by ophthalmologists and other eye care professionals to improve or correct vision in patients suffering from refractive conditions, cataracts and glaucoma. With a price surge of approximately 14.06% over the last six months, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick. Earnings for this company are expected to grow 9.25% over the next five-year period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Medical – InstrumentsThe Instruments industry is currently ranked #97. It fell from last week’s #88. The industry has underperformed the S&P 500 by registering a gain of only 0.97% over the past month. The index has gained only 1.94%. In this space, we are bullish on Masimo Corporation (MASI  -  Free Report).Irvine, CA-based Masimo develops, manufactures and markets a family of non-invasive monitoring systems. With a price surge of approximately 27.26% year to date, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick. Earnings for this company are expected to grow 11.10% over the next five-year period.Medical – ProductsThe Products industry is currently ranked #174, falling from #161 during last week.  The industry has underperformed the S&P 500 by registering a gain of only 1.80% over the past month. The index on the other hand has rose 1.94%%. In this space, we are bullish on Smith & Nephew plc (SNN  -  Free Report).Smith & Nephew, headquartered in London, U.K., is a manufacturer and distributor of advanced medical devices in the sports medicine, joint reconstruction, trauma and wound management areas. With a price surge of approximately 19.68% year to date, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick. Earnings for this company are expected to grow 9.09% this year. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

"
60,XRAY,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8. Last quarter, the company’s earnings met estimates. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, the average positive surprise being 1%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayOver the last few quarters, Henry Schein demonstrated solid growth across all four segments — Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in North America and overseas. We expect the trend to continue in the first quarter.Favorable Dental Business Trend: The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is encouraging. In this regard, management believes the company is well-positioned to gain from the ongoing trend of digitalization in the global dental market. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues of $3.17 billion reflects an increase of 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we are also upbeat about management’s expectations about the sustained dental equipment business growth in Europe and other regions.Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Starting Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of DENTSPLY SIRONA’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to a considerable extent. Also, per management, this agreement is expected to prove accretive to earnings per share from this year onward. Thus, we are looking forward to the deal’s contribution to Henry Schein’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. Quote In addition, Henry Schein continues to distribute products from Planmeca, 3Shape and 3M as well as the dental equipment and consumer product lines of its longstanding partner Danaher under the KaVo Kerr brands.Solid Animal Health Portfolio: We are optimistic about the well-diversified Animal Health product portfolio featuring software, diagnostic equipment and surgical instruments. The product offerings have been driving growth domestically as well as globally.Notably, during the fourth quarter of 2017, Henry Schein acquired Merritt Veterinary Supplies and integrated it into its Animal Health business. Merritt has 4,500 veterinary clinics in Eastern United States, with a strong presence in the Southeastern part of the nation. The company offers a comprehensive line of products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and equipment. However, according to Henry Schein, this acquisition will drive earnings this year onward. Thus, we are looking forward to the deal’s contribution to Henry Schein’s financials in the to-be-reported quarter.Growing Medical Business: Henry Schein is consistently working on boosting its Medical segment. Notably, worldwide Medical revenues rose 2.6% year over year in the fourth quarter. Last October, the company inked an agreement with Cerebral Assessment Systems to distribute Cognivue. This is the first computerized cognitive assessment screening device cleared by the FDA for the detection of early signs of dementia. We believe this development will bolster the company’s presence in the field of mental cognitive diseases.Broad Distribution Network: We are also upbeat about the company’s widespread distribution network. Apart from North America and Europe, the company has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in the emerging nations of China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland. We believe Henry Schein will continue to ride on the strength of its broad distribution network in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, at the beginning of March, Henry Schein signed a distribution agreement with Grifols, enabling the former to market and distribute the latter's 500mL Normal Saline solution (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) in the United States. With growing demand for saline products in the U.S. market, we believe this partnership will prove beneficial for Henry Schein.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margin performance over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of -0.36%.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 92 cents reflects a rise of 4.5% year over year.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Brady Corporation (BRC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank #2.
