4,VFC,"Just as an ace baseball pitcher mixes his throws, top mutual fund managers vary their investments. Managers of Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund are mingling semiconductor stocks with biotech stocks, online travel agencies and a Chinese fast-food chain, all to good effect. That's been a benefit to investors with retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $3.3 billion fund is working its way back toward its multiyear top-notch outperformance. This year going into Wednesday, the fund's 8.97% gain topped 62% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the 5.75% advance by the S&P 500.That's an improvement over its showing during the past 12 months, when the fund outpaced just 54% of its direct rivals with a nonetheless decent 15.49% rise. So its year-to-date relative performance is a turn back toward what it accomplished over the past three years, when it beat 89% of its direct rivals.A key piece of credit goes to the fund's stake in technology stocks, which was the portfolio's largest sector as of Feb. 28 with a 34% weighting, nearly double the second-largest sector then, consumer discretionary. The S&P 500 has a tech weighting of 20%.The fund's semiconductor stocks include Lam Research (LRCX), up 19% so far this year; Micron Technology (MU), up 22% this year; and Broadcom (AVGO), up 18%.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Its 99 Composite Rating is the highest possible, and its earnings per share growth has accelerated for four quarters in a row. See how its additional easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' at IBD's Stock Checkup.Biotech bets include Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), up 56%, and Celgene (CELG), up 8%. Two of the fund's consumer discretionary plays are online travel agencies Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (EXPE), which are up 19% and 14% respectively this year.And China-based restaurant chain Yum China (YUMC) is another security to like in the consumer discretionary space, up 25% this year.They've also trying to make plays with multicategory straddlers Alibaba (BABA) and Amazon (AMZN).Lam has benefited from two trends. One is the growing complexity in some semiconductors and their manufacturing equipment, says Peter Deininger, one of three managers of the fund. The second is consolidation in the semiconductor equipment space. That has cut inventory volatility, and smoothed out industry cycles. ""That means higher margins and higher returns for Lam,"" Deininger said.In addition, Lam is a leader in the etching and deposition segment of the semiconductor equipment field. ""That's helped them increase market share at a rate in excess of other players,"" Deininger said. ""Combined, all of this has put the company in a good situation, which we anticipate has legs to go.""Micron makes memory and data-storage devices. Its industry has gone through enough consolidation that pricing is stable to rising in Micron's key DRAM and NAND products, Deininger says. That leads to rising margins, he adds.Industrywide, with earnings and share prices doing so well last year, might the segment be near a top? That could explain the recent pullback in this space, which affected Micron among other stocks.But Deininger is not ready to retreat yet. ""There continues to be very balanced supply, pricing remains firm, and lead times for products are modestly extended,"" he said. ""Combined with a lack of significant new capacity, that argues that (share-price strength) should hold for some time going forward.""Fund manager Tchintcia Barros likes Vertex's existing treatments for cystic fibrosis as well as another in development. Vertex gapped up 20% on March 29 amid news about favorable results in a late-stage trial for that new treatment, a combination therapy. Vertex plans to add another drug to create a three-drug cocktail that could treat thousands more cystic fibrosis patients, Barros says.""Several months ago, a competitor (Galapagos) created some fears (among investors) around whether Vertex would have that portfolio of treatments to itself,"" Barros said. ""But data show that (Galapagos) is three years behind Vertex.""The fund's managers have mixed feelings about the consumer discretionary space. On the one hand, since the end of last year they have shifted to an underweight from an overweight in the sector vs. the Russell 1000 Growth Index.They've sold out of positions in branded apparel manufacturer VF (VFC), yogawear chain store Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and pharmacy operator CVS Health (CVS). ""Online companies have put a lot of pressure on traditional retail areas,"" manager John Wilson said.On the other hand, the fund still likes online travel agencies Priceline and Expedia.And the managers like Yum China as a pure play on China restaurant stocks.Yum China gapped up 9% on April 6, the day it released first-quarter financial results. Earnings per share grew 19%. Despite a 1% slip in sales, sales nosed above the consensus estimate. The company opened 133 new stores in the quarter, including its Little Sheep and East Dawning outlets.In its guidance for fiscal 2017, the company said it would open at least 550 new stores and that operating profit would grow at a double-digit pace.Yum Brands (YUM) — which the fund also holds — said it had completed its spinoff of Yum China on Nov. 1, 2016. Since they began trading that day, shares in the new company are up 25%.RELATED: Why This Top Columbia Fund Loads Up On These Stock LeadersYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

5,VFC,"Confirming earlier reports, Under Armour (UA) said Monday that it has clinched a 10-year deal to be the official on-field uniform provider of Major League Baseball, starting in 2020.Financial terms weren't disclosed, but the contract is a major first for the apparel and footwear brand — its first professional sports league deal.Last year, Under Armour was reportedly one of the names vying to outfit the National Basketball Association after Adidas decided not to renew its partnership, but Nike (NKE) ultimately won out. (Under Armour struck a deal to become the official outfitter of the NBA Draft Combine, however, starting in 2018.)Under the deal, licensed sports merchandise company Fanatics will manage the manufacturing and distribution of both Under Armour and Fanatics fan gear at retail, according to Under Armour.Under Armour will also provide the pro baseball league's players with its Connected Fitness offerings, which currently include a fitness band, smart scale and heart-rate monitor.The companies will replace VF (VFC)-owned Majestic Athletics. VF said in March that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its licensed sports group business, a division that includes Majestic.In a statement, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank called the deal a ""watershed moment"" for the brand. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, San Francisco Giants catcher Buster Posey and Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper are just a few of Under Armour's MLB endorsers, and viewer enthusiasm for baseball reached fever pitch this year as the Chicago Cubs won the World Series for the first time since 1908.Shares of Under Armour rose 1.4% to 30.44 in the stock market today.Meanwhile, Nike received an upgrade from HSBC to buy from hold and a price target bump to 60 from 56. The bank acknowledges that the stock is the worst performer on the Dow this year, but the ""reality isn't that grim,"" and Nike ""could be a good stock or 2017 ... and beyond.""IBD'S TAKE: Some fear that Nike's innovation streak is slowing, but a recent patent-application dump from the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office show that the Swoosh has some futuristic offerings in the works.""The company epitomizes, in our view, the 'captain of industry' status in a growth sector, and even though we accept that alternative brands may be gaining share at times, we feel the company is still poised for superior growth and returns long term,"" wrote HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg in a Monday note.Nike shares climbed 2.75% to 51.85, retaking their 50-day average for the first time in three months.RELATED:Major League: Under Armour-MLB Deal Means It's Here To Play BallUnder Armour Challenges Nike Dominance With NBA Deal

23,VFC,"""Buy on fundamentals and technicals, but sell on technicals alone.”You might have heard that expression at an IBD workshop on investing principles or at a Meetup group event.The saying carries a heavy degree of significance in short selling as well. Numerous books have noted how some accomplished short sellers take a magnifying glass to a company’s financial statements and operations, discover fraud, sell the stock short, then wait for a profit as more investors catch on.IBD’s strategy? Focus on the chart action (i.e., the ""technicals"") of a former big winner and determine if the bias among large investors -- mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, banks -- have switched from enthusiastic buying to anxious selling.When these players have become big sellers, the reasons may already have a lot to do with the fundamentals.An institutional investor will eventually lose confidence that a company will continue to smash Wall Street’s estimates on earnings and sales. Perhaps the forecasts themselves have gotten overly optimistic.Because high-growth stocks tend to show above-average price-to-earnings ratios, they tend to fall fast on even the slightest disappointment in quarterly sales, profits, margins or forecasts for these numbers in the current or next quarter.As noted in Investor’s Corner columns at the start of this year, make sure you are only targeting stocks that have made huge runs of 300% to 400% or more in price. Make sure they are highly liquid.Also, grow familiar with the head-and-shoulders pattern, as well as the price-and-volume action of a former market winner that breaks out of a flawed late-stage base, then quickly triggers sell signals such as the 8% stop-loss rule.Timberland enjoyed a hefty run from its October 1998 low of 7.02 (adjusted for two 2-for-1 splits) to a high of 74.25 in January 2001.The boot maker’s fundamentals justified the gains: Net sales ballooned from $690 million in 1996 to $1.09 billion in 2000. Profits zoomed 536% over that period, from 45 cents a share to $2.86.Yet as the broader market topped, so did Timberland. The stock built a six-month head-and-shoulders pattern that featured at least three touches of the falling 10-week moving average.In the week ended May 25, 2001, a short sale near 48.69 as Timberland swung back below the 10-week moving average produced a 25% gain just three weeks later. The stock's lofty 96 EPS Rating and SMR grade of A did not matter.By September, Timberland slid 65% below its 74.25 peak as its top and bottom lines stumbled. It was acquired by VFC Corp. (VFC) in 2011.

24,VFC,"Nike (NKE) bumped off fast-fashion name Topshop this year as the most-searched-for fashion brand on Polyvore, but Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6 held on to its title as the No. 1 searched tech gadget on Yahoo (YHOO), according to the search engine's 2015 Year in Review.Polyvore, the shopping site recently acquired by Yahoo, called out Nike and Adidas as the hottest brands among its users, a signal ""athleisure"" — that is, the practice of donning activewear outside of the gym — remains fashionable.Analysts feel a bit differently about the Air Jordan maker, however, with both Barclays and Goldman Sachs removing Nike from their conviction buy lists. Goldman Sachs noted Wednesday that it maintains a ""bullish view on long-term fundamentals"" but sees less near-term upside to its price target following recent outperformance.Both firms now rate the stock as buy.Nike shares ended the session down 0.5% in the stock market Wednesday.Topshop, last year's top brand on Polyvore, is nowhere to be found on this year's list. Neither are fellow fast-fashion labels H&M and Forever 21. Instead, high-end names including Fendi, Givenchy, and Christian Louboutin show up on the rankings.Nike-owned Converse and VF (VFC)-owned Vans also make prominent appearances.In tech, Apple's iPhone 6 retains top honors on Yahoo, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 10. And, in constant anticipation of the next big thing, the yet-to-be-unveiled iPhone 7 came in third. (Rumor has it the iPhone 7 could be both waterproof and dustproof.)The Samsung Galaxy S6 and Apple Watch rounded out the top five, with Apple products ultimately accounting for half of the top-10 list.Yahoo's annual review included a number of other hot lists, such as ""Top Searched Cocktails"" (Old Fashioned), ""Top Searched Presidential Hopefuls"" (Carly Fiorina) and Tumblr's ""Top Solo Artists"" (Taylor Swift).The most buzzed-about obsession/craze on Yahoo in 2015?

Meanwhile Marathon Petroleum (MPC) agreed to buy Andeavor (ANDV) and create the largest U.S.-based refiner. Additionally, Walmart (WMT) said its U.K. chain Asda will merge with Sainsbury's.

PayPal (PYPL) tumbled as Amazon (AMZN) reportedly offered merchants discounts to use its own payment service.The controversy over Kanye West's comments about slavery have tangled up Adidas (ADDYY), after the CEO of the No. 2 sportswear company distanced himself but would not cut ties with the rapper.

Meanwhile, Under Armour (UAA) topped estimates but gave a weak outlook as Susquehanna said inventories are a ""ticking time bomb."" Coach and Kate Spade parent Tapestry (TPR) topped Q3 consensus.

34,VFC,"Teenagers' love for streetwear and the 1990s is only growing, and that means good news for a few apparel brands whose heydays happened before those high schoolers were even born.Lest sister-models Gigi and Bella Hadid haven't clued you in, Piper Jaffray's latest semiannual teens survey pegged both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein as brands that made ""significant upwards moves"" in their top 20 list, with Calvin Klein holding on to its No. 10 spot as the preferred handbag brand for average-income teens, and Tommy Hilfiger remaining popular among teen boys. (Gigi and Bella have endorsement deals with Tommy and Calvin, respectively.)This reads as good news for PVH (PVH), one of the biggest players in the apparel space, and the parent of both '90s sweethearts.Tommy Hilfiger alone makes up 44% of the company's sales. Together with fellow '90s staple Calvin Klein, the two brands account for over 80% of PVH's revenue and 90% of PVH's earnings before interest and taxes, according to the company's latest figures. PVH raked in $8.9 billion in reported revenue in fiscal 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd as Bloomberg reports, Tommy Hilfiger has actively been courting younger shoppers through Hadid, social media and TommyNow, a ""see now, buy now"" offering that makes its latest runway designs available immediately.PVH currently has an exclusive partnership with Macy's (M) in men's sportswear. It's also joined forces in Canada with Hudson's Bay Company, the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. In North America, Tommy Hilfiger has licensed its womenswear wholesale business to G-III (GIII).PVH closed up 1.5% at 157.95 in the stock market today, nearly back above a 158.06 flat-base buy point. G-III advanced 1% to 38.96, flirting with retaking a 39.04 entry in a double-bottom base. Macy's climbed 0.5% to 29.30, as it works on a flat base with a 31.14 buy point.The Piper Jaffray survey also pointed to ""unprecedented"" momentum for VF (VFC) brand Vans. The shoe line ""continues to find traction across all demographic/socioeconomic groups and categories.""From the fall of 2016, Vans' share of upper-income teens' favor has grown to 16% — a new peak — from 9% and remains No. 2.VF Corp. stock rose 2.4% to 77.92, back above its 50-day line in a flat base.While retaining its monster lead, Nike (NKE) has lost turf over that time, slipping to 42% from 51%. But Vans is increasingly popular with teen girls, and Piper Jaffray notes that Vans ""appears to be taking mindshare from NKE's Converse brand in canvas.""Adidas (ADDYY), another purveyor of throwback footwear fashion, is sitting pretty in third place with gains of its own, now up to 14% from 6% just a year and a half ago.Nike stock fell 0.3%, but found support at its 50-day line in a flat base. Adidas climbed 1.8% to a new high.The nostalgia train isn't picking up everyone. Ralph Lauren (RL) lost its place in the survey's top 10 among upper-income teen boys, a first since Piper Jaffray started issuing the poll in 2002.And the '90s are eating into modern-day brands. In a separate survey, B. Riley FBR analysts found that Under Armour (UAA), a stock which halved its value in 2017, is waning in popularity, particularly with women and teens.Piper Jaffray, for its part, said Under Armour is being ""boxed out by resurgent Adidas and retro-category growth.""Perhaps the most striking example: once-popular athletic-sweats maker Champion, in the midst of its own '90s comeback, jumped from No. 44 to No. 10 among upper-income teen boys over the last half year. It managed to nab two votes from upper-income teen girls naming their favorite clothing brands.Under Armour, by contrast, received but one.Still, Under Armour stock rose 1.1%.

35,VFC,"Under Armour (UA) kicked up the pace of its athletic footwear sales last week, leaving larger rival Nike (NKE) trailing as the trendy sportswear brand struck a chord with pre-Black Friday shoppers.But Nike shares raced past rivals Friday, following its announcement Thursday that it will buy back $12 billion in stock, raise its dividend and enact a 2-for-1 stock split.In the week ended Nov. 14, Under Armour's athletic footwear sales rocketed 194.9% from a year earlier, according to a report by Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner, citing data from market researcher SportScanInfo.Under Armour ""accelerated further on the back of strong Curry Two (basketball shoe) sales,"" Weiner noted.Nike saw athletic footwear sales rise 7.5%. Adidas, including its Reebok brand, saw a 1% decline, though Adidas brand sales were up 8.8% and Reebok's were down 39.9%.Skechers USA (SKX), which is expanding into athletic footwear, saw sales climb 19%.Under Armour shares closed up 3.1% on the stock market today. Nike jumped 5.5%. Skechers, which said Thursday that it won a favorable ruling in a Nike lawsuit, closed down 0.5%.Total athletic footwear sales ""accelerated"" last week to a 10.4% gain from a year earlier. After three straight weeks of declines, basketball shoe sales rebounded with a 13.9% gain.Top sellers in the basketball category and across athletic footwear included Nike's Jordan Retro 8 and 7 and Under Armour's Curry Two, Weiner noted.The running shoe category also rebounded last week with a 6.3% rise, and the casual athletic shoe category kept its ""leadership position"" with a 21% jump in sales as Nike's Air Force 1 and Skechers After Burn platforms ""continued to resonate,"" Weiner noted.While Under Armour has gained traction with consumers via big-name endorsements and expansion in running, basketball and training categories, its stock lost traction Tuesday after sporting goods retailer Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), a major seller of Under Armour products, reported earnings that missed views.In a note out Tuesday, Piper Jaffray said Armour gets 14.4% of its sales from Dick's, while Nike gets 2% of sales from the athletic retailer and VF Corp. (VFC) likely gets less than 2%.
"
36,VFC,"Athletic apparel retailer Under Armour (UA) faces the biggest risk from Dick's Sporting Goods' (DKS) dismal Q3 and darker outlook issued Tuesday, Piper Jaffray said in a note, with the investment firm suggesting that rival brands such as Nike (NKE) and VF Corp. (VFC) were more insulated.Under Armour gets 14.4% of its sales from Dick's, Piper Jaffray said, while Nike gets 2% of sales from the athletic retailer and VF Corp. likely draws less than 2%.Dick's said in its Q3 earnings release that inventory rose 13.1% during the quarter, and that it was ""working with its vendors to reduce its exposure to slow-selling merchandise by returning product, canceling orders and securing markdown allowances.""""While we note that this will throw yet another cautionary blanket on the athletic vendor group,"" Piper Jaffray said, ""we believe it is important to gauge exposure and risk appropriately. Not all brands are created equal.""Shares of Under Armour fell 5.6% to 85 on the stock market today, closing below its 200-day moving average for the first time since April 2013.Nike and VF Corp. didn't fare as badly, down 0.7% and 1.3%, respectively. VF Corp. has a variety of apparel brands, from Nautica to Vans to Wrangler jeans.Dick's gapped down 10.5% to 36.53 after tumbling as low as 33.42, the worst since January 2012. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) sank 4.8% to a 5-year low. Hibbett Sports reports earnings on Friday.Warm Weather Chills SalesDick's also said that its fourth quarter would be marked by a ""more promotional environment"" and that it will work to ""actively manage our inventory levels."" The rise in inventory, Sterne Agee CRT said in a note Tuesday, was likely in part due to ""slow selling cold weather product"".Dick's CEO Edward Stack said in the earnings release that ""record warm weather in more seasonal categories"" offset a stronger showing in athletic apparel, footwear and accessories. He also said that same-store sales growth in the quarter initially got a boost from the back-to-school season but that sales fizzled as the quarter progressed.Macy's (M) and other retailers also have warned of excess inventory due to warm weather.Dick's consolidated Q3 same-store sales grew 0.4%, well below expectations of 1.9%. Dick's earnings per share increased around 10% to 45 cents, missing views by a cent. Net sales rose 7.6% to $1.642 billion, just beating estimates.The company sees full-year EPS of $2.85-$3.00, well below Street forecasts for $3.20. Dick's said it expects Q4 EPS of $1.10-1.25, well short of views for $1.41.The results came a week after Piper Jaffray cut its price target on Under Armour to 97 from 105, citing the company's recent management shake-ups.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

70,VFC,"Apparel conglomerate VF Corp (VFC) — whose many brands include North Face, Nautica, Dickies, Vans and Wrangler — just fell short of analyst expectations early Friday with its fourth-quarter results.X Estimates: Profit growth of 5% to $1.02 a share on 10% sales gains to $3.66 billion.Results: VF Corp earned $1.01 a share, up 4%. Revenue was $3.65 billionStock: Shares fell 11% to 74.63 on the stock market today, plunging below their 50-day moving average in the heaviest volume since October 2016. Aside from a 1-day dip in September, VF Corp hadn't closed below its 50-day since last June. That high-volume break of the 50-day is a clear sell signal.VF hit a record high Thursday.Among other notable apparel stocks, Canada Goose (GOOS) fell 1 cent, PVH (PVH) fell 2% and G-III Apparel (GIII) was up 2 cents.Piper Jaffray said last week that VF Corp was making ""significant inroads"" with Amazon (AMZN) in cleaning up unauthorized third-party distribution of its products on the e-commerce site — and said it ""would not be surprised"" if VF announced a deeper first-party merchant partnership with Amazon soon.VF got an upgrade to buy from Stifel Nicolaus on Monday for its healthy inventories, favorable foreign exchange rates, plus strong consumer sentiment and spending power.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. Apparel makers have been facing a crowded market in the U.S. Under Armour (UAA), for example, beat forecasts earlier this week but is said to still need time for a full turnaround in North America.Parka maker Canada Goose beat quarterly forecasts last week, but shares fell amid indications that expectations had become sky high, overshadowing a solid performance.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: These 3 Hot Stocks Plus Food Giants Lead Earnings: Investing Action PlanNike Rises As Bill Ackman Discloses Pershing Square StakeRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News FANG Stocks News & Quotes How To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. Wait for the stock to set up and breakout from a new chart pattern and buy point. Also understand that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Canada Goose saw both earnings and sales growth rise last quarter. Earnings-per-share increased from 0% to 15%. Revenue rose from 22% to 80%.

107,VFC,"Under Armour (UA) has been on a winning streak as endorsers Jordan Spieth and Steph Curry triumph in golf and basketball, respectively, but will the Nike (NKE) rival score again when it reports on Thursday?Analysts expect revenue to grow 25% to $761.6 million, while earnings are seen falling 37.5% to 5 cents, which would mark the second consecutive quarter of profit declines. In Q1, earnings fell 17%.As ""athleisure"" — think yoga pants, sweat-wicking tops and colorful sneakers — continues to dominate the weekend warrior wardrobe, activewear companies such as Under Armour, Nike, Foot Locker (FL) and others have benefitted from the trend.Athletic footwear, in particular, is the ""earnings season trend to play"" in Q2, says Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole in a Friday note.""Valuation remains at a high peak, but our view is as long as UA's 2Q report indicates its story is getting better, and we think it will, the stock should rise,"" he said of Under Armour specifically.Under Armour has also made a foray into the white-hot wearables space, currently led by fitness band IPO Fitbit (FIT) and kept in the headlines by the Apple (AAPL) Watch.But the Grip, backed by Under Armour and HTC, will reportedly be delayed in its rollout. The wearable is now expected to debut later in the year alongside a suite of health and fitness products, said HTC on Thursday.Fitbit shares dipped 1.3% Friday to 47.17. Apple rose 0.8% to 129.57. Shares of Under Armour rose about 2% to 87.20. The stock slid more than 3% Thursday following a downgrade from OTR Global, citing delivery delays and poor weather that led to below-plan domestic apparel sales. But Under Armour recovered Friday to close the week still within buy territory with a buy point of 86.40.BB&T Capital Markets remains bullish, lifting Under Armour's price target to 98 on Wednesday as it anticipates a ""solid"" earnings report, updated guidance at its investor day in September, and the upcoming stock split. (In mid June, the company announced a new class of non-voting Class C common stock, which will have the same effect as a 2-for-1 split.)Spieth and Curry's wins are believed to have driven direct-to-consumer sales in Q2, wrote BB&T analyst Corinna Freedman.A member of IBD's Apparel-Clothing Manufacturing industry group, Under Armour boasts a 94 Composite Rating, which means it has outperformed 94% of publicly traded companies in a mix of technical and fundamental factors.Fellow group member VF (VFC) reports Q2 results on Friday.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter: @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Under Armour Up As Jordan Spieth Collects Another WinCrystal Slippers To Air Jordans: Shoes Still A Smart Buy.

110,VFC,"Stocks continued the selling yesterday - even in the face of so many earnings beats that we heard throughout the morning and the day….commodities also continued to come under pressure and now seem to be in a clear 'sell at any price' mode……this mindset is what is causing equities to come under pressure as traders and investors look to raise cash from other assets - and since equities are closer to teasing the highs - it makes some sense to raise cash here.

Overnight - commodities got a further kick in the head after HSBC/Markit's China PMI fell to 48.2, down from 49.4 (a 15-month low) ....this number says that manufacturing has not yet stabilized in China which only causes analysts and investor to question the validity of Q2 GDP growth of 7%.......Hmmmmmmm

114,VFC,"Which now brings up next week's release of U.S. Q2 GDP! In addition to more earnings next week - we will also get a range of economic data to help us navigate the waters…the big one is next Thursday's release of Q2 GDP - which is expected to show an increase of 2.4% - this after the gov't conveniently found a new way of computing the results. Read what San Francisco Fed President Williams had to say:
"
115,VFC,"""The government agency that computes GDP and related economic statistics, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, uses a bottom-up method to account for seasonal adjustments to arrive at its overall numbers. They do this for a number of reasons that are appropriate for their purposes. But for monetary policy, it's preferable to have the most accurate reflection of the broader economy….. To get a measure that avoids seasonal patterns, SF Fed economists ran a second round of seasonal adjustment, not just on GDP, but on gross domestic income (GDI) and something called GDP Plus, a new measure of economy-wide activity that combines GDP and GDI and strips out the extraneous noise. After making this modification for recurring seasonal patterns, the data show GDP actually grew about 1½ percent in the first quarter. GDI and GDP Plus grew at about 3 and 2¾ percent, respectively. Based on these revised numbers, and relative to trend growth of around 2 percent, the first quarter appears to have been more or less on track. More recent data on spending have also been encouraging, indicating the economy is still on a solid trajectory with a good deal of forward momentum. Looking forward, I expect growth to average about 2¾ percent for the remainder of the year, then slow to a more sustainable pace next year.""
"
116,VFC,"So what does it all mean? It means that the administration will 'massage' the numbers until they get what they want…..and if they get a number they don't like - then they will massage it some more until they get the reaction they want! I mean - they must be taking a lesson from China 101 - ' How to produce a positive GDP - just make it up'.
"
117,VFC,"From a technical perspective - for the Dow - the 50 dma is now beginning to trend downwards towards a rising 200 dma……a couple of more days of this indiscriminate selling and we could have what we know as the 'death cross' - when the 50 dma breaks below the 200 dma - a technical sign of more difficult times ahead….I think it is too early to call that - and in fact I do not believe it will happen.
"
118,VFC,"The S&P 500 on the other hand is not confirming that at all - both its 50 and 200 dma continue to trend flat to upwards. The test will be how the S&P finishes out the month… (considering that it did breach its long term support earlier in the month amid all of the Greek drama) - so next week will be about more earnings and some 'window dressing' as PM's doll up their portfolios.
"
119,VFC,"Overnight in Asia - the markets ended the week in negative territory - as they got slammed from all sides.....U.S. markets ended lower. Commodities still under pressure and lousy Chinese economic data all contributed to the 'risk off' mentality..... China ended down 1.3% breaking their 'six-day winning streak'.......but look - the Chinese market has had some ride over the past two months...suffering swift losses not seen in decades....so that the market continues to try and find its footing and that may take some time. Japan -0.67%, Hong Kong - 1.06%, China -1.3% and ASX -0.43%
"
120,VFC,"In Europe - markets there are not paying any attention to the negatives out of China....Miners and producers are still coming under pressure as commodities continue to suffer - but that action is not taking the broader indexes lower with it. German and EU PMI also slightly missed - but analysts are blaming Greece for that......so no one is getting worked up. In Greece - the Troika is now back in town (after being kicked out months ago by Yanis Varoufakis) - so many are looking for more positive results for the negotiations.
"
121,VFC,"Investors there are also in the midst of earnings season and are trying to focus on the positives...... FTSE + 0.14%, CAC 40 + 0.39%, DAX + 0.01% EUROSTOXX +0.17%, SPAIN -0.37% and ITALY +0.53%

On the economic front - we are only getting New Home Sales - expectations of 548k or 0.3%..... Again - it is Friday in the summer - volumes to remain a bit light so moves can be more exaggerated....It feels like the S&P 500 wants to find support right here....but if it does not - then a move to 2080 would not be out of the question.

164,VFC,"So it was only last week - when we were celebrating the breakout by the Nasdaq market - a breakout that took 15 years to accomplish....On April 24th - My Morning Thoughts started out like this and asked that age old question:
"
165,VFC,"Oh.....now it is getting interesting.....but is it getting a bit 'bubbly'?
"
166,VFC,"Nasdaq made history yesterday....breaking out of its 15 year purgatory....but the breakout did not come with any fanfare, or bells and whistles.......Yesterday at 11:55 am....traders took the Nasdaq up and thru its former high of 5048 - as it ticked at 5049......... and shift into overdrive....the algo's kicked in forcing it to a new all time intraday high of 5069. At the closing bell - Nasdaq ended the day at 5056....signaling a 'new dawn'....and this during what many would consider the worst earnings season in recent memory (negative 4% growth) ....
"
167,VFC,"And that was the 'kiss of death' - Just a few days ago we were celebrating - Nasdaq was the new darling child, the S&P 500 was at an all-time new high and the Dow and Russell were teasing with their all-time highs.........but today - the Dow 30 is now flat for the year and both the S&P and Nasdaq have closed below their 50 day moving average's and the small cap Russell 2000 - well that broke its 50 & is now sitting right on its 100 dma at 1217.
"
168,VFC,"In the past week - stocks have reversed course, giving back all of the April gains.....There was not one sector left standing as investors did a little 'window undressing' at the end of the month....or as the incomparable Arthur Cashin of UBS and worldwide fame said:
"
169,VFC,"""Today's action looks like end of month window BREAKING""
"
170,VFC,"And so it was.....you could hear the smashing glass as investors started throwing everything out the window - the only thing left was the kitchen sink....but hold on - that may be next....
"
171,VFC,"We can credit the 'usual suspects'.........ongoing uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates, the pending Greek Tragedy, key weak earnings, weakening macro data and the tensions building in the Persian Gulf as the Iranians try to bully the international community causing us to send warships to 'accompany US ships thru the Strait of Hormuz.....as one 'unidentified' US Official put it:
"
172,VFC,"""Out of abundance of caution, because of the unpredictability of our Iranian friends, we're now positioned so that, should the Iranians decide that they're going to be stupid, we're ready to respond...."" (Iranian officials have yet to comment...)
"
173,VFC,"So after you turn on the lights and look back- you will see that we haven't gone anywhere in the broad market so far this year. Yesterday, we got confirmation that the economy is not growing...... 4 months ago the GDP was 'supposedly' growing at 5.0% and now the GDP is growing at 0.02%. - Yes - that is NOT a typo.....a 4.98% reversal in activity......and this as all of the major indexes were making all time highs. (There's that whole disconnect thing again......)
"
174,VFC,"But you say - ""Why the negative - we knew this...The Atlanta Fed's forecasting model actually called for growth of 0.01% - so in fact - we beat it! Where are the party hats? What does the Atlanta Fed say about this quarter? Their initial forecast calls for growth of 0.9% - a far cry from the consensus estimates of 3% - so the reality of the robust recovery......well - ain't so robust. These are recession numbers....Hey...I'm just sayin.....
"
175,VFC,"Over the last 2 weeks - we have seen the dollar get clobbered (not such a bad thing for the multinationals)...it is down 5% - this though has been good for oil...(dollar down/oil up) and prices ended the month of April up another $1.05 closing at $59.63/barrel or up 17% in that same time. And with tensions building in the gulf - you can rest assured that there is now a floor under the price of oil....(could this whole Iranian thing be a set up to goose oil?)
"
176,VFC,"Yesterday we heard from some of the big oil companies.... Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CHV), ConocoPhillips (COP), - while the plunge in oil prices has caused some heartburn for the oil producers it has created a boom for the refiners.....and in fact American refiners are laughing all the way to the bank....because US crude - cheaper than Brent - has given them the competitive advantage over their European and Mid East rivals.......and the plot thickens.....
"
177,VFC,"After the bell - LinkedIn (LKND) slashed guidance - blaming the strong dollar and weaker demand for its problems.....the stock was down 5 points during the trading day and then got slammed in the afterhours session......dropping more than 20%....this morning in early pre-market trading it is hovering around $201....There we go again with these 'high growth stocks'......(Recall Twitter) - it is difficult to forecast and guide - so when they do they set themselves up for failure - but anyone trading these names understands that.....and if they don't - they do now.....
"
178,VFC,"US futures are up 6 points....not surprising after being down 21 points yesterday.....with the S&P 500 now broken its short term support at 2090 - look for that to become resistance again......support is now at 2070ish......
"
179,VFC,"It is May 1st...so expect to hear the 'sell in May and go away' mantra - as historians come out of the woodwork telling us about this phenomenon......This is a well known trading adage - essentially telling investors to take the summer off......
"
180,VFC,"Economic data today includes April ISM Manufacturing - expectations of 52. March Construction Spending of +0.5% and University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey...expectations of 96...on the earnings front - look for Weyerhauser (WY), CVS Health (CVS), Legg Mason (LM), VF (VFC) to name just a few.
"
181,VFC,"Also, watch for 2 Fed speakers today....Loretta Mester (Cleveland Fed) at 8:30 a.m. ETand John Williams (San Francisco) at 3:20 p.m. - of the two - Williams is the one that has the potential to create more noise.....

"
212,VFC,"When it comes to feeding the consumer appetite for bargains, China's Vipshop Holdings follows a tried and true recipe that's helped nurture a healthy growth spurt.
"
213,VFC,"Vipshop (VIPS), which started in 2008 and went public in March 2012, is somewhat of a rare breed among retail websites. It sells quality branded apparel, accessories, home goods and other lifestyle products at a 30% to 70% discount to the original retail price using a ""flash sales"" model. Every morning at 10 Beijing time, it launches new flash sales on a finite quantity of products or services online for a limited time.
"
214,VFC,"To provide shoppers with a greater opportunity to buy featured discounted products, each customer is limited to purchasing two pieces of the same item and each shopping cart can hold only 20 items at one time, except for food products.
"
215,VFC,"As with other popular flash-sale sites, which sell everything from high fashion to hotel rooms, the idea is to create an impulse-driven shopping experience while helping to move excess inventory sourced from a variety of vendors.
"
216,VFC,"As of the end of 2012, Vipshop had an impressive lineup of goods with exclusive rights to sell selective products from more than 700 brands.
"
217,VFC,"Preferred Products
"
218,VFC,"Vipshop features products from more than 5,800 brands, including international labels such as such as Nike (NKE), Disney (DIS), Hanesbrands (HBI) and Lee (owned by VF Corp. (VFC); and domestic brands like Hstyle. Its top three selling brands are Adidas, Nike and Kappa, a domestic sporting goods brand.
"
219,VFC,"Vipshop's approach has played well with customers. In 2012, sales more than tripled to $692 million. It ended that year with close to 27 million registered users.
"
220,VFC,"It has also scored a big hit with investors. Vipshop's stock price has rocketed nearly 450% over the past 12 months to around 100.
"
221,VFC,"Vipshop has been profitable the past five quarters. It earned 26 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) in the most recent third quarter, up from one cent a year earlier. Sales rocketed 146% to $383.7 million as it saw a 132% rise in active customers to 4 million and a 116% rise in total orders to 11.7 million.
"
222,VFC,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year 2013 earnings to reach $1.04 per ADS, up from a 4-cent loss in 2012. They see a 107% surge in 2014 and a 59% rise in 2015.
"
223,VFC,"China-based UBS analyst Erica Poon Werkun forecast a 62% revenue compound annual growth rate from 2012 to 2017, driven mainly by growth on active customers, in her January initiation note on Vipshop, which she rates a buy.
"
224,VFC,"Why the bright prospects?
"
225,VFC,"""We believe VIPS addresses issues on the supply side, namely excess inventories in distribution channels and the difficulty in penetrating lower-tier cities,"" noted Werkun.
"
226,VFC,"It also addresses the consumer's demand for ""superior product value proposition, newness and convenience in shopping,"" she added.
"
227,VFC,"Vipshop's main growth drivers are its discounts and product selection, adds Kelland Willis, an associate analyst at Forrester Research.
"
228,VFC,"She says Vipshop offers access to brands at affordable prices that for the most part aren't available on other websites in China.
"
229,VFC,"""Vipshop has hit that niche in China's mass market with mid-range name brands like Adidas and Puma that are considered luxury products among this consumer group in China,"" she said. ""They've really done a great job catering to middle-income consumers age 18 to 35 by offering them name-brand products that they wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. The consumers they target are brand-conscious and are excited to be able to shop for those products at price points they can afford.""
"
230,VFC,"Three Growth Drivers
"
231,VFC,"In an initiation report, China-based HSBC analyst Chi Tsang cites three growth drivers for Vipshop. No. 1 is the fact that ""the market is large and growing rapidly.""
"
232,VFC,"Tsang estimates the market for discount retail in China is $40 billion, growing at over 50% a year, and Vipshop has a 4% market share. The company's other growth drivers are ""limited competition"" from traditional discount retailers and ""substantial potential upside to customer numbers.""
"
233,VFC,"Among Vipshop's strengths is its mix of international and domestic brands in its flash sales, says Willis. She says not many websites in China offer the mix of both. And the sites that do offer that mix, she says, don't do as good a job presenting the brands as Vipshop does. Vipshop does a ""good job highlighting"" whether a brand is international or domestic in its flash sales, ""whereas other multibrand retailers tend to sell products by category and you don't know the actual brand name,"" she added.
"
234,VFC,"Competitive Environment
"
235,VFC,"Still, overall industry rivalry in China is ""intense,"" says Tsang, and Vipshop competes with both dedicated flash-sale players and online marketplaces. Its primary rivals include business-to-consumer e-commerce firms that sell similar products and services online, such as Tmall, 360Buy and Dangdang (DANG), and other online flash sales firms, says a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"
236,VFC,"Marketplaces ""dominate"" the e-commerce scene in China, writes Willis in her China online retail forecast report for 2013 to 2018.
"
237,VFC,"The biggest marketplaces in the country include Taobao, Tmall, Suning and Jingdong as well as Amazon.com (AMZN). But Vipshop has some advantages over rivals, says Tsang. They include ""customer loyalty, driven by a high-quality product selection chosen by what is considered to be the largest team of buyers in China and a dedicated customer service organization; and effective operational management and financial controls.""
"
238,VFC,"Meanwhile, online shopping in China is growing faster than most anyone originally expected, Willis noted in her report. In 2013, China's online retail market — which includes business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer sites — surpassed $300 billion, Willis says.
"
239,VFC,"Forrester forecasts the nation's online retail market (B2C and C2C) will pass $670 billion by 2018.When it comes to feeding the consumer appetite for bargains, China's Vipshop Holdings follows a tried and true recipe that's helped nurture a healthy growth spurt.Vipshop (VIPS), which started in 2008 and went public in March 2012, is somewhat of a rare breed among retail websites. It sells quality branded apparel, accessories, home goods and other lifestyle products at a 30% to 70% discount to the original retail price using a ""flash sales"" model. Every morning at 10 Beijing time, it launches new flash sales on a finite quantity of products or services online for a limited time.To provide shoppers with a greater opportunity to buy featured discounted products, each customer is limited to purchasing two pieces of the same item and each shopping cart can hold only 20 items at one time, except for food products.As with other popular flash-sale sites, which sell everything from high fashion to hotel rooms, the idea is to create an impulse-driven shopping experience while helping to move excess inventory sourced from a variety of vendors.As of the end of 2012, Vipshop had an impressive lineup of goods with exclusive rights to sell selective products from more than 700 brands.Preferred ProductsVipshop features products from more than 5,800 brands, including international labels such as such as Nike (NKE), Disney (DIS), Hanesbrands (HBI) and Lee (owned by VF Corp. (VFC); and domestic brands like Hstyle. Its top three selling brands are Adidas, Nike and Kappa, a domestic sporting goods brand.Vipshop's approach has played well with customers. In 2012, sales more than tripled to $692 million. It ended that year with close to 27 million registered users.It has also scored a big hit with investors. Vipshop's stock price has rocketed nearly 450% over the past 12 months to around 100.Vipshop has been profitable the past five quarters. It earned 26 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS) in the most recent third quarter, up from one cent a year earlier. Sales rocketed 146% to $383.7 million as it saw a 132% rise in active customers to 4 million and a 116% rise in total orders to 11.7 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year 2013 earnings to reach $1.04 per ADS, up from a 4-cent loss in 2012. They see a 107% surge in 2014 and a 59% rise in 2015.China-based UBS analyst Erica Poon Werkun forecast a 62% revenue compound annual growth rate from 2012 to 2017, driven mainly by growth on active customers, in her January initiation note on Vipshop, which she rates a buy.Why the bright prospects?""We believe VIPS addresses issues on the supply side, namely excess inventories in distribution channels and the difficulty in penetrating lower-tier cities,"" noted Werkun.It also addresses the consumer's demand for ""superior product value proposition, newness and convenience in shopping,"" she added.Vipshop's main growth drivers are its discounts and product selection, adds Kelland Willis, an associate analyst at Forrester Research.She says Vipshop offers access to brands at affordable prices that for the most part aren't available on other websites in China.""Vipshop has hit that niche in China's mass market with mid-range name brands like Adidas and Puma that are considered luxury products among this consumer group in China,"" she said. ""They've really done a great job catering to middle-income consumers age 18 to 35 by offering them name-brand products that they wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. The consumers they target are brand-conscious and are excited to be able to shop for those products at price points they can afford.""Three Growth DriversIn an initiation report, China-based HSBC analyst Chi Tsang cites three growth drivers for Vipshop. No. 1 is the fact that ""the market is large and growing rapidly.""Tsang estimates the market for discount retail in China is $40 billion, growing at over 50% a year, and Vipshop has a 4% market share. The company's other growth drivers are ""limited competition"" from traditional discount retailers and ""substantial potential upside to customer numbers.""Among Vipshop's strengths is its mix of international and domestic brands in its flash sales, says Willis. She says not many websites in China offer the mix of both. And the sites that do offer that mix, she says, don't do as good a job presenting the brands as Vipshop does. Vipshop does a ""good job highlighting"" whether a brand is international or domestic in its flash sales, ""whereas other multibrand retailers tend to sell products by category and you don't know the actual brand name,"" she added.Competitive EnvironmentStill, overall industry rivalry in China is ""intense,"" says Tsang, and Vipshop competes with both dedicated flash-sale players and online marketplaces. Its primary rivals include business-to-consumer e-commerce firms that sell similar products and services online, such as Tmall, 360Buy and Dangdang (DANG), and other online flash sales firms, says a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Marketplaces ""dominate"" the e-commerce scene in China, writes Willis in her China online retail forecast report for 2013 to 2018.The biggest marketplaces in the country include Taobao, Tmall, Suning and Jingdong as well as Amazon.com (AMZN). But Vipshop has some advantages over rivals, says Tsang. They include ""customer loyalty, driven by a high-quality product selection chosen by what is considered to be the largest team of buyers in China and a dedicated customer service organization; and effective operational management and financial controls.""Meanwhile, online shopping in China is growing faster than most anyone originally expected, Willis noted in her report. In 2013, China's online retail market — which includes business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer sites — surpassed $300 billion, Willis says.Forrester forecasts the nation's online retail market (B2C and C2C) will pass $670 billion by 2018.

268,VFC,"We expect VF Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) to beat expectations, when it reports fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16. Last quarter, the designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded apparel and related products, delivered a positive earnings surprise of 9.8%. In fact, the company  recorded an average positive surprise of 3.4% in the last four quarters.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether VF Corp. will be able to deliver  positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.02 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 5.2%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been trending up ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $3.7 billion, up 10.3% from the year-ago quarter.V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the last six months. The company’s shares have increased 27.1%, while the industry grew 10.7%.Factors at PlayVF Corp. is gaining from its progress on the 2021 growth strategy. The strategy focuses on responding to the changing marketplace while targeting shareholder returns. The company’s focus on this plan is evident from its recently raised dividend and stellar third-quarter 2017 performance.Both the top and bottom line topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grew year over year in the quarter, which marked VF Corp.’s second straight quarter of earnings and sales beat. Results were backed by strength in international and direct-to-customer platforms, the Outdoor & Action Sports unit and the workwear business.The splendid quarter encouraged management to raise its view for 2017, wherein results are likely to gain from the recently concluded Williamson-Dickie buyout. Further, the company’s continued investments in core growth areas are likely to aid performance. For 2017, management now anticipates revenues to grow 6% to nearly $12.1 billion. Currency neutral revenues are expected to rise 5.5%. The Williamson-Dickie buyout is estimated to contribute nearly $200 million to revenues. Moreover, the company envisions earnings per share to be $3.01, reflecting a 1% rise (6% on a currency neutral basis) from the year-ago period figure of $2.98.However, the company has been troubled by a difficult global economic environment and currency headwinds for over a year now. The company’s significant global presence exposes it to adverse foreign currency movements. Currency woes will continue to be a hurdle and are expected to hurt margins in 2017.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that VF Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Let’s delve deeper and find out the reason that kept Michael Kors ahead of its peers. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Turnaround StrategyMichael Kors’ acquisition of Jimmy Choo will help diversify portfolio and tap international markets. The buyout is likely to be accretive in the low single digits in fiscal 2020. In order to drive top-line growth, Michael Kors has been focusing on store expansion. In fiscal 2016, the company opened 142 new stores, which included 47 in the Americas and 95 worldwide. In fiscal 2017, it opened 159 net new stores openings, which includes 111 outlets related to the acquisition of the earlier licensed operation in Greater China. Given the scope for high profitability from company-owned stores, management is putting more emphasis on opening retail outlets. Moreover, the company stated that it will continue with the expansion drive in Asia and also believes it has a $1 billion opportunity in the long term.Michael Kors had earlier stated that its project Runway 2020 strategic plan, which focuses on product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience, has made rapid progress during the second quarter. As part of the company’s strategy of product innovation, it launched Bancroft in the Michael Kors collection line. The product innovation strategy aided the global Women's footwear comparable sales to increase by double digit. Moreover, e-commerce continues to post robust performance.Valuation PerspectiveA brief glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that Michael Kors has enough room to run in bourses.Michael Kors looks attractive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 16.3x compared with industry’s 16.8x. A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. Michael Kors holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 9.4 lower than 16.6 for the industry.Earnings Trend & Estimate RevisionsMichael Kors continued with positive earnings surprise streak for the 10th consecutive quarter, when it posted second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Further, revenues came ahead of the estimate for the third straight quarter.

277,VFC,"The retail sector is today dominated by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is proving a tough match for traditional retailers. With market share growing for Amazon Prime, Marketplace and Prime Air, as well as the launch of drone delivery, Amazon is poised for exceptional growth. So much so, that Amazon is a threat to most retailers scouring for options to stay in business.Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) has adopted speedy fulfillment by shipping directly from its stores. Moreover, retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) have opted ship-from-store to cut down on transportation costs. On the other hand, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and V.F. Corp’s (VFC  -  Free Report) North Face brand have come up with an innovation to use artificial intelligence to help shoppers find and customize products online. Likewise, retailing giant Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) has been gaining from increased sales of groceries online for more than a decade. However, Wal-Mart’s success is also at stake here, with Amazon expanding in the grocery business.Another concern stemming from Amazon’s success story is that retail sector is struggling with lower footfall at stores as all the brands are looking to directly sell to consumers through the expansion of digital stores. This apart, retailers are making strides to enhance mobile experiences through the launch of mobile apps, while also improving the checkout process with mobile wallets like PayPal and Apple Pay.Additionally, players in the sector have also been hit hard by major economic challenges like a strong U.S. dollar, volatile commodity costs and global uncertainty. The volatility in U.S. dollar has been hurting retailers for quite some time now with worldwide operations.While retailers are leaving no stone unturned to stay in the game, it remains to be seen if they really have solutions to their Amazon problems.This clearly shows that the Retail-Wholesale sector is no longer a bed of roses. Some issues troubling the retail industry are elaborated below:Online vs. Offline: The rise of omni-channel retailing has heightened consumer expectations and simultaneously problems for retailers. Today, retailers must provide a blend of online and offline experience to engage customers. Moreover, along with an impressive product assortment, pricing, shipping, returns and promotional offerings, it is necessary to introduce personalized customer services in order to satisfy consumers.Further, there are other challenges in the brick-and-mortar store format that need individual attention, like deciding a store layout, fixing places for products and promotions, and a quick test of ideas to arrive at the best decision and implement it across multiple stores. However, fixing problems in the online world is easier as data expedites the process of finding problems and solutions, and engineers solve the same in no time. Also, the overhead cost of operating a physical store is a lot higher than that of managing a website. Hence, online retailers sell products at lower costs. While physical stores indulge in lowering prices to match up, this can ultimately weigh on their bottom lines.Looking at the other side of the coin, pure-play online retailers also face challenges in converting a browsing customer into a buyer. Additionally, these companies incur huge logistics costs in shipping products to customers as well as returns.New Payment Systems & Mobile Payment Solutions: With an increase in point-of-sale (POS) systems and online transactions, there has been a significant rise in the number of data breaches, which have heightened concerns regarding the security of consumers’ personal data. As a result, retailers have introduced EMV cards and renovated their POS systems to accept various payment options including chip and pin cards, magnetic stripe cards and NRF payments.Further, there has been tremendous growth in mobile payment solutions including tap-and-pay or mobile wallets. It is clear that customers prefer to pay with cards or by using their mobile. So, retailers missing out on these payment options may end up being laggards. It has thus become necessary for retailers to adopt mobile payment solutions that suit them, from mobile POS systems, customized mobile payment apps like the Kohl’s Pay, and third-party solutions like Apple's Apple Pay. Speaking of third-party options other noteworthy options are Android Pay and Samsung Pay, which are expanding globally.Customer Experience/Personalization: Today, customers are well-informed, thanks to increased access to online portals that provide every detail regarding products, ranging from price to reviews. This, along with the fact that every product has some or other alternative, makes it difficult for store personnel to convert an in-store sale. Additionally, customers now have high expectations as they want the best product at a reasonable price, assured availability, speedy delivery and more. Moreover, customers look for a more personalized shopping experience that they can connect with.Well, here we can give the example of Nike, which has been offering personalized services like customized sneakers on customer request and the like. However, this kind of personalization is not possible for smaller firms, which can otherwise bank on ideas like targeting customers with a product tailored according to their preferences based on past purchases, or using location-based technology such as beacons to push personalized offers to customers’ mobile devices. These tactics may aid in satisfying customers’ sky-high expectations.A Highly Promotional Environment: The retail industry is highly competitive. To counter competition, retailers resort to excessive and often unplanned promotions that can largely impact sales and erode margins. In the past, this was common during the holiday season, when retailers proffered huge discounts and offers to meet short-term top-line targets and steal share from competitors. However, now we are in the world of constant commerce, which requires lucrative offers not matter how, when and on what one shops. In general, the increased use of such promotions comes at a price, usually strained margins, especially as consumers today are unwilling to pay the full price for products.Maintaining Efficient Workforce: In the retail industry, where a salesperson is more like an asset than staff, recruiting disciplined workforce and maintaining productivity is very difficult. Retailers generally find it challenging to spot good staff in the first place, and even if they succeed in the process, retaining them becomes tedious.Further, an improving economy has opened up more employment options and hence the pressure of maintaining a pleasant work environment with competitive wages and scheduling is high.Efficient Supply Chain Management: This involves ensuring that the products reach stores on time. Maintaining an efficient flow has been a major challenge for retailers as disruption in supply of products due to miscommunication, changes in requirements or any unavoidable situation is common. This roils retailers’ business with empty racks and costs dollars. An example of this situation is when a customer sees empty shelves after a promotional advertisement. While the customer will only be disappointed on not receiving the product, the retailer will be penalized for such an act and not be allowed to run the promotion further despite all the money spent on the advertisement.Bottom LineAs you can see, survival is tough in the evolving retail space, particularly as Amazon steals the majority of market share. However, retailers vying to stay on should be ready to cover the shortcomings and treat the threats as opportunities.In a nutshell, online retailing is a major growth driver in the retail industry. Retailers that balance physical and online presence are here to stay. Altogether, retailers providing frictionless shopping experience, online or in-stores, with seamless payment solutions are likely to stay in the market. On the other hand, retailers that have been slow to invest and still relying on traditional marketing methods are bound to suffer.  Check out our latest Retail Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.

On a constant currency basis, sales dropped less than 1%.In fact, the top line benefited from sales growth across its geographic regions mainly in the EMEA region, Canada and LAAP region. These were partially offset by decline in the U.S. wholesale arena. Gross profit increased 1% to $349.1 million driven by higher revenues and lower cost of sales. Also, gross margin increased 30 basis points (bps) to 46.7%. Further, the company reported operating income of $122.9 million, 0.5% lower than the operating income reported in the year-ago quarter. This was accountable to higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. Also, operating margin declined 20 bps to 16.4%.Regional SegmentsUnited States: Net sales declined 6% to $456 million owing to decline in wholesale net sales, which was partially compensated by growth in direct-to-consumer net sales.Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA): Net sales jumped 20% (up 15% on a constant currency basis) to $87.5 million, backed by solid performance at its European business (direct-to-consumer and wholesale) and growth in sales to EMEA distributors.Canada: Net sales grew 8% (up 4% on a constant currency basis) to $80.9 million.Latin America/Asia Pacific (LAAP): Net sales increased 9% (down 11% on a constant currency basis) to $123.0 million, mainly due to sales in China, Korea and to the LAAP distributors. These were partially countered by sales decline in Japan.Category and Brand SegmentsThe increase in net sales was also driven by the strong performance of its Global Columbia brand, which registered a growth of 2% to reach $598.3 million.However, Global SOREL brand sales declined 7% to $81.7 million.

279,VFC,"The story narrating the retail sector’s transformation is now old. What is coming up is the holiday shopping season, the key yearly event for retailers. This money-making period brings with it a lot of enthusiasm as Christmas and Thanksgiving provide ample opportunities for retailers to make up for lost profits during the year.The holiday season, which accounts for a sizable chunk of yearly revenues and profits for retailers, generally extends from Thanksgiving to Christmas, also including the Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. This season can represent as much as 30% of annual sales for some retailers. Last year, holiday season accounted for nearly 20% of overall retail industry sales.Coming to the forecasts for this year’s holiday season, analysts remain optimistic on grounds of gradual wage growth, lower inflation, 16-year low unemployment rate, an uptick in the U.S. consumer sentiment to a 13-year high and a lift in economic activity post-hurricanes. Characterized by the aforementioned improvement in the consumer backdrop, alongside early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, the holiday season this November and December is likely to be a huge success.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) rightly projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Additionally, the NRF projects online holiday sales to rise 7-10% to nearly $117 billion in November and December compared with a 9% improvement to $105 billion in 2015.Apart from the strong consumer confidence, the NRF predicts sales for the period to benefit from a longer holiday season as Christmas is falling on Monday this year and 32 days after Thanksgiving. This will give retailers one extra day of sales than normal, as well as benefit last-minute shoppers in the weekend before Christmas.Moreover, Deloitte projects holiday season sales to go up as much as 4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%. The data compiled by Kantar suggests that the fourth-quarter holiday period sales are expected to jump 3.7%. Further, eMarketer forecasts holiday sales (November and December) to increase 3.1% to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Further, with considerable growth in retail employment in recent months, the NRF expects to witness lesser seasonal hiring for this year’s holiday bash. It expects retailers to employ nearly 500,000-550,000 seasonal workers this year, a decline from last year’s 575,000 hiring.In this context, retailers including Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) have already put forward their hiring plans for the upcoming holiday season to cater to the holiday rush. Per media reports, Target intends to employ 100,000 associates, while Macy's will hire nearly 80,000 seasonal workers. Meanwhile, Gap is deploying seasonal associates at all stores including Gap, Gap Outlet, Banana Republic, Banana Republic Factory and Old Navy across the United States and Canada. J. C. Penney will hire nearly 40,000 seasonal workers.This apart, there are some trends that are likely to rule the retail space in the long term. Let’s take a glance.Long-Term Trends Rule the SectorWith the increasing influence of technology on the buying patterns of consumers, the general retail sector trends set to rule the future are:Omni-channel Eliminates Retail Pure-Plays: Omni-channel, which emerged as an option to offer more touch points and multiple channels to customers, has gone beyond this simple definition. The cross-channel sales mantra now requires every retailer, whether online or brick and mortar, to bring together both physical and digital systems to serve omni-customers. As a result, retail pure-plays, both online and offline, are now turning omni-channel. This means online retailers are coming up with physical stores or pop-up shops to satisfy customers and vice versa.Here, the prime objective is to bridge the gap between a physical and an ecommerce store of any particular retailer. For example, Macy’s Inc. makes the most of its omni-channel presence with services like click-and-collect. Additionally, the company’s site allows customers to access the inventory at its local stores, so that they can check the availability of a product at the nearest store, purchase it and have it picked up or arrange for same-day delivery. In another online feature, Macy’s mobile app allows customers to scan bar codes of products at stores and check online reviews, promotions and the like.Growth of Off-Price Retailing: A recent trend shows that apart from e-commerce, the rise of off-price retailing is making competition worse for retailers. Off-price retailers like TJX Companies Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report), Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report), Nordstrom’s (JWN  -  Free Report) Nordstrom Rack, Five Below Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report), Macy’s Backstage, Bloomingdale’s, Kohl’s and others are doing a good job, unlike department stores and specialty clothing retailers. Customers today are looking for value, which means reasonable and quality merchandise. Off-price retailers offer immense value as they purchase their inventory at a discount. In contrast, department and specialty retailers have to resort to mark downs from time to time in order to clear their inventory. This has led to a major shift in consumer preferences to off-priced merchandise, making department and specialty store irrelevant to consumers.Expanded Payments Options: With retail undergoing a sea change, the modes of payment have also evolved dramatically. The increasing use of mobile payments and the EMV mandate in the U.S. induced retailers to remodel their payment terminals to accept multiple options like mobile payments and EMV cards. Some of the available payment solutions are PayPal Here Chip Card reader, Mercury and Poynt, which equip retailers with different payment accepting options. These devices or hardware ensure compatibility with iOS and Android devices, magnetic cards, EMV, QR codes and NFC payments such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.Technology-Friendly Brick & Mortar Stores: With shoppers becoming increasingly tech savvy, brick and mortar stores need to leave their old-fashioned layouts behind and improvise by adopting innovative in-store technologies. With rising demand for convenient delivery and alternative payment solutions, all at affordable prices, technology is bound to play a key role in growth. This is because consumers are becoming increasingly dependent on their mobile phones and other digital devices to buy goods.The simplest way to execute this is through in-store mobile devices, which enable customers to make payments, see product demonstrations, gather information and connect to social networks. Further, these in-store devices can help customers locate the products they are looking for. Not only this, retailers have developed mobile apps that will track customers as they shop and send them tailored offers on products in sections they are in, recommend items based on past purchases, or allow them to program automated shopping lists.In-store technologies that customers look for these days include mobile point of sales, price checkers, self-checkout payment lanes, information kiosks, and digital signage, among others. Other innovative technologies to engage customers both in store and elsewhere are smart shelves, Wi-Fi hot spots, point-of-sales (POS) systems, virtual storefronts and endless aisles.Shrinking Store Sizes: Changing consumer preferences have led to an increase in smaller stores. Even ‘big box’ retailers are now concentrating on smaller store formats, which accommodate more specific merchandise according to consumer preferences. We have already seen a transition relating to this idea, with companies like Target and Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY focusing on smaller store formats.The main reason for this shift in consumer preference is the convenience and accessibility that small stores provide. Consumers are looking to make quick purchases these days. Finding the desired products by wandering through endless aisles of big stores seems cumbersome and time taking. Today, smaller stores with specialized selections are preferred as finding desired products in little time is easier in these. Additionally, smaller stores are cost effective right from inception to managing operating costs to finding space in urban environments.Growth of Retail-centric Apps and Services, Social Shopping: As already said, consumers are looking for speedy deliveries apart from multiple buying options. This has increased the number of retail-centric apps that merchants are adopting in order to stay competitive. Further, retailers are looking for third-party solutions to fulfill the demands of customers. Retailers have also been using social media platforms to advertise their brands, launch products and campaigns, talk to customers and even make merchandising decisions.Most companies are now also selling their products through social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which have shopping functionalities. Some retailers that have already adopted the Like2Buy platform on Instagram are Nordstrom, Aeropostale and Target. Moreover, retailers are increasingly seeking the assistance of third parties to quickly get their products delivered.Merging Online and Offline Data to Track Shoppers: The growing use of multiple shopping channels has made it imperative for retailers to collectively study their online and offline data in order to analyze the buying habits of consumers. This gives a more comprehensive picture of their shopping practice.A study of online and offline data has revealed that shoppers usually browse for products online before finally making purchases in stores. Such data can be helpful in tracking the purchase habits of customers and executing effectively on their omni-channel initiatives.Taking Charge of Value Chain: The success mantra in modern retail is to provide a compelling shopping experience, which is only possible by taking full control of one’s value chain i.e., from the creation of products to their consumption. We expect this strategy to gain importance, with retailers focusing more on fulfillment practices, product distribution, speed and convenience of delivering products to consumers, and more.Growth of Retail in Emerging Markets: Having tapped most of the potential in the domestic market, retailers have started venturing into emerging markets. Most retail chains are witnessing growing demand for their products in countries like Brazil, the Middle East, China and India. Retailers planning to venture into these markets include the likes of The Gap Inc., The Clorox Company CLX, Ralph Lauren Corp. (RL  -  Free Report), V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report).Consolidation in Retail Industry: The U.S. retail industry has been witnessing further consolidation, with companies merging with peers to become larger and vying to lead the markets they serve. Some of the recent mergers include that of Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR with Family Dollar, which has given rise to a mega U.S. discount retailer. Also, apparel retailer, Ascena Retail Group Inc. ASNA bought the ANN Taylor parent ANN Inc., which has strengthened the position of the former in the women’s apparel market.Also, the recent liquidation of sporting goods chains like Sports Authority, Sport Chalet and Golfsmith has left gaps to intensify competition. Such consolidation in the sporting goods space is benefiting other participants like DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. DKS and Big 5 Sporting Goods Inc. BGFV.Localization of Products Mix: Localization requires tailoring of products and stores to satisfy the needs of native communities. This trait is expected to prove most beneficial this year as it is likely to attract more customers. One example of such a retailer that tailors its merchandise for respective stores is O’Reilly Automotive Inc. (ORLY  -  Free Report).As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail industry over the long term. But what about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Retail Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.

280,VFC,"Shares of Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) were up nearly 6% through early afternoon trading hours Monday after analysts from Stifel said the sports apparel giant was making significant changes that should soon be apparent in its financial results.Citing management’s renewed focus on operating efficiency, expense control, resource allocation, and commitment to earnings, Stifel today set a $27 price target for Under Armour—nearly 27% higher than Friday’s close.According to Stifel’s analysts, Under Armour began showing signs late last year that “rational minds would prevail and focus would shift from cavalier growth to profitability.”This has not been fully realized in the company’s actual numbers just yet, with better-than-expected Q1 revenue results being overshadowed by concerns about sluggish gross margins, but Stifel believes that should change soon.“With the recent market evidence that performance athletic demand and channel inventories are healthy, we have increased confidence that inventories will be appropriately matched to demand before year-end and margins will inflect and margin improvement can continue in 2019 and beyond,” the firm wrote.Under Armour shares are up nearly 50% in 2018 as the company looks to rebound from a two-year selloff that saw the stock crash more than 70% from its all-time highs. Fierce competition from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) and Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) exacerbated this volatility, raising questions about the effectiveness of founder and longtime CEO Kevin Plank.Plank remains the company’s CEO, but Under Armour has made changes to its management team—including bringing in Aldo and VF Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) veteran Patrik Frisk as its new president, a position that Plank previously held himself.Stifel’s optimism is a part of a larger picture of improving analyst sentiment for Under Armour right now. Within the last 60 days, the company has seen 11 positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, lifting our Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny in that time.Still, earnings are projected to slump about 5% year over year in 2018, and one negative revision has kept the stock at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Under Armour is not expected to see significant earnings momentum until next year, when current estimates are calling for adjust profits to surge about 87% from 2018’s estimated totals.Want more market analysis from this author?

289,VFC,"Monday, July 24th, 2017The big name reporting earnings today will be Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), but not until after the closing bell this afternoon. Never fear, though — there are plenty of other firms pushing out Q2 earnings results in the meantime:Oil field services provider Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) posted 23 cents per share on quarterly revenues of $4.96 billion. Both numbers easily topped expectations of 19 cents per share and $4.84 billion in sales.

Shares are selling off roughly 5% in today’s pre-market, however, as the stock is up 40% year to date.Retail brand company VF Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) beat expectations narrowly on top and bottom lines this morning, by a penny on the bottom line to 29 cents per share, and by roughly 3% on the top line to $2.36 billion. Strength in the company’s largest brands — among them Wrangler jeans, The North Face, Timberland and Nautica — boosted the company’s fortunes in the quarter. VF Corp. also announced Executive Chairman Eric Wiseman will be stepping down as of late October, to be replaced by President & CEO Steven Rendle.Finally, a Q2 beat for Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report) in both earnings and sales has come out this morning, reporting a 6-cent beat to 32 cents per share and $3.23 billion topping the $3.18 billion in revenues anticipated. The spin-off from Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report) in Q4 2016 also bumped up its 2017 EPS guidance from $1.15 per share to $1.20. The company appears to be on fairly sound footing considering the shakeup not only regarding the spin-off but the sudden departure of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld this past spring.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

292,VFC,"V.F. Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 24. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, manufacturer and marketer of branded apparel and related products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company posted in-line earnings in the last two quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. V.F. Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   V.F. Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | V.F. Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 28 cents, reflecting year-over-year decline of over 20%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.3 billion, down about 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.V.F. Corp. forms part of the Retail – Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Trends as of Jul 15, the Retail – Wholesale sector’s earnings are expected to inch up 0.1%, with 3.8% revenues growth.Factors at PlayV.F. Corp.’s shares have gained 10.1% in the last six months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Textile – Apparel industry’s decline of 2.2%. This could be largely attributable to its five-year strategic growth plan (2021 growth strategy) that was announced this March. The plan focuses on rapidly responding to the changing marketplace as well as targeting shareholder returns. Further, the company’s four-point strategy focuses on redesigning portfolio and empowering its key brands, adopting a consumer and retail-centric model, enriching direct-to-consumer and digital businesses, and directing investment to Asia, particularly China. Well, these plans underscore the company’s growth prospects. In fact, we believe that the company is progressing well on these lines, as revenues in the first quarter mainly gained strength from international and direct-to-customer platforms, along with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.However, both earnings and sales declined year over year, as a challenging retail environment and currency headwinds played foul. Currency has long been a hurdle for the company’s top line which has suffered four consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline. Also, adverse currency fluctuations are expected to persist and hurt results. Evidently, management expects foreign currency woes to hurt 2017 revenues by about two percentage points. Also, the gross and operating margins are likely to bear respective 70 and 60 bps negative impacts from currency, in 2017. Finally, the company expects earnings per share to decline at a low-single digit percentage rate on a year-over-year basis, whereas the same is likely to rise in the mid-single digit rate on a currency neutral basis.Considering the pros and cons, we prefer to wait and see if V.F. Corp.’s growth strategies can help it sail through these headwinds this earnings season.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that V.F. Corp. is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.V.F. Corp. currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both, the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 28 cents. The combination of V.F. Corp.’s Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #2.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +13.77% and a Zacks Rank #3.Nordstrom, Inc.

293,VFC,"Cruise and vacation company, Carnival Corporation (CCL  -  Free Report), is expected to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 25, before market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.64%. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 9.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Carnival Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Carnival Corporation QuoteFactors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsDuring the second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call, the company had issued a guidance of $2.16-$2.20 adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal third quarter. Carnival had factored in year-over-year growth in net revenue yields (constant dollars) of roughly 4% and a flat year-over-year net cruise costs, excluding fuel, while projecting its earnings per share.We are positive on Carnival’s strategy to grow beyond its familiar itineraries and capitalize on new markets. In fact, the company is confident about its fiscal third-quarter results to reflect growth in China and other Asian markets as well as expansion in relatively other untapped markets like Cuba, Bermuda and Mexico.Notably, last year, the company had launched the initial phase of its yield management system, which is expected to aid in driving incremental revenue yields in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, Carnival predicts the quarter’s revenue yields to improve on the back of marketing initiatives, enhancement of guest experiences and a better booking environment.Moreover, the company remains focused on its cost-containment efforts, including decreased fuel consumption that is likely to aid the quarter’s margins.However, higher investment in marketing increased marketing expenses might hamper the quarter’s margins. Higher fuel costs and adverse foreign exchange movements may also weigh on the company’s profits. Meanwhile, macroeconomic issues in key operating regions remain concerns for the company’s top line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Carnival this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Carnival has an Earnings ESP of -0.31%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is $2.19, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $2.20.

294,VFC,"Benchmarks closed in the red for the third consecutive trading day on Wednesday following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. President Trump is expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly. Shares of Dow component Boeing declined after investors fretted that a possible trade war between the two biggest economies may push China to retaliate, which may adversely affect the company. Boeing’s performance weighed on broader markets, with the Dow registering a one-day decline of around 250 points.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1%, or 246.74 points, to close at 24,758.12. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% to close at 2,749.48. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,496.81, losing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 3.9% to close at 16.99. A total of 6.53 billion shares were traded on Wednesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.14 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Trump To Initiate Trade War With China?Per U.S. Census Bureau data, the United States posted a trade deficit of $375 billion with China last year, which was two-thirds of the economy’s trade gap of $566 billion. In contrast, China registered trade surplus of $276 billion during the same period, which was also two-thirds of the second biggest economy’s trade surplus of $422.5 billion.Last Wednesday, President Trump tweeted that the U.S. is looking to reduce its trade deficit by $1 billion.  A White House spokesperson later clarified that the exact amount was around $100 billion. Additionally, Trump reportedly said that the U.S. is looking to impose “tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports,” with Chinese telecommunications, apparel and technology sectors likely bearing most of the brunt.Following this development, a trade war is likely to break out between the United States and China. Investors fear that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) might be the primary target of Chinese retaliation. The aircraft manufacturer projected last September that China may invest about $1 trillion over the next 20 years to acquire aircraft from the company.Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5% on Wednesday, weighing on the Dow and the industrials sector of the S&P 500. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) declined 1.1%, becoming the second biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report) fell 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively.Additionally, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) decreased 1.3% and was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Two of its main components, DowDuPont Inc. (DWDP  -  Free Report) and Praxair, Inc. (PX  -  Free Report) declined 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively. Praxair has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This increase was slightly higher than the consensus estimate of 0.1%, but fell short of January’s rise of 0.4%. Core PPI rose 0.2% in February, in line with January’s movement. Subdued PPI number along with in line consumer price inflation data reduced concerns over the pace of Fed rate hikes this year.Additionally, the Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that retail sales fell 0.1% last month, in contrast to the consensus estimate of 0.4% increase. Retail sales fell for third straight month, indicating that consumer spending will fall in the first quarter of this year. However, core retail sales increased 0.1%, which are closely correlated with the consumer spending component of the GDP.Stocks That Made HeadlinesV.F.

296,VFC,"The transformation in the retail sector has brought in good news with signs of prosperity emerging since late 2017. The overwhelming holiday season was a clear indicator, which not only justified the growth of the economy but also lifted the outlook of the retail sector. The economy has been gaining from more confident consumers, who are willing to spend, as the labor market remains strong and incomes continue to rise.This favorable consumer environment raised the hopes of retailers, who are looking to benefit from collaborations, taking more risks and being innovative. Clearly, retailers coming up with new ideas to create a more customer-centric experience are poised to grow in today’s market.The retail trends emerging after the solid holiday bash reveal that consumers will continue to spend throughout 2018. This calls for another eventful year ahead, where consumers will seek more convenience, personalization and speed, and retailers will continue to bring in newer ways to provide a robust customer experience.The Nation Retail Federation (“NRF”) revealed that retail sales for January were as strong as the holiday season backed by an improving economy. Retail sales in January rose 5.4% year over year, following a 5.1% unadjusted year-over-year growth in holiday sales during November and December.With consumers feeling good about their financial health and consumer spending reflecting steady growth, the NRF predicts retail sales for 2018 to improve between 3.8% and 4.4% from the 2017 level. Notably, retail sales were up 3.9% in 2017 compared with 2016. Further, online and other non-store sales are likely to witness growth of 10-12% as the definition of retailing continues to evolve.That said, let’s take a look at the trends that are expected to rule the retail sector in 2018.Retail Trends This YearThe retail sector will witness intense competition among store formats, channels and players. Consumers will gain from a slate of increasing options as retailers continue to reform their businesses with both online and in-store operations.Redefining Retail Strategies: Despite the rise of omni-channel and e-commerce, the brick-and-mortar retailing concept still holds value. Time and again it has been proven that it is impossible to eliminate physical stores and human assistance in shopping. However, with the rise of digital commerce there arises a need to re-think and re-define the role of workforce to deliver on both online and in-store tasks.Retailers thus need to focus on a renewed retail strategy, including adjusting the ways of doing business. For this, companies have to consider adopting methods to analyze consumer behavior, ensure value proposition and redesign operating models.Online Retailers Focus on Offline Store Formats: Amid news of big brands resorting to enhancing digital presence, 2017 also saw some leading online pure plays launching offline or physical stores. These offline stores basically serve as a marketing tool to boost online business. Some e-tailers that launched physical stores include Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Birchbox, Bonobos, Everlane, Rent the Runway and Warby Parker.On the other side, brick-and-mortar stores are continuously making efforts to improve online and omni-channel presence in order to keep up with evolving shopping habits. This is working well for retailers as customers prefer to shop directly from the brand’s e-commerce site.Some notable names that have boosted their online presence are Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report), American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report), Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report), among others. This trend of online retailers opening physical stores and brick-and-mortar retailers making collaborations and acquisitions to expand online is going to prove beneficial for the industry in 2018.Increased M&A Activity: The last year was marked by numerous mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as well as investments to stay ahead. Some of the most interesting M&A activities included Amazon acquiring Whole Foods, and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) buying numerous e-commerce brands.Further, we saw Target investing in direct-to-consumer mattress brand, Casper. These mergers and investments have been beneficial in bringing more business for these brands. At the same time, this has helped retailers bring innovative solutions to drive traffic, boosting the top and the bottom lines.Further, we expect to see many more M&A activities in 2018. In fact, grocer Albertsons Companies proposal to buy the distressed drugstore retailer, Rite Aid Corporation (RAD  -  Free Report), may soon materialize.Shrinking Store Sizes: Changing consumer preferences have led to an increase in smaller stores. Even ‘big box’ retailers are now concentrating on smaller store formats, which accommodate more specific merchandise according to consumer preferences. We have already seen a transition relating to this idea, with companies like Targetand Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) focusing on smaller store formats.The main reason for this shift in consumer preference is the convenience and accessibility that smaller stores provide. Consumers are looking to make quick purchases these days. Finding the desired products by wandering through endless aisles at big stores is time taking.Today, smaller stores with specialized selections are preferred as finding desired products in little time is easier. Additionally, smaller stores are cost effective right from setting up to managing operating costs to finding space in urban environments.Growth of Retail-centric Apps and Services, Social Shopping: As already said, consumers are looking for speedy deliveries apart from multiple buying options. This has increased the number of retail-centric apps that merchants are adopting in order to stay competitive.Further, retailers are looking for third-party solutions to fulfill the demand of customers. Retailers have also been using social media platforms to advertise their brands, launch products and campaigns, talk to customers and even make merchandising decisions.Most companies are now also selling their products through social networking sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, which have shopping functionalities. Some retailers that have already adopted the Like2Buy platform on Instagram are Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Aeropostale and Target. Moreover, retailers are increasingly seeking the assistance of third parties to quickly get their products delivered.Economic Outlook Looks Supportive: The economic outlook has been favorable lately due to increased consumer confidence, steady consumer spending, low unemployment rates and rising incomes. These factors alongside rising house prices and improving stock market have put enough money in the hands of consumers, increasing their propensity to spend.This is a welcome thing for retailers, as the prosperity of the retail sector depends largely on consumers’ spending power. With these favorable trends expected to continue in 2018, retailers are gearing up to compete and gain a larger share of consumer spending.As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the retail industry in 2018 and beyond. But what about investing in the space right now?Check out our latest Retail Industry Outlook here for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

297,VFC,"The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 8. In the trailing four quarters, it outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of roughly 1%. In the preceding quarter, the company reported positive earnings surprise. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Kroger will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 41 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of roughly 13%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $27,366 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayStiff competition, falling comps, volatility in food prices, aggressive promotional environment and waning store traffic are making things tough for Kroger that has underperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has declined 23.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.6%.Although, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.8% in the first quarter, earnings per share continued to decline year over year. After falling 4.7% and 7% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, the bottom line plunged 18.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Subsequently, management trimmed earnings projection. Management envisions fiscal 2017 earnings in the band of $2.00-$2.05 per share down from earlier projection of $2.21-$2.25. The company anticipates earnings per share to decline in the second quarter. The company’s high debt level is also a concern for investors.Nevertheless, a dominant position among grocery retailers enables Kroger to sustain sales growth, expand store base and boost market share. It has also kept long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8-11% intact and expects it to attain on the back of customer 1st strategy, effective cost management and share buyback activities.Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kroger Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kroger Company (The) QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kroger is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

349,VFC,"V.F. Corp. (VFC  -  Free Report) has successfully acquired the privately held outdoor and sports apparel company Icebreaker Holdings Ltd. for an undisclosed amount. Following the conclusion of the acquisition, which was announced in November 2017, this Auckland, New Zealand-based brand has become a wholly owned subsidiary of V.F. Corp.The acquisition of the Icebreaker brand, which uses natural merino wool in its merchandise, perfectly complements V.F. Corp’s SmartWool brand that also has the merino component in its clothes and accessories. Rightly, this acquisition will enhance V.F. Corp’s position in the growing and underpenetrated natural fiber category. The company expects the addition of the brand to be immediately accretive to its bottom line.Founded in 1995, Icebreaker is popular for its natural clothing solutions as its merchandise are designed using merino wool, plant-based fibers and recycled fibers. The company uses a ‘farm to garment’ approach, buying merino wool from some of the most sustainable and ethical Merino farms in New Zealand. Served by 340 full-time employees, the brand is available in 47 countries.Operating under the V.F. Corp. umbrella, Icebreaker will retain its name as a unique brand and continue to base its employees in New Zealand.As it is, we believe that the acquisition provides increased opportunity for both parties. As for V.F. Corp., the Icebreaker brand will strengthen its leadership position in the natural fiber space. Meanwhile, this transaction provides Icebreaker and its suppliers with the opportunity to illustrate the benefits of its sustainably-farmed, ethically-sourced, New Zealand merino wool products to a whole new set of consumers.

Estimated earnings of 10 cents for the second quarter depict a year-over-year decline of 7.6%. However, estimated earnings of 69 cents for fiscal 2017 depict a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. The same is also within the managements guided range of 66-71 cents for fiscal 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $82.8 million for the second quarter which depicts a growth of 25.9% from the prior-year period.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Duluth Holdings Inc. QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Duluth Holdings is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. Duluth Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #3 but has an Earnings ESP of -1.64%, consequently making surprise prediction difficult. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Factors at Play Duluth Holdings has been witnessing sturdy year-over-year growth in its revenues for the past 29 consecutive quarters. The company has been gaining from the strong growth in both its direct and retail segment, backed by robust men’s and women’s business lines. A higher product-margin owing to favorable product mix and strong strategic management policies have been boding well for company. Additionally, the company’s stores have also been depicting strong performance, which has further encouraged it to focus to new store openings. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, it opened four new retail stores. The company has plans to open a total of 12 retail stores and one outlet store in fiscal 2017.Nevertheless, the company expects selling, general and administrative expense ratio to increase from figures in last year due to retail store pre-opening expenses. An aggressive promotional retail environment has also been raising concerns since it carries the risk of pulling down margins. Moreover, the company has also been experiencing a decline in shipping revenues in its direct business category. These headwinds having been taking a toll on the company’s share price performance. Shares of Duluth Holdings have declined 3.5% compared with the industry’s increase of 5.3% in the past six months.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:V.F.

372,VFC,"The big name reporting earnings today will be Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), but not until after the closing bell this afternoon. Never fear, though — there are plenty of other firms pushing out Q2 earnings results in the meantime:Oil field services provider Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report) posted 23 cents per share on quarterly revenues of $4.96 billion. Both numbers easily topped expectations of 19 cents per share and $4.84 billion in sales. Improved performance in both North and South America were cited as improvements in the company’s Q2, as was operating income in its Completion & Production segment, which swung to $397 million from a loss of $32 million this time a year ago. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is trading up 2.5% in today’s pre-market.Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report) also beat the Zacks consensus estimates on both top and bottom lines: $2.01 per share and $3.23 billion in revenues outperformed the $1.96 and $3.17 billion expected, respectively. This marks at least the fifth straight positive earnings surprise for the Zacks Rank #3 company, which also bumped up its guidance range for fiscal 2017 by a dime on both top and bottom ends.Toy-making giant Hasbro (HAS  -  Free Report) reported a mixed Q2 report this morning, beating the bottom-line estimate by 7 cents to 53 cents per share. Quarterly sales, however, narrowly missed the $973 million expected in the Zacks consensus. Yet franchise brand sales were up 21% year over year (these include popular brand names such as Monopoly, Transformers and My Little Pony), on quarterly sales up 10.6%. Shares are selling off roughly 5% in today’s pre-market, however, as the stock is up 40% year to date.Retail brand company VF Corporation (VFC  -  Free Report) beat expectations narrowly on top and bottom lines this morning, by a penny on the bottom line to 29 cents per share, and by roughly 3% on the top line to $2.36 billion. Strength in the company’s largest brands — among them Wrangler jeans, The North Face, Timberland and Nautica — boosted the company’s fortunes in the quarter. VF Corp. also announced Executive Chairman Eric Wiseman will be stepping down as of late October, to be replaced by President & CEO Steven Rendle.Finally, a Q2 beat for Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report) in both earnings and sales has come out this morning, reporting a 6-cent beat to 32 cents per share and $3.23 billion topping the $3.18 billion in revenues anticipated. The spin-off from Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report) in Q4 2016 also bumped up its 2017 EPS guidance from $1.15 per share to $1.20. The company appears to be on fairly sound footing considering the shakeup not only regarding the spin-off but the sudden departure of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld this past spring.
