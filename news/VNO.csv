0,VNO,"Stocks stumbled to a mixed close in above-average trade Tuesday as earnings news and concerns over missteps by lawmakers in Washington, D.C., kept the session off balance.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.3%, struggling against Goldman Sachs' (GS) 3% decline — which followed Goldman's second-quarter results before the starting bell. The S&P 500 managed a one-point gain, up a fraction.The Nasdaq Composite turned in a 0.5% win, as Netflix (NFLX) held the index's head above water, with assists from JD.com (JD), PayPal (PYPL) and Tesla (TSLA).The Senate found its effort at health care reform roadblocked by internal GOP resistance Monday night, and plan B — to simply repeal the Affordable Care Act and start from scratch — ran into resistance of its own later in the day. Stocks have generally shown sensitivity to indications that the Trump administration may not enact pledges on items such as health care, tax and banking reform. Stock futures had slumped overnight and remained weak before earnings reports begin to hit the wire early Tuesday.There was also weak economic news out of the real estate sector, with the National Association of Home Builders reporting its builder confidence survey slumped to 64 in July, down from June's reading of 69 and the lowest tally since November.Netflix scored a gap-up breakout, despite reporting mixed second-quarter results late Monday. The company reported adding 5.2 million new subscribers during the quarter, far above consensus views for 3.2 million. When the stock opened, it was extended above a standard flat-base buy point of 166.97. But the wide gap-up move enabled a technical buy range beginning roughly at the stock's 176.12 opening price. That left shares near the top of their buy range at the end of the session.PayPal rose more than 2% in quiet trade after a price hike, to 64 from 60, from KeyBanc Capital Markets. PayPal is extended after clearing a 55.24 flat-base buy pointJD.com kept up its recent volatility, punching up more than 3% in light trade. The stock has been trading wide and loose, but hung up by resistance near 44 since early June.Solar stocks were among the day's best performers, with SunPower (SPWR) beaming up 7% on news that utility Oklahoma Gas & Electric Energy had committed to a 10-megawatt solar facility in Covington, Okla. The gain put SunPower 90% above its March low.Other Solar plays also responded, with China's JinkoSolar (JKS) and Daqo New Energy (DQ) up 7% apiece, and First Solar (FSLR) notching a 3% gain. The solar energy group has outperformed all other industries over the last four- and eight-week periods.Office and retail REIT Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) clocked the S&P 500's worst loss, down 20% after spinning off a portion of its New York assets in combination with Washington D.C.-based assets from privately held JBG Smith. The new issue, JBG Smith Properties (JBGS), dipped 0.2% Tuesday.Also at the bottom of the S&P 500, Harley-Davidson (HOG) dropped 6% after reporting mixed Q2 results. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also took a 6% dunking, despite upgrades from Standpoint and Maxim Group, as investors flinched at fresh reports of customers falling ill after eating at a Chipotle's restaurant in Sterling, Va.After the close, United Airlines (UAL) dropped 3% after reporting its second-quarter results, railroad CSX (CSX) skidded 2% lower and IBM (IBM) shed more than 1%.RELATED:Electronic Payment Sector Swipes Ahead Of S&P, Gets Price HikesTop Large-Cap Growth Companies: Inside Big Cap 20How To Find Top-Quality Stocks Near A Buy Zone

1,VNO,"Donald Trump didn't look very far when searching for infrastructure advisors. He turned to two Manhattan real estate developers he has known for decades, Richard LeFrak and Steven Roth.LeFrak, a billionaire whose New York roots mirror Trump's own, and Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), one of the city's largest landlords, will spearhead a committee dedicated to one of the new administration's signature campaign pledges. Trump's relationships with the two men, who will lead a council of builders and engineers to monitor spending, crisscross New York in a web of personal and professional ties.The extent of their power and the risk of conflict aren't clear. Vornado is the biggest property owner in the area surrounding Manhattan's Pennsylvania Station and could benefit from increased infrastructure spending.While Trump told the Wall Street Journal that the council would reject some projects and expand others, that's usually the province of local officials. He hasn't articulated a plan beyond broad statements promising as much as $1 trillion in spending, including private investment, to improve roads, bridges and other public works. In an interview last month with CNBC, LeFrak said he anticipated a tug of war with Republicans in Congress concerned about deficits and that $550 billion was a more reasonable estimate.""Part of our assignment is to advise him as best we can on the merits of these different things,"" LeFrak said. ""There's no simple answer.""LeFrak isn't discussing the council further because it hasn't been formed yet, according to his spokesman, Steve Solomon. A spokeswoman for Roth declined to comment. A White House spokesman said he couldn't provide any details about the council or its role.Rep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said on Feb. 14 that an infrastructure package won't be released until after the House wraps up its proposals on taxes and to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.""I am honored that he has asked me,"" Roth said of Trump on a Feb. 14 conference call with analysts. ""Infrastructure matters are not political. Every citizen of America wants our infrastructure to be robust, to be in a good state of repair, so that we can be competitive and we can have the right quality of life.""LeFrak, 71, and Trump, 70, are both scions of families that made fortunes owning apartment buildings on the outskirts of Manhattan. The LeFrak real estate dynasty traces its origins to 1905, when Richard LeFrak's grandfather Harry emigrated to the U.S. from Palestine. The family business grew to become one of the largest residential landlords in New York and New Jersey, best known for building an eponymous apartment complex in Queens.Through the years, LeFrak has had cameos in Trump's life, serving as a Miss Universe judge in 2009 and appearing in a 2010 episode of ""The Apprentice."" In Trump's 1997 book ""The Art of the Comeback,"" he praises Richard LeFrak while disparaging his father, Sam LeFrak, who had tussled with Trump. The younger LeFrak has been a frequent guest at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Fla., according to a 2007 profile in the New York Times.Roth's relationship with Trump goes back at least to the early 1980s, when the two men acquired stakes in Alexander's (ALX) during a takeover battle for the department-store chain. Roth prevailed, seizing on the value of the company's real estate — including what is now the Manhattan headquarters of Bloomberg — and turning it into a $35 billion real estate empire. Trump lost his stake to Citibank (C) in bankruptcy court in the 1990s.In 2007, Roth was Trump's partner in a deal that tied up the loose ends of the future president's failed attempt to turn a 77-acre tract of land on the West Side of Manhattan into what would have been New York's biggest development since Rockefeller Center. After publicly feuding with Mayor Ed Koch and spurning an offer from developer William Zeckendorf Jr. to buy the undeveloped plot, Trump was forced by bankers to cede control of the site to a group of Hong Kong investors. Proceeds from the sale were eventually used to acquire 1290 Avenue of the Americas in New York and 555 California St. in San Francisco, leaving Trump with minority stakes in the two office buildings.Vornado bought out the controlling partners after Trump sued them, and it assumed potential liabilities from the lawsuit. Roth, 75, referenced his long-standing friendship with Trump when explaining the deal in an annual letter to shareholders. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed. Trump's stake in the two towers is now worth about $640 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making it his most valuable asset.More recently, Vornado swooped in when Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now senior White House advisor, was fighting to hold on to 666 Fifth Ave., a Manhattan tower he acquired at the height of the property bubble in 2007. Kushner was on the verge of defaulting on $1.1 billion of loans in 2011 when Vornado injected $80 million into the 39-story building as part of a deal to stave off Kushner's creditors. Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009, recently sold his stake in 666 Fifth Ave. to a family trust of which he isn't a beneficiary to comply with conflict-of-interest rules.Roth and LeFrak have their own history together. The developers jointly own a parcel of land on West 57th Street, near Central Park, where they leveled three prewar buildings in the past two years and plan to build what they describe as a seven-star hotel.The relationship between Roth and LeFrak will help smooth decision-making when it comes to infrastructure spending, according to Steven Witkoff, a Manhattan developer who has known Trump, Roth and LeFrak for 30 years. They know how to speak to one another, and they're both regarded as savvy stewards of their real estate empires, he said.""Risk management is going to be the order of the day,"" Witkoff said. ""Trump is not just appointing this slot to two billionaires. They have shown a unique ability to manage risk.""With exceptions such as projects on federal land, state and local entities typically control infrastructure and decide what work proceeds, said Jim Tymon, chief operating officer of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Trump's council could help review high-profile projects and possibly decide which get additional funding or financing, he said.It's not unheard of for developers to have a seat at the table for infrastructure planning. Many of the skills required to put together large real estate projects are transferable, such as navigating the regulatory process, gaining public support and arranging financing, according to Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR Realty, whose company owns $15 billion of real estate throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.""Real estate are seeds that are planted around infrastructure,"" Rechler, who spent five years on the board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said in an interview.Vornado has been involved in attempts to redevelop Penn Station and nearby structures for more than a decade. A parallel project called the Gateway Program, which would expand the railroad network under the Hudson River, is high on a list of proposals that local officials say need additional funding.Roth's holdings around Penn Station, one of the busiest transportation hubs in North America, are more of an asset than a liability, according to Alexander Goldfarb, a real estate analyst at Sandler O'Neil & Partners. Roth's familiarity with the area, in addition to his experience working alongside government entities, gives him insight into logistical issues such as the best way to alleviate traffic jams, Goldfarb said.LeFrak is partnering with Florida developer Turnberry Associates on SoLe Mia, a $4 billion project to transform a former Miami superfund site into a community with residential, office and retail properties.Roth and LeFrak are skilled at raising capital from diverse sources, which will be crucial for getting the program off the ground, according to Witkoff. Being able to show private investors predictable returns can be a challenge for infrastructure projects.""These guys are experts at financial structuring,"" Witkoff said. ""They understand incentives and how debt and equity come together and what it's going to take to get people interested in infrastructure.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantSurvey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In AmericaTrending Home Improvement Projects For 2017's Housing MarketHomebuying Cheaper Than Renting In Most Of U.S., But For How Long?

2,VNO,"Investing in real estate may help to build a strong foundation in your investment portfolio. These securities diversify portfolios, generate income and hold potential for capital growth -- a trifecta of benefits for ETF investors.And several REIT exchange traded funds may be poised for a sizable rally, having found support around their 200-day moving averages after a recent pullback. They include Vanguard REIT (VNQ), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), which are among the five largest funds in the sector.Real estate debuted as the 11th S&P 500 sector Monday, commanding a roughly 3% weighting in the large-cap index. It's a timely move, given the performance and popularity of REIT exchange traded funds with investors in 2016.As a stand-alone sector, REITs will gain added visibility that may serve to further increase asset flows into this asset class, says Adam Patti, CEO of IndexIQ, the firm behind IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (ROOF). Active managers, many of whom underweighted real estate when it was part of the financial sector, may be forced to adjust.Demand for U.S. real estate securities held strong ahead of the industry's elevation as a new S&P 500 sector. Investors poured $1.33 billion into real estate ETFs in August, following $1.60 billion in July, according to Morningstar data.""The popularity of REIT ETFs persisted last month"" even as other yield-focused ETFs, such as rate-sensitive telecom services and utilities, saw significant outflow, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote Sept. 13.On the stock market today, VNQ showed bullish momentum, extending Wednesday's gains from the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged in September. The Fed left the door open to hikes later this year. Several other REIT ETFs showed similar action.Investors in REITs should monitor interest rates closely. Lower rates typically make it easier to buy, sell and refinance property, which boosts demand for real estate. Conversely, the sector tends to sell off when rates trend up.IBD'S TAKE: Recent changes to a widely used classification system for equities could significantly impact how fund investors allocate resources.Among real estate ETFs, Vanguard's VNQ dominates in terms of net inflow so far this year, raking in $5.75 billion through August. The $34.83 billion ETF holds traditional real estate such as self-storage company Public Storage (PSA) and health care REIT Welltower (HCN).By comparison, its iShares rival IYR also holds newer ""specialty REITs"" focused on timber, communications or other areas. They include American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), former telecoms that have restructured as REITs, Rosenbluth noted.And the young XLRE invests exclusively in S&P 500 components. This ETF launched in late 2015 in anticipation of the landmark change to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) -- a taxonomy for equities -- that carved out real estate from financials as a stand-alone sector.XLRE swelled from a few hundred million in assets to $2.82 billion as the GICS changes took effect this month. The five largest real estate ETFs skew toward big REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG) and Vornado Realty (VNO).IndexIQ describes ROOF as the only way for investors to gain access to the small-cap segment of REITs and real estate holding companies. It invests across the commercial, residential and specialized REIT sectors.The ETF is relatively small in assets and thinly traded, but has vaulted over the five largest funds so far in 2016.ROOF jumped 16.2% on the stock market year to date through Sept. 21. By comparison, VNQ gained 11.8% over the same period, XLRE 6.8%, and ETFs tracking the S&P 500 7.5%.Index IQ's Patti thinks ""REITs still have room to run"" because they got hit fairly hard in 2015. Funds holding smaller REITs may offer an especially attractive opportunity for investors.Small caps as a group provide higher dividend yield than large caps, according to Patti. ROOF currently has a 12-month yield of 3.80% and VNQ 3.27%.The former invests in the bottom 10% of the domestic REIT market in terms of market capitalization, while filtering out the smallest and most illiquid names. Patti described ROOF's 67 stock holdings as ""hidden gems"" that are underowned and offer attractive relative value. They include First Industrial (FR).Added flow of money to real estate as a new sector could further extend valuations for large caps, while reducing their dividend yield, according to Patti. That dividend income is a big reason why investors seek out REITs in the first place. Real estate investment trusts generate yield by distributing 90% of their earnings as dividends.""The reality is if you're investing in REITs for yield and diversification, you should look at small caps,"" Patti said. He suggests that investors carve out 15% of their overall REIT exposure for the small caps in ROOF.RELATED:The First New S&P 500 Sector Since 1999 Is A Big Deal For InvestorsWith Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And AppealKey Debut For Real Estate Is A Big Opportunity For ETF InvestorsMeet The First New Sector SPDR ETFs In 17 Years

3,VNO,"Toys R Us, the world's largest toy chain, plans to leave its flagship store in New York's Times Square as it faces an expected rent hike.
"
4,VNO,"The 110,000-square-foot store at 1514 Broadway, with an indoor Ferris wheel and mechanical Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur, is too big for any single tenant, said C. Bradley Mendelson, vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield, who is handling leasing for building-owner Bow Tie Partners. The landlord plans to break up the space, Mendelson said.""The configuration of space is just too expensive for any one tenant,"" Mendelson said. ""Market rates have changed substantially. It has nothing to do with Toys' ability. Toys has been a very good tenant for the last 15, 16 years.""The move reflects rapid rent growth in the Times Square ""bow tie"" — the blocks immediately surrounding the area where Broadway and Seventh Avenue cross, often called the crossroads of the world. Retailers clamoring for access to the square's tourist traffic have been driving rents higher.Rates for ground-floor retail space in the bow tie area averaged $2,317 a square foot in late 2014, higher than anywhere in Manhattan except Fifth Avenue between 49th and 59th streets, according to a report by the Real Estate Board of New York. Three years earlier, the average was $1,433 a square foot.'Proud Resident'Toys R Us has been ""a proud resident of Times Square since our international flagship store opened there,"" Linda Connors, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an emailed statement. ""The lease for our store in Times Square expires in 2016 and, as previously noted, we have been reviewing our lease renewal options. We have not signed a lease agreement for a new location, and any rumors regarding this ongoing process are just that.""The ground floor of 21,000 square feet is being marketed for $2,500 a square foot, its second-floor space for $350 a square foot, and the lower level at $150 a square foot, he said. There are four other retail tenants in the 150,000-square-foot building: Foot Locker (FL) and Swatch stores, a Starbucks (SBUX) coffee shop and the Bond 45 restaurant. Their leases all expire in February, the same time as Toys R Us, he said.Toys R Us may relocate to the retail storefronts across the square at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, where Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) controls the retail portion of the property, according to the Commercial Observer, which reported the retailer's move. Vornado, which owns a stake in the toy retailer, has installed Times Square's largest digital advertising sign above its stores.About 43,000 square feet of retail space are immediately available at the hotel, according to Vornado's website. Wendi Kopsick, a Vornado spokeswoman, said the company would have no comment.The model dinosaur and Ferris wheel are Toys R Us property, and could be used at its new store, ""wherever that may be,"" Mendelson said. There have been discussions with Toys R Us about taking less space but ""nothing ongoing right now"" with the retailer, he said. The Times Square store was a staging area for marketing for the company, which has struggled in competition with the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).

However, this amount will be excluded in the adjusted FFO plus assumed conversions per share figure.These items will have a positive impact of 22 cents per share on the company’s net income for the quarter.

As a result, in 2011, Vornado acquired 49.5% stake in the building for $80 million and concurrently participated in half of the building’s loan of $1.2 billion. This loan, on the 1.4 million-square-foot office tower, is due in February 2019.Vornado will receive net proceeds of $120 million from the above-mentioned asset disposition. The company expects to realize a gain of $134 million in its financial statement and a tax gain of $244 million. Proceeds from sale of this stake will be used to pay off Vornado’s mortgage loan on the property. The company will also receive $58 million from its share in the refinanced mortgage on the property.This deal is a strategic fit for Vornado as it will enable the company to reduce its debts and pay off near-term loans efficiently. It will also help improve the company’s financial position. In addition, the disposition aids the company to reduce asset concentration in the New York City. This bodes well as any deterioration in economy or a fall in real estate markets in the region might hurt the company’s financial performance and the value of its properties in the area.However, Vornado’s aggressive dispositions, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, are expected to have a near-term dilutive impact on earnings. In fact, the company has identified another $1 billion of assets, which, it expects to sell over the next several years.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed its industry in the past six months.

Moreover, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, the company has been aggressively disposing of its assets. Recently, it announced a “handshake” deal with Kushner Companies to sell its stake in the office tower, situated at 666 Fifth Avenue. However, dilutive impact on earnings from divestitures of assets cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, intense competition and hike in interest rates remain concerns.Currently, Vornado carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

29,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30, after the closing bell. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to decline year over year.In the prior quarter, this NY-based real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 5.4% in terms of FFO per share. The results reflected growth in occupancy and same-store net operating income (NOI) in the New York portfolio.Over the trailing four quarters, Vornado surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in one, witnessing an average negative surprise of 0.22%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteShares of Vornado have underperformed the industry in the last three months. While the company’s shares have lost 9.6%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 7.3%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado boasts a concentration of high-quality assets and a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail. In addition, the company owns 555 California Street in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District as well as the MART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic assets in signature cities. This focus on having assets in such a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, as well as a diversified tenant base that includes several industry bellwethers, are expected to drive steady cash flows and fuel growth engine in the to be reported quarter.Vornado has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, it has been involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures along with business spin-offs. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be avoided in the near term.Moreover, the company announced that the first-quarter 2018 financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 37 cents on its total FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions. However, this amount will be excluded from its corresponding adjusted figure.Vornado will be recording $34.7 million worth of expenses, relating to the change in fair value of marketable securities as a result of new GAAP accounting standard effective Jan 1, 2018.  Earlier, the same was recognized through “accumulated other comprehensive income” on the company’s consolidated balance sheets and did not impact its consolidated statements of income.Moreover, Vornado will be recording $23.5 million of expenses that are linked to its share of possible additional New York City real property-transfer taxes.The company will also record expenses of $14.5 million, relating to the write off of issuance costs of Series G and Series I, which were redeemed in January 2018.Vornado will also report net loss from other items, amounting to $6.5 million.The company stated that the aforementioned figures are preliminary estimates and are conditioned on the completion of the financial closing procedures. Hence, it does not assure any consistency between these estimates and the final results.We also anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the first quarter is pegged at $533 million. This reflects a decline of 14.1% as compared with the prior-year quarter.Further, the company’s management and leasing fees are expected to remain flat, sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71 million indicates no change from the prior quarter.Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share, which is now 88 cents, witnessed a decline of 1.1% over the past month. Also, this indicates a year-over-year decline of 18.5%.In addition, over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 FFO per share, stands at 88 cents decreased 1.1%, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict FFO beat for Vornado this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Vornado is -10.63%.Zacks Rank: Vornado has a favorable Zacks Rank #3.

30,VNO,"Toys R Us, in which Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has 32.5% interest through a joint venture, recently announced that it has filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Filing for bankruptcy will allow Toys R Us to restructure its long-term debt of $4.9 million, $400 million of which has interest payments in 2018 and $1.7 billion due in 2019.  A bankruptcy will enable the company to reorganize its balance sheet, which has been made complex due to its leveraged buyout in 2005. This New Jersey-based toy retailer was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital Partners and Vornado Realty for $6.6 billion.Toys R Us is yet to discharge the remaining debt from its $6.6-million deal. In addition, the company is witnessing low sales amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences, with e-commerce grabbing majority of the market share.The bankruptcy filing will simplify the company’s capital structure and provide financial flexibility to improve its financial condition. Moreover, it will make efforts to enhance its website and shift focus to products like cribs instead of diapers, where online competition is less likely. These efforts, collectively, can help the company stage a turnaround and make the business viable for the long term.Also, acknowledging its financial obligations provides an insight to the major vendors about the company’s long-term sustainability and ensures inventory built-up throughout the holiday season.Vornado has been criticized for making non-traditional investments, many of which have not been profitable. Further, the bankruptcy of Toys R Us underlines the formidable competition that store retailers face from online giants.Amid these, Vornado has been actively disposing its assets in a bid to streamline the business. The company earlier spun-off its shopping center business, creating Urban Edge Properties — a publicly-traded real estate investment trust (REIT). In July, it separated the Washington, D.C.-based JBG SMITH Properties and combined it with selected assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”).Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed its industry year to date, plunging 28.6%, as against 6.1% growth recorded by the industry.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc. (UNIT  -  Free Report). While Getty Realty and Seritage flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Communications Sales & Leasing carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

32,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corporation (SLG  -  Free Report) recently closed a loan refinancing worth $1.2 billion for the Manhattan-based office building — 280 Park Avenue. Both companies hold a joint venture spanning 1,250,000 square feet at this property.The interest-only loan is slated to mature in September 2024, as extended, and carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.73%. It will replace a previous LIBOR plus 2% loan of $900 million, which was slated to mature in May 2023.The aforementioned joint venture has strategically improved the Manhattan-based building with a renovation plan worth $150 million. The plan was focused on the revitalization of the façade and the interior of the property. It has been upgraded with a premium lobby, new thin-line perimeter induction units, bathrooms and elevator cabs, electrical distribution and an advance security system.  Moreover, the plaza adjacent to this property has been redesigned. Improvements have been made to make the building more sustainable. Such transformative redevelopments helped enhance its profile and achieve 97% occupancy.

Other significant tenants on its roster include Fiduciary Trust, Promontory Financial Group, Teneo Holdings, Viking Global and Starbucks.Vornado is a New York-based real estate investment trust (REIT), which mainly owns office and retail properties. Its portfolio is concentrated in the New York City.The company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate.

33,VNO,"Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, reported first-quarter 2018 pro forma funds from operations (FFO) of 60 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure indicates a 3% increase from the year-ago quarter tally of 58 cents.Results displayed growth in property net operating income (NOI), supported by same-store properties, and lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities. However, these positives were partially offset by lower NOI from apartment sales in 2017 and 2018.In the reported quarter, total revenues of $247.7 million comfortably outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $243.7 million. In addition, the reported figure came in marginally higher than the prior-year quarter tally of $246.5 million.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (before utility reimbursements) increased 2.6% year over year to $144.9 million while expenses (net of utility reimbursements) increased 2.1% from the prior-year quarter to $38.9 million. Consequently, same-store NOI climbed 2.7% to $106 million on a year-over-year basis.Same-store average daily occupancy expanded 30 basis point (bps) year over year to 96.3%. Rental rates on new leases were up 0.4% whereas rental rates on renewal leases were up 4.9% from the expiring lease rates.As of Mar 31, 2018, Aimco had cash and restricted cash on hand of $91 million. Moreover, the estimated fair market value of the company’s unencumbered apartment communities was around $2 billion.Further, at the end of the quarter under review, Aimco’s outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility were $79 million and available capacity was $509 million, after considering $12 million of letters of credit, backed by the facility.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Aimco invested $47 million in redevelopment and development.In addition, Aimco is revamping its portfolio through property sales and reinvesting the proceeds in select apartment homes with higher rents, superior margins and higher-than-expected growth.Through these efforts, the company increased its revenues per apartment home by 7% to $2,052. Additionally, it enhanced the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio. Specifically, the percentage of A, B and C+ home was 49%, 35% and 16%, respectively, in first-quarter 2018 compared with 51%, 35% and 14% recorded in the year-ago quarter. GuidanceFor full-year 2018, the company updated its pro forma FFO per share guidance to $2.39-$2.49 from $2.42-$2.52 provided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $2.48.For second-quarter 2018, Aimco provided pro forma FFO per share guidance of 57-61 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is 62 cents.The company projects same-store NOI growth to be in the range of 1.70-3.10% and revenue growth in the range of 2.10-3.10%.DividendOn May 2, Aimco announced a quarterly cash dividend of 38 cents per share of Class A Common Stock for the first quarter. This marks a 6% year-over-year increase. The dividend will be paid on May 31 to stockholders of record as of May 18, 2018.Bottom LineAimco’s efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions are likely to drive long-term growth. In addition to this, the company has a solid portfolio, diversified both in terms of geography and price point. This is likely to help meet the rise in demand for apartment properties efficiently.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets is anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Apartment Investment and Management Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Apartment Investment and Management Company QuoteAimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company bought the building, just before the financial crisis in 2007, for a record price of $1.8 billion. However, as recession created chaos for Kushner, they eventually started selling its parts. As a result, in 2011, Vornado acquired 49.5% stake in the building and was permitted to rearrange the mortgage on the office building.Through the filing, Steven Roth, Vornado’s chairman and chief executive officer informed the investors, “I believe we now have a handshake to sell our interest to our partner at a price which will repay our investment plus a mezzanine-type return. The existing loan will be repaid including payment to us of the portion of the debt that we hold.”Notably, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, Vornado has been aggressively disposing of its assets. Moreover, in July 2017, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC-segment. Earlier, the company spun-off the shopping center business, creating Urban Edge Properties – a publicly traded REIT. Another $1 billion of assets have been identified, which the company will be selling over the next several years. The streamlining efforts are a strategic fit and are anticipated to propel growth over the long term.

35,VNO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report).

Moreover, total revenues increased 4.3% year over year.Results reflect growth in occupancy and same-store NOI in the New York portfolio.For full-year 2017, adjusted FFO per share was $3.73, well ahead of the year-ago tally of $3.59. This was backed by 4.0% year-over-year growth in total revenues to $2.1 billion.Behind the Headline NumbersIn the New York portfolio, 319,000 square feet of office space and 39,000 square feet of retail space were leased in the reported quarter.

36,VNO,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in VNO.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen four estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $5.12 a share a month ago to its current level of $4.17.Also, for the current quarter, Vornado Realty has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 87 cents a share from $1.32 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 15.3% in the past month.Vornado Realty Trust Price and Consensus Vornado Realty Trust Price and Consensus | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report).

37,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.35, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. The number also increased 11.6% year over year.However, the results reflect a fall in occupancy in the Washington DC and 555 California Street portfolio.In the reported quarter, total revenue came in at $626 million, up 0.7% year over year. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $610.81 million. Vornado Realty Trust Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.Behind the Headline NumbersIn the New York portfolio, Vornado leased 543,000 square feet of office space and 24,000 square feet of retail space in the reported quarter. Also, the company leased 91,000 square feet and 5,000 square feet of space in the Mart and 555 California Street, respectively. It also leased 196,000 square feet of office space in Washington DC.At the quarter end, same-store occupancy in the New York portfolio was 96.6%, flat sequentially and up 60 basis points (bps) year over year. Further, same-store occupancy in the Washington DC portfolio was 90.4%, down 20 bps sequentially and 160 bps year over year.Same-store earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization edged down 0.5% year over year for the New York portfolio. For the Washington D.C. portfolio, the figure descended 2.7%.As of Jun 30, 2017, Vornado had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, down from $1.5 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Other Important DevelopmentsOn Jul 17, the company completed the spin-off of JBG SMITH properties from its Washington, D.C.-based business and merged the same with the operating company and specific Washington, D.C. metropolitan area assets of The JBG Companies (JBG). This move led to the formation of an independent public company — JBG SMITH Properties (JBGS) — which started trading on the NYSE on Jul 18.Our ViewpointAlthough Vornado has Class A office assets located in high-rent, high barrier-to-entry markets and a diverse tenant base, which have the capability to support a turnaround over the long term, its results in the second quarter were disappointing.After being criticized for venturing into too many sectors, Vornado started repositioning its portfolio through property dispositions. The earnings dilutive impact of the same cannot be bypassed. Further, the company faces stiff competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estate, including sublease space available from its tenants. This influences the company’s ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors, thereby adversely affecting its long-term profitability.Also, persistent office space efficiency trends continue to limit any robust additional demand for office space. Furthermore, hike in interest rates remains a key concern for the company.Currently, Vornado carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Q2 Earnings Schedule of Other REITsWe now look forward to the earnings releases of other REITs like Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc.

38,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has a portfolio of premium assets in high-rent, high barrier-to-entry markets as well as a diverse tenant base. Further, its strategic acquisitions and divestitures including spin-offs and strong New York business keep its growth momentum alive.However, dilutive impact on earnings from divestitures of assets cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, intense competition and hike in interest rates remain concerns.Vornado reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. However, the figure was lower than the prior-year quarter tally of $1.02. Total revenues were $536.2 million in the reported quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $524.1 million. Moreover, total revenues increased 4.3% year over year. The results reflected growth in occupancy and same-store NOI in the New York portfolio.Vornado boasts a concentration of high-quality assets and a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail. In addition, the company owns 555 California Street, in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District, as well as theMART in Chicago's River North District, which are the iconic assets in signature cities. This focus on having assets in such a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets as well as a diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers, are expected to drive steady cash flows and fuel its growth engine over the long term.Furthermore, the company is focused on improving its core business and is making opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures in addition to business spin-offs. In fact, strategic sell-outs provide the company with dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic acquisitions. The spin-off of its Washington, D.C properties made Vornado a New York-based office and a retail REIT. Also, the previous spin-off of its shopping center business into a publicly-traded REIT named Urban Edge Properties was an outcome of Vornado’s decision to separate two businesses, which have been together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies. Such efforts to streamline its business are likely to help its long-term growth.Nonetheless, Vornado faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties and other commercial real estates, including sublease space available from its tenants. This influences its ability to attract and retain tenants at relatively higher rents than its competitors, thereby, adversely affecting its long-term profitability. Also, persistent office space efficiency trends continue to limit any robust demand for office space. Additionally, the retail real estate market is crippled with issues like declining mall traffic, retailers’ store closures and bankruptcy filing amid growing preference for online retailing.Further, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, Vornado has been aggressively disposing of its assets. The company has identified $1 billion of assets, which will be sold over the next several years by them. The streamlining efforts are a strategic fit and are anticipated to propel growth over the long term.Shares of Vornado have underperformed its industry in the past three months, declining 11.9% versus the industry’s descend of 8.8%.Currently, Vornado carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth a LookInvestors interested in the real estate industry can consider better-ranked stocks like HFF, Inc.

40,VNO,"As we are about to enter another eventful week of the current reporting cycle, real estate investment trust (REIT) will be seeing a really busy Monday.Admittedly, the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. However, underlying asset categories and location of properties play a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm — CBRE Group Inc.  — the overall U.S. office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 13.0% during fourth-quarter 2017 amid an uptick in supply. Nevertheless, the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post-recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U.S. office markets.Also, the holiday season turned out to be blissful for the retailers with upbeat consumer sentiment amid an improving economy, rising income and low unemployment level. Per government data, consumer spending remained solid during this season, with retail sales rising 0.9% and 0.4% in November and December, respectively.However, the retail real estate market continued to bear the brunt as mall traffic suffered amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through online channels, resulting in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition are filing bankruptcies. Additionally, the turbulent retail real estate market is said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which mall landlords find unjustified.Nevertheless, retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, but expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities to boost traffic.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others may disappoint this earnings season. However to predict that, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP, to predict the chances of a beat this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases.Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company is involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. In July 2017, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC business. This made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. Though such efforts to streamline business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be ignored.In January 2018, Vornado announced that its fourth-quarter 2017 financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 18 cents on its funds from operations (FFO) per share. However, this amount will be excluded in the adjusted FFO per share figure.We predict a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $524.1 million. This reflects a decline of 17.9% from the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at 93 cents, which also denotes a projected decline of 17.7% year over year.At present, Vornado has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -4.76%. This combination of a negative ESP and a Zacks Rank of 4 lowers the chances of a positive surprise for the company. (Read more: Why an Earnings Beat Is Unlikely for Vornado in Q4)Moreover, Vornado has a mixed surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and missed in the other two, witnessing an average negative surprise of 4.6%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteNational Retail Properties, Inc. (NNN  -  Free Report) invests in net-leased retail properties throughout the United States. The company is expected to report quarterly numbers around Feb 12.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for National Retail Properties is projected to register 3.2% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter to 64 cents. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at nearly $148.8 million, which reflects growth of 5.7% year over year.This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of -1.73%. Therefore, according to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted whether National Retail Properties will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter under review. In fact, though a favorable Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stock has exceeded estimates in three out of the preceding four quarters and met in the other, with an average beat of 2.87%, as demonstrated in the chart below: National Retail Properties Price and EPS Surprise  National Retail Properties Price and EPS Surprise | National Retail Properties QuoteBrixmor Property Group (BRX  -  Free Report) is engaged in ownership and operation of high-quality, open-air shopping centers.

Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at nearly $315.2 million, which reflects a decline of 2.7% from the prior-year period.Currently, Brixmor Property Group has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #4.

44,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 12, after the closing bell. Revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are expected to decline year over year.In the prior quarter, this NY-based real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 1.96% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. The results reflected growth in occupancy and same-store NOI in the New York portfolio.Vornado has a disappointing earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and missed in the other two, witnessing an average negative surprise of 4.6%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteShares of Vornado have underperformed the industry in the last six months. While the company’s shares have lost 13.6%, the industry has witnessed a decline of 6.3%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company has been involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be avoided either.The company announced that its fourth-quarter 2017 financial results will include certain items that will have a negative impact of 18 cents on its FFO per share. However, this amount will be excluded in the adjusted FFO per share figure.The non-recurring items will have a loss impact of 20 cents per share, after non-controlling interests, on its net income for the quarter. Similar to FFO, the adjusted net income will exclude the impact.On account of a reduction in corporate tax rates under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company will recognize $34.8 million of tax expense. The tax expense pertains to a reduction in deferred tax assets — primarily 220 Central Park South — of Vornado’s taxable REIT subsidiaries.  The company will also record expense of $4.8 million related to the prepayment of $450 million of aggregate principal on its senior unsecured notes. Specifically, on Dec 13, 2017, the company prepaid the principal amount on the 2.5% notes due in 2019.Vornado will also report net loss from other items amounting to $1 million. This includes any losses from the real estate fund.The company also stated that the aforementioned figures are preliminary estimates and are conditioned on the completion of the financial closing procedures. Hence, it does not assure any consistency between these estimates and the final results.We also anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the fourth quarter is pegged at $524 million. This reflects a decline of 17.9% as compared with the prior year quarter.Further, the company’s management and leasing fees are expected to witness a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 million indicates a marginal decline from the prior quarter.  In addition, over the past month, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 FFO per share decreased 2.1%, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.Vornado’s wholly owned subsidiary, Building Maintenance Services (BMS), is expected to realize lower cleaning fees for its cleaning, engineering and security services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BMS cleaning fees of $24.2 million reflects an 8.6% decline from the prior quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict a FFO beat for Vornado this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Results reflected a fall in occupancy in the Washington DC portfolio.Moreover, Vornado does not have an impressive surprise history. In fact, in each occasions, over the trailing four quarters, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado’s high quality office and retail properties are concentrated in New York City. Also, the company has premier assets in both Chicago and San Francisco. These are high-rent and high barrier-to-entry geographic markets. Additionally, the company has a diversified tenant base.However, as part of portfolio-repositioning efforts, Vornado has been aggressively disposing its assets. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the earnings dilutive effects of these moves cannot be bypassed.Also, the company faces intense competition from developers, owners and operators of office properties, and other commercial real estate in its markets. Amid this, Vornado’s pricing power and occupancy gains are likely to remain limited.In addition, over the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2017 FFO per share moved south nearly 1.6% to $1.26, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Vornado will likely beat estimates this season.

47,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) announced the completion of its spin-off of JBG Smith properties from its New York-based business and merging the same with the operating company and specific Washington, D.C. metropolitan area assets of The JBG Companies (“JBG”). This move led to the formation of an independent public company – JBG Smith (JBGS) — which started trading on the NYSE on Jul 18.The combined entity has become the largest landlord to the U.S. government in the capital. While Vornado’s shareholders have 73% stake in the new company and JBG investors and management own 21% and 6% stake, respectively.According to Vornado’s announcement of the spin-off, JBG's senior management team would oversee the management of the newly formed business. The combined company’s portfolio would include 50 office properties, 18 multifamily properties and 11 other properties. These assets are located in the premier submarkets of the Washington, DC metropolitan area.The combined entity is anticipated to create synergies worth approximately $35 million. The company would be well funded, with strong liquidity and balance-sheet positions.After being criticized for venturing into too many sectors, Vornado spun off its shopping center business in 2015 into a publicly-traded REIT named Urban Edge Properties. The spin-off was an outcome of Vornado’s decision to separate two businesses, which were together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies.Such strategic spin-offs are likely to help Vornado in streamlining its business and create value for the company.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the space include ProLogis, Inc.

48,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has announced a hike in its quarterly common dividend, giving shareholders a reason to rejoice. Specifically, the company will now pay a dividend of 63 cents per share, up from 60 cents paid in the prior quarter. The increased dividend will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders of record as on Jan 29, 2018.Based on the increased rate, the 2018 annual dividend comes to $2.52 a share, resulting in an annualized yield of about 3.53%, considering Vornado’s closing price of $71.30 on Jan 17. Though this is lower than the industry average of 4.36%, the hike will likely increase investors’ confidence in the stock.Notably, Vornado has a concentration of high-quality assets, with a strategic focus on expanding its market share in New York City office and Manhattan street retail. In addition, the company owns 555 California Street, in the heart of San Francisco's Financial District, as well as theMART in Chicago's River North District, which are iconic assets in signature cities.This focus on having assets in such a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets, as well as a diversified tenant base, which includes several industry bellwethers, is anticipated to drive steady cash flows and fuel its growth engine over the long term.Moreover, the company, focused on improving its core business, has been making opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures in addition to business spin-offs. In fact, well-planned sell-outs provide the company with dry powder to reinvest in opportunistic acquisitions.The 2017 spin-off of its Washington, D.C properties made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. The focus on New York is a strategic fit given that the city is preferred by businesses, residents, tourists and investors. It enjoys solid long-term employment growth with a diversified employment base. In addition, the city attracts international tourists and enjoys steady tourism growth.Also, the previous spin-off of its shopping center business into a publicly-traded REIT named Urban Edge Properties (UE  -  Free Report) was an outcome of Vornado’s decision to separate two businesses, which have been together for legacy reasons but with no real operating synergies. Such efforts to streamline the company’s business are likely to drive Vornado’s long-term growth.Vornado boasts a strong liquidity position with decent leverage and well-manageable debt maturities. As of Sep 30, 2017, Vornado had nearly $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, in October 2017, the company announced the extension of one of the two $1.25-billion revolving credit facilities. The extended credit facility will improve the company’s liquidity position. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.The company is likely to benefit from improvement in the economy and the job market. However, dilutive impact on earnings from divestitures of assets cannot be bypassed in the near term. Further, intense competition and hike in interest rates remain concerns.Shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 4.7%, while the industry incurred loss of 4.6% during this time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors.

(VTR  -  Free Report).Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

51,VNO,"We will now tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle and real estate investment trust (REIT) will buzz with activity on Monday itself.Among the factors that influenced the REIT space, a sluggish yet steady macroeconomic improvement is worth mentioning. This led to strong demand for a number of asset categories in third-quarter 2017. Though supply has been increasing, the pace has been modest in many of the asset categories.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Moreover, according to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the previous years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.However, mall traffic continues to suffer amid rapid shift in customers’ shopping preference through the online channel, resulting in an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot com bandwagon. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent times. Further, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been considerably curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases.Office REIT Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. (ARE  -  Free Report) focuses on Class A properties concentrated in urban campuses, primarily for the life science and technology entities. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and exit, and a limited supply of available space. This highly dynamic setting adds to the productivity and efficiency of the tenants, and will enable the company to enjoy steady rental revenues in the third quarter.However, a substantial development pipeline, currency fluctuations and stiff competition can affect Alexandria’s bottom-line growth in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $210.9 million. This reflects a decline of 8.5% as compared with the prior-year period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share for the quarter is $1.50.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Alexandria is 0.00%. Moreover, it has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP.

(AVB  -  Free Report), there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of its markets. Hence, any robust growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Further, delay in construction activities in the development portfolio is anticipated to affect the company’s lease-up net operating income in the near term.Nevertheless, AvalonBay has a solid portfolio of high quality assets in premium locations as well as a healthy balance sheet. Also, increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth and rising wages augur well for rental demand.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $538.5 million, denoting an expected increase of 4.3% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $2.26.However, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -5.75%. This combination leaves our prediction inconclusive. (Read more: What's in the Offing for AvalonBay in Q3 Earnings?)On the other hand, residential REIT UDR Inc. (UDR  -  Free Report) boasts vast experience in the residential real estate market. The company has a superior portfolio in targeted U.S. markets and adheres to disciplined capital allocation. These are likely to drive results in the to-be-reported quarter.Specifically, the company is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographic trends. Along with this, the healthy job market is estimated to drive demand for apartments.However, we remain apprehensive about UDR Inc.’s performance as it has been dealing with escalating deliveries in a number of its markets. This remains a concern as elevated levels of supply curtail a landlord’s ability to demand higher rents and result in lesser absorption. As such, concession levels are likely to remain at the higher end, while pricing power of the company is expected to remain limited in the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of UDR Inc. is pegged at $250.1 million, denoting estimated growth of 2.8% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at 47 cents.At present, UDR Inc. has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat. (Read more: What's in the Offing for UDR Inc this Earnings Season?)Finally, diversified REIT Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company is involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. In July, it completed the spin-off of its Washington, DC business. This made Vornado a New York-based office and retail REIT. Though such efforts to streamline business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be ignored.Subsequently, we anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $527.8 million. This reflects a decline of 16.7% from the prior-year quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is currently pegged at 72 cents.At present, Vornado has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -16.7%. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.

52,VNO,"AGNC Investment Corp. (AGNC  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 net spread and dollar roll income of 59 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Also, the figure came in below the prior-quarter tally of 63 cents per share.Following the release of disappointing third-quarter results, shares of AGNC Investment declined 4.2% to $20.53 during regular trading session on Oct 26.However, encouragingly, the third-quarter comprehensive income per common share came in at 99 cents, way ahead of 40 cents recorded in the prior quarter.Further, as of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s tangible net book value per share was $19.78, up from $19.25 as of Jun 30, 2017.The economic return on tangible common equity for the company during the reported quarter was 5.6%. This included dividend per share of 54 cents and a rise of 53 cents in tangible net book value per share.However, net interest income (NII) of $178 million came in lower than the prior-quarter figure of $181 million.Inside the HeadlinesAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s investment portfolio aggregated $72.5 billion. This included $71.7 billion of Agency mortgage backed securities (MBS) and to-be-announced (TBA) securities, and $0.8 billion of credit risk transfer (CRT) and non-agency securities.Inclusive of its net TBA position and net payable/(receivable) for unsettled securities, AGNC Investment’s tangible net book value ""at risk"" leverage ratio was 8.0x as of Sep 30, 2017, against 8.1x as of Jun 30, 2017.For the third quarter, the company's investment portfolio bore a weighted average constant repayment rate (CPR) of 12.1%, up from 10.9% in the prior quarter.Excluding net TBA position, AGNC Investment's average asset yield was 2.72% for the reported quarter, up from 2.66% recorded in the previous quarter.Average cost of funds, excluding the net TBA position, was 1.59% in third-quarter 2017, marking an increase from 1.51% witnessed in the prior quarter. The rise primarily stemmed from higher repo rates which were mostly offset by an uptick in the average floating rate received on AGNC Investment’s interest rate swaps.On its balance sheet and dollar roll funded assets, combined annualized net interest rate spread for the quarter came in at 1.34%, down from 1.46% reported in the prior quarter.Also, as of Sep 30, 2017, AGNC Investment’s cash and cash equivalents totaled around $1.10 billion, down from $1.12 billion as of Jun 30, 2017.Dividend UpdateIn the third quarter, AGNC Investment announced monthly dividends of 18 cents per share for July, August and September.

53,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the closing bell.In the prior quarter, this NY-based real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 7.14% in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results reflected robust same-store occupancy rate in the New York portfolio. However, this was offset by a decline in same-store occupancy and same-store earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the Washington D.C. portfolio.Moreover, Vornado has a disappointing earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and missed in the other three, witnessing an average negative surprise of 5.8%. This is depicted in the graph below:Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Vornado Realty Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Vornado Realty Trust QuoteYear to date, shares of Vornado have underperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have plunged 29.4%, the industry recorded growth of 2.3%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVornado has been actively repositioning its portfolio. In line with this, the company has been involved in opportunistic acquisitions and divestitures, along with business spin-offs. Though such efforts to streamline its business are commendable, the dilutive effects of these moves cannot be avoided either.Subsequently, we anticipate a fall in the company’s total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $528 million. This reflects a decline of 15.7% as compared with the previous quarter.Further, the company’s management and leasing fees are expected to witness a decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.09 million indicates a sharp drop of 36.8% from the prior quarter.  In addition, over the past week, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter 2017 FFO per share decreased 12.2%, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.Nonetheless, Vornado’s wholly owned subsidiary, Building Maintenance Services (BMS), is expected to realize higher cleaning fees for its cleaning, engineering and security services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BMS cleaning fees of $21.4 million reflects a 0.7% increase from the prior quarter.  Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predicts a FFO beat for Vornado this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Vornado is -16.67%.Zacks Rank: Vornado has a Zacks Rank #3.

54,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) announced the extension of one of the two $1.25-billion revolving credit facilities through its operating partnership, Vornado Realty L.P. The extended credit facility will improve the company’s liquidity position.The debt, previously due in November 2018, is now scheduled to mature in January 2022. Two six-month extension options enable the company to stretch the maturities of the assumed debt.The arrangement has also enabled the company to access debt markets at favorable terms. The extended loan carries an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 100 basis points (bps). It will replace the previous facility bearing a higher annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 105 bps. However, the facility fee remains at 20 bps.Nonetheless, the interest rate and facility fees on the other $1.25-billion credit facility of Vornado remain unchanged. The borrowing is due in February 2021 and carries two 6-month extension options.The inflated credit facility will complement the company’s efforts to expand its industrial portfolio. This, along with the company’s robust operating platform and strong balance sheet position, will likely help it execute strategic priorities, and drive net asset value and dividend growth.Vornado has been actively strengthening its balance sheet with the help of refinancing activities. Recently Vornado and SL Green Realty Corporation (SLG) closed a loan refinancing worth $1.2 billion for the Manhattan-based office building, 280 Park Avenue.The interest-only loan is slated to mature in September 2024, as extended, and carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.73%. It replaced a previous LIBOR plus 2% loan of $900 million, which was scheduled to mature in May 2023.

55,VNO,"Vornado Realty Trust (VNO  -  Free Report) announced that its third-quarter financial results will include certain items that will have an impact of 47 cents loss on its funds from operation (FFO) per share. However, this amount will be excluded to reach adjusted FFO per share. The non-recurring items will have a loss impact of 51 cents per share, after non-controlling interests, on its net income for the quarter. Similar to FFO, the adjusted net income will exclude the impact. Vornado incurred transaction costs of $53.6 million related to the spin-off of its Washington D.C. segment — JBG SMITH — on Jul 17. The spun-off company recorded a net income of $3.9 million for the Jul 1 to Jul 17 period.
