1,LEG,"When's the best time to buy stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)? In a strong market uptrend as they break out of the kind of chart patterns that launch virtually all major moves.In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA, bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (AKA, technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.TIP: For an even deeper understanding of how chart patterns work, read more about the concept and psychology behind bases.From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.Nvidia Breakout From Cup With HandleWhen Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose more than 700% over the next 27 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can identify the cup with handle that Amazon formed from October 2016 to February 2017.Learn More About Cup-With-Handle PatternsThe double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.Here's what to look for in a double bottom:Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.Facebook Breakout From Double BottomLike many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.Can You Spot The Pattern?Look at a weekly chart for Micron Technology (MU). Can you see the double bottom it formed from June to August 2017?Learn More About Double BottomsAs the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.Here are the key elements of a flat base:Netflix Breakout From Flat BaseNetflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can spot the powerful breakout Abiomed (ABMD) launched from a flat base in early January of this year.Learn More About Flat BasesGet instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Improve Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

2,LEG,"Check out the way Facebook stock has responded to the data-breach scandal that smacked the company earlier this year, and it seems clear the social networking giant's long apology tour has helped lift the stock.XOn the public relations and Facebook (FB) news pages of the company's website, there are headlines such as ""Removing Bad Actors From Facebook."" It says Facebook took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the company is still running a media blitz that started in May called ""Facing Facts,"" an explanatory campaign that includes national commercial broadcasts and regular messages to Facebook users.Facebook also is trying to keep users updated on what it's doing to prevent false news and how its fact-checking program is working. It has pledged to commit a task force of 20,000 people to get the job done.Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, has called the data breach the darkest chapter in Facebook's 14-year history. Still, he says, the fundamental damage to the social network's platform has been ""very contained.""""We're seeing minimal damage over the last few months, in terms of user engagement, trends and advertising,"" said Ives. ""Facebook is going through a hand-holding period with users, regulators and app developers to make sure these things can't be repeated.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs details of the data breach emerged, Facebook stock plunged 24% from a high of 195.32 on Feb. 1 to a one-year low of 149.02 on March 26. But the stock has rebounded 32% since then, indicating Facebook's mea culpa and recovery plan is working. Facebook stock surged to another all-time high of 203.55 on June 20. On Monday, shares gained 1.6% to close at 197.36 on the stock market today.Facebook's data breach involved research firm Cambridge Analytica and its access to personal information from 87 million users of the social network. The breach seeped its way into the U.S. presidential election of 2016, due to its connection with alleged Russian meddling.In subsequent congressional hearings, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was dragged before both House and Senate panels, giving 10 hours worth of testimony. Since then, Facebook has faced a storm of criticism from users, advertisers and regulators over the past few months, both in the U.S. and Europe.Facebook's troubles helped spur the European Union into implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, which created data protection rules across Europe. It took effect in May, and Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit already have complied.But it has also raised a question as to whether digital advertising revenue at Facebook and Google will be impacted long-term by a regulatory wave in Europe and in the U.S.""It's created some disruption but I think the bark is worse than the bite,"" said GBH's Ives. Ives has a rating of highly attractive on Facebook stock and price target of 225.Whatever troubles Facebook is facing hasn't slowed its consistent pace of double-digit growth in revenue and earnings. Facebook's first-quarter revenue jumped 49% from the year-ago period to $11.96 billion, along with 63% growth in earnings per share.For the second quarter, analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue growth of 43% to $13.3 billion. They also see 30% growth in earnings per share.Working in Facebook's favor is its massive size. It has 2.2 billion monthly active users, one-third of the world's global population. That's up 14% from the same period a year ago. About 1.45 billion people log on daily, spending an average of 20 minutes per visit.Put it all together and Facebook has enormous influence among advertisers, which account for about 96% of its revenue. Facebook's clout, resulting from the large amount of data it has on users, is matched only by Google. Combined, the two rake in about 60% of digital advertising spending. That includes Alphabet's YouTube.Other social networking sites, including Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Pinterest and Yelp (YELP) have hardly put a dent in Facebook's armor.All this is occurring while Facebook stock still has several revenue-growth levers to pull. Its biggest ace-in-the-hole right now is Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing mobile platform that just surpassed 1 billion users. Compare that with Snap's Snapchat, which had 191 million users at the end of the first quarter.Facebook has steadily monetized Instagram with ads. The company does not break out Instagram revenue. It is, however, seen by analysts as a core revenue driver with a lot of room to accelerate.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves believes ad revenue will more than double from a year ago to $8.9 billion. By 2020, he thinks Instagram will account for 26% of Facebook's total revenue.""As core Facebook matures, Instagram is the key to the next leg of growth,"" Hargreaves wrote in a report to clients this month. He has an overweight rating on Facebook and price target of 245.""Facebook continues to grow its core user base and increase the effectiveness of its advertising offerings, which, when combined with a massive opportunity to grow Instagram and monetize its messaging products, we believe creates a substantial opportunity for future growth for many years,"" he wrote.Another growth lever is the Facebook Messenger platform.This past month, analysts have spotted some of the first advertisements on Messenger. That includes ads from Staples, Uber and Peloton.""Just in the last two weeks we have seen consistent ads in Facebook Messenger for the first time,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a June 19 note to clients. Facebook Messenger has 1.3 billion monthly active users.Mahaney thinks Messenger could contribute $6 billion to $8 billion in revenue. That translates into $1 in earnings per share to the company by 2020. He has an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 250.Another future growth lever is Facebook's other messaging platform, WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion users.There is one overhang out there that analysts are watching closely. The issue is whether younger users are abandoning the platform for social apps considered more ""cool,"" or other reasons. It's already happening, but not to a level that has yet threatened the stock, GBH's Ives says.Facebook had dominated the social media landscape among America's youth. But it no longer is the most popular online platform among teens, a recent Pew Research Center survey said. In a survey on Facebook and teenage usage, about half of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use Facebook, but they use YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat more often, in that order.Notably, it said 95% of those teens have a smartphone, with almost half saying they ""almost constantly"" use the internet. That's a big pool of advertising opportunity.""That's been a challenging demographic for them and speaks to why the Instagram acquisition will go down as one of Zuckerberg's best moves in the evolution of Facebook,"" said Ives. ""What Instagram has done is put a competitive moat around that demographic.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Mark Zuckerberg, The Facebook Data Breach And The Dark Side Of Social MediaFacebook's Zuckerberg Admits Big Mistake, Apologizes For ScandalFacebook Rejects Claims In New York Times Story About User Data AbuseFor First Time, Facebook Seen Losing Youth Audience To Snapchat

3,LEG,"Even Indiana Jones would probably have given up.Howard Carter and his team dug through hundreds of boulders in Egypt's Valley of the Kings for about five arduous years, looking for the lost tomb of Tutankhamun. His research told him the tomb was there. But no one — not even he — could find it thousands of years after the child king's death. Carter's once enthusiastic financial backer was losing patience.But in one of history's greatest examples of persistence with a massive payoff, Carter removed rubble that revealed the entrance of the tomb on Nov. 25, 1922. His discovery is still considered the most significant archaeological feat in modern times, Tarek El-Awady, curator of the ""King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh"" exhibit, told IBD in an email sent from Egypt. ""Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun still stands as the greatest discovery made by man,"" El-Awady said.The valuable treasures Carter found still draw crowds to museums around the world. But what Carter did to achieve his goals and persevere is equally priceless, including:Carter was never formally trained as an archaeologist or even a scientist. He was the son of an artist and an artist himself. But he learned about archaeology on the job after he was hired at the age of 17 to draw Egyptian artifacts for a wealthy family. His skill as an artist won him a spot traveling to Egypt alongside some of the best archaeologists of all time, including Percy Newberry. From them he learned how to carefully excavate and catalog a dig's artifacts. This knowledge, paired with his previous training as an artist, created a powerful blend of skill sets that few in the world possessed. ""He learned a lot on the job. You can't learn it until you're standing there having to do it,"" Pearce Creasman, associate professor and director of the Egyptian Expedition at the University of Arizona told IBD. ""He put all the pieces together and learned from all these people and added his special skill (of drawing) to the mix.""Carter's skill set was so unique that he commanded respect on digs and was later named chief inspector for the Egyptian Antiquities Service — a position that would set him up for success later.From Newberry and others, Carter learned the importance of being highly detailed in cataloging everything he found. His journals of findings are richly illustrated in painstaking detail — a standard practice in archaeology today — but perhaps seen as excessive or even obsessive in the day.To capture every detail, Carter developed a breakthrough system of classifying digs that culminated with the King Tut discovery. Every group of objects found was designated with a number from one to 620, Nicholas Reeves and John Taylor wrote in ""Howard Carter Before Tutankhamun."" Smaller groups of items found were then notated with single or multiple letters, such as a, b, c, aa, bb, cc and aaa, bbb, ccc.Again, this was Carter applying his talents to something he learned from someone else. Carter ""learned excavation with British excavator Flinders Petrie, who taught him the importance of small finds,"" Brian Fagen, an archaeologist and emeritus professor of anthropology at University of California, Santa Barbara, told IBD. ""Researchers working on the tomb still consult his notebooks, which are an exceptional record, far ahead of their time.""Carter closely observed and took valuable tips from ""experts."" But just as importantly, he knew what to ignore, too. Theodore Davis, a wealthy U.S. attorney and successful archaeologist whom Carter was working with, declared in the early 1910s that all the great finds in the Valley of the Kings already had been found.Carter disregarded Davis' ""expert opinion."" Carter's own experience proved to be just as precious, if not more than Davis'. Carter ""was a maverick operator, stubborn, ambitious and brimming with self-confidence,"" William Cross, author of ""Carnarvon, Carter and Tutankhamun Revisited: The Hidden Truths and Doomed Relationships,"" told IBD. ""His know-how, spark and ingenuity convinced him that the tomb of Tutankhamun was somewhere in the Valley of the Kings.""After Davis gave up on the dig, Carter had to find another backer to fund a continued search.Carter quit his stable job as an inspector for the Egyptian archaeological service in 1905 to free up time for his search. Some of the hardest years of his life followed.Carter's quest for the tomb was almost an obsession. But he knew that to complete it he would need financial backing. After Davis left the quest, Carter teamed up with a new financial supporter, wealthy Briton Lord Carnarvon. The difficulty was convincing him to keep writing the checks even as Carter found nothing year after year.When Carnarvon grew frustrated and was about to cut off Carter's financing, Carter modified his approach to appeal to Carnarvon's sense as an investor. In those times, archaeologist teams kept half of what they found and returned the remainder to Egypt. Carter knew the cost of financing another dig was a fraction of the reward possible if they found the tomb. He explained the economics to Carnarvon and said if he wouldn't pay to keep digging, Carter would from his own pocket. The pitch was so compelling — blending economic reasoning with scientific precision — it convinced Carnarvon to keep writing the checks. ""He got one guy to buy in and sometimes that's all it takes, is one person to make something really big happen,"" Creasman said.Carter's sharp tongue might have made it difficult to sell his idea, but he ""was smart enough and eloquent enough in tales about Tutankhamun's lost tomb to be enticed and trusted by millionaire investors looking to cash in on antiquities, and the glint of gold to come,"" Cross said.Just imagining your success isn't going to do much. Success comes to those who visualize how to get there. Carter provides an example. While still antiquities inspector, Carter looked back and examined all the successful digs in the Valley of the Kings. Not just his, but everyone's. Most archaeologists randomly dug. But Carter applied his detailed grid-block system of analysis to past discoveries. This allowed him to build a holistic picture in his mind of what was explored, and what wasn't. By ""retroactively applying to all the work done in the Valley of the Kings … he knew areas that other people had missed,"" Creasman said. By studying past records, Carter knew others ""dug 10 feet to the right and 20 feet to the left, and 15 feet over here. They had not dug everything, everywhere.""Perhaps it was another example of how Carter elevated archaeology by blending facets of his unique mind as an artist would. Carter's attention to detail allowed him to visualize what parts of the valley were ""clean territory — an area no one has ever excavated,"" Creasman said.""He had this map in his head, along with internal motivation,"" Creasman said. ""I haven't done everything I can do until I've done this. When people obsess on a thing, they can't let it go.""Carter loved his life's work — ever since starting out as an artist. That passion drove him to keep looking and learning. Others who were purely driven by money would have given up. ""Working in the Valley of the Kings is like magic, the silence and the absolute power of the cliffs surrounding the valley makes every Egyptologist willing to spend his entire life working and working, running after a dream that might or might not ever come true,"" El-Awady said.His passion yielded success even when he wasn't trying. In addition to exploring and drawing, Carter loved horses and riding the west bank of Luxor, El-Awady says. ""One of his greatest discoveries happened when the leg of his horse got stuck in a hole that turned out to be the symbolic burial of King Mentuhotep II (Dynasty 11),"" El-Awady said. ""In this tomb, the beautiful statue of the king was discovered.""Carter brought ""long-term planning, the need for a disciplined approach to finding and excavating sites, and the necessity for recording everything with photographs, drawings, or in writing,"" Fagen said. ""He really was one of the first modern archaeologists, with a unique eye for detail, and always a mind for the long-term outcome of the project.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Apply your unique interests and abilities to your profession to reinvent what's possible.Overcame: Many failed attempts to find King Tut's tomb and loss of financial backing""All we have to do is to peel the shrines like an onion, and we will be with the king himself.""

7,LEG,"Marijuana stocks Canopy Growth (CGC) and Cronos Group (CRON) were mixed on Friday, even after President Trump said he would ""probably"" back marijuana-friendly legislation in the U.S. and Canada's senate voted a day earlier to legalize recreational marijuana — with conditions.XBut one analyst suggested the slide in some marijuana stocks could be simple profit-taking following the clearing of a big obstacle in Canada.Trump on Friday made the remarks outside the White House in response to a question from the media on whether he would support a bill that would keep the federal government from intruding on states' efforts to regulate marijuana. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., introduced the bill on Thursday.""I support Senator Gardner,"" Trump said, according to Politico. ""I know exactly what he's doing, we're looking at it. But I probably will end up supporting that, yes.""Trump's remarks put him at odds with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who once said ""good people don't smoke marijuana."" Sessions in January rescinded Obama-era guidance that essentially instructed the federal authorities to take a more laissez-faire approach to states that voted to legalize usage of the plant. Some analysts, and much of the industry, at least publicly, shrugged off the move.The bill from Gardner and Warren could help speed expansion of the marijuana industry in the U.S., where pot is still federally forbidden.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) CEO Jim Hagedorn last month called for more ""states' rights"" as patchwork regulations, particularly in California, weigh on its hydroponics business.In particular, he called for ""a solution that allows the players in the space to have adequate access to banking and to pay a fair tax rate like other businesses.""Banks have to comply with federal regulations. But since the federal government outlaws pot, many marijuana businesses operate on cash, or depend on good relationships with the banks that will take them.U.S. marijuana producer MedMen, in a recent regulatory filing in Canada, noted that its banks ""are fully aware of the nature of the Company's business and continue to remain supportive of the Company's growth plans."" MedMen's dispensaries currently accept cash and debit cards.The company, which has been valued at $1.65 billion, went public in Canada last week.On Thursday, Canada's senate voted 56-30 to legalize recreational marijuana use, amid resistance from the nation's conservative lawmakers. The bill cleared by the senate came with some four dozen amendments that now need to be weighed by the House of Commons.The House of Commons will consider the amendments to the bill and send it back to the Senate.Legislation to legalize recreational marijuana in Canada was first introduced last year. It would allow users to have 30 grams of marijuana. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada.The amendments in the measure cleared by the senate, among other things, placed tougher advertising constraints on marijuana businesses. Marijuana companies would not be able to advertise on T-shirts, hats and other items under that amendment.Another would let Canada's provinces decide whether people can grow their own marijuana at home. Young adults would also get a ticket for sharing small amounts of weed with a minor.""On a longer-term basis, as the market develops, we would expect these rules to be relaxed as unintended consequences do not materialize (which largely has been the case in the U.S.), and the market ultimately migrates more toward an alcohol model,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in a research note dated Friday.The bill, if passed, would give Canada's marijuana businesses a leg up on the U.S. Already, the marijuana industry in Canada has seen a wave of consolidation, as companies try to position themselves for recreational legalization.Canopy Growth, a big Canadian pot producer whose shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange last month, fell intraday but closed up 0.4% at 30.40 in the stock market today. Canopy trades in Canada under the ticker WEED.Cronos Group, another such producer in Canada, lost 5.6%.

9,LEG,"A U.S. and China trade war has been put on hold, but maybe not for long. For a few weeks this spring, President Trump's Make America Great Again and President Xi Jinping's Made in China 2025 seemed ready to collide. Then came word that China would buy more U.S. goods and the U.S. won't impose harsh new China tariffs.""Be cool, it will all work out!"" Trump tweeted about talks en route to a recent trade deal that China's state-run People's Daily hailed as a ""win-win"" for both countries.Trump's throwback vision — stressing steel, agriculture, autos and oil — may coexist for a while with Xi's prescription for China's centrally planned high-tech, high-income future. But the harmony can't last long in the world's most important economic relationship.Already, Trump, under fire over the China trade truce, said on May 22 it's just a ""start"" and then the following day said talks would likely need a ""different structure."" On Tuesday, the White House said it have tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods set up by June 15, though news reports suggesting that a China trade war was back on appeared premature.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMore broadly, the largely status quo deal won't alter China's grand plan to overtake America's technological leadership by nearly any means necessary. Ultimately, China and the U.S. could erect barriers in strategic sectors, creating an economic cold war that severs closely integrated global supply chains.Blue-chip giants Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) all popped May 21 as Wall Street celebrated Trump's deal with China. While their near-term future in China may be more secure, the longer-term remains as uncertain as ever.Made in China 2025, the 10-year plan set out three years ago, looks like anything but a win-win for the U.S. or any of Beijing's other major trading partners. Through state subsidies, acquisitions, market access rules and sometimes outright cybertheft, Xi is bent on closing the technological gap, dominating domestic markets and establishing global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence.The official aim is to steadily displace foreign components, achieving 40% self-sufficiency by 2020 and 70% by 2025.Concerns over China's techno-military ambitions are only heightened by its One Belt, One Road trillion-dollar vision to command global trade by financing infrastructure across Asia and into the Middle East, Europe and Africa. China also created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to rival the World Bank and the D.C. consensus on the global economy.Yet it's unclear if the U.S. has the appetite or strategy to thwart Beijing's ambitions. Just 10 weeks ago Trump tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win"" and then demanded a $200 billion cut in the China trade gap. Yet rather than move beyond tariff skirmishes to a full-blown U.S. and China trade war, Trump gladly took Beijing's pledge to boost American energy and agricultural purchases somewhat. And that modest concession came after Trump pledged leniency for Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE, which violated sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE had ceased operations after the U.S. banned American companies from working with it.Why was Trump so quick to relent? He may have favored a unified approach to North Korean diplomacy. Beijing also called his bluff, judging that Trump would have no stomach for a U.S. and China trade war with American farmers in the cross hairs ahead of key midterm elections.Trump also may have realized he had a much weaker hand than he had imagined.His initial threat was a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports. But Trump tariffs largely would have hit Chinese ventures of U.S. and other foreign multinationals, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The tariffs on mostly intermediate goods would have raised U.S. production costs, hurting competitiveness.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang. Made in China 2025 is an aspiration, but current Chinese tech prowess still lags that of the U.S. and others, they noted. ""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""Trump said something similar about his desire to go easy on ZTE, tweeting that it ""buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies.""A Friday report said that the Trump administration has reached a deal to lift ZTE sanctions in exchange for another financial penalty, restructure management and hire U.S. compliance officers.Still, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains uneasy.The Trump administration's sudden shift from wielding a big stick to selling more carrots, so to speak, reflected a long-running split between businesses' short-term financial interests and national security concerns about long-term strategic goals, says American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Derek Scissors.Despite a consensus that America must confront China on trade, both sides ""keep fighting over how tough we should be,"" he told IBD.Likewise, Scissors says, a growing consensus holds that the U.S. must act multilaterally to hold China to account. Even Trump had a change of heart about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal cobbled together by President Obama to help counter China's influence in East Asia. Trump relentlessly criticized the 12-nation deal in the campaign. He dropped TPP, never ratified by the Senate, on his fourth day in office. But he recently told top economic advisor Larry Kudlow to explore getting back in.Yet saying we should act multilaterally is easier than doing it, says Scissors. He sees no realistic chance for a TPP revival. Instead, Trump is targeting allies with steel and aluminum tariffs and a new probe into auto imports.For now, America's strategic drift and Trump's status-quo trade deal are playing into China's hands. But Scissors says a cold U.S. and China trade war is coming.""We're heading into a cold war with Chinese characteristics,"" Scissors said. ""They aren't the Soviets.""Unlike the USSR, China is a rival but not an enemy. And it's fully integrated with the global economy. ""I don't think it gets as bad,"" Scissors said.Other nations have sought to climb the income ladder via unfair trade policies to build up national champions. Yet ""China now has the wealth, commercial sophistication and technical expertise to make its pursuit of technological leadership work,"" warned James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a submission to the Trump administration's probe of China's technology and intellectual property practices.It boasts the world's fastest supercomputer, half as many tech unicorns as the U.S. (private companies sporting a $1 billion market cap) and wildly successful public companies such as Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) that can give U.S. FANG stocks a run for their money.""The fundamental issue for the U.S. and other Western nations, and the IT sector, is how to respond to a managed economy with a well-financed strategy to create a domestic industry intended to displace foreign suppliers.""Yet there's also a clear military dimension to China's ambitions to become the leader in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics and aerospace.The premise behind allowing China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 was that trade would force its state-run system to gradually converge with market economies. That opened the door for U.S. multinationals to outsource their assembly lines, capitalizing on China's huge pool of low-wage labor. More recently, Chinese companies have been moving up the value chain, aided by strategic deals but also by technology from foreign joint-venture partners as a price of market access.Many have questioned whether the liberal technology policies of the U.S. and other rich nations ever made sense. Yet now that Beijing is directing a $300 billion national ""self-sufficiency"" campaign to minimize reliance on technology from the U.S., Germany, South Korea and others, its bid to buy technology has been met by a chill, if not paranoia.In 2015, when Beijing spelled out Made in China 2025, Chinese investments in U.S. tech startups surged to $9.9 billion from $2.3 billion a year earlier. The tide began to turn at the end of 2016 when President Obama, on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), blocked the sale of a German chipmaker's U.S. unit to Grand Chip Investment GMBH, owned by a Chinese company.Last year, President Trump nixed a bid by Chinese investors to buy Lattice Semiconductor. In March, Trump blocked a $117 billion Broadcom (AVGO) offer for Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. The apparent fear was that Broadcom, ready to move its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, would sandbag Qualcomm's 5G wireless R&D and give a leg up to China's Huawei. Facing pressure from U.S. lawmakers, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) this year dropped plans to sell Huawei's new phone in America.Qualcomm has long been in Beijing's sights. China has threatened to derail Qualcomm's merger with Dutch chip firm NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). In 2015, Qualcomm ponied up $1 billion to get out from under a Chinese antitrust probe. Qualcomm seemed to have bought regulatory tolerance, in part by lending its technology to a joint venture with Guizhou Province to produce server chips.China has used such strong-arm tactics to gain proprietary technology, costing U.S. firms upward of $200 billion a year, according to some estimates.But if Beijing won't give up its tacit encouragement of technology transfer as a cost of doing business in China, the U.S. Congress could step into the breach.Congress is weighing legislation to beef up the CFIUS to let it oversee more transactions, including technology transfer agreements, bankruptcy sales and early-stage venture capital deals. The VC industry warns that banning Chinese funds from U.S. investments will push startups to migrate elsewhere.The Trump administration reportedly has mulled curbing Chinese citizens' participation in advanced research at U.S. universities. A Duke University researcher is believed to have transferred knowledge to develop China's new stealth fighter jet.If China continues to resist competitive market dynamics, ""Western nations will naturally turn from managed integration to something more self-protective,"" Daniel Rosen, founding partner of the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in Foreign Affairs.While products such as toys, furniture and apparel could avoid national security scrutiny, Rosen sees a real risk of disengagement in strategic areas.Countries don't follow Econ 101 textbook examples with trade only in finished goods. Modern supply chains and investment links often involve a myriad of countries for a single product, especially for tech goods.The breakup could happen in stages, as China marches toward Xi's 2025 goals. Or the impact on technology supply chains could be more violent, like a major slow-moving earthquake.Consider the chip industry in which U.S. and China trade frictions are highest. China consumes about 60% of the $412 billion semiconductor market, but three-fourths of those chips are imported (even factoring in foreign multinational output in China). No Chinese firms rank in the top 20 producers. Those chips are then assembled into finished electronics like the Apple iPhone, the bulk of which are shipped overseas. High-tech exports in the first quarter totaled $138 billion.""The cost of disengagement will be severe for China, the United States, and third parties,"" Rosen wrote. ""It is possible that when China and the United States stare these hard realities in the eye, with adjustment costs likely to run into the trillions of dollars over the next decade, they will seek an alternative.""But with Beijing working to ""hardwire its system not to converge,"" a long-term U.S. and China trade war becomes increasingly likely, he said.China's leaders aren't willing to trust their country's future to the free market. Wages in China have leapt above those in Brazil and Mexico and can't compete with Vietnam or India. The working-age population is shrinking and will keep doing so for decades. To a large extent, if China is going to remain the world's manufacturing giant and join the ranks of rich nations, it will have to depend on robots and other technology, such as artificial intelligence.China's ascendancy is hardly a sure thing. ""Like many grandiose ambitions of central planning, the more spectacular elements will likely fall by the wayside,"" Council on Foreign Relations research associate Lorand Laskai wrote of Beijing's AI roadmap. ""However, the plan might still succeed if only because China is committing resources to a societywide AI push"" and reorienting the education system to train Chinese students to work with AI.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Gave Up His Best Leverage In China Trade Talks — For Beans?Alibaba Price-Target Raised On Continued China E-Commerce DominanceThese Stocks Rally After Trump Cancels North Korea SummitBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchShould I Buy Stocks Now?

10,LEG,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all started last week higher but closed the week modestly lower. This sideways stock market action offered a chance for many leading stocks to work on handles in their consolidations. Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) finished handles last week, offering new buy points. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Alibaba (BABA) finished handles on Monday.All five stocks rallied at least 1% on Monday, with Twitter attempting a breakout. The stocks were mixed Tuesday morning.Handles offer a last shakeout of weak holders. When a stock clears a proper handle in strong volume, it's evidence that the stock is ready to advance.Proper handles involve at least five days of moderate declines, though some develop over several weeks. You want to see a gradual drift, ideally in light trade. Heavy trade would imply selling from big institutions. The midpoint of the handle should be above the midpoint of the base. If a handle forms in the lower half of a pattern, there may still be selling pressure as old investors seek to exit with a profit or minimal losses.While handles are most closely associated with cup bases, they also form on double-bottom patterns. Twitter and Akamai stocks are cup-with-handle bases, while the Facebook stock handle is on a double bottom. Alphabet and Alibaba stocks are trying to finish handles in double bottoms.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook stock formed an oddly shaped, double-bottom base, with the second leg of the W falling sharply lower amid the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal. The stock cleared a 186.20 buy point on May 11, but volume was well below average. Indeed, shares had been rallying for a few weeks on weak trade.But after that tepid breakout, Facebook stock has pulled back modestly in even-lighter volume. As of Friday's close, Facebook stock has a handle with a new 188.42 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 182.68, then rose 1% to 184.49 on Monday.Facebook fell 0.4% to 183.80 in stock market trading today.Keep in mind that the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging since the start of November and hasn't made headway for the past 10 months.Twitter has formed a cup-with-handle base with a 33.88 entry. Much of the base formed below its 50-day moving average, though the handle is moderately above that level. Twitter stock price ended Friday at 32.63.Twitter climbed 3.1% to 33.63 Monday after rising as high as 34.03. The breakout attempt came on below average. Twitter fell 2.3% to 32.86 on Tuesday.Akamai Technologies formed a cup base since March 9, forging a handle last week. That gives the stock a 77.69 buy point. The stock climbed 1.5% to 76.46 Monday. Shares popped to 78.25 intraday Tuesday, briefly clearing the entry point, but reversed to close off 0.1% to 76.39.The Google parent rose 1.3% to 1,084.01 on Monday. As of Monday's close, Alphabet stock has a proper handle with a 1,118.25 entry point.However, the midpoint of the handle is just above the midpoint of the base. While that's proper, it also means a fair amount of overhead resistance could remain.Also, the stock's RS line has gone sideways for year, as Alphabet has moved in line with the S&P 500 index.Alphabet fell 0.8% to 1,075.31 on Tuesday.Alibaba has formed a shallow double-bottom base. On Monday, shares rose 1.35% to 197.64. The stock now has handle on a daily chart, creating a 200.10 entry.  Alibaba lost 0.9% to 195.87.But on a weekly chart, this potential handle isn't visible, because Alibaba rose fractionally last week and is up slightly so far this week. The handle buy point also isn't much lower than the 201.60 entry from just above the middle of the double-bottom's ""W.""At minimum, Alibaba's stock appears to be facing resistance at 200. The stock hasn't been above 200 since the mid-March peak of the middle part of the W.

11,LEG,"Another darling of the Trump administration is poised to gain from the Iran deal breakup as oil surges: Natural gas exports.With the move to curb Iran's oil output encouraging more shale drilling, prices for natural gas produced alongside crude in West Texas could crater, falling to zero some days, according to Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Already, the gas sold at West Texas' Waha hub is down 48% for the year.That's bad for producers selling the fuel in the U.S., but good for companies that export it in tankers. As the market for liquefied natural gas grows in Asia, being able to source gas at its cheapest should give U.S. exports a leg up.""I doubt this was a driving factor by the administration"" to impose sanctions because ""we just don't have that much capacity built up for LNG exports,"" said Anastacia Dialynas, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.But indirectly, she said, ""if it results in a structurally higher oil price, it definitely makes U.S. cargoes more attractive.""Only Cheniere Energy (LNG) and Dominion Energy (D) are currently exporting U.S. shale gas worldwide, but as many as three more projects could be up and running in the next year. Several other companies including Tellurian (TELL) and NextDecade (NEXT) plan to start LNG projects within the next decade.From Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to the President himself, the White House has long sung the praises of increasing American LNG exports to help trim the trade deficit with Asian countries. Meanwhile, the Permian boom has filled pipelines to capacity, trapping gas in the region and making prices there the cheapest of any major U.S. shale play.Once the sanctions formally kick in, they'll make long-term LNG contracts linked to oil prices in other parts of the world more expensive, potentially increasing demand for agreements tied to cheap and abundant U.S. shale gas.

13,LEG,"Not surprisingly, Elgin Baylor was the No. 1 pick in the 1958 National Basketball Association draft. After all, he'd been selected to the Associated Press All-American team and named Most Valuable Player in the NCAA Final Four. So he was rewarded with the highest salary ever paid to an NBA rookie: $25,000 for the season. The average salary paid to an NBA player today is over $72,500 per game — whether they play or not.You'd think that Baylor might be a tad envious, but he isn't. In typical Baylor fashion, he looks to the positive.""That was a lot of money then,"" he said in a phone interview with IBD. ""Teachers were only making $6,500 a year.""Baylor, of course, went on to a magical career, named to 11 NBA All-Star teams (he was 1959's All-Star Game MVP), averaging over 27 points per game over 14 seasons with the Lakers — first in Minneapolis and then in Los Angeles — and inspiring fans and teammates alike.Baylor writes about all this in his newly published memoir, ""Hang Time: My Life in Basketball,"" written with Alan Eisenstock.He was born Sept. 16, 1934, and grew up in heavily segregated Washington, D.C. His father — presciently — named him Elgin, after his dependable watch. It was a difficult life, but Elgin had basketball.The park in Baylor's neighborhood did not have a hoop, but he and his brothers started sneaking into a white neighborhood's park at night to play. Once the authorities put up a basket in his neighborhood park — it was a rim without a net and a wobbly wooden backboard — there was no stopping him.Baylor became obsessed with basketball, playing after school and on weekends. He was good, far better than his peers. So he begged his brothers to take him along to their games. ""I wanted to play with older guys,"" he said. ""Playing with kids was no fun."" He couldn't learn anything.When he was 14, Baylor got into a one-on-one game with a taller, older boy who played for his college team. The game was close, but Elgin lost. And he lost the second game, too. And the third. They played each other almost daily for weeks before Baylor eventually won one. And after that first victory, he never lost again.""I'm living the old saying: If you want to improve your game, play against somebody better."" Current fans of the game likely wouldn't recognize the way basketball was played then. It was mostly a lot of passing until someone was clear to take a two-handed set shot. But Baylor was fast, jumped high and recognized that he didn't have to be constrained. He had moves. And he had great hang time. He could stop on a dime and jump over defenders for one-handed shots.There are times where he took one of his jumpers and he heard ""the crowd gasp,"" he recalled. ""That's what I'd call it — a collective gasp, as if coming from one large body.""But Baylor had more than skill working for him. He took to the court every day with another important ingredient for success: confidence. He built it in the schoolyards where trash-talking was an important element in the game — ""You can't guard me,"" was a regular Baylor refrain to opponents — and carried that through to the NBA.""The thing about it is that in the neighborhood I lived in, everybody had an attitude that they were better than the other guy. You had to go out there (on the court) with that attitude and give as good as you got.""Trash talk didn't end in the schoolyard. It extended all the way to the top levels of the game, ""especially when I was a rookie,"" Baylor said. ""The most important thing is having confidence and the veteran players would try to break that in me, especially because I was the first player chosen in the draft.""I was never arrogant or cocky, but I felt I had the skills to go out there and do what I had to do and I just concentrated on that.""Baylor's single-minded focus on playing his game and avoiding distractions was significantly more important for him than for other rookies — and not just because he was the first draft pick. He was also the savior. It had been years since the Minneapolis franchise enjoyed a championship season as it did during the years when George Mikan led the team to titles in six years (1949-54). The Lakers finished 19-53 in the season before Baylor joined the team.But along with the team's lackluster performance there was another problem: It was hemorrhaging cash. And there were some who placed the team's future squarely on Baylor's shoulders.""I never thought about it,"" Baylor told IBD. ""I was just happy to be able to play professional basketball, and that's what I concentrated on.""It paid off. The Lakers made it to the NBA finals in the next two seasons, before moving to Los Angeles. Certainly it was Baylor who made the difference, not only because of his skills but also his attitude.He came to his first training camp prepared — and respectful. He'd memorized the names, numbers and stats of all his new teammates. Watching him in practice, they in turn soon came to appreciate him and his skills.However, practice doesn't always make perfect. Early in the season, Baylor's performances were largely lackluster until teammate Hot Rod Hundley lectured him.""I remember Hot Rod told me I was thinking too much. I was a rookie and didn't want to go out there and show off too much. But he said I should play my game, that I wasn't playing the way I did in practice.""That discussion not only freed Baylor to become the player he became, but also a leader of a team he would lead on and off the field.""He treated everyone with respect,"" teammate Jerry West said in an email exchange. ""He was beloved by all his teammates. I used to watch him out of the corner of my eye (wondering) can I learn anything from this? He never called attention to himself. His own teammates were the ones who called him great.""Part of the example he set was not holding on to tough losses. His philosophy: Once a game ends, it's over. We'll get 'em next time.""You can't let a loss bother you,"" Baylor said. ""My mother used to tell me everything is going to be fine. You have a long life ahead of you.""The professional part of that life, however, was potentially curtailed by a serious knee injury. Multiple doctors were unable to diagnose the root cause of his pain, so Baylor just kept playing. Finally, one physician figured out what the problem was, and successfully operated on it, but doubted Baylor would be able to play again. In fact, he told Baylor he might walk with a limp.Baylor refused to listen. Instead he followed an extensive exercise regimen that sufficiently recuperated his leg so that he could play.""I was concerned about how well I could play,"" Baylor recalled. ""I had to change. I knew I couldn't do the same things I did before.""So at first, he did not play all-out, until his surgeon cornered him:""He told me, 'You're not playing the way you should play. I did a great job on your knee. But you're just going out there being tentative. If you're going to play like that, you might as well come and sit on the bench with me.'""Baylor went back and played all-out. And no one appreciated his presence more than fellow All-Star West. ""He helped draw me out of my shell (to the point) where I was more personable with people,"" West said. ""My tendency was to always run away from publicity. I would watch Elgin sit and talk to reporters. He had a grace about him. Some people are real. He came into a room, and there'd be this white light where he was sitting, He had this aura about him. He's someone I care about deeply, as a player — and a person.""A perennial All-Star, he was a great athlete and a team leader.Overcame: Growing up in a deeply segregated Washington, D.C.Lesson: Find something you like and concentrate on that.Quote: ""As a youngster growing up, all I wanted to do was play, and I tried not to let the other stuff (such as inferior facilities in his neighborhood) bother me.""

14,LEG,"Apple (AAPL) and now Nvidia (NVDA) have broken out from shallow double-bottom bases. Chinese online sales giant Alibaba (BABA) and Workday (WDAY) are among the other top stocks moving toward buy points from the same bullish pattern.East West Bancorp (EWBC) and RH (RH), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, are also forming double-bottom bases. These W-shaped patterns proliferates when the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite fall and rebound furiously in several waves, which has occurred this year as investors worry over issues including the potential impact of a trade war with China.The double-bottom base is a W-shaped pattern. The second leg of the W must undercut the first leg, shaking out weak holders. The middle of the W must be above the midpoint of the broader pattern. The buy point is 10 cents above the middle of the W. Sometimes a handle will form, creating a slightly lower or higher entry.The recent crop of double-bottom patterns, including Apple, Nvidia and Alibaba, are relatively shallow. That reflects the fact that the stock market, while having some sharp moves, hasn't had a deep correction.

15,LEG,"If you want to make money in stocks this year, it's not too late to first take a few steps back before you go forward. Take some serious time out to review your past trades.You could dramatically improve the results of your portfolio performance going forward.It's always fun to see how your good investments worked out. But looking back also lets you see how and why the bad trades emerged. A sober analysis will give you a leg up for the rest of 2018. If you learn how you made your mistakes, you can write a rule about them and vow to always follow it. This disciplined approach will help you avoid making the mistakes again.First, print out charts of your disappointing trades. Mark the day or week when you bought shares and when you sold.Print a chart of the Nasdaq or the S&P 500, and study the market trend in which you made the trades. Did you tend to buy when the market was falling or flat-lining? Were breakouts from proper buy points fizzling fast? If yes, then write down this rule: I will deploy cash only when IBD's Market Pulse outlook states ""confirmed uptrend.""Your chances of catching a rising stock are now instantly greater.Note the price and volume of the stocks you buy. Do you home in on cheap shares priced in the single digits? If so, you might want to write a rule in which you focus only on those that trade for at least 15 a share. Also, focus on those with an average dollar volume of $25 million to $50 million or more. Institutions — the main drivers of big stock winners — tend to favor higher priced stocks with ample volume.Such a rule would likely have steered you toward big-cap winners such as PayPal (PYPL), which on April 21, 2017, cleared a 43.90 entry in a long cup with handle in active turnover, 45% above its 50-day average. At that time, the digital payments firm traded 5.52 million shares on average over the prior 50 sessions. So the average dollar volume was a hefty $240 million per day.When the market is in the late stages of a bull run, it's sensible to take gains quickly. Instead of waiting for each stock winner to rise 20% or 25% from the proper buy point, start taking gains at 10% to 15%.Avoid round-trips in good stocks. Don't let a gain of more than 10% gain evaporate to zero or become a loss. If you get shaken out of a stock, you can always buy it back when it presents a new buy point.Study the volatility of the stocks you traded. Do they swing, say, 10% or more from weekly low to high on a regular basis? Such stocks tend to chase people out after rushing to new highs.Are you trading too much? Take a break from all new buys if the number of losing trades begins to exceed your winning ones.Also, study your equity curve. Do it by plotting your monthly account balance on a graph. Over time, is your equity rising steadily and holding up well during long periods? That's ideal. But if the graph looks like a string of hairpin curves, you're more prone to taking too many trades that ultimately erase your hard-earned profits.One of the most important keys to achieving steady gains and staying in sync with the market is to watch the market every day.It takes only two minutes at most to check IBD's Market Pulse and scan the Big Picture column so that you know when to be in the market.If you don't make such a daily habit, your results will likely suffer.""Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm — to forget to plant in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest?"" Stephen R. Covey wrote in ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."" ""The farm is a natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.""For serious IBD readers, post-trade analysis is part of the price that must be paid.(A version of this column was published in the Jan. 5, 2015, edition of IBD.

16,LEG,"Two top stocks with very different characteristics and companies are preparing to report results early Thursday. Abiomed (ABMD) reports its fiscal fourth quarter results. Floor & Decor (FND) turns in first-quarter numbers.One trait the two top stocks do share: both are listed on IBD's Stock Spotlight stock screen. Another important factor: analysts expect both to generate EPS growth greater than 60%, while sales growth is forecast to be above 30%.For Abiomed, its 60% EPS growth target would mark a sharp downshift after two quarters of triple-digit earnings gains. Its track record with topping estimates is uneven. In its fiscal first and second quarters, it beat analyst targets by 95% and 42%, respectively. In the third quarter, earnings were shy of expectations by 43%.The Danvers, Mass.-based company has a market capitalization of $13.6 billion, while generating revenue of $445 million in fiscal 2017. The consensus estimate is for a 31% revenue increase this year to $584 million, with earnings rising 85%.Abiomed produces small pumps that are inserted using a catheter through an artery in the leg and into the heart. Sold under the Impella name, they supplement and increase the pumping power of the heart. It markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In October, Abiomed announced its first Impella recipient in Japan. But the company reported that sales outside the U.S. accounted for less than 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn terms of stock action, shares Tuesday were up 63% since the start of the year. In addition, the stock was in a buy range above a 304.38 buy point in a flat base. The base is very late stage. That means the current breakout comes with a high risk of failure. The good news: The stock only needs to pullback about 11% in order to undercut the current base pattern and reset its base count.Among top stocks, Floor & Decor is considered a smaller midcap, with a market capitalization of $5.3 billion. It generated revenue of $1.39 billion in 2017. The company distributes wood and tile flooring through a network of 83 warehouse-type locations scattered over 21 states. Competitor Lumber Liquidator's (LL) stores are relatively small, and tucked into mini-mall-type locations. By contrast, Floor & Decor stores average around 73,000 square feet. Home Depot (HD) stores, for comparison's sake, average about 105,000 square feet.Analyst consensus places the Smyrna, Ga., company's first quarter EPS growth at 64%, with a 30% advance in revenue. The first quarter is seasonally a strong period for the company, and the consensus estimate is below last year's first-quarter gain of 75%.The revenue forecast is just below Floor & Decor's average sales gain of 30% over the past three quarters. The company has topped analyst expectations over the past four quarters by margins of anywhere from 5% to 30%. For the year, analysts see EPS rising 39% on a 25% sales gain.Floor & Decor is a young stock, public only since April 2017. Unlike Abiomed's tight-trading shares, the IPO swings wide and loose on a regular basis. It was up only 11% for the year Tuesday, but trading 163% above its year-ago IPO price.Shares are currently extended, 7% above a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup base. It's four weeks into a 14% deep consolidation.RELATED:Permian Basin Oil Stocks: These 2 Face High Expectations This WeekThe Market Trend: Keep Tabs On Market Indicators and StatusMajor Stock Indexes Reverse Lower, Techs Hit As Attention Shifts To FedTesla, Mastercard, Square, Fed Lead Investing Action Plan Nvidia, Apple: How To Avoid Getting Chopped Up In A Choppy Market Stocks Near Lows In Afternoon Trade; This Top Chip Stock Bucks Dow's Sell-Off

17,LEG,"New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo is threatening to sue the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for its ongoing raids to detain illegal immigrants wanted for serious crimes like assault and rape.A staggering 80% of those apprehended in recent ICE raids in New York were either convicted criminals or charged with crimes. But Cuomo's siding with criminals over crime victims.He's playing politics. Faced with a challenge on his left flank from ""Sex and the City"" star and gubernatorial hopeful Cynthia Nixon, he's desperate to prove his liberal bona fides. Public safety be damned.The ambitious New York Governor is parroting Democrats across the nation who claim ICE should be abolished because it's breaking apart families and peaceful communities. The facts prove otherwise. Eighty-eight percent of the illegal immigrants arrested in recent Los Angeles ICE raids and 81% arrested throughout California, according to the latest ICE data, had criminal convictions.These are bad guys.So when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., claims that ""unjust and cruel"" ICE raids ""terrorize innocent immigrant families,"" don't buy it.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCuomo's making the same bogus claim. Last Thursday, Cuomo denounced an ICE raid on an upstate farm looking for Marcial DeLeon-Aguilar, a three-time prior deportee convicted of felony aggravated assault. The governor complained that Aguilar's children had to watch their father being pinned by officers to block his escape.Nice try, governor. What about families victimized by violent illegal immigrants?Since January 2016, at least 25 Long Island youths have been executed by the MS-13 gang of Central American illegal immigrants. Some of the victims are left so mutilated they can hardly be identified. MS-13 beats the youngsters with baseball bats, puts plastic bags over their heads to suffocate them, and then slices off their noses, ears and lips with machetes. No one read these victims their constitutional rights.ICE's Operation Matador targets MS-13 gang members. Yet Cuomo seems angrier at the ICE agents than at the MS-13 butchers.Laughably, Cuomo issued a ""cease and desist"" letter to ICE last week, ordering federal agents to touch base with local police before taking enforcement action. Cuomo doesn't have a constitutional leg to stand on. Check the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Uncle Sam doesn't need Andrew Cuomo's permission to enforce federal laws.Why the surge in visible, violent sweeps? ICE is forced to conduct sweeps out in the community because New York's sanctuary laws are preventing the agency from taking custody of criminal aliens before they're released from jail, like the agency used to do. As ICE's Deputy Director Thomas Homan points out, these sanctuary policies are needlessly exposing New Yorkers to violence.Cuomo's mimicking California Democrats, who are in open rebellion against federal law enforcement. In February, Oakland California Mayor Libby Schaaf issued a public alert about a planned ICE raid in her city before it took place, tipping off hundreds of wanted criminals to scatter. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said to Shaaf, ""How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda?""Political pandering is driving this agenda. An amazing 27% of California's population are immigrants. Immigrants disproportionately favor big government. California hasn't elected a statewide Republican since 2006. New York is moving in the same direction, with 23% of its population foreign-born and Democrats gaining increasing control of state government.Cuomo and other Democrats resist the federal crackdown on immigrant-related crime, and call for increased spending on after-school music and sports programs to provide an ""alternative"" to gang activity in immigrant communities. That's nonsense. Brutes willing to torture and mutilate a human being with a machete will not be dissuaded by learning to play the flute.President Trump calls them ""animals"" who have turned peaceful neighborhoods ""into bloodstained killing fields."" He's got the right plan: ""We will find you. We will arrest you. We will jail you.

18,LEG,"Will the current creep up in interest rates slow demand in the vacation-resort time share market? One executive answers an emphatic, ""No.""Mike Flaskey, CEO of Diamond Resorts, says his firm is ""very bullish"" and aims to keep expanding in hot leisure destinations such as Hawaii. One piece of proof: the company's recent $225 million purchase of The Modern Honolulu in Oahu.Diamond will upgrade it to meet customers' demands for luxury-style suite accommodations that feature full-size kitchens and one- or two-bedroom formats.""It's a four-star property. We're going to go through it floor by floor,"" Flaskey told IBD during an interview Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, Calif.Flaskey said that Diamond Resorts generates roughly $100 million in annual sales centered on its collection of membership-based hotels across the entire Hawaiian isles. While Las Vegas is Diamond's top sales market, Flaskey believes Hawaii will in time take the top spot.One leg of Diamond's business is financing the purchase of customers' points-based time share ownership. Flaskey says the typical customer makes a 15% down payment on an average transaction of $24,000. Then he or she borrows to pay off the rest via a loan from Diamond.""Middle America is our customer. The usual household income is between $110,000 and $140,000,"" Flaskey said. ""They are very comfortable with making a regular payment"" to fund the buy. Plus, 30% of Diamond's customers pay off the outstanding loan before maturity.Flaskey's bullish sentiment dovetails with the rising fortunes in recent years among publicly traded hotel companies.The lodging industry veteran foresees the total public market value of timeshare-oriented companies rising to nearly $37 billion within a couple of years. That's up nearly fourfold since the fall of 2013, when Diamond Resorts and competitor Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC) totaled less than $10 billion in market cap.Marriott Vacations fell more than 8% in big volume Monday. Plus, shares undercut the 200-day moving average on news it's buying Miami-based ILG (ILG). The operator of the Interval International ""exchange network"" allows timeshare owners the opportunity to access other properties.IBD's Leisure-Lodging group has faded within rankings of 197 industries for six-month price performance. Through Monday, the 15-member group ranked 79th, down from 64th six weeks ago. But seven companies, nearly half of the total, carry a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher. They include Hyatt (H), Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott (MAR). All three stocks are forming new bases after decent run-ups since the fourth quarter of last year.In the same group, China Lodging (HTHT) shows the best ratings from IBD Stock Checkup, including a best possible 99 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The diversified hotel chain broke the $1 billion sales barrier in 2017, growing the top line by 25% to $1.22 billion. China Lodging earned a record $2.66 a share, up 46%.The best stocks in the market tend to break out of well-formed bases, such as the cup with handle, while having strong RS ratings. In the same lodging group, Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) shows a 79 RS score and an 85 Composite on IBD Stock Checkup. The stock has risen as much as 75% since its debut in January 2017.Diamond Resorts had traded on the NYSE from its July 2013 debut until September 2016, when private equity giant Apollo Global Management completed its $2.2 billion acquisition.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond hit 3% last week for the first time since January 2014. The yield has more than doubled from a July 2016 low near 1.37%.The Federal Reserve is not expected to hike the cost of money at the end of two-day meeting Wednesday. Futures traders, though, are seeing a nearly 50-50 chance that the fed funds rate will reach a 2.25%-2.5% target level by December.

19,LEG,"Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk has said his company was building advantages in the ability to make electric cars cheaply and efficiently. Those claims keep looking more questionable.The latest knock against Tesla's production credentials comes from Munro & Associates, a small Detroit-area firm that disassembles new cars and analyzes them down to the nuts and bolts. Founder Sandy Munro has picked apart a Tesla Model 3 sedan. He praises its battery pack and electronics but pans much of the rest of the vehicle as costly, heavy and poorly built.For Tesla, developing the ability to mass-manufacture cars is key to its viability. Musk, who predicted programmable robots would give his electric-car maker a leg up over the rest of the auto industry, has instead confronted repeated delays and steep losses.If Munro is right, Musk may have a more lasting problem on his hands: His first car for the masses could be weightier and more expensive to build than competing models that are on the way.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

""If it would have come out even decent, they'd have mopped the floor with everybody. But they didn't.""A Tesla spokesperson didn't immediately comment.The Model 3 has great battery pack design and industry-leading electronics, according to Munro, who will elaborate on his findings to the Automotive Press Association on Wednesday. Its packs are better in terms of power and efficiency than those built by Samsung SDI or LG Chem, he said. Those two companies supply batteries for BMW AG's i3 and General Motors' (GM) Chevrolet Bolt electric cars.The circuit boards in Tesla's newest sedan also are on par in terms of complexity with those used in cell phones, high-end computers or military fighter jets, Munro said. Other carmakers should take notice.""This is not some Mickey Mouse outfit that you can just dismiss,"" he said. ""Ignore Tesla's electronics, and you're in peril.""The challenge for Tesla will be figuring out how to efficiently build the car at its assembly plant that Musk himself has said employed too much automation. In an interview earlier this month with CBS This Morning, Musk said that excessive use of robots has been one of the factors holding the company back from making more Model 3s.Musk may have to follow his hunch and hire more humans. Munro said this wouldn't be unprecedented. GM once called him in to inspect the robots the company was trying to use many years ago, before its 2009 bankruptcy.The cars weren't designed to be built with heavy use of robots, and GM ended up taking them out of the plant, he said.Munro also had some harsh words about the Model 3's design, which he said appeared to be done by someone who lacked experience in body engineering. The car has eight or 10 panels welded together that all create weight without adding strength. For a vehicle of its size, the Model 3 is the heaviest and most expensive to build, he said.The car Munro & Associates purchased and analyzed had inconsistent gaps between body panels, which Munro said may be an indication that people on the assembly line weren't properly trained.The silver lining for Tesla is that the company's biggest weakness might be fixable: there are plenty of experts available to get Tesla's factory humming.""They have a hard time with what I would classify as the dinosaur technologies, the mechanical stuff,"" Munro said. ""There are hundreds of us in the field that could help them fix that. I hope they pick one.""

22,LEG,"AB Large Cap Growth (APGAX) is in an elite group of top mutual funds. It is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. That takes extraordinary consistency. For $6.3 billion Large Cap Growth and other U.S. stock mutual funds, the bogey they've beaten is the S&P 500. Across all categories, only 22% of eligible funds managed the four-time feat.More impressively, AB Large Cap Growth outperformed in all four time periods in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. How hard is it to gain entry to the winners' circle? Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.To become a top mutual fund like this, lead manager Frank Caruso, co-manager John Fogarty and senior research analyst Vinay Thapar have assembled a diversified portfolio that includes leading stocks in auto parts, health care, financials and technology such as Copart (CPRT), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Zoetis (ZTS), S&P Global (SPGI) and Nvidia (NVDA).Holding periods vary, but the stocks in the past 12 months have risen from 48% for Edwards to 49% for S&P Global, 55% for Zoetis, 63% for Copart and 116% for Nvidia.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Caruso and his team have been trimming one of those leading stocks because of a growing competitive threat. Below, Caruso describes which of those stocks he has reservations about and why.Meanwhile, overall finding stocks that persistently outperform the market depends, Caruso says, on finding ""idiosyncratic opportunities to invest.""Sixty-one-year-old Caruso and his colleagues — Fogarty, 48, and Thapar, 39 — discussed that and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from their offices in Manhattan.IBD: This portfolio is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. What does it take to outperform so consistently over periods as short as 12 months to 10 years?Frank Caruso: We focus on looking at businesses, not stocks. We are attracted to businesses with differentiated competitive positions, companies that produce higher than average levels of profitability, profitability that exceeds the fair cost of capital.Here's our secret sauce: we start by looking for good businesses, then we obsess over each company's idiosyncratic opportunities to invest and to earn high returns on capital.IBD: What exactly do you mean by 'idiosyncratic opportunities to invest'?Caruso: It is an investment opportunity that is company specific. It occurs when a company takes action that can put upward pressure on profitability. Take Nike (NKE). They've been chasing low-cost labor since the 1960s. We noticed patent filings that looked like new manufacturing technology. If they could build shoes with robotized machines, they could build plants closer to consumers, saving on tariffs, duties and shipping.IBD: The fund is fairly concentrated, with just 47 stocks as of Jan. 31. Why do you prefer a concentrated approach?Caruso: First, we think we're good at researching companies. And we want to get paid for research.Second, having around 50 names allows us to get exposure to some larger-cap companies and also seed the portfolio with sometimes younger and more exciting companies.Forty-seven is near the small end of our portfolio size range. We may have been in the low to mid sixties when we first took over this portfolio in 2012. We were still shaping the portfolio to our vision.IBD: Auto auctioneer Copart is one of your smaller names with a market cap under $12 billion. It has posted three straight quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration. What's the driver?Caruso: They're probably not the type of business in a lot of growth portfolios. They have high profitability, and they are high versus their cost of capital. Yet it's surprisingly stable. One secular trend that gives us confidence in the sustainability of their performance is that as autos become more complex, it leads to more attractive salvage rates. With more and more cars, it's too expensive to repair ones that get damaged. So Copart's supply of inventory gets bigger.IBD: You began your current stake in August. Why then?Caruso: Over a multiyear period, Copart's infrastructure did not perform efficiently to exploit new inventory when it arose due to (hurricanes). So the company invested money to upgrade its capabilities. In the August hurricane season, investors questioned whether Copart had done enough, lowering Copart's share price. We bought on that uncertainty.IBD: For the most part, you've been building your stake in Edwards Lifesciences. Why?Vinay Thapar: They pioneered development of transcatheter aortic valves. Before that, patients had to do through open-heart surgery and go on a bypass machine to have their valves repaired. Edwards got around that by engineering a product that could be inserted by snaking a catheter through an artery in the leg.It is far more minimally invasive and results in faster discharge from the hospital. The average patient cost is 10% to 15% less than the open-heart procedure. Yet the product has higher than average gross margins and operating margins. We expected an uplift in return on the company's invested capital (ROIC), and that has occurred. There's about an 18% ROIC, which is close to the upper echelon in other companies.The company forecasts the market to be about $5 billion-plus by 2021, and it's only $2.5 billion to $3 billion now. Beyond that, they're looking at using the same procedure for a different valve, the mitral valve, which would be a new market.IBD: Zoetis is another name in which you've been building your stake. What's fueling your interest?Thapar: They're the leader in pharmaceuticals for animal health. Our thesis is that after their spinout from Pfizer, they had an opportunity to improve their operating performance. They right-sized their number of SKUs (items for sale), they closed manufacturing facilities. Those improved their gross margin. And they committed to investing in higher returning R&D projects.Their single-digit top-line growth above the market growth rate, along with cost improvements, had led to higher returns. Going forward, their pipeline of products is yet to be reflected in their stock price. And they've committed to reduce their inventory balance, which will improve their return on invested capital.IBD: S&P Global is another holding whose EPS growth has accelerated. Why has that happened?Caruso: We're modeling annual revenue growth in the 6% area for the next four or five years, along with low single digit earnings growth.Their index business has been a big part of their success. And their ratings business is a best-in-class franchise. In a low-rate environment with a good level of volatility, the expectation is that if there's an increase around the world, their ratings business should benefit and maybe some parts of their index business.IBD: You've been in Nvidia a long time. Does this story have much runway left in front of it?Caruso: It's been in this portfolio since 2014. Their graphical chips have found new applications. Think AI (artificial intelligence), think hyperscale data centers, think VR (virtual reality), think auto vision.But Nvidia's GPUs are general purpose chips. And we think there are application-specific chips from early-stage companies that will become competitive for market share in the next 15 to 18 months. So we've been trimming our position.IBD: Booking Holdings (BKNG) is Priceline's new name. Why do you like that particular online travel agency?John Fogarty: They changed their name to reflect their primary assets in the online travel portfolio. Their appeal is their dominant position in Europe, where the hotel market is far more fragmented than in the U.S., where the industry is dominated by chains. Booking can take advantage of Europe's fragmentation, so they enjoy a higher commission rate as a result.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you introduce it?Fogarty: We began to buy it in the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth of PayPal is essentially riding the increased adoption of online payments and, in particular, mobile payments. We're attracted to their rising return on assets trajectory — not just their growth, but their increased profitability.IBD: Anyone want to add any comments?Caruso: John summarized our thoughts about PayPal. It's taking market share, we expect it to grow in the high teens over the next three years and it complements our Visa (V) exposure.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing trading environment.

24,LEG,"A Boeing (BA) 787 Dreamliner with engines made by General Electric (GE) made a 9,000-mile, nonstop flight from Perth to London over the weekend, marking the first direct air link between the two continents.Qantas Airways, which operates the aircraft, described it as the third longest commercial passenger flight in operation as well as the world's longest Dreamliner flight.Passengers on board Qantas' Boeing 787-9 aircraft made the transcontinental journey in roughly 17 hours and 20 minutes, or about three hours quicker than routes which involve stopping in the Middle East to change planes or refuel.The aviation feat also comes with some bragging rights for Boeing and GE, though Boeing's European rival Airbus (EADSY) is seeking similar long-haul flights.Airbus is working with Qantas ""on its challenge for direct flights"" on long-haul routes between Sydney-London Heathrow and Sydney-New York City, while Singapore Airlines will receive the first Airbus ULR later this year and deploy it on a Singapore-New York City route that is a longer flight than the Perth-London route in the news, Airbus told IBD.The A350-900 ULR is already capable of the London-Perth route, but no Australasian carriers have ordered the aircraft, so Airbus does not expect direct flights between Australia and the U.K. any time soon, the planemaker said.Meanwhile, GE told IBD that ""the GEnx-1B engine that powered this flight is not on any Airbus applications.""Boeing stock climbed 2.5% to finish at 328.97 on the stock market today, GE fell 1.4%, while Airbus' U.S.-listed stock rallied 2.6%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

25,LEG,"Buffalo Discovery Fund (BUFTX) turns to market disrupters like Align Technology (ALGN) and long-term secular trends in shaping its investment strategy, which has landed the fund among the top mutual funds in the third annual IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards.The $1.9 billion fund has been led by Clay Brethour, Dave Carlsen and Elizabeth Jones since 2004. ""We seek the early identification of attractively priced, financially strong, well-managed companies,"" Carlsen said. ""We take a patient approach to stock selection, looking for stock opportunities where long-term growth is underappreciated or where there's been an overreaction in the near term.""The approach has paid off for the top-performing mutual fund. It has beaten the S&P 500 in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. In doing so it won IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards in both the Growth Fund and Midcap Fund categories.Over the last 10- and 15-year periods the fund has turned in average annual returns of 13.6% and 14.7%. These gains have handily surpassed those of midcap growth funds tracked by Morningstar, which have posted 9.6% and 11.4% returns for the same periods. Where does that put it among top mutual funds? Buffalo Discovery's 10- and 15-year annual average returns ranked among the top 3% and 2% of Morningstar midcap growth funds.In 2017, Buffalo Discovery returned 25.4%. It earned a top-three ranking in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Awards list for midcap funds.Innovation is essential for inclusion in the Buffalo Discovery portfolio. ""We've found that our focus on innovation is one of the best ways to hitch our wagon to share gainers and market disrupters,"" Carlsen said. ""We believe these companies will be the most likely to reap the rewards of the big secular growth trends.""Carlsen's team uses secular trends to home in on worthy portfolio candidates. ""The secular trends provide a growth tailwind and narrow our stock picking universe to a durable growth universe that we believe should grow faster and have less cyclicality than the overall market,"" he said. ""Our growth universe establishes our hunting grounds, not the constituents of a benchmark index. This purposely distances us from relative benchmark portfolio management styles leading to high active share.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Buffalo Discovery team looks for companies that can gain market share in almost any market environment. ""We let our innovators run,"" Carlsen said. ""We have a preference for small- and midcap stocks with long runways for growth where the benefits of innovation are sustainable and early relative to the potential opportunity, resulting in high rates of growth for many years.""Buffalo Discovery owned 86 stock holdings and maintained an annual turnover ratio of 53% as of Dec. 31. Technology, industrials and health care were its three largest sector weightings.Top holding Align Technology has been a mainstay in the portfolio for much of Carlsen's tenure. The stock has surged more than 4,000% since the maker of Invisalign was added to the portfolio in 2005, and has climbed into large-cap territory. The Buffalo Discovery team still sees plenty of room to run. ""We believe robust growth is sustainable over the intermediate to long term,"" Carlsen said. ""Less than 15% of the orthodontic market has converted from metal braces to clear aligners. The company has also been focused on driving down the cost of its product resulting in tremendous growth internationally.""In Q4, Invisalign case shipments spiked 34% on a year-over-year basis.Carlsen sees the fund's stake in Nevro (NVRO) benefiting from an aging population and a government push away from opioids for pain management. ""The company makes high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices that treat chronic back and leg pain more effectively and with better clinical outcomes than competing SCS devices from traditional players,"" he said. ""It has rapidly gained nearly 15% market share and remains well positioned for further share gains and rapid growth. Continued product innovation like smaller footprint devices should expand the market and recent full-body MRI approval in Europe bodes well for future U.S. approval.""Xylem (XYL), the No. 2 holding of the fund, enables municipal and industrial customers to manage water systems more efficiently. ""They've incorporated sensors and analytics to proactively provide alerts when a problem requires attention, before it breaks and causes costly downtime,"" Carlsen said. ""They have also incorporated intelligence on pumps to use less energy and boost efficiency. The company should have earnings growth in the midteens over the next several years.""Shares of Xylem are up 50% from a year ago.In the tech space, the Buffalo Discovery team is bullish on the video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA). ""Video game companies have enjoyed a strong year as investors realize the positive business model effects of downloadable games and in-game content,"" Carlsen said. ""Emerging online player networks should help further expand the user base as players connect from around the world.""Electronic Arts has seen its stock price rise 43% over the past year.Buffalo Discovery bought shares of Praxair (PX) in 2015. The industrial gas supplier was a top 10 holding at year-end. ""It is a premier operator and serves a consumable (product) to a diverse set of industrial customers,"" Carlsen said. ""This tends to insulate it from negative flash points in the economy. Its strategy is to grow profitably regardless of the macroeconomic environment. The name brings some nice stability to our portfolio.""Shares of Praxair are up 31% versus a year ago.With an eye on its current holdings, the Buffalo Discovery team remains on the lookout for opportunities to add innovators to the portfolio.""We believe the market frequently overreacts to near-term events, which will create opportunities to buy premier stocks at attractive prices,"" Carlsen said.""The market volatility experienced this past February is the most recent example. Only through active management can an investor benefit from these temporary market dislocations. Anyone can ride an index fund or ETF up during the bull market, but you need the skill of an active manager to protect your capital when the tide turns.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Read The Full IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards 2018 Special ReportHere's The List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryBest Mutual Funds: News, Performance Reports And Investing IdeasHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying — And Selling?

27,LEG,"At The City College of New York in the late 1930s, my father, an Orthodox Jew, wrote his senior class thesis on anti-Semitism in America. He delineated common realities of the era, such as Jews' admission to law firms, country clubs and colleges being denied or restricted, and various other manifestations of popular and institutional anti-Semitism.XYet he taught his two sons — my older brother and me — to believe that we, as Americans, were the luckiest Jews in Jewish history.With the obvious exception of Jews living in Israel, he was right. I can state this with some authority, having written a book on anti-Semitism and taught Jewish history at Brooklyn College.Despite the existence of anti-Semites and anti-Semitism in America, American Jews are indeed among the luckiest Jews in Jewish history. Even with the re-establishment of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, many more Israeli Jews have moved to America than American Jews have moved to Israel. This is not a reflection on Israel, which is a country with a high quality of life that is an unparalleled blessing in Jewish life; rather, it is a reflection on America and how good it is for Jews.Likewise, despite the existence of racists and racism in America, black Americans are among the luckiest blacks in the world. A distinguished black journalist, Keith Richburg of the Washington Post, fully acknowledged the horror and cruelties of slavery. Nevertheless, he thanked God his ancestors made it possible for him to be born and live in America, not Africa. After covering Africa for the Washington Post, Richburg put it this way in his newspaper:""Let me drop the charade and put it as simply as I can: There but for the grace of God go I.""Somewhere, sometime, maybe 400 years ago, an ancestor of mine whose name I'll never know was shackled in leg irons, kept in a dark pit ... and then put with thousands of other Africans into the crowded, filthy cargo hold of a ship for the long and treacherous journey across the Atlantic. Many of them died along the way, of disease, of hunger. But my ancestor survived ... He was ripped away from his country and his family, forced into slavery somewhere in the Caribbean. Then one of his descendants somehow made it up to South Carolina, and one of those descendants, my father, made it to Detroit during the Second World War, and there I was born, 36 years ago.""And if that original ancestor hadn't been forced to make that horrific voyage, I would not have been standing there that day on the Rusumo Falls bridge, a journalist — a mere spectator — watching the bodies glide past me like river logs. ... And so I thank God my ancestor made that voyage. ... I empathize with Africa's pain. I recoil in horror at the mindless waste of human life, and human potential. I salute the gallantry and dignity and sheer perseverance of the Africans. But most of all, I feel secretly glad that my ancestor made it out — because, now, I am not one of them."" (italics added)Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThat is why millions of Africans prefer to live in America than anywhere else. That is why more than 2 million Africans immigrated to the United States in the recent past (compared with the 388,000 who came as slaves). Unlike the many Americans — black and white — who believe the leftist libel about America oppressing blacks and all other nonwhites, the millions of Africans who want to come to America know how lucky they would be to be a black in America, as do the millions who already live here. They know they are, or would be, among the luckiest blacks in the world.And what about Latin Americans? Like American Jews and American blacks, they are among the luckiest Latinos in the world. How could they or anyone else deny this given the fact that tens of millions of Latin Americans left their families, friends, culture, language and very homes to live in America? And given the fact that tens of millions more ache to do the same? What kind of lie must a person embrace to flee to a peaceful, prosperous country whose people treat him generously and beautifully and not think he is lucky to live there?And, finally, there are the many white Americans — people born and raised in America, many of whose ancestors also fled war, poverty and oppression in Europe — who not only deny how lucky they are to live America but also vilify the founders of America who made their blessed life possible. Their attitude transcends mere lying; it enters the realm of pathology.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:California's Bullet Train To Fiscal OblivionTax Revenues Hit Record Highs — Are Trump's Tax Cuts Paying For Themselves?It's Time For Mueller To Come Clean: Is There Any Evidence Of Trump-Russia Collusion Or Not?

29,LEG,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average turned mixed Tuesday morning ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill.S&P 500 index futures were just below vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.1% vs. fair value. Dow Jones futures were a fraction above fair value. All had been modestly positive earlier.Powell will testify before the House Financial Service Committee at 10 a.m. ET, though his prepared written testimony will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It's Powell's first big appearance as Fed chairman, so he's unlikely to try to rock the boat. But given markets recent sensitivity to Treasury yields and the always-watchful eye toward Fed policy, investors will be paying close attention.During Monday's session, the S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite all rose more than 1%. Micron Technology (MU) and Applied Materials (AMAT) both broke out from double-bottom bases, at least intraday, though trading volume wasn't impressive. Meanwhile, fellow chip plays Lam Research (LRCX), Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) also are setting up in this bullish ""W""-shaped pattern.Micron Technology and Applied Materials both boast Composite Ratings of 97 out of a possible 99. The Composite Rating combines several IBD proprietary ratings into a single score. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their big runs.Lam Research has a strong 96 Composite Rating and Monolithic Power a 94. Marvell Technology has an OK 79 CR,  in large part due to previously spotty earnings, but recent earnings and profit estimates show an improving trend.All three chip groups — Electronic-Semiconductor Equipment, Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing and Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless — were among the top 15 out of IBD's 197 industries on Monday.The double-bottom pattern tends to form in volatile markets, which we've seen over the past several weeks. You have one down leg, then the stock tries to rally but hits resistance and ends up pulling back to form a second down leg. The peak of the initial rally must be above the midpoint of the consolidation. The second down leg must undercut the first low of the consolidation, shaking out weak holders. The buy point is 10 cents above the peak in the middle of the W. Sometimes a double-bottom base will form a handle that could create a lower or alternative entry.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersMicron stock rose 3.1% to 47.98, moving above its 47.08 buy point from a shallow double-bottom pattern. Volume was 2% below normal. You want to see volume rise at least 40%-50% above normal on a breakout as a sign that big institutions are adding to holdings.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is well off its levels from the left side of the consolidation, but it has moved above where it was at the middle of the ""W,"" thus providing some breakout confirmation. The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.Look to see if the stock can power higher in strong volume, boost the RS line and indicating that mutual funds are buying in bulk.Applied Materials climbed as high as 58.99 intraday Monday, briefly clearing a 58.83 buy point. Shares closed up 3.2% at 58.81, two cents below that entry. Volume was just 4% above average. Look for the stock to close above the buy point in rapid trade.Applied Materials, a leading chip-equipment maker, has surged since undercutting its 200-day line on Feb. 9. The RS line is not at a high, but is at its best levels in near three months.Lam Research, another big chip-gear firm, rallied 2.8% to 198.43, continuing to rebound from its 50-day line. The stock is still a ways off from a 218.58 buy point.Marvell Technology rose 0.9% to 23.46. The stock is in a shallow double-bottom base with a 24.31 buy point.

31,LEG,"Several weeks ago, the City of New York sued five big oil companies, including ExxonMobil, BP and Shell, for damages related to Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  According to Mayor Bill de Blasio, greenhouse gas emissions from the production and consumption of fossil fuels precipitated a change in global climate that caused the storm to hit the city.XEight California cities and counties, including Richmond, which is home to a large Chevron refinery, have also filed lawsuits against a range of oil, gas, and coal companies seeking billions of dollars to help pay for past and future damages linked to climate change. Not to be outdone, on January 25 the city of Boulder, Colorado joined the fray by taking legal action to force fossil fuel companies to cover the costs of damages caused by severe past and future weather events.Coupled with legal actions against energy companies, the divestment crusade continues apace.  New York City is liquidating $5 billion of pension funds currently invested in oil and gas companies.  San Francisco, Berkeley, Madison, Wisc., and a number of other cities have also pledged to reduce their pension funds' holdings of fossil fuel companies.Several years ago, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced it would sell all of its fossil fuel company stocks (Is John D. turning in his grave?)  Banks, insurance companies, foundations, faith-based institutions, and universities are also being pressured to get rid of their oil, gas, and coal company investments.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportThe third leg of the ""keep it in the ground"" movement is opposition to energy infrastructure projects like pipelines, gas liquefaction projects, and export facilities.  Though the fights against the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines have gained the most media attention, battles are being waged over dozens of other proposed infrastructure projects, especially in the Northeast and on the West Coast.  Governor Andrew Cuomo's veto of the Constitution Pipeline that could bring cheap natural gas to New York consumers is a prime local example.Regrettably, the anti-fossil fuel movement suffers from both financial and political naiveté.  The costs to local governments of pursuing legal actions of dubious merit against oil and gas companies will mean higher taxes or less revenue available for schools and other municipal services.  Fossil fuel asset prices are unlikely to be affected by divestment, while numerous studies have shown that the pursuit of divestment strategies reduces returns to beneficiaries by decreasing portfolio diversification.What's more, by potentially removing a large and profitable sector of the U.S. and global economies from their portfolios, financial managers may be disregarding their implicit fiduciary responsibilities.Opponents of fossil fuels also fail to acknowledge how the oil and gas industry contributes to America's economic prosperity.  The American Petroleum Institute calculates that more than 11 million jobs nationwide are supported by oil and gas production.At the same time, all U.S. households and businesses benefit from relatively inexpensive and reliable energy supplies that help keep down the costs of heating and cooling, while powering a growing fleet of electronics and appliances in the typical home.  Cheap energy also holds down manufacturing costs while enhancing the competitiveness of American goods in the global marketplace.Finally, the ""keep it in the ground"" movement could use a dose of economic reality. Like it or not, according to the most recent forecast by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), despite the growing use of renewables oil and gas will still account for the lion's share of global energy supply in the year 2040.  This offers tremendous opportunities to further enhance America's energy dominance, with all the attendant economic and security benefits, by expanding oil and gas exports even as domestic consumption moderates.But the key to realizing this potential lies with building out the requisite infrastructure of pipelines, liquefied natural gas facilities, and export terminals — a task that has become more difficult and expensive as a result of the growing pushback by anti-carbon activists who are now focused on ""shaming"" financial institutions, foundations, pension funds, and endowments who hold assets or extend credit to fossil fuel companies. You Might Also Like...By Leaving Paris Climate-Change Deal, Trump Will Do U.S. Economy A 'Yuuuge' FavorOther People's Money: The Immorality Of The Fossil-Fuel Divestment CampaignThe Futility Of Divesting From Petroleum PipelinesIs U.S. Fracking Killing OPEC?Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

33,LEG,"Commission costs, trade reliability and site performance rank highly for online investors. That's why they get such a strong weighting year after year in IBD's Best Online Brokers survey. But active traders expect more from their brokers than a place to hold shares and execute trades. They want the best trading platform with cutting-edge features. Many of the tools active traders cherish weren't around even to institutional investors a decade ago.X Active traders carry weight with online brokers. They are prime providers of daily average revenue trades (DARTs), a key metric for brokers' earnings. Tools ranging from idea creation to trade execution speed the buy and sell process for active traders. That can lead to more trading and make the money spent on advanced platforms pay off for brokers. Here are a few of their offerings:Many investors shy away from complex charts. But technical analysis done on charts is key for active traders. Advanced platforms tend to give traders more ways to customize charts. That ranges from time period and chart type to how you lay out charts on multiple screens. That's just the start. The library of indicators is ever expanding, from the basics to proprietary metrics. Traders don't need all the indicators all the time, but want their favorites fast.TradeStation earned the top rating from customers for stock trading tools in IBD's latest investor survey (see best brokers survey methodology), and its robust database is a large reason why. Hundreds of indicators and studies can be applied to over 40 years of data. TradeStation's  EasyLanguage lets investors do their own coding. With a little programming, traders can back-test strategies to see how they would perform at different points in history.Fidelity also scored high in its Equity Trading Tools. Most of its tools were developed in-house. For technical analysis, Fidelity tapped third-party Recognia, which made a name for itself with chart pattern recognition features. It includes spotting classic patterns, short-term patterns and patterns on indicators.Many brokers also offer screening tools and alerts. They help find buy and sell points based on selected indicators or patterns.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) scored the highest for its options trading platform tools in the survey. TD Ameritrade's thinkorswim platform, acquired in 2009, is the backbone of the firm's options prowess.Options bring new concepts and terms to digest and often scare beginners. But brokers have harnessed technology to shorten the learning curve. Swim Lessons on thinkorswim is a good place for investors to dip their toe in the options waters. It offers daily analysis of options strategies, often using setups in the current market. Lessons also walk you through tools like profit/loss graphs and probability analysis. They show how profits may change through time as the stock price changes.Beginning lessons also show how with a single click on an option chain, over 15 preset option strategies are available. Can't remember the details of a multi-leg strategy? A prefilled order ticket gives you a start and then you can adjust expiration dates and strike prices.At some point, most active traders feel the frustration of putting in a trade and watching it sit there while algorithms jump ahead by a penny or less.  If you want to make the machines work for you rather than against you, Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is among brokers offering algorithm trading that can help get your order through. For instance a time weighted average price (TWAP) algorithm can disperse your order over a set amount of time.Sometimes just getting your order in quickly is more important. Fidelity's advanced platform, Active Trader Pro, allows for staging of up to 50 orders. Do your homework ahead of time and set up the trades. Then you can execute orders one at a time as targets are hit. Or, if you are waiting for an event, you could place staged orders all at once.That's not to mention all the conditional orders that brokerages offer. If you can't be at your computer or phone at all times, conditional orders and alerts can help. First, set up predetermined conditions like profit targets or loss-cutting levels. Then your trades execute without any further action on your part. Not quite comfortable letting the machines run amok? Alerts with similar conditions let you know something needs your attention. After you check out the trade, you can make the final decision.Sometimes you need to go beyond the individual trades to improve on your entire portfolio. Advanced trading tools can help with this as well. If you're getting a false sense of security from your diversification, portfolio analysis tools can dispel your myth. Correlation analysis, like that offered by Interactive Brokers, tells you if your assets aren't as spread out as you thought.Maybe you need to perform a post-analysis on your trades to see where you can improve. Charles Schwab (SCHW) boasts a unique Gain/Loss Analyzer to help you visualize and evaluate key metrics on your Schwab account trades from start to finish. Homing on what you're doing right and identifying where you are going astray can be critical to improving your own trading decisions.A little overwhelmed by the choices? Most brokerages offer plenty of educational opportunities to delve deeper into their advanced platforms. It's in their best interest after all. The more you understand the product, the more likely you are to trade more. Education includes webinars, chat rooms and even one-on-one coaching. Take advantage of the information offered to speed up your progress on the learning curve.Want to read more about the other top brokers, the latest commission trends and more?

34,LEG,"Employers are struggling to find their ideal workers. Nearly 45% of business executives think Americans lack soft skills like creativity, teamwork, and communication.XEven young people with four-year degrees are unprepared for the working world. Over half of hiring managers say new college graduates lack ""critical thinking and problem solving"" skills and don't pay ""attention to detail,"" according to a recent survey by salary-transparency website PayScale.This skills gap won't magically resolve itself. If businesses want higher quality workers, they'll need to start grooming recruits by offering internships to a largely untapped talent pool — high schoolers.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveMany employers already offer internships to college students. But companies can gain a leg up on their competition by starting these programs even earlier.Companies that currently offer high school internships have created reliable talent pipelines. In a recent survey of such companies, 45% of respondents said they were ""very likely"" or ""completely likely"" to offer their high school interns full-time jobs down the line.It's easy to see why. Despite their youth and perceived inexperience, high schoolers make firms more innovative. Nearly a quarter of business leaders say high school interns help them think of fresh ideas.""(Students) don't have any preconceived notions of what you can and can't do, and that's invaluable for a company like Verizon,"" explains David Bilodeau, a senior member of Verizon's technical staff. Verizon gets its investment in students back ""tenfold,"" Bilodeau asserts.I've seen firsthand how these young workers benefit businesses. My organization helps high school students find and prepare for internships at top brands like Verizon, Capital One, and Marriott.Our students aren't just scanning and storing documents. They're programming robots, planning events, and presenting cost-reduction strategies.By the end of their programs, interns confidently cold call potential clients and run social media accounts. These internships create immense value for companies — and help high schoolers hone their soft skills.Hiring high school interns also helps firms solve another major staffing challenge — namely, a lack of diversity. Black and Hispanic workers make up 29% of the American workforce.But they're underrepresented in high-paying fields, holding only 11% of science and engineering jobs  and just over 22% of positions in the financial sector.Firms that only hire college interns will struggle to achieve a more diverse workplace. That's because many children of color face structural barriers that prevent them from attending and graduating college.""More than 60% of the racial gap in college completion rates can be attributed to factors that occur before college,"" according to New York University.In other words, employers who only recruit college interns likely end up drawing from a homogenous applicant pool.Boosting diversity makes companies more profitable. According to a recent analysis by McKinsey, ethnically diverse firms are 35% more likely to financially outperform the national median firm in their industries.These internships benefit high schoolers too, of course.Consider an analysis of the Urban Alliance's High School Internship Program, which provides career training, internships, and mentorship to at-risk students in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. Young men who completed the program were more likely to attend college than their counterparts.When these former high school interns land their first job, they earn higher wages. Students who complete certain high school internship programs land starting salaries that are 11% higher, on average, than students who don't partake in such programs.Today's employers complain that their workforces lack diversity and soft skills. Fortunately, firms can fix this problem themselves. The solution is sitting in a high school homeroom right now.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

35,LEG,"Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) surged 46% in late trading Tuesday on a report that Celgene (CELG) is in talks to acquire it.X According to the Wall Street Journal, unnamed sources say Celgene is in talks to buy Juno. The two have long-partnered on cancer treatments including CAR-T drugs that teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.The talks could pan out in a deal in the coming weeks, sources say. The potential deal to acquire Juno would come on the heels of Gilead Sciences' (GILD) nearly $12 billion purchase of CAR-T drugmaker Kite Pharma late last year.Now, Gilead and Novartis (NVS) have the only approved CAR-T drugs on market. Juno could follow with a CAR-T drug approval later this year, the company has said. So far, CAR-T drugs look best poised to treat blood cancers. Firms are also looking into using these therapies in solid tumors.For Gilead, buying Kite helps stem the gap from declining hepatitis C drug sales. For Celgene, buying its longtime partner Juno could give it a leg up as it prepares to lose patient protection for Revlimid, which treats a blood cancer known as multiple myeloma.IBD'S TAKE: Some hematology focused biotechs have piqued investor interest of late. See what these firms are working on by visiting IBD Industry Themes.A representative of Juno declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily. Representatives of Celgene didn't immediately return requests for comment.In after-hours trading on the stock market today, Juno rocketed 46% to 66.35 after closing down 6.5% at 45.60. Celgene sank 1.7% after ending the regular session down 1.1%, at 104.82. Bluebird Bio (BLUE), a CAR-T company that also partners with Celgene, saw its stock pop 7.3% after hours.RELATED:This Biotech Stock Seen As Cheapest Among Rivals In Cancer DrugsWhy This Biotech Stock Is Defying A Hematology-Related PitfallDoes Gilead's Kite Acquisition Offer A New Buying Opportunity?

36,LEG,"Autohome (ATHM) is on the move, and as the company focuses on big data to drive future growth, analysts believe there could be more room for the stock to run.X Initiating coverage on China's online destination for all-things-automotive with a buy rating on Jan. 2, Citi said that Autohome is ""gaining share in auto ad budgets.""Not only does the website — with content ranging from professional to user-generated to informational listings — make money from advertising, it's also growing sales in two other segments: auto finance and data products. Citi expects these newer areas to drive the ""next leg of growth.""""Big data is one of our key competencies,"" Chief Executive Min Lu said during the company's quarterly earnings call on Nov. 7. ""Being a leader in the market, we're positioned to build and unify our comprehensive database of auto consumers and vehicles in China and leverage this vast amount of data to offer vehicle planning and design, consumer acquisition and sales leads conversion, highly targeted marketing solutions and detailed competitive analysis and sales projections.""Over the last three quarters, earnings growth has accelerated from 15% to 39% to 58%, and that upward trend is projected to continue in the fourth quarter.Analysts expect Autohome's next quarterly earnings to hit 75 cents a share, which would be a 60% rise year over year according to Zacks Research.After consolidating for over four months, Autohome shares surged nearly 11% in heavy volume on Jan. 2, sailing beyond a 67.79 buy point. The stock is continuing to extend its gains and is now trading roughly 7% above the entry. Looking at a weekly chart, the Relative Strength line is hitting new high ground, which confirms the move.The recent pop not only coincided with Citi's initiation of coverage, but it also came as positive economic data out of China lifted the nation's internet stocks as a group.Out on Jan. 2, the December reading for the Caixin/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturing reached 51.5. That not only surpassed estimates, but it marked a four-month high for the metric that focuses on small and midsize businesses.""Manufacturing operating conditions improved in December, reinforcing the notion that economic growth has stabilized in 2017 and has even performed better than expected,"" according to Zhengsheng Zhong, the director of macroeconomic analysis at Caixin's subsidiary CEBM Group.But amid ""tightening monetary policy and strengthening oversight on local government financing,"" according to Zhong, will Autohome as a company continue to perform better than expected?IBD'S TAKE: Autohome ranks No. 1 in Investor's Business Daily's Internet-Content industry group with a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, meaning the stock outperforms 99% of all other stocks on a variety of fundamental and technical factors, including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Even though Autohome's full-year earnings per share growth rate expectation sits at a strong 22% for 2018, not all analysts have a rosy outlook for the stock. UBS maintained its sell rating in the wake of Autohome's quarterly report in early November, saying there's a ""lack of visibility in (the) 2018 growth outlook.""In particular, analyst Ming Xu noted concerns about a potential slowdown in advertising revenue growth and is cautious about ""revenue contribution from the auto finance platform due to limited value add.""On the other end of the spectrum, CLSA analyst Man Ho Lam said in a Nov. 14 research report that the auto finance platform has the ""potential to begin contributing meaningfully"" to revenue this year, according to StreetInsider.

37,LEG,"Headlines are constantly vying for your attention but when putting hard-earned money at risk in an investment, you want some substance to the story. That long has been a selling point to The New America feature in Investor's Business Daily, and 2017 provided a good reason why.X The names highlighted in The New America this past year had stellar performances as a whole. In an IBD index based on the New America names, the 2017 performance was 30.4% vs. 19.4% for the S&P 500. The index assumes a holding period for a stock is six months from its publication in the feature.How is that accomplished? By applying a key tenet of IBD's investing philosophy: It's just not fundamental or technical analysis, it's both.The technical analyses often seem to garner a disproportionate amount of real estate with stock prices, chart scrutiny and discussions of base patterns.However, the elements of what the company does, its earnings growth, balance sheets, and income statements are often more important in your stock selection.Ratings such as the Earnings Per Share Rating and Sales/Margins/Return on Equity Rating give you a good starting point in stock screening, but the New America dives deeper to get behind the numbers.What are the opportunities for future earnings growth? What is the competition like? How do customers, management and analysts view the company? Understanding the details of the company gives you a leg up on playing the stock for a profit.The New America selection isn't based on fundamentals alone. In keeping with the IBD principles, companies selected also need to display technical strength.Relative strength, signs of institutional sponsorship and developing chart patterns inform the selection process. The technical selection process helps weed out weaker stocks and gives readers a more focused list of names that could be actionable soon. The combination is critical.The 57% advantage the New America Index has over the S&P 500 may seem rewarding by itself but that's really just a starting point. Chart reading and portfolio management principles applied to the names can significantly improve those results.Charts help with the timing of your buys and sells but the fundamentals guide you on what to buy in the first place and which stocks might be worth holding for larger gains.Take Planet Fitness (PLNT), featured on Feb. 13. A flat base was in the process of forming at the time and The New America put the stock on investors' radar prior to a breakout. A savvy investor wouldn't have made the purchase at that time, because it didn't break out until three months later on May 25. That was after a new base formed and offered an even lower entry opportunity.Planet Fitness exited the New America Index six months after its entry, in the middle of August. Here again, an investor using charts and portfolio management rules would most likely view the new flat base as another buying opportunity rather than a time to sell.The 13% gain Planet Fitness contributed to the New America index over six months could have easily turned into a 63% gain over seven months. The improvement was simply by delaying the entry until a breakout and holding until the end of the year since the stock never triggered any sell rules.The New America is just one element to your stock research process. Once you understand the company, you should also look at a chart to see where the stock is trading.Is it basing in a sound pattern? Is it extended and needing time to consolidate gains? No matter how great the company story is, it doesn't guarantee the stock will go up in price. Charts act as a critical supplement to the information gleaned from the article.That was the case with Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) in July. The stock broke out in May and pulled back after making gains of 20%. At the time of the article, the best course of action would be to wait for a consolidation or a bounce off the 10-week line.Neither happened for Macom. A 25% drop after an earnings report ruined the look of the chart. While the New America Index suffered the loss, anyone looking at a chart would have avoided the stock.The New America acts as both an idea generator and a research tool. Maybe you recognize a compelling chart pattern as you're scanning the names in the IBD 50 list. Before just buying a stock based on the chart, you can do a deeper dive to understand the company's prospects.The company most likely won't be featured in The New America that day, but you can view the archives to see the most recent articles and filter by feature. Sometimes, the extra knowledge of what the company does can be a deciding factor of whether this will be a stock to hold for a larger gain.The story behind Alibaba (BABA) was certainly compelling when featured in the last quarter of 2016. Alibaba was in the process of forming a cup with handle at the time. But, when it broke out in March it quickly turned into one of the biggest leaders of 2017 with a gain over 80% from the breakout.The New America won't make the buy decisions for you, but it can certainly give you the tools to make informed decisions for yourself.RELATED:Planet Fitness Bumps 'Gymtimidation' Lunks To Powerlift Its GymsMacom Sees Gold In Mining The Silver Linings Of Data CloudsTwo Years After Its Blockbuster IPO, Alibaba Ready To Take On World

38,LEG,"A bombshell report just revealed that a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital knowingly hired a physician with a record of more than a dozen cases of malpractice, including the death of a patient.  Other recent VA physician recruits include a known sexual predator and a dangerous felon.A separate analysis from the Government Accountability Office determined that several VA medical facilities had ignored roughly half of all patient complaints.X These are merely the latest additions to a laundry list of shameful incidents at VA medical centers. The agency seems incapable of delivering high-quality care to the patients it serves — or even holding its employees accountable. Our nation's heroes are suffering the consequences.VA medical facilities are infamous for administering low-quality care. The latest GAO report, which examined five VA medical centers from 2013 to 2017, proves as much. Administrators of the medical centers were supposed to monitor and review the performance of 112 doctors ""after concerns were raised (by patients) about their clinical care.""But they shirked their responsibilities. GAO auditors concluded that administrators never reviewed 21 of the doctors. The medical centers were unable to provide documentation that reviews took place for 26 other physicians. One medical center did complete its required reviews — three and a half years late.Administrators' negligence enabled incompetent doctors to continue treating — and likely harming — veterans.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveWhen administrators do find hard evidence of malpractice, they often sweep it under the rug. An October USA Today expose of VA facilities revealed at least 126 cases in which employees committed fireable offenses.  Instead of immediately terminating these doctors and nurses, the VA asked them to resign — and gave them secret settlements on their way out the door.In about 75% of the settlements, administrators omitted the incidents from employees' records and even recommended them to other employers.Consider the case of Thomas Franchini, a podiatrist at a Maine VA hospital. Franchini botched 88 procedures. He severed a patient's tendon during one surgery and failed to successfully fuse one woman's ankle in another. The latter's leg had to be amputated as a result.Franchini wasn't fired for any of these errors. Instead, the VA allowed him to resign and return to private practice.The VA has even hired doctors who have lost their medical licenses — even though federal law prohibits them from doing so.In December 2017, USA Today revealed that the VA Hospital in Iowa City had recruited surgeon John Schneider, despite knowing that Wyoming had revoked his license. This summer, Schneider conducted four brain surgeries in just four weeks on one veteran. The patient died just weeks later due to infection.Another vet withstood three spinal surgeries from Schneider; a month after his third, his wound still hadn't healed.This negligence is too often the norm in VA medical centers. Vietnam veteran Bill Nutter died at a VA hospital in Massachusetts earlier this year because his nurse's aide failed to check on him. She instead opted to play video games while on the clock, according to the Boston Globe.Vets have to wait for care outside the hospital, too. The VA aims to keep wait times for appointments under 14 days. The department can't even clear this low bar.As of September, new patients had to wait an average of over three weeks to see a primary care doctor.  Worse, Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin recently announced that delays in care will likely spike in 2018.Many VA facilities try to hide these shortcomings.  The agency itself has recently been forced to admit that employees at hospitals in California, Colorado, and several other states manipulated wait time lists for years to show that delays were shorter — or in some cases, nonexistent.The VA is in shambles. Absent reform that allows vets to seek care in the private sector, our veterans will continue to be subjected to subpar care.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

39,LEG,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly Monday morning, while Bitcoin's wild ride took another leg down.During Thursday's session, chip giants Intel (INTC) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) undercut recent breakouts while Facebook (FB) drifted below its 50-day moving average. Those issues come as energy stocks power up, with Chevron (CVX) among Thursday's powerful moves into buy zones.X S&P 500 futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly above fair value.Bitcoin futures were falling yet again this week, with CME and Cboe futures tumbling to about $14,100. CME futures opened trading on Sunday evening at $20,650. Several Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks were retreating as well.Long Blockchain (LTEA), which surged 183% on Thursday on its decision to change its name from Long Island Iced Tea, was down 31% in premarket action. Riot Blockchain (RIOT) lost 12% and Overstock.com (OSTK) 5.5%.Intel fell 1.7% to 46.76 in Thursday's stock market trading, dropping below a 47.40 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Volume was 44% above normal, slightly more than on Wednesday's breakout. However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers, Micron Technology (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival Snap (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal. Concho Resources (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while EOG Resources (EOG), BP (BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading. But those moves still added to the general optimism surrounding the sector.Diamondback Energy (FANG) surged 5%, becoming extended after leading the way with a high-volume breakout Wednesday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Next Potential Pitfall In WashingtonThese Oil, Mining Stocks Hit Buy Zones On Global Growth, Trump Tax Cuts: Investing Action PlanArtificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

40,LEG,"China-based Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) soared Monday following news that Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and JD.com (JD) will invest $863 million in the online discount retailer.X Vipshop shares catapulted 39.2% higher to close at 11.75 on the stock market today. The deal was announced late Sunday.Tencent, China's leader in online messaging and gaming, will invest $604 million and receive a 7% stake in Vipshop. JD.com, a leading e-commerce retailer that competes most directly against Alibaba (BABA), will invest $259 million for a 5.5% stake.Tencent and JD.com paid a 55% premium for the shares, which are subject to a two-year lockup period. The two will have the right to appoint a director and an observer to Vipshop's board of directors during the lockup period.The deal is seen is an attempt to defend against Alibaba, China's leading provider of e-commerce services. In October, JD.com and Tencent expanded their partnership with the launch of a retail marketing platform.As part of the new agreement, Tencent will grant Vipshop a spot on the Chinese version of the popular WeChat communication platform, called Weixin Wallet. JD.com will grant Vipshop a prominent position on its main page and within its mobile application and will assist Vipshop in achieving certain gross merchandising volume targets through JD.com's e-commerce platform.IBD'S TAKE: JD, Tencent and Alibaba are among the best Chinese stocks to buy and watch.  To get a leg up on the stock market going forward, here's a thorough explanation of what to focus on.""We will develop a holistic cooperation with Tencent on the Weixin platform and expand our strategic alliance with Tencent into more and broader areas,"" said Eric Ya Shen, Vipshop's chief executive, said in prepared remarks.Tencent reported third-quarter results in November that beat estimates on the top and bottom line, fueled by strong growth in mobile gaming and video-related subscription services.Alibaba, last month, said it will invest $2.88 billion for a 36.16% stake in Hong Kong-based Sun Art Retail to expand opportunities in food and grocery retailing.Shares of JD.com were up 3.4% to finish the regular trading day at 41.68.

44,LEG,"Thomas Francis Meagher fought many battles to help his fellow Irish.Though born to a wealthy merchant family, Meagher (pronounced ""mar"") helped lead a failed rebellion against British rule in 1848. Convicted of treason, he was sent to a penal colony in Tasmania, Australia, for life, but escaped to New York City four years later.He spoke out against anti-Irish discrimination, then rallied his community to back the Union during the Civil War. Brig. Gen. Meaher led the Irish Brigade that distinguished itself in many of the bloodiest battles.""In (Meagher) we see the entire arc of so much crucial Irish-American history in one man's life — persecution, famine, banishment, exile, revival, and finding your place in a strange land,"" Timothy Egan, author of ""The Immortal Irishman,"" told IBD. ""During Irish-American Heritage Month, we should remember that these poor immigrants were once considered scum and filled our jails. They were told they were too clannish, too contentious, too Catholic, and didn't belong. The triumph of the Irish is finding joy, of persevering in the face of centuries of misery, a universal story born in a great struggle.""Meagher (1823-67) was born into a Catholic family in Waterford, Ireland, where his father had a thriving trading business with North America. At 17, he was sent to a Jesuit college in Lancashire, England.""Unlike most Irish Catholics of his generation, he was afforded an excellent education and read voraciously,"" said Roger McGrath, author of ""Gunfighters, Highwaymen and Vigilantes."" ""This and an extraordinarily quick mind enabled him to perform brilliantly in debating societies, and his oratorical eloquence carried him to a leadership role in the Young Irelander movement.""In 1843, Meagher went to Dublin to study the law and became involved in the movement to repeal the Act of Union of 1800, which united Britain and Ireland. He became radicalized when Ireland's main source of food, the potato, was wiped out by a blight in 1847, followed by a weak harvest the following year, causing the deaths of 1 million and driving another million into exile.Meagher and his comrades were outraged because there was plenty of other food on the island and the British government refused to keep it from being exported. Despite the fact that Ireland had a British garrison larger than colonial India, the Young Irelanders tried to foment a revolt among the starving peasants.When Meagher, 25, and three others were tried, he spoke to the jury: ""You may deem this language unbecoming in me, and perhaps it may seal my fate, but I am here to crave with no lying lip the life I consecrate to the liberty of my country. … Judged by the law of England, I know this crime entails upon me the penalty of death; but the history of Ireland explains that crime and justifies it.""They were sentenced to be hanged, but worldwide protests resulted in life sentences to that island at the end of the British Empire, where half the 65,000 residents were convicts.When Meagher arrived in New York City in 1852, after his escape, 20% of its population was Irish and most lived in slums. He was in demand as a speaker for Ireland's independence and published the weekly Irish News. He became a lawyer and helped provide a successful defense in a high-profile murder trial.As the debate over slavery heated up, Meagher was initially sympathetic to the South, influenced by friends whom he had visited there. He was, however, a staunch Unionist, as was the Catholic Church, and when South Carolina seceded in April 1861, he saw an opportunity for Irish Americans to get military training that could be valuable later in liberating Ireland.His offer to recruit a company of Irish was accepted, but his 1,000 men had only minimal training when they were sent to the First Battle of Bull Run in July. They arrived in Virginia without much sleep, food or medical supplies and soon joined the retreat by the Union Army. Meagher was knocked out when his horse fell and he was carried from the field, but was praised for his valor in leading from the front.He returned to New York to recruit what became known as the Fighting Irish Brigade and was made a brigadier general in February 1862, one of only 700 generals commanding 2.5 million Northern soldiers during the war. He developed a close relationship with President Abraham Lincoln, who saw him as the key to Irish support for the war, but Meagher had an increasingly difficult relationship with his Army superior, Gen. William Sherman, whom he accused of being anti-Irish and using his men as cannon fodder.The Irish Brigade was severely tested during the Seven Days Battles in June 1862, as the Army tried to take Richmond, Va., the capital of the Confederate States of America. The terrain was swampy and Southern troops were well-entrenched. In ""The Irish General,"" Paul Wylie wrote that one reporter described Meagher as ""indefatigable … all the time under fire,"" and he returned a hero.The Northern public had been led to believe the rebels would be quickly beaten, and early Union defeats made Meagher's recruitment efforts for his decimated brigade much harder. But like Lincoln, he came to believe that the war was not simply about the cause of reunification, but about ending slavery and giving African Americans the vote.At Antietam, Md., in September, during Gen. Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North, the Union troops achieved a costly victory, with 3,000 from both sides killed, wounded, captured, or missing on the bloodiest day in U.S. military history. Meagher had his horse shot from under him and was carried from the field. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, Va., in December, Meagher directed repeated assaults, earning Lee's admiration. Meagher had entered the battle with 1,200 men and only 280 survived, while he spent the next four months recovering from a cannonball wound to the leg.Meagher's protests about the way Irish-American soldiers were being treated prompted Sherman and his allies to claim that he had been drunk on the battlefield. His officers signed letters strongly supporting him as their commander. Furious, Meagher tendered his resignation in May 1863, but it was rejected in December and he returned to command at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Va., in April 1864, where his men were tasked with keeping Union soldiers from fleeing the fighting.Meagher's final assignment in September was to protect railroads in Tennessee with 10,000 convalescing soldiers. When he was ordered to move 6,500 south and the operation was botched due to poor communications, Sherman pushed for his dismissal. Having lost his protector when Lincoln was assassinated in April, Meagher resigned the next month.President Andrew Johnson appointed Meagher to be acting governor of the Montana Territory, where he arrived in September 1865. He did his best to try to get things done, despite infighting by bitter political factions, vigilantes, Indian attacks, settler reprisals, inability to conclude viable new treaties, miners who disregarded existing treaties, budget shortfalls, and hostility toward Irish Americans.In July 1867, Meagher took a Missouri River steamboat to retrieve a shipment of guns at Fort Benton. He either fell overboard or was pushed by some of his many enemies and his body was never recovered.But he was not forgotten: The founders of the Irish Republic often quoted his eloquent calls for the island's independence. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy addressed its parliament and told the story of Meagher's Irish Brigade, then presented the flag that they had always carried into battle.Led the Union Army's Irish Brigade during the American Civil War.Overcame: Banishment to Australia; bigotry; resistance among America's Irish community to backing the Union cause.Lesson: Read widely and prepare extensively to communicate effectively and persuasively; support your words with actions.""A good government may, indeed, redress the grievances of an injured people, but a strong people can alone build up a great nation.""MORE ABOUT LEADERSHIP:Dangerous Sam Adams Put A Revolutionary Vision Into ActionJoseph Warren Died A Hero At The Battle of Bunker HillGen.

45,LEG,"Shares of hospitals and Medicaid-focused health insurers took another leg down on Friday as the divide among House Republicans over the bill to replace much of ObamaCare appeared to narrow.Among hospitals, Tenet Healthcare (THC) slid 5.3%, Universal Health Services (UHS) 1.7%, HCA Holdings (HCA) 1.3% and Lifepoint Health (LPNT) 1.8%. Medicaid-focused insurer Molina Healthcare (MOH) lost 2.5%, falling close to a 28-month low, while Centene (CNC) slipped 1.6%.Other insurers were faring better on Friday, with Anthem (ANTM) rising 0.1% and Dow industrials component UnitedHealth (UNH) 1.2%.After sinking on Tuesday after the release of the House Speaker Paul Ryan's American Health Care Act, hospital stocks had recovered the past few days. Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick noted that the apparent willingness of President Trump to back conservatives who want a faster phaseout of the Medicaid expansion might get the bill over the top in the House.The White House clarified Friday that it supports phasing out the Medicaid expansion after 2020, as the current AHCA would do. But that didn't help health stocks.Drug companies and biotechs including Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) also sold off on Tuesday as Ryan's bill was scrutinized. But that was likely due to a Tuesday morning Trump tweet: ""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!""On Friday, Teva shares were up 1.3% Friday on the stock market today, while Mylan edged up 0.4%.Overall, markets were holding onto modest gains after a sizzling February jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq were all up 0.2%-0.4%, although the Dow and other major indexes were on track to break a string of four straight weekly gains.In a research note, Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick said the upbeat assessment from House Majority Whip Steve Scalise offers something of a wake-up call to health care investors.""It has become clear that hospital investors were assuming that there was very little chance of a draconian repeal bill passing,"" Skolnick wrote.IBD'S TAKE: The parts of President Trump's economic agenda that investors are most excited about, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, are stuck in line behind ObamaCare.That still leaves plenty of doubt about how anything resembling the House bill can get enough support in the Senate. Five GOP senators have expressed serious concerns about unwinding the Medicaid expansion, let alone on the expedited basis that House conservatives want to see.Skolnick notes that Trump's support will carry a lot of weight in the House, but that may not be as true for senators in states like Maine and Colorado, where Hillary Clinton beat Trump. In Ohio, GOP Sen. Rob Portman far surpassed Trump's vote tally.Yet Skolnick is sticking with her bottom line that repeal and replace gets done.

46,LEG,"Pfizer (PFE) and Tesaro (TSRO) could follow AstraZeneca (AZN) after the drugmaker early Friday unveiled strong results from a late-stage trial of PARP inhibitor Lynparza in breast cancer, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says.In the stock market today, Tesaro stock jumped 4.3% to 190.36.  AstraZeneca stock lifted 1.4% to 29.16, while Pfizer stock was flat, at 33.62.AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Tesaro, Roche (RHHBY) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) are all working on PARP inhibitors, a drug class that blocks specific enzymes to treat ovarian and other cancers. Drugs from AstraZeneca and Clovis are already approved in ovarian cancer. Clovis stock jumped 7.2% Friday to 65.80.Lynparza was first approved to treat ovarian cancer in December 2014. Early Friday, AstraZeneca said the drug showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful benefit in improving progression-free survival in HER2-negative, germline BRCA-mutated breast cancer.""This is the first Phase 3 readout for a PARP inhibitor in breast cancer and will likely have positive read-through for similarly designed trials of Pfizer's talazoparib and Tesaro's niraparib,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report. He has an outperform rating on AstraZeneca stock.IBD'S TAKE: Immuno-oncology companies like Merck, Bristol-Myers and Roche are racing toward a cure for cancer in the emerging field. Thus far, six I-O drugs have been approved with an array of indications. Head to IBD's Technology page to see which companies have the head start.Pfizer and Tesaro are expected to have data in the first and second halves of the year, respectively. AstraZeneca is expected to unveil full data at an upcoming medical conference, though the company didn't specify which conference.""Importantly, this represents a win for AstraZeneca, which is building its DNA Damage Response portfolio around Lynparza, as well as providing the first validation for the PARP inhibitor class outside of ovarian cancer,"" Fernandez said.In the future, Fernandez expects data from PARP inhibitors in combination with immuno-oncology drugs from the likes of Merck (MRK) and Roche.RELATED:Tesaro Rockets To All-Time High On Rumored Takeover InterestTesaro, AstraZeneca Could Shrink Clovis' Ovarian Cancer Drug PoolTesaro's Rumored Sale Could Fetch North Of $200 Per Share: Analysts

49,LEG,"North Korean Nukes: Why did President Trump suddenly go wheels-up on a grueling, 12-day Asian tour? As new polling data suggests, it might be because North Korea has suddenly emerged as a major nuclear threat in the eyes of most Americans.In the November IBD/TIPP Poll, taken from Oct. 26 to Nov. 3,  73% said they were ""very concerned"" or ""somewhat concerned"" about the ""possibility of a nuclear attack by North Korea against the U.S. or its allies."" The national poll of 917 adult Americans has a margin of error of +/-3.7 percentage points.Recent news developments no doubt feed this growing fear.On Sunday, Rear Adm. Michael J. Dumont of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it would take a ground invasion of North Korea to destroy its nuclear weapons capability. Dumont noted that Seoul, the South Korean capital that lies just 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone, would be vulnerable to attack by artillery, rockets and ballistic missiles in the event of a war. Seoul is home to 25 million people.Meanwhile, just days ago, an unnamed U.S. official told CNN that North Korea is ""working on an advanced version of its existing KN-20 intercontinental ballistic missile that could potentially reach the United States."" The totalitarian regime of Kim Jong Un launched its first ICBM just last July, so the progress is rapid. An ICBM could potentially reach the U.S. in a little over half an hour.Based on this escalation, blunt-talking U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis last month made clear what the U.S. policy was: ""I cannot imagine a condition under which the United States would accept North Korea as a nuclear power,"" he said.So a very clear and bright line has been drawn for all to see.Americans seem to understand this. While on many issues these days there are often sharp, even divisive, splits in general opinion based on party affiliation, that's not the case with North Korea's nuclear threat, the IBD/TIPP Poll's results show.Among Democrats, for instance, 86% said they were concerned, vs. just 14% saying they weren't. But Republicans weren't too far behind, with 69% expressing concern about a North Korean nuke, compared with 31% not being concerned. For independents, it was 65% concerned vs. 35% not concerned.A surprising share of those queried also believe that a military conflict between the U.S. is ""inevitable."" Some 27% said the U.S. and North Korea will go to war — 37% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats and 25% of independents.That explains Trump's tough talk on Monday, as he began the first leg of his nearly two-week tour. Speaking with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next to him, Trump referred to the ""North Korean menace"" and vowed that ""the era of strategic patience is over.""""The regime continues development of its unlawful weapons programs, including its illegal nuclear tests and outrageous launches of ballistic missiles directly overly Japanese territory,"" Trump said. ""We will not stand for that.""Americans have good reason to be worried about the totalitarian North Korean regime's nuclear schemes. Given the brutal nature of the murderous Kim regime and its potential instability, a nuclear North Korea is a nonstarter.President Trump is expected to meet with Chinese officials and possibly also Russian leader Vladimir Putin during his trip. No item on the agenda will be more important than North Korea's burgeoning nuclear program.American presidents of both parties have kicked this can down the road for decades, leaving it for someone else to resolve. Trump is the first to really take it seriously. As we've said before, China is North Korea's main patron. We hope, and expect, Trump will mince no words in expressing his disappointment over China failing to leash its mad dog in Pyongyang.Americans might be surprised to know that the U.S. is already technically at war with North Korea, since the hostilities of the Korean War ended with a cease-fire — not a formal end of the state of war. For one side of the conflict — North Korea — that state of war is very real. Seeing Kim's growing nuclear program, Americans are also starting to realize the threat is real.RELATED:No, North Korea's Nuclear Threat Isn't Fake News North Korea's Nuclear Threat To The U.S. Is Real — And China's Largely To Blame Trump's Trade War With China Is War On North Korea By Other Means IBD/TIPP Poll Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

50,LEG,"It will cost more than a trillion dollars to improve America's nuclear forces, according to a new estimate, but analysts argue that the Pentagon can get by with less.XThe Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday put the price tag at $1.2 trillion dollars through 2046, just 6% of total defense spending over 30 years but 20% higher than its estimate three years ago. The bill includes about $800 billion to make incremental upgrades to existing weapons near the end of their usable life spans, and about $400 billion for modernization efforts like the new Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bomber.The total figure is actually $1.7 trillion with inflation included, noted Tom Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which is focused on reducing nuclear weapons.In addition to the B-21, the Pentagon has already award initial contracts to other defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) for everything from nuclear-armed missiles to nuclear-armed submarines.The massive cost estimate for the nuclear force comes as the Defense Department faces other big-ticket priorities such as Lockheed's F-35 and pushing the Navy's fleet back above 300 ships.But the bill doesn't have to be that high for taxpayers and the CBO offered suggestions on how to lower costs. Here are some:America's nuclear force has for decades been based on the triad of land-, air- and sea-based weapons. But getting rid of the land-based ICBM leg, would save $120 billion though 2046. Of that, roughly $90 billion would come from canceling a replacement program. In August, the Air Force awarded Boeing and Northrop preliminary design phase contracts for it.Former Defense Secretary William Perry and retired Gen. James Cartwright, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs, wrote a letter to President Trump on behalf of the Ploughshares Fund, arguing that ICBMs create instability and increase the possibility of accidental nuclear war.""Our ICBMs are in danger of being launched in the case of another false alarm (we have experienced three to date), thereby starting a civilization-ending nuclear war by accident.""But during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis backed the development of new ICBMs.Perry and Cartwright support the building of ""an appropriate number of new, nuclear-armed submarines as the most survivable leg of the deterrent"" and new bombers that also have conventional applications.Going without the new  Long Range Standoff weapon would save $28 billion through 2046. Last month, the Air Force also awarded Lockheed and Raytheon preliminary design phase contracts for the LRSO.While CBO warned the lack of cruise missiles ""would diminish the capability of U.S. nuclear forces, particularly for limited nuclear strikes,"" Collina said the LRSO creates more instability as Russia can't tell if the air-launched missiles are nuclear or conventional and could spark a nuclear response to a conventional weapon.""Have conventional weapons  do the job instead,"" he suggested. ""We have conventional cruise missiles that can take out air defenses. We don't have to use nuclear missiles.""IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The Defense Department is currently reassessing its nuclear strategy as part of its Nuclear Posture Review, which will be sent to the White House by the end of the year.Collina noted that the U.S. can still maintain plenty of bang for fewer bucks.""The core of our power are conventional forces that can be deployed and project power around the world,"" he said. ""We can still be a nuclear power and have way fewer nuclear weapons than we have today.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 258.50 on the stock market today, still in buy range. Lockheed fell 0.5%, just below buy zone, Raytheon edged up less than 0.1%, Northrop lost 0.45% and General Dynamics eased 0.7%.RELATED:Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

51,LEG,"Mario Draghi warned that the European Central Bank will remain cautious even as he put his signature stimulus measure on the road toward an exit.Starting in January, the ECB will take a step toward ending one of its more controversial tools by cutting monthly purchases of public and private debt to 30 billion euros ($35 billion), or half the current pace. The shift in stance comes six years into Draghi's presidency, a new phase after his unprecedented actions to prevent the breakup of the euro area and stave off deflation.The decision ""reflects growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation rates towards our inflation aim on account of the increasingly robust and broad-based economic expansion,"" he said in a press conference after Thursday's Governing Council meeting. ""At the same time, domestic price pressures are still muted overall, and the economic outlook and path of inflation are conditional on support from monetary policy.""While Draghi toned down his language, saying the euro area still needs ""ample"" stimulus instead of the ""substantial"" used in previous statements, he emphasized the need to tread carefully as long as consumer prices remain weak. QE will be extended again if needed, even if only to draw it to a gentle halt, and will take total holdings to at least 2.55 trillion euros.The decision wasn't unanimous. A key point of dissent among some policy makers has been whether or not to set a firm end date for purchases.""I would characterize the discussion as ranging between consensus, broad consensus on some issues and large majority on others,"" Draghi said. The decision to keep purchases effectively open-ended was taken by large majority, he said.The ECB head highlighted additional risks including the strength of the euro, which has risen almost 12% against the dollar this year, potentially depressing price pressures and undermining export competitiveness. The currency slid after Thursday's decision and was down 0.5% at $1.1759 at 3:19 p.m. Frankfurt time.He also reiterated that governments need to step up their structural reforms ""substantially."" That could be a key risk as monetary stimulus is pulled back.""The door is left open to extend the asset-purchase program yet again,"" said Ken Wattret, an economist at TS Lombard in London. ""Though the likelihood of this happening for a fourth time looks rather lower now for various reasons, including the positive economic outlook.""Investors have for months attempted to guess the central bank's next move, with the drawn out decision-making process highlighting the struggles policy makers face in balancing a stimulus exit with the need to return inflation toward their objective.Even after becoming the first major central bank to charge banks for deposits and embarking on a quantitative-easing program, inflation remains far from the goal of just below 2 percent. That partly reflects a phenomenon of lackluster price growth faced by developed economies across the globe, which U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has called a mystery.The ECB began large-scale asset purchases in March 2015 — more than six years after the Fed started its first program. Germany's Bundesbank has been outspoken against the measure even before it began, arguing that it reduces incentives for governments to make their economies more competitive.To read more about the history of the ECB's QE program, click here.The latest reduction is the second after the program was slowed this April, and it is widely expected to constitute the final leg of QE as the ECB's capacity to provide more stimulus becomes increasingly constrained by self-imposed rules.Draghi pushed back on the idea that it is facing limitations.""Our program is flexible enough that we can adjust its size,"" he said. ""We can carry it through smoothly, and that's been the evidence we've given until now.""

52,LEG,"When professional racing pilot Kirby Chambliss is shooting across the sky, aiming to win a Red Bull Air Race in his Zivko Edge 540, there's just one thought crossing his mind: how to go fast and win.""I'm asked all the time, 'What do you think about when you're racing?' "" the 2004 and 2006 winner of the Red Bull Air Race World Series, which wrapped up in Indianapolis this past weekend, told IBD in an interview. ""Do you think about your family, your daughter? All I have time for is to think how to get from gate to gate in the least amount of time possible.""When you're maneuvering an acrobatic plane that can speed more than 225 miles an hour and do a 520-degree roll in less than 1 second (the F-16 fighter jet can only roll 240 degrees in the same time frame), Chambliss must indeed keep a clear head.When fractions of a second can decide who gets to stand on the medals podium, a champion must maintain 100% focus on the job at hand.Other keys to success as a racing pilot?The 57-year-old former test pilot at Zivko Aeronatics from Corpus Christi, Texas, who now lives on an airfield with his wife and daughter in Arizona, tries to focus on three tasks: fly very well, maintain a very good team, and have a great plane. He keeps risk at a minimum at all times.""I'm an adrenaline junkie, but everything is balanced with experience,"" said Chambliss, who has also put in 17,000 hours of flying time at Southwest Airlines (LUV) as a commercial pilot.

53,LEG,"It's good to see a stock pull back after a long, healthy run. After all, that gives it a chance to catch its breath and set the stage for what could be the next leg up.When you see a stock make its third pullback, dig a little deeper; the setup could be more than just an ordinary pullback. The stock may be shaping an ascending base.Unlike cups, cup with handles, double bottoms and flat bases, all of which are quite common, ascending bases are rare. They are also tougher to spot, but they can be powerful patterns.In 1999, Internet service provider America Online cleared an ascending base and nearly doubled in about five weeks. Specialty metal producer Titanium Metals bolted out from a 15-week ascending base in 2006. The stock doubled in about seven weeks.An ascending base usually forms after a stock has already broken out from a cup-with-handle or double-bottom pattern. So there should be a prior uptrend of at least 20%.One can characterize the ascending base as a pattern of a strong stock in a not-so-strong market. Each time the stock tries to rally, the weight of the overall market holds it back. Once the resistance from the general market disappears, the stock is free to make its advance — kind of like removing a brick off a heavy metal spring.The key distinguishing feature in an ascending base formation is its three pullbacks. Each one has a higher high and higher low, which gives it the overall ascending appearance.Each retreat should be due to general market weakness. And each pullback should be limited to no more than 10% to 20%.Sometimes these pullbacks will take the stock to its 10-week or 50-day moving average.Ascending bases take more time to form than other patterns. They usually develop over nine to 16 weeks. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the third pullback. Volume should be at least 40% above normal on breakout day.Retailer Limited Brands, now called L Brands (LB), cleared a cup-with-handle base in the week ended Feb. 26, 1982 (1). The stock gained 43% by late July before retreating to its 10-week moving average (2). It came out of that pullback and shot up for 10 straight weeks. After that rampage, the stock fell 13% (3) — the first of what would be three pullbacks of an ascending base.A second retreat came in January 1983. The stock fell 17% before finding support near its 10-week line (4). Limited's third pullback came in March. That set up an ascending base with a 15.29 buy point (5), which is adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split later in the year.The stock cleared that base in the week ended March 25, 1983. Limited more than doubled by July before settling into another base (6).(Editor's Note: This column originally was published in the July 15, 2010, edition of IBD.

55,LEG,"Shares of Edwards Lifesciences (EW) crumbled Friday after a U.K. judge ruled that one of its heart-valve patents is invalid, in a suit brought by rival Boston Scientific (BSX).In the stock market today, Edwards stock fell 1% to 92.44 as it continues to be tested at its 50-day line, earlier losing as much as 1.6% after announcing the court decision. Boston Scientific stock slipped 2 cents to 24.98.The judge ruled that one of Edwards' patents protecting its Sapien 3 transcatheter aortic heart valve is invalid, while a second patent is valid and has been infringed. Both patents deal with the outer seal for the valve.Boston Scientific's rival heart valve, Lotus, is credited with lowering the rate of leaks at the side of the heart valve, Evercore analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research report. The company uses a ""skirt"" to minimize leaks.Per the U.K. court, Edwards' patent for a ""sac outside the anchor to provide a seal"" was ruled valid. A second patent dealing with a fabric seal was ruled invalid.IBD'S TAKE: Boston Scientific, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic are pitted in the heart-valve market. But Boston's decision to buy Neovasc's advanced tissue business in December could give it a leg up. See how these Sector Leaders are battling it out.Edwards is appealing the decision and kept its guidance, believing ""the company will ultimately prevail."" The decision doesn't affect the commercial availability of the Sapien 3 valve.Court proceedings are ongoing in the U.S., Germany, France and Canada. A decision is expected in the German lawsuit in the first quarter, with a court date of March 9. The French case is still building, Muken wrote.The court decision comes a week after Boston Scientific said it would delay its Lotus heart valve amid mechanical issues involving excess tension on a pin.

56,LEG,"Is America in a new Gilded Age? That's the contention of Republican political consultant Bruce Mehlman, and in a series of 35 slides, he makes a strong case.In many ways, problems facing America today resemble those facing what we still call ""turn-of-the-century"" America, the 1890s to the 1910s. Just as employment shifted from farms to factories a century ago, it has been moving from manufacturing to services recently.Financial crashes are another point of resemblance, coming precisely 100 years apart. The panic of 1907 was resolved when J.P. Morgan locked his fellow financiers in his library and required them to pony up funds to save failing banks. Something similar happened in 2007, this time with Ben Bernanke in the bowels of the Federal Reserve.Technology's providing new products and threatening incumbent businesses is a feature of both epochs — with huge steel mills and automobile factories then and smartphones and mouse clicks today. Monopoly power reared its ugly head then and is doing the same now. Railroads and steel and oil muscled potential regulators then; retail-dominating Amazon and political communication censors Google and Twitter are now.Income inequality was actually greater in the 1920s (and probably earlier, but the statistics are incommensurate) than today. And immigration as a percentage of pre-existing population was three times as high in peak year 1907 than in peak year 2007.In all these respects, the problems — or perceived problems — of Americans today more closely resemble those facing the Americans of 100 years ago than they resemble the problems of the era that is generally taken as a benchmark, especially by commentators of a certain age (including me), the two decades after World War II.But Mehlman's list is not exhaustive. And the items omitted are perhaps even more troubling than those already mentioned.Consider family stability. Charles Murray's 2012 book, ""Coming Apart,"" documents meticulously how the stable marriage became far less common and unmarried parenthood far more common among the lower third on the socio-economic scale between 1960 and 2010.But if you look back to 1900 or 1910, the numbers look a lot like the numbers now. Americans then married at later ages, and more people didn't marry at all in that period than during the postwar years. Divorce was far less common than today, but many more marriages were ended early by spouses' deaths.And how did the many single men and women get along in turn-of-the-century America? Some lived quietly with relatives as bachelor uncles or maiden aunts. But many men also lived lives disconnected from stable communities, riding the rails or doing stints at odd jobs.Substance abuse is another common theme. Alcohol consumption was actually considerably higher 100 years ago than it is today; Prohibition, which took effect in 1920, really did significantly reduce alcoholism and improve public health. And though oxycodone was not available then, drugs were a problem.You can see it lurking just around the corners in the turn-of-the-century novels of Theodore Dreiser and Frank Norris and even the aristocratic Edith Wharton. Respectable forces choked off the explicit narratives we are used to today, not because unrespectable behavior wasn't common but because they knew it was.Mehlman notes that various political, market and social reforms addressed problems of turn-of-the-century America. He might have added that immigration — beneficial on the whole but greatly disturbing to many — was largely ended by legislation in 1924 and wouldn't have continued during the Depression or World War II in any case.The problems he doesn't mention were addressed, as well — by public schools dedicated to Americanization, by the outreach of Protestant and Catholic churches and voluntary organizations such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Clearly, something like this could help the people Charles Murray describes as left behind.But some of the homogenizing forces that produced the high family stability, the cultural consensus and the high church membership of postwar America were pretty dire. The Great Depression tended to equalize incomes and wealth by lowering incomes and destroying wealth. Not desirable, however much you dislike economic inequality.World War II, with 16 million Americans out of 131 million in the military, brought together people from diverse backgrounds and hostile regions, and GI benefits gave veterans a leg up on attending college and buying homes. Good effects, but no sane person wants a total war.As Bruce Mehlman suggests, political and economic reforms could address the problems he identifies today as such reforms did 100 years ago. But it's not clear what could be done about the problems he leaves to the side.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

59,LEG,"AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) could challenge Tesaro's (TSRO) treatment for ovarian cancer known as a PARP inhibitor, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Wednesday, reiterating his view of Tesaro as a potential acquisition target.In the stock market today, Tesaro stock toppled 5% to 178.95, after its late Tuesday fourth-quarter earnings report. Shares last week touched a record high of 192.94.Fernandez classified the earnings report as ""largely uneventful,"" but Tesaro's quarterly numbers lagged significantly.For the quarter, Tesaro reported $4.23 million in sales, up from $200,000 in the year-ago quarter, but missing analyst estimates for revenue of $5.76 million. Tesaro posted a $2.60 per-share adjusted loss, worse than analysts' $1.95 per-share loss forecast.Fernandez kept his 186 price target and market perform rating on Tesaro, adding a fair takeover price would likely be 220 per share. The Street currently thinks niraparib leads the field in PARP inhibitors, essentially a second-line maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer.Niraparib's reputation is under some duress, though, as AstraZeneca and Clovis Oncology are expected to release data on PARP inhibitors Lynparza and Rubraca later this year, Fernandez wrote in a report. Data on Lynparza is expected later this month, and Rubraca data is likely by mid-2017.IBD'S TAKE: PARP inhibitors could help buoy the biotech industry in 2017, analysts say. How will Tesaro fit into that trend? Read on, on IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive.But unlike Lynparza and Rubraca, niraparib isn't yet FDA-approved. It was granted priority review in December, a day after the FDA granted accelerated approval to Clovis' Rubraca. All three drugs aim to block a specific enzyme thought to be tied to ovarian and breast cancer.Tesaro also is working on an anti-nausea medication for chemotherapy patients, Varubi. Tesaro expects Varubi to receive approval in the first half of 2017 after the FDA asked for more information surrounding the in-vitro comparison of the drug between two manufacturers.RBC analyst Adnan Butt expects niraparib and Varubi to gain FDA approvals this year. He has an outperform rating and 202 price target on Tesaro stock.Tesaro also has plans to initiate a registration program for an immuno-oncology drug, known as TSR-042, in the first half of 2017. The drug will target the PD-1 checkpoint within the immune system, putting it in the same category as drugs from Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Immuno-oncology drugs teach a patient's immune system to identify cancer cells in order to destroy them. Tesaro is also looking at other checkpoints, including anti-TIM-3 and anti-LAG-3, and has plans to begin trials looking at combinations of its immuno-oncology drugs in mid-2017.RELATED:AstraZeneca Could Give Pfizer, Tesaro Leg Up In Breast Cancer: LeerinkTesaro's Rumored Sale Could Fetch North Of $200 Per Share: AnalystsTesaro Rockets To All-Time High On Rumored Takeover Interest

60,LEG,"Exelixis (EXEL) is taking a page out of Incyte's (INCY) playbook, teaming up with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) to test its Cabometyx and their immuno-oncology (I-O) drugs in liver and bladder cancer.In the stock market today, Exelixis stock flirted with a 16-year-plus high it touched on Tuesday, as the company announced its collaborations with Bristol-Myers and Roche. Shares came within 10 cents of eclipsing that Tuesday high of 23.49, rising 6.5% to 23.09. It helped lift IBD's 423-company Biomed/Biotech industry group 4.2%, as did 7%-plus gains by Bluebird Bio (BLUE) and Cara Therapeutics (CARA).""Planned phase 3 trials, if successful, could support potential label expansion for Cabometyx in several additional indications, including first-line kidney cancer, bladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and potentially other tumor types,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a research note.Cabometyx inhibits tyrosine kinases and VEGFR2 receptors to slow tumor growth, metastasis and angiogenesis. It is approved as a monotherapy for second-line advanced renal cell carcinoma.I-O partnerships are nothing new. Merck (MRK) is testing out its PD-1 inhibitor Keytruda in conjunction with Incyte's IDO inhibitor epacadostat (not yet approved) in five tumor types. Bristol-Myers also has teamed up with Horizon Pharma (HZNP) in advanced solid tumors.IBD'S TAKE: There are more than 1,000 I-O trials underway right now, analysts estimate. But only a small handful of I-O drugs have actually been approved. Who's leading the sector in terms of approvals? Head to IBD's Technology page for the best opportunities in I-O.Exelixis and Bristol will focus on first-line RCC and have trials planned in HCC and bladder cancer, the companies said Monday. Exelixis' outside-U.S./Japan partner Ipsen will participate in the RCC trial. Exelixis' Japan partner Takeda Pharmaceuticals has the opportunity to do so.Partnering in the phase 3 trial will help Exelixis shave off some costs, Schmidt wrote. Exelixis' Cabometyx will be combined with Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy — respectively, PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors.""While detailed economics with Bristol-Myers were not disclosed in the press release, Exelixis may potentially end up paying as little as 20%-25% of these trial costs given the 50-50 cost split with Bristol-Myers,"" he wrote.Exelixis and Roche will combine Cabometyx and Tecentriq, a PD-L1 inhibitor, in a phase 1b escalation study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, they said. The trials will begin enrolling in mid-2017.The trial will look at first-line advanced clear cell RCC and three cohorts of urothelial carcinoma. Exelixis will sponsor the study with Roche contributing Tecentriq. Ipsen will participate and contribute 35% of the costs. Takeda could still opt in.Schmidt kept his outperform rating on Exelixis stock.RELATED:Merck, Bristol-Myers, Incyte Race For A Cure In $25 Billion I-O MarketCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Bristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O Competition

61,LEG,"Google's 2004 initial public offering is ancient history in Silicon Valley time. But buried in an IPO prospectus this month from another tech wunderkind, Snapchat, were clues to the future growth of Google and its parent, Alphabet (GOOGL).Forget Google's much-touted but money-losing ""other bets,"" far-flung businesses ranging from home automation to the Google Fiber broadband service. The real story is in one of the tech giant's three ""big bets"" — cloud computing — which could become Google's first major revenue source not based on advertising.IPO documents filed by Snapchat's parent Snap revealed it has a $2 billion, multiyear contract with Google's cloud computing service to power the company's trendsetting social media network. The disclosure validated views that Google Cloud Platform, while smaller than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, is prospering from its focus on ""born in the cloud"" high-tech startups. Aside from Snap, Google's cloud customers include Spotify, Evernote, Zulily and Niantic.And Alphabet has bigger plans. It aims to crack the enterprise market — large companies and government agencies — where AWS, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Microsoft's Azure dominate.""Cloud could represent the first material, non-advertising revenue stream for Google and is a key support for the stock multiple,"" said Daniel Salmon, a BMO Capital Markets analyst.Google has more than quadrupled in size since 2008. Its 2016 revenue rose by 20% to a hefty $90 billion.The big driver remains its core advertising business, encompassing its search engine and related web services as well as its YouTube video site, which analysts believe is a big growth contributor.Yet digital advertising growth is leveling off in the U.S., and the continued growth of mobile search could chip away at Google's search dominance. Another worry is the potential challenge from voice-based search from Apple (AAPL), Amazon and others.On Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai highlighted Google Cloud and the other two ""big bets,"" which are YouTube and consumer products like smartphones.Cloud computing is mushrooming as customers ditch the hassles of running their own computers and seek better speed and performance. Cloud service providers lease number-crunching computers and data storage via the internet. They also sell applications and software that run on cloud infrastructure.AWS revenue jumped 55% in 2016 to $12.2 billion. Analysts estimate that Microsoft's Azure cloud service topped $2.6 billion in 2016 revenue while Google trailed at around $1 billion.But Google wants more. In 2015 it brought in Diane Greene — a co-founder of VMware (VMW), whose virtualization software is used in many corporate data centers — to head its cloud business.Greene spelled out Google's enterprise cloud strategy at a Goldman Sachs conference earlier this month. That same day, Google unveiled a new cloud service based on Spanner, a database technology that shares information in data centers spread out globally.Naysayers argue that serving the enterprise market is not in Alphabet's DNA. But Greene says Google aims to help cloud customers become more competitive using data analytics and artificial intelligence tools.""The enterprise has to lean into data and that's what Google was built for,"" Greene said. ""With machine learning and data analytics, we're in the sweet spot of where enterprise customers are going.""Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research, says Google could be on the right track.""Google's innovation in analytics and big data platforms could be the wedge that gets them into enterprises,"" said Bartoletti. ""There's gold inside loads of corporate data, and no one's won the battle to extract it yet.""More than 3 million businesses now use Google's Cloud G Suite software productivity tools — word processing, spreadsheet, calendar and other software that competes with Microsoft's Office 365.The competition is tough.Microsoft has a huge corporate customer base. And, Microsoft has been successful in getting Office customers to sign on for Azure services.Amazon has steadily added tools to make it easier for large companies to shift business workloads to its public, shared cloud infrastructure. Even so, AWS still lacks an ""anchor"" software platform to attract enterprise clients, says Bartoletti.That's where speculation arises could make a takeover bid for Salesforce.com (CRM), the leader in software-as-a-service. Such a combination could give Google Cloud a leg up against Amazon in wooing enterprise clients.Salesforce software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships. It has expanded into marketing, customer services and e-commerce.""I doubt they would try for Salesforce. It would be expensive. But that's not crazy,"" said Bartoletti. ""It's true that one way to buy a big load of enterprise users is to acquire a top SaaS product.""One hurdle for Google is that Salesforce last year selected AWS as its public cloud infrastructure provider in a deal said to be worth $400 million. The pact runs through 2020.But Google is arming for battle. In the fourth-quarter conference call, Pichai signaled bigger cloud investments as the company targets enterprise customers. By 2018, Google plans to operate 40 data centers, up from 15, says Pacific Crest Securities.""I think whatever investments Google makes in the cloud the market will be fully supportive of,"" said Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital, in an interview. ""It's perceived to be a huge TAM (total addressable market), especially looking at the track record of AWS. And, it's an extremely profitable business."" The operating margin at AWS was 26.2% in the fourth quarter.Higher investments to develop new revenue streams put Google in the same boat as rivals Facebook (FB) and Amazon, says Mahaney. Facebook plans to up spending on video content, data centers, engineering and sales, and virtual reality. Amazon is investing in logistics, cloud, media and other areas.""The common theme across all three names is they're all aggressively investing,"" Mahaney added. ""They're still deep in investment mode because they think there are high-growth opportunities that are early stage in their development.""If not the cloud, where will Google's growth come from, excluding search-related ads? On Google's fourth-quarter call, management cited ""very significant"" growth rates for YouTube.Some analysts are on the YouTube bandwagon.""We believe YouTube could be the next leg of earnings growth for Alphabet,"" said Ralph Schackart, a William Blair analyst, in a report. He says Alphabet shareholders ""could see $75 to $175 of share price appreciation from YouTube alone"" over the next two years.One question is whether YouTube will grow non-advertising revenue. Google launched YouTube Red, a subscription service, in 2015 but has not disclosed subscriber numbers.""It takes a while to build a subscription business,"" Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on Google's earnings call.Google is expected to roll out YouTube Unplugged, a subscription service with live broadcast content, in 2017. It will compete with on-demand video services like Netflix (NFLX) as well as live streaming services from AT&T (T) and Hulu.Google also has signaled higher spending on Pixel phones and smart consumer devices.Google's financial statements lump a number of businesses into the ""other revenue"" category. That revenue includes cloud computing, the Google Play store and consumer hardware, such as Pixel phones and the Google Home assistant, which competes with Amazon's voice-activated Echo smart speaker.In the fourth quarter, ""other revenue"" jumped 62% to $3.4 billion, blowing past consensus estimates. The company did not break out operating income. The segment, though, has lower margins overall than Google's core ad business, and contributes less to profits, says Mahaney.Revenue at smart home device maker Nest, the Verily Life Sciences health data and technology unit and the rest of the ""other bets"" rose 82% to $809 million in 2016. Their combined operating loss grew 4% to $3.6 billion.Verily announced in January that Singapore's sovereign fund, Temasek, will acquire a minority stake for $800 million.Alphabet has pruned other ventures. It spun off Waymo, its self-driving car project, as a stand-alone business in December. Alphabet also sold Terra Bella, its satellite imaging company, to startup Planet Labs.With Google pulling back on broadband investments, 2017 operating losses for the ""other bets"" could be lower.Mahaney says investors have low expectations for the ""other bets,"" though one of them could emerge as a multibillion-dollar business in years to come.""Even if 'other bets' were to shock people with falling losses and material revenue generation, it would be a small stock driver for Google,"" Mahaney said.Google stock slipped 0.37% to 847.81 on Friday. Shares hit a record high of 867 late last month and still are up 18% in the past 12 months.RELATED:Could Google Bid For Salesforce.com Despite Amazon Cloud Pact?This Is What Google Won't Tell You About YouTube's Financials

63,LEG,"Industry group strength can make or break a swing trade. The best trades often have a confluence of a great stock, in a strong group, with a market in an uptrend. Weakness in an industry group that was previously showing strength can be an early warning sign that it might be time to part ways.The solar stocks provide multiple opportunities for profit, but also supply many pitfalls along the way. Regulations, trade relations with China, and prices of energy commodities like oil, natural gas and coal can all influence how the stocks act.Most recently, news centered on a petition to restrict imports on solar panels, specifically targeting cheap imports from China. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled Friday that these imports were harmful to U.S. solar panel makers. That means tariffs might be on the way.SolarEdge (SEDG) joined IBD's SwingTrader Sept. 12 as the stock reversed strongly near its 50-day moving average line (1). Volume was at its highest in over a month (1). In addition, the solar industry saw a number of its high profile names setting up in bullish chart patterns. The industry group itself went from the top 20 of IBD's 197 Industry Groups to the top five.That combination got our attention for a potential swing trade. The timing gave the trade just under 10 days before the ITC decision. Note that SolarEdge produces direct current inverters, which it sells to solar installers rather than selling or installing panels for residential or commercial consumers.Over the next few days, the stock was up nearly 4% from our entry but showed a bearish reversal back to its 5-day moving average (2). Volume was lower on the day (2), so it wasn't enough to incite a panic, but definitely deserved a more watchful eye. Meanwhile, group mate First Solar (FSLR) wasn't following through on its breakout.Things got worse a couple days later as the stock went through both its 5- and 10-day moving averages and came back to its entry intraday (3). Though volume was low again (3), the biggest names of the industry group were retreating as First Solar's breakout neared a trigger of the 7% sell rule. Individual sell signals on your stock coupled with a weakening industry group will usually suggest an exit on its own, but the looming ITC ruling sealed it. We removed the trade with a slight profit as it started to rebound at the end of the day.More details on Past Trades are available to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Industry Group Moves Can Make, Or Break, A StockSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

65,LEG,"Apple (AAPL) charged up 1.5% Monday, ending a four-day sell-off ahead of Tuesday's media event to showcase next-generation iPhone models and helping stage a broad rebound in U.S. equities.XThe largest company by market value on the U.S. stock exchanges rose 2.67 to 161.30 in slightly heavier than normal turnover and is still within the permissible buy zone following its Aug. 2 breakout at 156.75. That buy zone goes up to 164.59. Shares are also up more than 36% since the Jan. 6-9 breakout from a bottoming base pattern, a first-stage cup with handle with a 118.12 proper entry.The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite led the upside with gains of 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively, edging a 1% gain for the S&P 500. The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied nearly 1.2%, yet still trails the 500 year to date with a gain of less than 2% for the former vs. a 11% rise for the latter.Volume at 3 p.m. ET is running mildly lower on both main markets vs. the same time Friday.Apple, for now, remains nominally in buy range since breaking out of a second-stage flat base with a 156.75 buy point Aug. 2. Don't chase stocks up already more than 5% past a proper buy point, as day-to-day market volatility can quickly send any stock back to or even slightly below the breakout point. Such pullbacks can persuade an investor who bought too high in price to sell on otherwise normal price action.IBD research shows that as many as four out of every 10 huge stock market winners will reverse back to or near the proper buy point after a sound breakout before firming up again and rushing to new highs.As Hurricane Irma, now categorized as a tropical storm, looked set to depart Florida with less catastrophic damage than originally thought, banking, insurance, home construction, semiconductor, automaker, airline, oil drilling and internet firms helped pace the market's rebound following last week's mild declines for the major benchmarks.MercadoLibre (MELI) jumped well above its 50-day moving average on a gap up at the open and rallied nearly 7% to 280.70. Volume is running nearly 60% above its 50-day average turnover of 801,000 shares.The big gain puts the Latin American e-commerce firm in a stronger position to potentially break out from a nearly four-month base that features traits of a classic double-bottom base. In such a bullish pattern often shown by leading stocks, a stock encounters two major sell-offs and the second decline takes out the low of the first leg down.In August, the midcap stock dropped to as low as 232.17, undercutting the first low of 245.50. The middle peak between the two lows, 293.96, thus offers a potential buy point at 294.06, a dime above that midterm high.The quarterly earnings record shows mixed results. In two of the past four quarters, earnings fell 14% (Q3 of 2016) and 17% (Q2 of this year). Analysts see on consensus a 15% EPS decline in the current third quarter vs. a year ago. Full-year profit is seen sliding 13% to $3.01 a share, which would snap a growth streak of at least eight years.However, 2018 looks far brighter, with profit seen rebounding 63% to $4.91 a share.Going back to Apple, analysts appear mixed in their view over whether consumers are ready to pay premium prices for the upcoming new smartphone models, said to cost as much as $1,000. IBD's Click blog notes that some analysts believe production snags could delay the launch to late October or even later.However, the current stock's price action appears to reflect several bullish fundamental and technical traits that help make Apple one of the prime leaders in the market since Jan. 1. First, Apple management is showing shareholder-friendly action with its massive buyback and dividend program. In the June-ended fiscal third quarter, the company returned $11.7 billion to shareholders via these measures. Annualized, that's equal to $46.8 billion, or nearly 5% of the stock's current market cap of $833 billion.Two, a high-priced phone may not deliver the same unit growth as Apple achieved when it debuted the smartphone in the late 2000s and proceeded to grab market share in the industry. However, high prices are a measure of a company's ability to sustain excellent profit margins, which boost earnings.In fiscal Q3, Apple's aftertax margin improved by 80 basis points to 19.2%. In the prior quarter, net margin was unchanged at 20.8%.Three, Apple is deriving more and more of its top line from services-related revenue as it cashes in on the strength of its iPhone and iMac hardware base. This is one reason why both the top line and bottom line have seen accelerating growth. Earnings per share have gone from a 15% dip in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 (ended in September) to gains of 2%, 11% and 18%.The Street sees earnings rising 13% to $1.88 a share in fiscal Q1.In the chip sector, Micron Technology (MU) advanced more than 2% to 33.22. While trading is on the light side, the memory chip firm, featured in a recent IBD New Highs column, is acting like a new breakout should. On Sept. 1, shares lifted past a 32.45 entry in a 10-week double-bottom base.Micron has posted three quarters in a row of solid earnings, and full-year earnings are set to increase sharply in 2017 ($4.72 a share vs. 26 cents in 2016) and in 2018 ($6.14 a share, up 30%). Fiscal Q4 results are slated to come out Sept. 26 after the close.While Micron is part of the Computer-Data Storage industry group, its memory cards, DRAM modules and solid state drives are closely related to semiconductors. And while Micron's data storage group ranks virtually in the middle of IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups at No. 97, the chipmaking group is a little bit better at No. 83 and the fabless semiconductor group is No. 85.IBD's TAKE: One key step to making money in stocks is to perfect one's timing in growth stocks by identifying important chart patterns such as the cup with handle.

67,LEG,"Microsoft (MSFT) is trying again in health care, betting its prowess in cloud services and artificial intelligence can help it expand in a market that's been notoriously hard for technology companies.A new initiative called Healthcare NExT will combine work from existing industry players and Microsoft's Research and AI units to help doctors reduce data entry tasks, triage sick patients more efficiently and ease outpatient care.""I want to bring our research capabilities and our hyper-scale cloud to bear so our partners can have huge success in the health-care world,"" said Peter Lee, a Microsoft Research vice president who heads Healthcare NExT.Microsoft has tried to expand in health care before, with mixed results. It had a Health Solutions Group for many years, but combined that into a joint venture with General Electric (GE). Last year, it sold its stake to GE.Microsoft unveiled the new effort ahead of the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society conference next week.The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Microsoft want to use things like speech and natural language recognition technology to replace manual data entry by doctors, Lee said.Microsoft's Israel office has taken the company's chatbot technology to create a ""triage bot"" for digital health provider ""MDLive."" In a demo, a Microsoft researcher tells the bot her leg hurts. She connects the bot to her personal health account where it finds her prescriptions and confirms she's taking birth control pills.It pulls up a picture of a leg and asks her to click where it hurts. The bot notes recent exercise from the researcher's wearable device, while a scan of her calendar spots a recent airplane trip. The system calculates there's a good chance she has a blood clot in her leg, and connects her to a nurse. It can also suggest doctors and answer insurance questions.There's also a new Microsoft project called HealthVault Insights that works with fitness bands, Bluetooth scales and other connected devices to make sure patients stick to their care plan when they leave the hospital or doctor's office.Many companies, like International Business Machines (IBM) and Verily, a unit of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), are developing similar technology. However, the healthcare industry has been slow to adopt essential enabling technology like electronic records.Entrenched, legacy systems and rigorous regulation are also obstacles, said Malay Gandhi, co-founder of Ensemble Labs, which invests in health-care startups.""The industry wasn't built as a tech-enabled industry,"" he said. Some large tech companies ""are trying to sprinkle AI or machine learning over the top of existing systems and I view that as misguided. We might need to rebuild these businesses with tech at the center.""Lee found the space daunting when Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella asked him to take it on.""At first it felt like he threw me into the middle of the Pacific Ocean and asked me to find land and you see others swimming around aimlessly and beneath you people are drowning,"" Lee said. ""Big technology firms have tried this and failed.""This time, Microsoft aims to support existing health-care organizations with cloud services and AI software, rather than launch company-branded products that may compete with existing industry players, he said.""We know health care will become more patient-focused, more cloud-based and that AI will make health care more data-driven. We just don't know when and and how it will come together,"" he said ""But we can position Microsoft to be there when all these changes happen.""

68,LEG,"What if your body's immune system fought off deadly cancer cells just like it protects you from germs you encounter every day?That's the goal of an emerging class of treatments called immuno-oncology, or I-O, drugs, which Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham says could become a $25 billion market by 2025. Products from Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche Holding (RHHBY) already are approved by the FDA to treat melanoma and lung cancer.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez estimates some 1,000 trials are underway in the I-O stratosphere. Those include drug trials by the likes of AstraZeneca (AZN), Incyte (INCY) and a slew of others to treat kidney, bladder, urothelial and head and neck cancers.Results are still very preliminary, says Tim Reilly, development lead for Bristol-Myers' early I-O pipeline.""That 'cure' is a tough word,"" he told IBD. ""We are seeing indications that we can at least reset the patient's immune system to normal homeostasis. ... Our hope is we can bring patients who have an official diagnosis of cancer back to that homeostatic place.""Bristol-Myers stock rose 0.6% to 54.58 in stock market trading Friday. Merck shares rose a small fraction, to 65.38, while Roche shares inched up 2 cents, to 30.53.  Incyte ended the day up 0.3%.Though preliminary, the I-O thesis played out for Bristol-Myers and Merck in Q4. Bristol-Myers tacked on $1.57 billion in sales of its I-O drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Yervoy sales were flat, but Opdivo sales grew 176% from a  year earlier. Merck's Keytruda grew 125% to $483 million in sales. (See a list of the major immuno-oncology drugs cleared so far by the U.S. FDA and their approved uses.)Cancer cells are constantly occurring in everyone, Reilly says.""Every time we get out in the sunlight and get some UV exposure, there's a mutation to a cell that is technically now a mutated cell and is, technically, cancer,"" he said. ""But our body eradicates that cell.""That's what a healthy immune system does. But, in some cases, aberrant cells evolve to outpace or outsmart the system, throwing off the body's natural homeostasis. Those cells then grow, becoming a cancerous tumor.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street was nervous entering the Q4 earnings season as biotechs took political heat for high drug prices. But biotech Incyte is riding high on a plethora of potential blockbusters, including those in the I-O sector. Head to IBD's The New America article to get a deep dive on Incyte's vast opportunities.Chemotherapy — pumping the body full of poison to kill cancer cells — is the standard of care. In the early 2000s, targeted therapies changed the growth rates of tumors. After that, drugmakers looked at combining therapies to improve results.Immuno-oncology drugs — more precisely checkpoint inhibitors — are completely different, Meacham says.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo are both PD-1 inhibitors. Both were first approved in 2014 to treat melanoma. Since then, they've tacked on a slew of indications including lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Yervoy is Bristol-Myers' CTLA-4 inhibitor. It was approved in 2011 for advanced melanoma.""A lot of these drugs basically train the immune system to see the difference between a regular cell and a tumor cell, and use the immune system to fight the tumor off,"" Meacham said.Immune system T cells patrol the body for aberrant cells. When a T cell encounters another cell, it probes the surface looking for proteins that would indicate a cancerous cell. Upon finding a cancer cell, the T cells attack, calling forth additional molecules to prevent the battle from injuring regular tissue.These additional molecules are checkpoint inhibitors, explained a July 6, 2016, blog post from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. But a cancerous cell can trick a T cell by wearing the proteins of a normal cell, evading detection and destruction.""Checkpoint inhibitors block these normal proteins on cancer cells, or the proteins on T cells that respond to them,"" Dana-Farber wrote. ""The result is to remove the blinders that prevented T cells from recognizing the cells as cancerous and leading an immune-system assault on them.""Monotherapies like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo block the interaction between the PD-1 protein on a T cell surface and the PD-L1 protein on the surface of the cancer cell. Doing so allows the T cell to see the cancer cell for what it is.Bristol's CTLA-4 antibody Yervoy works in a similar fashion.More than 1,000 clinical trials are exploring different inhibitors, Leerink's Fernandez wrote in a Jan. 20 note. Firms are also looking at checkpoint modulators that would stimulate T cell activation.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol-Myers' Opdivo have myriad indications as solo therapies. Both are indicated in advanced lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Opdivo is also approved to treat melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. Bristol-Myers' Yervoy is indicated in melanoma.Near-term excitement, though, is on the potential for I-O combinations. That's where Merck might have a slight lead. In January, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Merck's supplemental filing for accelerated approval of a Keytruda plus chemo combination to treat non-small-cell lung cancer.Less than two weeks later, Bristol-Myers said it wouldn't seek accelerated approval for its combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in non-small-cell lung cancer, confirming Merck will have a lead in that market. Bristol-Myers is studying that combo in its Phase 3 trial CheckMate-227.In the aftermath, Wall Street is awaiting the results of AstraZeneca's Mystic trial with bated breath. Like Opdivo and Yervoy, AstraZeneca's durvalumab and tremelimumab are PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies, respectively, Barclays' Meacham says.""That trial is a leading indicator of what could happen with 227,"" he told IBD. ""It's a similar mechanism to Bristol-Myers' Yervoy and Opdivo. ... There are a lot of subtleties between the (Mystic) trial and the 227 study, but I think overall people want to see if the idea worked.""Meanwhile, Merck is testing out Keytruda with Incyte's epacadostat in first-line melanoma, advanced lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer. Epacadostat belongs to another class of checkpoint inhibitors working to target IDO enzymes.CTLA-4 antibodies were among the first I-O antibodies approved. In 2011, when it was first approved, Yervoy ""was a pretty toxic drug,"" Meacham said. But drugmakers pushed forward upon the discovery of ""eye-popping"" efficacy when combining CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies.Finding the right dosages of both drugs requires ""a bit of trial and error,"" Bristol-Myers' Reilly said. Through that testing, Bristol-Myers has cut down on the toxicity of its Opdivo and Yervoy combo to ensure the benefits outweigh the risks.""We don't want to bring toxicity to patients,"" he said. ""But we know one thing for sure: The cancer will kill the patient. We want to be sure we're bringing the benefit and that the Opdivo plus Yervoy combination will bring that benefit.""Reilly expects future cancer treatment to focus on segments of patients who share a diagnosis and similar biomarkers. In the distant future, treatment combinations could potentially be tailored to specific patients based on their body's chemical makeup, said Merck's Dr. Roy Barnes.Barnes is the senior vice president of global clinical development for Merck Research Laboratories. Like Reilly, he won't call I-O a cure for cancer. But he notes impressive results from patients who've been on Yervoy, one of the first approvals, for years without progressing.""A lot of patients have started coming off of the drugs after three or four years,"" he said. ""When they come off, there have been very few relapses. It's early days, but it's quite encouraging.""RELATED:Merck Keytruda Sales Lag Without $40 Million In Deferred Revenue: AnalystBristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O CompetitionCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?

69,LEG,"The double-bottom base is one of the basic chart patterns among huge stock market winners in the CAN SLIM catalog, alongside the venerable cup with handle.If a good double bottom is identified during a bull market, a strong breakout in big volume by the stock can lead to handsome gains in a stock.The double bottom is shaped like the letter W. An important distinction is that the second leg down should undercut the first.IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil, who developed the chart-reading strategy over the past six decades, says the undercut of the second leg — even by just a penny — is a necessary shakeout, as a final purge of weak holders, before the stock can advance. In that respect, it serves a similar use to the handle in a cup-with-handle base.A second leg that doesn't undercut the first down leg is failure prone, O'Neil says. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the middle peak.Many of the requirements for a double bottom are similar to those for a cup with handle. There should be a prior uptrend. The base should be a minimum of seven weeks. The correction should be moderate, usually 20% to 30% from high to low. Or a bit more if the market has had a severe correction.Double bottoms can have handles, but they aren't necessary for a sound base. Many stocks form double bottoms and shoot straight past the buy point into profitable territory. It's ideal to see the stock's volume pick up at least 40% to 50% above its 50-day average at the breakout.Nokia (NOK) formed a classic double bottom in late 1998. The general market began a severe and painful bear market in July of that year. But an Oct. 15 follow-through day kicked off one of history's great bull markets, led by tech stocks.Cellphones were just gaining in popularity, and Finland-based Nokia and Sweden-based Ericsson practically owned the space. Both made huge advances during the bull market.The Nasdaq carved out a double bottom of its own as a September recovery attempt failed, sending stocks to new lows. That helped Nokia form a double bottom.Nokia completed its first leg down during the week ended Sept. 4, 1998 (1). Notice that the stock finished higher and in the upper half of its weekly range. That's bullish. The second leg undercut the first on the week ended Oct. 9 (2).Nokia fell for the week, but again it finished in the upper half of its daily range. The careful chart reader could have spotted a pattern developing and put it on a watch list before it broke out.Nokia broke out during the week ended Oct. 23, rising 7.7% that week and sprinting past an 85.10 entry point (the chart above shows the entry adjusted for later stock splits). That big move helped make it one of the first big winners to emerge in the new bull market.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the March 21, 2016, edition of IBD.)RELATED:How To Win Big In Stocks: All About The Cup-With-Handle PatternHow To Master The Cup With Handle: Learn Why Some Handles Are Great, Others NoteHow To Time Your New Stock Buys: Why Various Patterns Show Distinct Entry Points

72,LEG,"In recent weeks, most breakouts have been from relatively short flat or cup base. That's reflects overall market action, with the Nasdaq composite retreating modestly from late July and the S&P 500 index from early August before rebounding since Aug. 21. But don't forget about double-bottom bases. Universal Display (OLED), which is riding the move by Apple (AAPL) and other smartphone makers into OLED screens, has this W-shaped bullish pattern. So does Ichor Holdings (ICHR), a recent chip-equipment IPO.XDouble-bottom bases must be at least seven weeks long, with the middle of the ""W"" lower than the left hand side. The second low of the base must be lower than the first leg, to shake out weak holders.Universal Display is a supplier of technology and materials for OLED displays and lighting. Organic light-emitting diode displays are starting to replace LCD screens in smartphones, TVs and other displays. They offer richer colors, lower power use and faster refresh times, while also being thinner and more flexible. Apple is expected to adopt OLED screens in the iPhone 8. Apple is set to unveil its latest handset at a Sept. 12 event.Universal Display is in a double-bottom base that started on June 9. The second leg of the W just undercuts the first leg. The buy point is at 127.88, 10 cents above the middle of the W, which is lower than the left side of the pattern. Universal Display crossed into a buy zone on both Thursday and Friday, but closed just below the entry point both days, ending the week at 126.95. The stock leapt 12% on Aug. 30, vaulting above its 50-day moving average, after Deutsche Bank initiated Universal Display  with a a buy rating and 135 price target.Universal Display has a 95 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 95% of all stocks on a variety of proprietary IBD ratings, including earnings. All-time winners tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or above near the start of their big share price moves.As for Apple, the iPhone giant is near the top of the 5% buy zone from a 156.75 flat-base entry.Ichor makes fluid- and gas-delivery subsystems for semiconductor capital equipment.The stock came public at 9 a share last December. Shares spiked to a record 29.73 on June 9, but reversed hard, closing at 24.73. That began a 40% correction, larger than most double bottom bases outside of bear markets, but recent IPOs can be more volatile. Ichor has rebounded from 17.76 on Aug. 10, retaking its 50-day moving average on Aug. 29 as part of a 16% weekly share price gain to 23.10.Ichor's buy point is 24.40.Ichor has delivered huge profit and sales growth, but expectations are lofty.Ichor has a 97 Composite Rating.Here's a look at a false double-bottom base: Alphabet (GOOGL).Google-parent Alphabet's chart could be described as a W-shaped pattern. But the second leg of Alphabet's W does not undercut the first leg. So Google's parent is classified as a cup base.In Alphabet's case, that doesn't have a big impact on the potential buy point. Google's cup base buy point is currently 1,008.71, but that's only 0.2% above the hypothetical buy point over the middle of the W. In any case, Alphabet's stock still has work to do, having only retaken its 50-day moving average last week.RELATED:Smart Chart Reading: How To Locate A Double-Bottom BaseBullish Chart Patterns: How To Find The Exact Buy PointDow's Hottest Stock, 2 FANGs Lead 5 Top Plays Near Buy PointsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksIPO Leaders

73,LEG,"As you watch your children board the school bus for the first day back to classes, consider this: If you don't live in one of the 28 states with a Right to Work law, chances are that school bus driver is forced to pay fees to a union as a condition of driving that bus. The teachers at the school the bus is heading toward likely face the same choice: Pay money to the union or be fired.Why? Because there are still 22 forced-unionism states in America, where a union official can legally have a worker fired for not paying union dues or fees.You are not alone if this coercive power offends you. Polls consistently show that 80% of Americans agree with the Right to Work principle: No worker should be forced to pay union fees as a condition of employment.Under Right to Work laws, enacted in the other 28 states, employees are still free to join a union if they choose and support that union with dues. The difference is the choice belongs to each worker individually, so they can decide if payment of union dues is a good use of their hard-earned money or if the money is better spent elsewhere.While today union officials oppose Right to Work protections for workers, one of their most important predecessors, Samuel Gompers — founder of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1886 — was a strong opponent of compulsory unionism. Gompers, who served as the longest-tenured president of the group that would later become the AFL-CIO wrote that: ""The workers of America adhere to voluntary institutions in preference to compulsory systems which are held to be not only impractical but a menace to their rights, welfare, and their liberty.""Instead of heeding Gompers' advice, today Big Labor is doing everything in its power to deny workers the choice provided by Right to Work. Union lawyers are currently attempting to overturn Right to Work laws in Idaho, Kentucky, West Virginia and Wisconsin with legal challenges. In Missouri, union officials have already begun pouring millions of dollars — much of it seized from workers who would be fired for refusing to pay — into an effort to overturn that state's recently-enacted Right to Work law through a ballot measure.Big Labor's desperation on the issue is a response to the recent spread of workplace freedom. In the past five years, six states have passed Right to Work laws, with Kentucky and Missouri joining the ranks earlier this year.Additionally, a case brought by National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation staff attorneys, challenging forced union dues as a violation of government employees' First Amendment rights, is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. A ruling freeing millions of teachers, police officers, firefighters and other government employees from mandatory union fees could come in the first half of 2018.The case for Right to Work has always centered on the freedom it provides workers, but there is also overwhelming evidence that freeing workers from forced dues gives Right to Work states an economic leg up.From 2005-2015, private-sector job growth was 15.4% in Right to Work states compared to just 10.4% in forced-unionism states, according to government statistics compiled by the National Institute for Labor Relations Research. The same research shows that once you adjust for the cost of living, workers in Right to Work states had on average $2,500 more to spend in disposable personal income than their forced-unionism counterparts.Given the facts, it is no surprise that a growing number of states are eager to cast off Big Labor's chokehold, free their workforce, and realize the economic opportunity that a Right to Work law would bring.Ultimately, though, because forced-dues powers are granted to union officials by federal law, the best solution for ending compulsory union dues is a National Right to Work Act. This one-page bill already introduced in Congress simply eliminates from federal law the authorizations for forced union dues, leaving workers covered by federal labor laws free to choose for themselves whether or not to join and pay dues to a labor organization.So as you enjoy Labor Day weekend, remember that when it concludes millions of Americans will return to work where they face a choice: Pay a portion of their paychecks to a union they may not support or lose their jobs.Honoring America's hardworking men and women must mean respecting workers to make their own choice about whether or not to send their money to a labor union, so let's work to make this the final Labor Day during which Americans labor under compulsory unionism.

74,LEG,"The Pentagon has picked Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) to advance to the next stage of a competition for new nuclear-armed cruise missiles that could be launched from bombers like Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21.XThe Long Range Standoff (LRSO) weapon will replace aging AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missiles made by Boeing (BA). Those missiles were initially fielded in the early 1980s.The LRSO is meant to hit targets from long ranges without putting bombers at risk of getting shot down. But critics have charged that the Pentagon doesn't need the LRSO as the B-21 is supposed to be stealthy enough to elude enemy air defenses.Lockheed and Raytheon each received $900 million contracts to develop the technologies for the LRSO and demonstrate the new weapon's reliability, the Air Force announced late Monday. The service will then pick one company to manufacture the LRSO, whose cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.The Air Force plans to start fielding the next-generation nuclear cruise missile in the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the B-21 is expected to enter service in 2025.""This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement about the LRSO. ""Deterrence works if our adversaries know that we can hold at risk things they value. This weapon will enhance our ability to do so, and we must modernize it cost-effectively.""Shares of Lockheed were flat on the stock market today, but still above buy range.

Leaderboard is having its best month of the year and the YTD distance is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500.Earlier this week, the Pentagon awarded Boeing and Northrop with similar early-stage development contract for new nuclear ballistic missiles to replace Boeing-made Minuteman IIIs.The Pentagon will then award a single, final contract for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent in late fiscal 2020, with deployment seen in the late 2020s. That contract will be worth up to $85 billion, according to the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. However, the Air Force has put the number around $62 billion.Those contracts will build on earlier deals to upgrade strategic bombers and submarines.In 2015, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Development and procurement costs are expected run as much as $80 billion.The Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class nuclear missile submarines.

76,LEG,"Incyte (INCY) could pull in $4.8 billion in 2026 peak sales on its Merck (MRK) partnership alone, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter said Friday — and that's without noting collaborations with AstraZeneca (AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY).But those collaborations with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche don't target the substantial non-small cell lung cancer market, an opportunity that Richter pegs at $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales. And whether Incyte goes that route will likely depend on whether Merck pushes for exclusivity, she says.Richter boosted her price target Friday on Incyte stock to 149 from 116, and kept her buy rating. In the stock market today, Incyte stock rose 0.9% to 121.72. Shares are up 21% for the year but are now extended from a 110.05 buy point out of a flat base first touched on Jan. 9.Incyte's epacadostat is an immune-oncology, or I-O, drug, as are Keytruda from Merck, Opdivo and Yervoy from Bristol-Myers, Tecentriq from Roche and durvalumab from AstraZeneca. These therapies target PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and IDO molecules, which act as ""brakes"" on the immune system, providing a negative signal to T cells.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte has a slew of potential blockbusters, and not all in the immune-oncology sector. Dive into The New America for a deeper analysis for more ""Incyte"" into those potential markets.Tumor cells apply the brakes to prevent their destruction by the immune system, Richter explained. I-O drugs remove the brake, allowing T cells to attack the tumor. Combinations of I-O drugs are thought to be more potent than combining I-O with chemo (though Merck is testing that too).""Based on encouraging early data from epacadostat in combinations with Keytruda, we view Incyte's IDO (inhibitor) as one of the leading 'add-ons' to PD-1/PD-L1,"" she wrote in a research report.Merck and Bristol-Myers are often seen as going head-to-head in the I-O space as their Keytruda and Opdivo both target PD-1 and are approved as monotherapies for melanoma, advanced lung cancer, and head and neck cancer. Both firms are also working on combos.This month, though, Merck announced an expanded collaboration with Incyte to test Keytruda and epacadostat in a total of five tumor types: first-line melanoma, advanced lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer and bladder cancer.Incyte's epacadostat is safe as a monotherapy, but only 29% of advanced melanoma patients in an earlier phase 1 trial could achieve a stable disease. In an earlier combo of epacadostat and Yervoy, 31% of patients hit an overall response rate. But toxicity also rose in the liver.""In our view, this result highlights the potential for I-O/I-O synergies with IDO, with a continued focus on finding the most effective I-O doublets as second generation immunotherapies continue to emerge,"" Richter said.She sees Incyte hitting $2.7 billion in 2026 peak sales in the NSCLC market alone. But that estimate could be conservative. Incyte could also team up with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in NSCLC, pending the details of exclusivity with Merck.Outside its partnership with Merck, Incyte is already testing epacadostat with AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers and Roche in treating other types of cancer.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth paragraph to correctly identify the Roche and AstraZeneca drugs.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Topples On 2017 Guidance Cut Amid Merck I-O RivalryCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Biotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On These 4 Key Sectors In 2017

77,LEG,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock toppled early Thursday after the biotech reported mixed Q4 earnings and lowered its 2017 earnings guidance by 15 cents, leaving analysts to question whether Merck (MRK) will win the ongoing I-O rivalry.In the stock market today, Bristol-Myers stock tumbled 5.5% to 46.82 and touched its lowest price since September 2013. Bristol shares are down 20% this year. Merck stock, on the other hand, rose a fraction, to 61.20, and is up 4% in 2017.For Q4, Bristol-Myers reported $5.2 billion in sales, up 22% year over year, and topping analysts' views for $5.1 billion. But its 63 cents earnings per share ex items, though up 66%, missed the 67 cents analysts had modeled. Sales of immuno-oncology drug Opdivo grew to $835 million.The company wrapped up 2016 with $19.4 billion in sales and $2.83 EPS ex items, up a respective 17% and 41%. Opdivo brought in $1.31 billion, topping views for $1.16 billion, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum said.IBD'S TAKE: While Bristol-Myers offered mixed guidance, analysts expect Incyte to outperform the industry on its potential blockbusters. Get more ""Incyte"" on The New America.U.S. Opdivo sales rose 74% in 2016 to $715 million. That disappointed, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research report. The beat on Opdivo was mostly due to outside-U.S. sales, Schoenebaum said in his report.Bristol-Myers also adjusted its full-year EPS minus items guidance downward by 15 cents to $2.70-$2.90 from $2.85-$3.05. The high end of the new guidance missed analysts' expectations for $2.96. Worldwide sales are expected to increase by low-single digits. Analysts had viewed 2.9% growth.Schoenebaum suggested the EPS guidance cut could be due to increasing competition in second-line non-small cell lung cancer, continued rivalry with Merck in first-line NSCLC, Bristol's decision against seeking accelerated approval for an I-O combo and/or exchange rate issues.Whatever the reason, Schoenebaum questioned ""can Bristol-Myers news get worse from here?""This month, Bristol decided against seeking accelerated approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combo in first-lung non-small cell lung cancer — an I-O cocktail most analysts suggest could be more potent than Merck's Keytruda plus chemo combo. But the latter already has accelerated approval.Still, ""our NPV (net present value) analysis indicates that even with zero first-line lung cancer sales (which is an unreasonable assumption), this stock is worth something like $40,"" Schoenebaum wrote in a research report.Leerink's Fernandez, though, still sees major value in Bristol-Myers despite the temporary missteps.""Opdivo, Yervoy, and the burgeoning I-O pipeline at Bristol is a high-value industry asset that cannot be ignored,"" he said. ""If history teaches us anything in pharma, it is that companies suffering from short-term missteps or surprises but with great assets are more likely than not to become vulnerable M&A targets over time if there isn't either a reversal of fortune or a series of value-added pipeline surprises.""RELATED:Could Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalties Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Bristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda RoyaltiesFDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: Leerink

79,LEG,"Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq is modestly trailing Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and continues to chip away at Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) share of the second-line lung cancer market, Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said Tuesday.Overall, immuno-oncology drugs have swiped 30% of the total lung cancer market, up from the high 20% range seen in previous quarters, Meacham said in a research report. I-O drugs are most popular in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, with 60% and 60%-70% shares, respectively.Bristol-Myers, though, is struggling in the second-line NSCLC setting, Meacham says. In Q4, Opdivo saw its high 40% share of the market fall as Tecentriq gained by mid-single digits sequentially. Tecentriq is now modestly trailing Keytruda, he says.Investors are seemingly disappointed that Bristol-Myers isn't seeking accelerated approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combination in first-line NSCLC. I-O combos are widely suspected to be more potent than combining I-O plus chemo. Merck is testing the latter with Keytruda plus Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta.Keytruda already is approved as a monotherapy in first-line NSCLS for patients with a high expression of the PD-L1 gene, metastatic melanoma, and head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma. The Food and Drug Administration recently granted priority review to its I-O/chemo combination.IBD'S TAKE: Merck, Biogen and Eli Lilly tied in 2016 for two drug approvals apiece, leading the broader biotech industry. Who trailed? Get more on IBD's Industry Themes.The combo could open Merck up to a broader patient population. Only 25%-30% of patients fall into the category of having a high expression of the PD-L1 gene. But half of patients are being tested, Meacham says. Four in 10 have the gene, regardless of expression.Chemotherapy is dominant in first-line NSCLC, where it has an 80% share to Keytruda's 11%. Still, momentum looks good in 2017 for Keytruda, Meacham said. But sentiment is more negative on Bristol-Myers following its decision against the accelerated regulatory route for Opdivo plus Yervoy.""For Bristol, the recent decision not to pursue an accelerated first-line pathway has little impact on our near-term estimates, but increasingly negative sentiment makes the premium to the group harder to sustain absent convincing pivotal data,"" he wrote in a research report.Meacham trimmed his price target on Bristol-Myers stock to 58 from 65. His rating on the overall biotech industry is positive.Bristol-Myers stock fell 2.1% to 48.96 on Tuesday, coming within a penny of a more than two-year low. Merck fell 1% to 61.21.RELATED:FDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Bristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda Royalties

80,LEG,"The Federal Reserve did just what Wall Street wanted and expected on Wednesday: It kept its key interest rate steady and decided to wait at least a couple of months before starting to scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. It's a signal from policymakers that they aren't overly concerned about equity prices even as the major averages hit fresh all-time highs.XFed policymakers had already signaled that they wouldn't hike the overnight lending rate for the third time this year as they wait for a clearer picture on the inflation outlook. The only real question was whether the Fed would announce a change in reinvestment policy — letting its asset portfolio gradually run off as mortgage and Treasury bonds mature — or would wait until the September 19-20 meeting. The Fed's statement that the change would happen ""relatively soon"" essentially locked in September.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 index and Dow Jones industrial average all hit record highs Wednesday morning but then backed off. The S&P 500 index, essentially flat heading into the Fed announcement, closed that way. The Nasdaq climbed nearly 0.2%. The Dow industrials led with a 0.45% gain, but Boeing (BA) accounted for all of that advance and more.On the margins, a quicker implementation of the reinvestment shift would likely be positive for bank stocks like Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS), Citigroup (C) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which until the past few days had mostly been sidelined in the latest phase of the stock market rally amid dovish signals from the Fed.After the Fed announcement, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America slightly extended losses, all closing about 1%. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are still in buy range from recent breakouts. BofA was modestly below a cup-with-handle buy point at 25.22. Citigroup, which offered upbeat guidance on Tuesday, climbed back near its recent seven-year high.IBD'S TAKE: Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the top-rated companies in the Banks-Money Center and Banks-Super Regional industry groups based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance.Shifting reinvestment policy this month would have sent some not-so-welcome signals to investors. One signal would have been that Fed committee members may be getting a bit nervous about equity and other asset values. It also would underscored that the hawks aren't convinced by the recent muted inflation data and want to maintain flexibility to raise rates again before December, when market pricing suggests the next hike will come.Conversely, holding off on the change until September suggests that policymakers aren't particularly concerned about equity valuations, even amid another leg upward for the stock market.A Bloomberg survey of Fed watchers gave just 13% odds of a reinvestment change on July 26, though most observers were expecting it to happen at the next meeting.Economists see a gradual move away from the Fed's current stance of reinvesting all principal from maturing bonds as likely to put upward pressure on long-term interest rates. Goldman Sachs figures the shift could raise the 10-year Treasury yield by 20 basis points over time. That would contribute to an upward sloping yield curve, a positive for banks' net interest margins.Recently, the dollar has dived to its lowest level in more than a year, partly on expectations of a more patient Fed. The weaker greenback is a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals such as Dow components Apple (AAPL), Boeing, Microsoft (MSFT) and Wal-Mart (WMT), helping to support the current rally. The dollar slid vs. other major currencies following the Fed statement, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell.Fed chief Janet Yellen's July 12 testimony to Congress, along with a speech by leading Fed dove Lael Brainard the prior day, helped spark the current stock rally. Yellen made clear that the softening in inflation since March had ""made it difficult to form a consensus view"" on near-term interest-rate policy, wrote Ward McCarthy, Jefferies chief financial economist.For now, Yellen will be content to watch the data for clearer evidence that inflation is on the rise because the Fed can begin scaling back its balance sheet in the interim. While the initial reductions will be quite modest, up to $10 billion per month, the Fed members have signaled that they want to have a window to implement the change while holding rates steady to avoid any market turbulence. Fed Gov. Brainard offered an even more dovish outlook for policy, insisting that rate hikes must pause, but allowing that a reinvestment shift was warranted.The Fed's policy announcement comes a day after President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he could reappoint Yellen to another term as Fed chief, but that he's also considering economic adviser Gary Cohn.RELATED:Morgan Stanley Earnings, Trading Revenue Push Stock Into Buy ZoneFed Chief Yellen Won't Fight The Doves Yet; Stocks FlyDraghi Drama Undercuts Key Stock-Market Support

81,LEG,"When you receive a generous gift, it's usually in poor taste to ask for more. However, investors do it all the time.D.R. Horton (DHI) provided IBD's SwingTrader with a nice gift after it was added on July 7 (1). It was part of a bullish move among homebuilders while the market was trying to find its footing after the Nasdaq composite breached its 50-day moving average for just the second time this year.XThe day after being added amid a 3.8% gain, D.R. Horton had its price target raised by Argus Research lifting the stock to a 4.6% profit at its peak for the day (2). Profits were taken on the entire position at 4% rather than holding out for a 5% or even 10% profit goal. You might wonder, why sell so early? What about letting winners run and trying to get more out of the stock? Whatever happened to greed is good?Looking back on the history of D.R. Horton, a 7% move in the span of two days was unusually strong behavior, especially without an earnings report acting as a catalyst. We tend to take notice when a stock changes character. Also, while the market was improving — the Nasdaq just got back above its 50-day moving average line — there hadn't been much of a correction. That left the risk of the market taking another leg down. Booking a solid 4% profit seemed prudent rather than getting greedy and asking for more.That sell ended up being near a short-term top. After dropping slightly, the stock hit the 4% profit level again but then reversed more sharply (3). If it hadn't been sold earlier, this would have been the time to step out. After that, D.R. Horton remained positive from the entry on SwingTrader as it began hugging its 5-day moving average line. The closes didn't stray far from the line, but some of the intraday action would have been challenging and it eventually closed below the 10-day moving average line (4).It would be easy to justify holding the stock through all this. You never turned negative on the trade and it seemed that getting to the previous level or beyond wasn't far-fetched. However, that also meant that after nearly two weeks you were worse off than locking in the gain early. While there are plenty of examples where that kind of start can turn into a huge winner, having a sense of what the market will give you and the stock's normal behavior will help you get the most pleasure out of your gifts.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits: Knowing When To Say WhenProfit-Taking Rules Spur Action Over Hesitation In Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

83,LEG,"AutoZone (AZO) topped quarterly earnings views early Tuesday and delivered another solid same-store sales gain as the No. 1 U.S. auto parts retailer benefited from upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Reporting before the open, AutoZone earned $7.43 a share for its fiscal second quarter, which ended in February. That was up 14% from the prior year and comfortably above consensus analyst estimates for $7.28.Net sales rose 5% to $2.26 billion, matching views. Same-store sales climbed 3.6% from a year earlier after rising 3.5% during the first quarter.Gross profit as a percentage of sales widened to 52.7% from 52.2% the prior year, driven by higher merchandise margins.AutoZone shares closed up 2.1% on the stock market today.The company continues to benefit from strength in the auto parts industry’s do-it-yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics. That segment has gotten a leg up from several favorable trends -- including lower gasoline prices and an aging fleet of cars on the road -- and helped boost business at rivals such as O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY).“Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled (leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales) and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,” Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a recent report.More than 80% of AutoZone’s sales are to consumers rather than professional mechanics, he says, making it the “best positioned to take advantage of the relative strength in the DIY segment.""AutoZone also has gotten a lift from a new “mega hub” distribution strategy designed to improve inventory coverage through increased shipping frequency from its distribution centers to its retail stores.The company continues to roll out the strategy to more stores. About 1,300 of its 5,200 U.S. stores were serviced by the new strategy at the end of Q2, with about 2,000 stores expected to be serviced by the end of the fiscal year.“Our results to date continue to meet or exceed our expectations, further confirming our new inventory deployment strategy,” AutoZone CEO Bill Rhodes said in a statement. “While we continue to strategically invest in our business in order to support our growth, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to growing operating earnings and utilizing our capital effectively.”While AutoZone and O’Reilly continue to pump out robust revenue and earnings growth, other auto parts retailers have seen a recent slowdown in business.Advance Auto Parts (AAP) reported lower sales and earnings during its 2015 fourth quarter -- the first time in more than three years that both metrics dipped during a single quarter.Meanwhile, Genuine Parts (GPC) has logged three straight quarters of flat earnings and two straight quarters of lower revenue.

84,LEG,"MADISON, Wis. -- The Super Tuesday primaries underscore how super Southern our presidential nominating process has become. This makes our way of picking standard-bearers unrepresentative of the country as a whole.In particular, it sharply reduces the influence of the great American Midwest even though the region's states are among the most important general-election battlegrounds.Southernization is a special problem for Republicans because their Southern supporters tend to be far more socially conservative than the rest of the party or the country. Southern politics is also more deeply polarized around race, giving backlash candidates a leg up.The GOP's slide rightward creates electoral difficulties for it in presidential elections and is the central factor in Washington's inability to find consensus on much of anything.True, the whole carnival starts in Iowa, which is as Midwestern as you can get. But the caucus system gives more conservative Iowa Republicans an out-sized influence because white evangelicals play a disproportionate role in what is a relatively low-turnout contest.It is to the evangelicals' credit as democratic citizens that they organize, mobilize and participate. But their civic virtuousness only makes the final result less reflective of opinion in the party, in Iowa itself and elsewhere.New Hampshire comes next, and its voters frequently reach verdicts at odds with those Iowa renders. This means South Carolina often plays a tie-breaking role on the GOP side. Talk about shifting the dialogue right: The site of the opening skirmish of the Civil War is not only one of the most conservative states in the nation; it is also one of our most racially divided polities.All of 1% of this year's Palmetto State Republican primary voters were African-American, according to the network exit poll -- yes, 1%. Some 96% were white.The matter of diversity is why the Southernized process is less problematic for Democrats. Having the South vote early gives the party’s large and loyal African-American constituency a significant role in choosing a nominee.In Hillary Clinton’s sweep of Saturday's South Carolina primary, black voters cast about 60% of the ballots and gave her a margin of roughly 6-to-1 over Bernie Sanders, according to exit polls reported by ABC.Pushing Nevada's voting dates up has diversified the calendar a bit, but now we confront Super Tuesday. It includes primaries in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.Yes, this Southern-fried, hickory-smoked mix is leavened by primaries in Massachusetts and Vermont, caucuses in Colorado and Minnesota, and, on the Republican side, a ""preference poll"" in Alaska. But there's a reason why the day is often called the ""SEC primary,"" after the Southeastern college sports conference.Not until March 8 does a big Midwestern state (Michigan) vote, and not until March 15 do Illinois and Ohio weigh in. Wisconsin doesn't hold its primary until April 5, and Indiana will not be casting its ballots until May 3.The Dixiefied calendar is now an issue in Republican presidential maneuvering, with the possibility that the Midwest would be further disenfranchised. Republican honchos may have presided over a party that ""brought to life"" and ""fed"" the ""Frankenstein monster"" they see in Donald Trump.Never mind. The feckless establishmentarians now have the temerity to tell Ohio Gov. John Kasich that he should do his part in their belated anti-Trump operation by dropping out in support of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- even though Rubio has yet to win a single primary.Kasich is saying no dice, and he is wholly right to insist that his own base be heard from before he calls it a day. There's a strong case that Kasich is far better prepared to be president than Rubio is, and that Kasich's tonally (and, to some degree, substantively) more moderate brand of conservatism has more appeal outside Republican ranks than Rubio's narrow conservative orthodoxy.In any event, it's clear that if the GOP's powers-that-be forced Kasich out before Michigan and Ohio voted, they would be confirming for all to see that their party only has room for Southerners (Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz) or, in the case of Trump, Northerners who speak the Republican South's language on immigration, race and nationalism.High-minded thinkers regularly bemoan the sharp polarization of American politics and wring hands earnestly over why this has come to pass. One of the principal causes is the Southernization of Abraham Lincoln's party, and our primary process only makes it harder for those who would reverse the trend.

85,LEG,"Facebook (FB) revealed Wednesday that it has more than 200,000 advertisers on Instagram, its video- and photo-sharing site, which began testing ads three years ago.Analysts have kept a close watch on Instagram as a key revenue growth leg for the social media leader, with estimates that revenue from the site could hit $1 billion this year, or about 10% of Facebook’s total.Facebook has been cautious but methodical in rolling out ads on Instagram, as the company says its priority is user experience over revenue. But Facebook has also continued to work with large advertisers and ad agencies. In September, Facebook announced it was boosting efforts to cash in on Instagram with an aggressive expansion of advertising and better analytics and measurement guidelines. It only began introducing video ads on Instagram in Q3 2015.Instagram now has more than 400 million users, up from 300 million last December. Facebook paid about $1 billion to acquire Instagram in 2012.Facebook has about 2.5 million advertisers overall, of which 75% are outside the U.S.Early this month, Facebook announced that it had doubled the length of video ads on Instagram to 60 seconds. Facebook derives more than 96% of total revenue from advertising, with video ads deriving a premium price.Facebook competes with Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Twitter (TWTR) and others to attract more advertisers.Facebook is also expected to introduce ads on its messaging platforms, WhatsApp and Messenger, down the road. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in the company's Q4 earnings call late last month, suggested that ads on WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, which now has 800 million users, are in the works.Image provided by Shutterstock.

86,LEG,"Despite her win in the Nevada caucuses Saturday, Hillary Clinton's lead among Democrats over Bernie Sanders has evaporated nationally, 45% to 43%, according to the latest IBD/TIPP poll. Last month, Clinton topped Sanders 50% to 38%.On the GOP side, Donald Trump held steady at 31%. Ted Cruz dropped a point to 20%. Marco Rubio, however, saw his support climb eight percentage points to reach 18% -- a clear sign that much of the support of candidates dropping out the race have been gravitating to Rubio.Meanwhile, Ben Carson has 8% and John Kasich has risen to 7%. Both are resisting pressure to step aside.Trump's lead, however, narrows considerably when first and second choices are combined. While 42% picked Trump as either their first or second choice, Cruz and Rubio were tied at 39%.An analysis of the 12 states that vote for GOP candidates on Super Tuesday shows that Trump holds a similar lead, with 31% support. However, Rubio moves into second place at 23%, followed by Cruz at 20%.Given Trump's definitive win in Nevada on Tuesday, a string of victories on March 1 could give him a virtually insurmountable lead for the GOP nomination.Clinton performs better in the Democrats' Super Tuesday states, where she leads Sanders by 50% to 39%.The states with primaries or caucuses for both parties on March 1 are: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia. In addition, Alaska's GOP will hold caucuses that day. Also, Democrats hold their South Carolina primary this Saturday.The IBD/TIPP poll included 334 registered and leaning Democrats, and 400 registered and leaning Republicans, resulting in margins of error of +/- 5.5 percentage points and +/- 5.0 percentage points, respectively. The margin of error for the Super Tuesday results are larger because of the smaller sample sizes.While Trump has been winning GOP votes, he has so far failed to close the deal with the public at large on his key issue -- immigration.In fact, the poll found that the public opposes building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, 53% to 44% -- with just 28% indicating that they strongly support the idea.While opposition to a wall is highest among Democrats -- 82% of whom oppose it -- more than half (51%) of independents don't support Trump on this, and a quarter of Republicans are against the idea.Trump's proposal to end automatic citizenship for children born in the U.S. to illegal immigrants fares even worse, with 58% -- including 47% of Republicans -- opposed to the idea.Support for mandatory deportation of illegals -- the other leg of Trump's immigration policy -- is split, with 48% supporting and 49% against the idea.• 51% say the economy is not improving, which is up from 49% last month.• However, the share of ""job sensitive"" households -- those where someone is either unemployed or worried about losing their jobs -- dropped from 33% last month to 30% in the latest survey.• President Obama's job approval rating stands at 46%, which is down three points from last month.• Meanwhile, 45% have a favorable view of Obama's leadership, which is also down three points from last month.• Just 41% approve of the way Obama has been handling the economy, down two points from last month.* * *The IBD/TIPP Poll was conducted Feb. 19-24, surveying 900 Americans, giving it an overall margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points. The poll was taken by live interviewers using both land and cell phones. For the party rankings, the poll included 400 registered Republicans or those who lean Republican, with a margin of error for the GOP results of +/- 5.0 percentage points. There were 334 Democrats or Democratic leaners surveyed, with a margin of error of +/- 5.5 percentage points. The IBD/TIPP Poll has a proven track record for accuracy, based on its performance in the past three presidential elections. In a comparison of the final results of various pollsters for the 2004 and 2008 elections, IBD/TIPP was the most accurate. And the New York Times concluded that IBD/TIPP was the most accurate among 23 polls over the three weeks leading up to the 2012 election. To see a detailed explanation of the methodology and the complete poll results, click here.

87,LEG,"Cara Therapeutics (CARA) stock popped Wednesday after the biotech unveiled strong data from a Phase 1 drug trial for chronic kidney disease patients — giving its shares a leg up for the second day running.XCara shares have been volatile over the past month. Cara was the de facto leader of a late-June spike in the biotech market. The stock rocketed 52% in just six trading days, but lost it all on the last day of the month amid a mixed trial in hip and knee pain.On Wednesday, it looked like Cara stock could be poised for another run.Cara stock climbed 7% to 13.44 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 14% intraday. Also on the rise, Calithera Biosciences (CALA) and Flexion Therapeutics (FLXN) stocks jumped 11.1% and 8.8%, respectively.Before the open Wednesday, Cara said its drug known as CR845 proved to be a safe oral drug for chronic kidney disease patients who experience itching as a result of hemodialysis.IBD'S TAKE: Cara stock hit several new highs in June, only to lose it all on a mixed trial in hip and knee pain. But one Leerink analyst says the biotech rally could regain some speed on the upcoming earnings season. How much? Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich called the announcement ""an incremental step forward."" Cara is also testing CR845 as an intravenous drug to treat the same disorder. That program is further along, with recently revealed Phase 2/3 data and a breakthrough designation.""Oral administration of CR845 has the potential to significantly expand the addressable market for CR845 beyond dialysis patients, which is the target market of the IV formulation,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In the trial, oral CR845 was generally well-tolerated when administered daily or after dialysis three times per week at four tablet strengths. Trbovich sees the oral version of the drug expanding Cara's market to 3.5 million to 4.5 million chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis.Beyond kidney disease, Cara is working on oral CR845 in hip and knee pain. But Cara stock lost nearly 40% of its value on June 30 after the results of a study showed a benefit on hip pain, but didn't reflect the same benefit in knee pain.Trbovich has a neutral rating on Cara stock.RELATED:Biotech Rally Gets Second Wind As This Small Cap Nears Break OutBiotech Plunges 40% On Mixed Trial — Is There A Silver Lining?Is This Small Biotech Headed For $1 Billion Market Cap — Or A Pitfall?

On Wednesday, chip stocks fueled the Nasdaq composite's 0.7% rally, on strong industry growth figures. But shares of Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip suppliers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) are all still below key support levels after significant sell-offs.XNasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value, while S&P 500 futures sank 0.4%. Dow futures were off 0.25%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4% and China's Shanghai composite rose 0.2%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE fell 0.7%, Germany's Dax 0.8% and France's CAC-40 1%.Apple shares themselves aren't acting that badly. The iPhone maker tumbled with other leading techs on June 9, then fell through its 50-day moving average on June 10. But since then the stock has moved sideways. Technically, Apple is in a flat base with a potential 156.75 buy point, though it needs to get above its 50-day line before investors should pay close attention.Apple's influence on the market is hard to overstate. Not only is the world's most valuable company by market cap and a member of the three major indexes, but its business strongly influences a raft of other companies, notably iPhone chip suppliers. Those chip stocks have been showing technical weakness, which one up session can't repair. Let's take a look at Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo.Broadcom is one of the better-looking iPhone chip stocks. Shares began pulling back with other techs on June 9, but held above its 50-day moving average until finally losing that support last week. On Monday, shares fell intraday to 229.08, almost roundtripping a near-13% gain from a 227.85 buy point cleared in early May.Texas Instruments tumbled hard on June 9, losing a buy point. That started a test of the 50-day over several sessions, with shares closing below that level for good on June 20. Since then shares have continued to trend lower. On Wednesday, TI rose 0.85% after finding some support at the 200-day line.Analog Devices' woes started a little earlier that most techs. Analog Devices broke out on May 30, closing just above the 84.34 buy point. The next morning Analog Devices skyrocketed intraday to 90.49, but closed up only 1.1% at 85.76. On June 1, shares tumbled below the entry area, followed by undercutting the 50-day line two sessions later. Analog traded above and below the 50-day for several weeks before starting a new leg down on June 27. Shares rose 2.1% on Wednesday, trading between the 50-day and 200-day lines.Skyworks was well extended from any buy zone on June 9, nearly hitting an all-time high, when shares quickly reversed. Skyworks closed below its 50-day line for good on June 23, then kept heading lower. Skyworks rose 2.3% on Wednesday, but is still more than 5% below its 50-day.Qorvo is trying to find support at its 200-day line after a sharp June sell-off that took the chip stock below its 50-day line and a buy point. Shares rose 3.1% on Wednesday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why The Sloppy Second-Half Start For StocksChip Stocks Jump As Industry Sees Strongest Growth In 7 YearsApple iPhone Demand Soft, But That's OK, Analyst ContendsQ2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

92,LEG,"in the realm of smart chart reading, handles commonly latch on to cup bases. They can also be found on double bottoms or saucer bases. Either way, they offer investors a prime buy point within a well-formed base.Why do handles matter? They visually represent the last transfer of shares from long-suffering holders eager to exit a stock to the sturdier hands of professionals with conviction. A handle marks the final mild shakeout before a stock prepares an outstanding breakout, a run of new highs, and the potential for dedicated growth investors to increase their wealth.But before deciding to buy a stock that is breaking out, make sure you spend enough time to recognize the good handles from the bad ones.Please use this handy-dandy check list to help you spot the flaws and avoid potential stock-market traps.The upward-wedging handle. A handle is simply a mild quantified pullback. It should drift lower along the price lows of the handle, setting up the next potential leg up. The lows in a wedging handle, however, angle upward — a flaw because it doesn't show a shakeout of the last remaining weak holders. Wedging handles tend to form on third- or fourth-stage bases.The short handle. Handles need to be at least five days in length. Anything less is too short. Some take weeks or longer to form. Blood donation handling systems firm Haemonetics (HAE) cleared a 61.17 buy point from a four-day handle on Feb. 2, 2009. But after a big breakout day, the stock quickly fizzled.The low handle. A handle should form in the upper half of the stock's base. It's also generally best if it begins forming no more than 15% off the high of the pattern.Use the midpoint test. This simple calculation is performed to see if the handle has formed in the upper half. First, add the high and low of the base, then divide by 2. That gives you the midpoint of the base. Then calculate the midpoint of the handle. The latter should be greater than the first. The formation of a low handle tells you the stock hasn't been strong enough to recover the bulk of its prior losses.The deep handle. Generally, a handle should correct no more than 8% to 12% during a normal up cycle in the market. When stocks are nearing the bottom of a bear-market-type decline, handles can correct 20% to 30% and the breakout can still be OK — so as long as the market soon stages a follow-through signal and the stock is top-notch in fundamentals, technical strength, and institutional sponsorship. In essence, such a stock should have all the characteristics of a true CAN SLIM growth name.Ctrip.com International (CTRP) cleared a 63.10 buy point from a deep handle on May 1, 2008. The stock's handle corrected 23% while the market was in a confirmed rally. Ctrip imploded after gaining 12%.High volume in handle. It's best to see a handle formed mostly in below-average volume. Yes, you can allow a day or two of heavy volume within the handle; such a shakeout in fact can be healthy. Yet overall the pullback should show only a few remaining uncommitted investors quietly taking money off the table, not institutions dumping stock.Back in January 1991, software giant Microsoft (MSFT) bolted out from a cup-with-handle base. The stock's handle was four weeks in length. All weeks occurred in very low volume, suggesting that professionals were holding on to their shares.Microsoft more than doubled in 12 months and went on to become one of the greatest stocks in the 1990s.It's possible for a stock to show more than one flaw within its handle. Even if the company has proved itself a winner, keep in mind that the current base gives the most important clues to whether or not a future breakout will have a good chance of success.Trina Solar (TSL) debuted on the NYSE at 9.30 on Dec. 19, 2006, and surged above 18 by late February the next year. The company makes photovoltaic cells for solar power equipment.Solar stocks have proved to be volatile, and Trina was no exception. After hitting a peak of 68.90 in April 2007, shares corrected 44% in less than eight weeks.Buyers rolled in, and the stock quickly formed a cup without handle.

94,LEG,"Shares of New Oriental Education (EDU) climbed early Tuesday after posting a solid second-quarter revenue beat and per-share profit that was in line with estimates.The China-based private education services heavyweight posted adjusted earnings of 8 cents per American depositary share on a 23% revenue bump to $341.2 million, well above forecasts for $329.4 million.Total student enrollment grew 56% to about 1.312 million in the second quarter, the company said.New Oriental stock gained 2.8% to close at 50.11 on the stock market today.New Oriental is China's largest private education company, offering K-12 subject tutoring and test-prep classes, and has recently come under fire for reportedly trying to give some of its students an unfair leg up when it comes to college-prep SAT exams.The company's quarterly results are the first to be disclosed in the wake of a Reuters investigation from late December that found New Oriental has ""regularly provided items from the (SAT) tests to clients shortly after the exams are administered."" The investigation found that practice could give New Oriental students an unfair advantage when it comes to taking the tests, since SAT exam material is frequently recycled.Earlier in December, a separate Reuters story reported current and former New Oriental employees accused the company of helping students engage in college application fraud. The Dec. 2 story prompted shares to tank 14.3% that day.IBD's TAKE: New Oriental isn't the only stock getting a lift Tuesday. Luxottica Group (LUX) and Reynolds American (RAI) are up on M&A moves. New Oriental, in a statement to Reuters, condemned ""illegal and illegitimate business practices,"" and said it would review the issue and discipline anyone in violation of its policies and procedures.Management did not comment on the issue in its earnings release.For the third quarter, the company expects $408.7 million to $421.8 million in revenue, with the midpoint just above current analyst estimates of $414.5 million.Peer TAL Education (TAL) inched up 2 cents to 75.68. Tal Education has formed a handle with a 77.87 buy point in a consolidation going back to late October.Tarena International (TEDU) rose 0.7% to 15.45, right on its 50-day moving average. The thinly traded Tarena has found resistance at the 50-day line for the past month.RELATED: Stock Futures Drag; Merger News Lift Reynolds, LuxxoticaIs China Entering A Golden Age Of Education?

95,LEG,"Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) received a couple of bullish reports Wednesday, a week before of its fourth-quarter earnings report.JPMorgan added Netflix to its U.S. Focus List and William Blair added Netflix to its Better Values List.JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated his overweight rating on Netflix stock with a price target of 140. He said Netflix is his No. 2 large-cap internet stock pick for 2017 after Facebook (FB).Netflix stock rose 0.47% to 130.50 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 4, clearing a buy point of 129.39. It jumped nearly 2% on Thursday, but then reversed. For more information on Netflix stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Netflix had a rough 2016 because of increased subscriber churn related to a price increase, slower-than-expected international growth, heavy content spending and cash burn, and growing competition from Amazon.com (AMZN).""We believe Netflix sets up as a cleaner story into 2017 with pricing changes behind, revenue accretion from higher (average selling prices), stronger content, and increased global profitability,"" Anmuth said in a research report. ""Importantly, we think Netflix can add more U.S. and international subscribers in 2017 than 2016, on its way toward 60 million-plus U.S. subscribers and about 100 million international subscribers by 2020 — with material earnings power.""Netflix is scheduled to report Q4 earnings after the market close on Jan. 18.William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart maintained his outperform rating on Netflix stock with a base case valuation in the mid-140s. He added Netflix to the firm's Current Better Values List, which has an investment horizon of 24 months.""We believe that Netflix has a meaningful leg up on original programming within the over-the-top (OTT) streaming environment and suggest that these advantages might be underappreciated by investors,"" Schackart said in a report. ""Moreover, contrary to some, we believe OTT streaming still has plenty of room to grow both domestically and internationally, and Netflix is well positioned to benefit from this secular growth.""Schackart says Netflix will top the 100 million global subscriber milestone in 2017. He also is modeling for Netflix to show improved international profitability this year.Netflix is continuing to ramp up its original programming vs. licensed content. It expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original programming in 2017, up from 600 hours in 2016.On Sunday, Netflix's original series ""The Crown"" won a Golden Globe award for best TV series drama. Its star, Claire Foy, won a Golden Globe for best performance by actress in a TV series drama for her portrayal of a young Queen Elizabeth II.The next big original series for Netflix, ""A Series of Unfortunate Events,"" based on the popular children's book series, premieres Friday.Cowen analyst John Blackledge on Wednesday reiterated his outperform rating on Netflix stock and raised his price target to 155 from 150. He noted that investor sentiment has improved since the company reported third-quarter results in October.Meanwhile, Netflix bear Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, on Tuesday maintained his underperform rating on Netflix stock with a 12-month price target of 60.""We continue to believe that Netflix is overvalued,"" Pachter said in a report. ""Netflix continues to burn cash to fund its acquisition of original and exclusive content, while international profitability remains elusive and competition for both content and subscribers is becoming more fierce. Cash burn is accelerating, and we remain skeptical that the company's content library justifies its high level of spending.""RELATED:Will Netflix Keep Climbing?

99,LEG,"Making predictions about U.S. primary elections is ridiculous, especially in this volatile year and especially in snowy New Hampshire’s vote today.The large polling leads of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders seem unlikely to stand up in final results tonight. But the elderly men do appear prohibitive favorites. Oh, and Jim Gilmore is not going to win any state delegates there.You can, however, watch for other indicators, results which will sketch the evolving shape of the GOP race and set the stage and tone for the next leg of this presidential nominating endurance contest. That comes in South Carolina in 11 days. Then Nevada and Florida beyond.Do not look for Ted Cruz to win this week, as he did in Iowa eight days ago. He’s been slogging along in fourth place in the RealClearPolitics state poll average, behind Marco Rubio, John Kasich and barely ahead of Jeb Bush. No, seriously.New Hampshire voters contain barely a third the evangelical population of Iowa. And New Hampshirites are an ornery bunch. They like folks who pander and can put up with hanging around there a lot – think Kasich, Chris Christie and Bush, whose parents reside next door in Maine.New Hampshire Republican primary voters (remember, independents and disgusted Democrats can jump in there too) have rejected the GOP's Iowa winner every time for the past 20 years. They even discarded Barack Obama in 2008. In 2000, they spanked prohibitive favorite George W. Bush by 19 points in favor of John McCain, who endured months in their living rooms for that brief glow.You may have noticed the religiosity of political soundbites dissipate since Des Moines. Be thou patient. They’ll return heading into South Carolina.The Palmetto state is more welcoming for Cruz’ blunt brand of conservatism. And his people have been organizing throughout the Southeast since last summer, especially among energetic college students who aren't socialists.Be aware though. A desperate national media is capable of creating a nail-biting competition out of a retirement-home race of seniors with walkers. It craves black-and-white winners and losers, even if the numbers don't hold up. Recall how Rubio was an Iowa winner, while finishing third.So, much of recent media buzz has focused on Christie’s attacks on the post-Iowa emerging star during the first half of Saturday’s debate, the lowest-rated so far. Rubio recovered, but that doesn't fit the up-and-down narrative.Anything can happen in the minds of New Hampshire’s notoriously late-deciders. But tracking polls since show no dip for the GOP’s youngest candidate – and no boomlet for the New Jersey governor.Who in the unlikely case you’ve somehow missed his repetitive, robotic claims, was a federal prosecutor after 9/11, has fought a Democratic legislature in a Democratic state and intends to aggressively prosecute Hillary Clinton come fall.Every candidacy has such thunderclap days. Some devolve into lethal tailspins. Others take the hit and keep on ticking, which is what voters should want when hiring a commander-in-chief. Primaries are not just news events; they’re a long, long marathon of mid-term exams.Today’s mid-term exam, like Iowa’s caucuses, could produce more dropouts on the GOP side. Despite predictable vows of durability, it’s difficult, for instance, to imagine Christie or Kasich moving much farther without strong showings in the Granite state.Kasich’s softer brand of conservatism suits New Hampshire’s sizable crowd of moderates. A third-place finish in the mid-teens would be impressive. But then what? In 2012, Jon Huntsman was third behind Mitt Romney and Ron Paul with 17%. He vowed to move on. He didn’t.Carly Fiorina could also use a good showing. She was denied a............debate spot Saturday with its valuable state and national exposure; ABC even refused to sell her ad time. So, calling herself a fighter for the long-term as the only woman in the conservative competition, Fiorina bought an effective Super Bowl ad. Watch above.Watch too Trump’s outcome. He’s in a strangely difficult spot way ahead. He needs to demonstrate that his appeal can grow beyond the hardcore 25% of deaf GOP voters who hail his combative candor. A soft performance in vote totals would be the second straight time he’s under-performed both expectations and his own amazing boasts.Trump’s short-lived grace in defeat after Iowa could re-emerge with pouting and profanity gradually diminishing his future showings. Although Cruz trails Trump significantly in New Hampshire, Monday night Trump inexplicably elevated him to the election-eve news by labeling Cruz with a crude, five-letter word for part of the female anatomy.RELATED:

101,LEG,"Google's new smart speaker for the home might give Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo some tough competition, analysts say, but views are mixed on Google's new Pixel smartphones following Google's product announcements Tuesday.Verizon Communications (VZ) will sell Google's Pixel smartphone, which includes Qualcomm's (QCOM) Snapdragon 821 processor. Unlocked versions of the Pixel phones will be sold at Google's online store.The Pixel smartphones are at the high end of the market, with prices starting at $649.""This is another shooting star that is bound to fizzle,"" said Anil Doradla, a William Blair analyst who covers Apple, said in a research report Wednesday. ""We do not believe this move will have material implications for Apple, and to a large extent we view this product introduction as a nonevent.""""Google's Pixel handset is another science project,"" he added.Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Co., has a different take.""We believe Pixel is by far the strongest phone product introduced by Google, directly taking on Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7,"" he said in a report. ""While the product is priced at a similar level as its competitors with comparable tech specs give or take, we believe Google's advantage could come from the phone's 'brain' -- Google's artificial intelligence capability, its expertise in search and maps, and its broad suite of applications including YouTube and Google Cloud.""Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) stock slipped a fraction on the stock market today. Alphabet stock rose a fraction Tuesday after being flat most of the day during the webcast announcements.IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet shares jumped 3.3% on July 29 after Q2 earnings and revenue beat, but the stock has been trading between 783.50 and 819.06 since then. Google stock has lagged Amazon.com and Facebook in 2016. Amazon and Facebook are IBD Leaderboard stocks.Google Home, the new voice-activated speaker/smart assistant, also features Google Assistant. Google Home as expected was priced at $129, $50 less than Amazon's Echo. Google Home offers natural language speech, unlike Echo, which consumers may like.Brian Fitzgerald, an analyst at Jefferies, is upbeat on Google Home.""Based on the success of Amazon's Echo, we believe the Google Home product can add $500 million in revenue in 2017,"" Fitzgerald said. ""Although they are a late mover, we are optimistic toward Google's position within this space due to their superior software, price-point, and cross-device capabilities.

102,LEG,"Motor-home maker Winnebago Industries (WGO) moved aggressively into the travel trailer market Monday, announcing it would acquire privately held Grand Design Recreational Vehicle in a $500 million cash/stock deal.Winnebago shares responded with a 24% gap-up gain in huge volume. The stock has been climbing since February — just after Michael Happe stepped into the roles of president and chief executive on Jan. 18. At their high point on Monday, shares were less than 6% from the stock's record high set in December 2013. The three-year consolidation could be considered a saucer base with a 32.51 buy point. The stock also ended well above the midpoint of the base's left side decline. This puts in a proper range to potentially shape a handle.IBD'S TAKE: Among the various types of chart base patterns, the saucer shaped base generally takes longest to form. This makes it one of the more unusual aspects of the Can Slim investing strategy.  The Grand Design deal gives Winnebago a quick leg up on Thor Industries (THO), which has dominated the travel trailer market by consolidating leading brands including Airstream, Bison Coach, Dutchmen and Jayco, among others.Winnebago is projected to pull $964 million in revenue this year, according to analyst consensus. The company reported that Grand Design's revenue were $428 million in the 12 months through August. The deal is projected to lift Winnebago's travel trailer sales from 10% to 37% of total revenue, the company said in an analysts call.Travel trailers have been among the fastest-moving pieces of the recreational vehicle industry in recent years. Seen as lighter, less expensive and more fuel efficient and less costly to register and insure, travel trailer sales jumped 16% for the year through August, to more than 190,000 units according to the Recreational Industry Vehicle Association. Conventional motor home sales were up 5%, including a 2% slip in August, to more than 15,000 units.But there was a twist to those numbers, too, with van camper sales soaring 30% in August and mini- (type C) camper sales vaulted more than 50%.Winnebago is based in Forest City, Iowa. Thor and Grand Design are both Indiana-based companies.Robert W. Baird analyst Craig Kennison upgraded the stock to outperform and lifted the price target to 30, from 25. Kennison called Grand Design ""perhaps the fastest-growing towable manufacturer in North America,"" and wrote that Winnebago showed ""signs of a leadership-driven transformation"" under the leadership of Happe, who had spent 19 years with turf equipment brand Toro (TTC).Winnebago also lifted its fourth quarter revenue estimate by 5%, to $263.3 million — well above analyst projections. Management put EPS guidance at 49 cents, vs. the 45-cent consensus estimate.Thor shares rose 1% in weak trade Monday. The stock is trading near highs, extended after a mid-September rebound off its 10-week moving average. Thor climbed in 13 of the past 14 weeks, but has shown no valid bases with buy points.Patrick Industries (PATK), which builds components for recreational vehicles and manufactured homes, has shaped a nine-week consolidation with a 69.63 buy point.

103,LEG,"Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, likens her job to drinking from a fire hose of feeds and reports.The work involves intense reading and research, every day, for the benefit of investors in ETFs and mutual funds. The main data points that inform her thinking include leading market indicators, monetary policy indicators, investor sentiment surveys, market breadth data, and every variety of short- and long-term valuation metrics. To help her dig up all this data, she has one research assistant.Tough? Perhaps. But here are the words that Sonders uses to describe her work: Intriguing. Fascinating. Intricate.""I love the psychology of the markets,"" Sonders said recently, in a phone interview with IBD. That interest in the ""behavioral side of things"" may explain why she enjoys being on the road, almost every week of the year.She travels to speak to Schwab's clients and other investors, alongside which she participates in and produces written reports, audio and video recordings, conference calls and webcasts. Asked where in the financial landscape she finds inspiration along the way, Sonders replied: ""I find it when I'm talking to our investors.""Sonders is a fan of charts. They are a mainstay of the hundreds of talks she gives in a year. They reinforce her philosophy that capitalism is the best economic structure.The Connecticut resident's conscious effort to address audiences in a simple way was inspired by a mentor. She used to be a regular panelist and guest host on PBS's original ""Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser."" ""The best piece of advice he gave me was, 'Get people to understand what you are talking about,' "" Sonders said.She's had other informal mentors along the way, including legendary stock investor Marty Zweig (""a pioneer in so many things, he invented the put-call ratio, he coined 'Don't fight the Fed' "") and Charles Schwab, the man who in 1971 founded the eponymous brokerage and investment firm she now works for.Her own investing takes the passive indexing route, with a heavy bias toward ETFs. ""I put my money where my mouth is,"" said Sonders, who is also on the investment committee at Windhaven, a Schwab subsidiary that constructs ETF-based portfolios for typically high-net-worth clients. She describes her personal asset allocation as aggressive for her time horizon, but keeps tinkering with her 401(k) to a minimum.""I look at it on an annual basis, or if there is a major move in the markets,"" Sonders said. She may make a tactical move only in response to extreme conditions -- ramping up equities in 2009, for example.The only stock she owns is Charles Schwab (SCHW), part of her compensation. The macro view is her thing, not bottom-up stock picking.A winner of multiple industry awards, a particularly meaningful award is one from Kiplinger's. It came, she noted, in 2009, a pivotal year for the stock market. ""My feeling was the bottom was in,"" she said. ""I was vocal about that view and stuck to my conviction even when I took heat for it.""The citation for that award said in part that Sonders ""has proved herself an expert in divining which way the economic winds will blow. In the fall of 2006, for example, she warned Schwab clients about the housing-market bubble."" IBD'S TAKE: Leading investment management firms including Charles Schwab have consistently advised investors to stay at a normal, long-term strategic allocation as the bull market matures.In a Q&A with IBD, Sonders discussed everything from what is needed for the next leg up for stocks to the growth of Schwab's ETF investing business unit. The investment services firm has around $2.71 trillion in client assets.Here's what she said:IBD: What's unique about the current economic and market situation, and what's the same old thing?
"
104,LEG,"Liz Ann Sonders: What's unique is unprecedented monetary policy globally, including zero and negative rates and how significant a driver of equity market behavior it has been during this bull market relative to past cycles. What's the same, though, is how investor sentiment drives markets in the short term -- in a contrarian fashion. That said, although optimism rose with the market's trek to all-time highs in August, longer-term measures of sentiment show a still-skeptical investing public; i.e., the ""wall of worry"" is intact.IBD: What will it take for the stock market to snap out of its range and make a significant advance?
"
105,LEG,"Sonders: From the aforementioned standpoint of investor sentiment, it's unlikely it turns decidedly more pessimistic (which would be a healthy contrarian indicator) without a pickup in volatility or a deeper pullback. In the meantime, given stretched valuations, it's likely that earnings growth needs to stage a healthier rebound than consensus expectations to carry stocks significantly higher.IBD: How would you sum up your outlook for the economy and stock market?
"
106,LEG,"Sonders: The most likely scenario for the economy is continued muddle through, sluggish growth. Recession risk remains relatively low (albeit up recently) given that no excess has built-in the economy; i.e., inflation, monetary policy, capital spending, capacity utilization, etc. The secular bull market is likely intact, although in a more mature phase which will be marked with higher volatility and greater frequency of pullbacks. A bear market should be avoided unless it begins to sniff out a recession.IBD: How is the stock market likely to react to a Trump/Clinton victory, and how should investors react?
"
107,LEG,"Sonders: Based on stock market behavior to-date around the moving target of polls and perceptions, it appears the least unsettling outcome for stocks would be a Clinton win, with both houses of Congress remaining in Republican control. We are suggesting investors remain at their long-term strategic allocations and not monkey around with short-term trading around election results -- prospective or reactive.IBD: What helped Schwab become the fifth largest ETF provider in 2016?
"
108,LEG,"Sonders: Investors are increasingly (and correctly) focused more on planning, asset allocation, and progress toward their goals rather than elusive market outperformance. They are also becoming more aware of what they're paying, the value they're getting in return, and the long-term impact that costs and fees can have.Our ETF business has grown rapidly because of its ability to develop low-cost, high-quality investment vehicles that meet investor needs -- and Schwab can do this because of its scale, and unique platform and distribution models. Schwab ETFs are available through the commission-free platform, as well as through packaged products and solutions such as Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, Schwab Managed Accounts (401k platform using Schwab ETFs), and Schwab's new Target Date Fund series using ETFs inside.IBD: Is Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, your online robo advisor, growing?
"
109,LEG,"Sonders: Schwab Intelligent Portfolios launched in March 2015, and client assets in the service totaled $8.2 billion at the end of Q2 2016. So it's grown pretty quickly. We think the future of investment advice will be a mix of technology and live professionals. The emergence of automated investing is exciting for investors because it makes investing and advice more accessible to more people, and it's exciting for the industry because it makes portfolio management very efficient and scalable.IBD: What's your best advice for both new and experienced investors?
"
110,LEG,"Sonders: Well, at Schwab, we're big believers that whether you're just starting out or have been investing for years, it's important to stay engaged with your finances, and if you work with a financial professional, ask questions to ensure that you understand how you're invested and how you're tracking against your goals. And if you're doing that and investing according to a plan, the best advice might be to ignore the short-term noise and headlines. That might sound odd coming from someone who spends most of her time writing and talking about the stock market and economy, but the reality is that for most long-term investors, short-term events and news typically don't have a significant impact.At the portfolio level, we believe this is a good time to remain at long-term strategic allocations, but use volatility to tactically rebalance around those norms. In more volatile periods, rebalancing can occur more often and ""forces"" investors to do what we know we're supposed to, which is ""buy low and sell high."" It also allows our portfolios to tell us when it's time to make portfolio adjustments vs. relying on our own (or pundits') forecasts of what will happen.IBD: How do ETF strategist firms, such as Windhaven, help investors?
"
111,LEG,"Sonders: An ETF-based asset manager can help clients achieve their financial goals through prudent management of their investment portfolios with an emphasis on broad diversification, portfolio transparency and low costs -- all things that really matter to most investors.At Windhaven, we aim to provide investors with three broadly diversified strategies consisting primarily of low-cost index ETFs, designed to capture growth in rising markets while attempting to reduce exposure in declining ones. So our focus is about less volatile, sustained performance, which is what most long-term investors want, as opposed to a ""win big, lose big"" approach.Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?Schwab's Sonders: Fed Should Stop Treating Economy Like Trauma PatientWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?

112,LEG,"Tesaro's (TSRO) Zejula would likely outperform drugs from Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and AstraZeneca (AZN) when combined with treatments from big-name pharmaceutical companies, an analyst suggested Tuesday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez suggested that Tesaro would do better mixed with drugs from Dow's Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) or Roche (RHHBY). His suggestion came a day after Clovis unveiled strong data for its drug Rubraca in ovarian cancer. The Phase 3 trial, dubbed Ariel-3, signals that Clovis could get a broader label than expected in ovarian cancer.On Tuesday, Wall Street scrambled to differentiate drugs from AstraZeneca, Clovis and Tesaro, all of which have what are known as PARP inhibitors. These drugs aim to block a family of enzymes that cancer cells use to proliferate.Differentiating Tesaro's Zejula from Clovis' Rubraca and AstraZeneca's Lynparza will likely come down to how well it combines with immuno-oncology drugs to block interactions involving the PD-1 and PD-L1 proteins in the immune system.""Zejula appears to be the only late-stage PARP inhibitor that is both combinable with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and crosses the blood-brain barrier,"" Fernandez said in a note to clients.Tesaro's drug appears to be less toxic in the liver, which will be important in immuno-oncology combos. And the ability to cross the blood-brain battier will help Tesaro get a foothold in breast and lung cancers, which commonly spread to the brain.But Fernandez cut his price target on Tesaro stock to 143 from 158, though he still has a market perform rating on shares. He sees an even split for Tesaro and Clovis in ovarian cancer patients who've already undergone two rounds of prior therapy.IBD'S TAKE: Merck, Bristol and Roche are all working in the immuno-oncology space. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at how they performed during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting earlier this month in Chicago.Fernandez and Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay see AstraZeneca benefiting from Clovis' trial, which shows that PARP inhibitors are more similar than dissimilar. Lynparza is approved to treat ovarian cancer patients with a mutation of the BRCA gene.PARP inhibitors are thought to work better in patients with a BRCA genetic mutation, though Clovis' trial showed responses in all patients regardless of genetics. Still, doctors' preference for screening patients for that mutation could benefit AstraZeneca.Chattopadhyay kept his neutral rating on Tesaro stock, but trimmed his price target to 120 from 139. Like Fernandez, he sees Tesaro having a leg-up on Clovis in immuno-oncology combos, but notes that its in-house anti-PD-1 antibody is far from mature.He also upgraded Clovis stock to a buy rating with a 107 price target. Clovis stock flew 46.5% on Monday following the trial. Meanwhile, Tesaro stock is still ""being buoyed by (the) M&A rumor mill,"" Chattopadhyay said. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is a rumored potential acquirer.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young, too, boosted her price target on Clovis stock to 107 from 88, though she kept her outperform rating on its shares. The top-line success in its Ariel-3 trial shows Rubraca can have a ""meaningful market opportunity"" in the PARP space, she said.At the close on the stock market today, Clovis stock was up 0.9%, near 88.68, as Tesaro stock dove 3.5% to 137.97. AstraZeneca stock lifted less than 0.2% to 34.72.RELATED:Why This Cancer Drug Specialist Is Up 50% TodayBiotech Flew Nearly 50% On Strong Trial — But Is Its Drug Better?Can AstraZeneca Keep Up As Clovis, Tesaro Unveil Blockbuster Drugs?

115,LEG,"Your stocks to watch this week are five Dow Jones industrial average components showing compelling chart action: Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), DuPont (DD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).X The market uptrend is under pressure following Friday's sell-off in leading tech stocks, including Apple. So investors should be cautious about any purchases.Apple had been forming a shallow base with a potential buy point at 156.75, but as tech stocks sold off Friday, the iPhone maker is facing a test at the key 50-day line. Apple breached that level intraday but was able to close the session back above the line. If Apple can rebound higher from that support level, it could provide an opportunity for existing shareholders to add to their position.DuPont rose 1.5% to 82.90 on Friday, hitting a 19-year high and clearing a double-bottom entry at 82.40. This pattern is called a double-bottom because it resembles a ""W"" — the middle peak plus 10 cents is your entry. (In a double-bottom base, the second leg down of the W must be lower than the first leg, shaking out weak holders.Volume on Friday's breakout was only slightly above normal. It's best to see powerful buying activity when a stock clears an entry, as that indicates institutional support.DuPont is currently seeking regulatory approval for its ""merger of equals"" with Dow Chemical (DOW). Dow's chart pattern is similar, but the stock has not yet cleared its own double-bottom entry.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for growth stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out Leaderboard, where our markets team curates a list of top names at or near buy points.Boeing remains in buy range from a flat base with a 185.81 entry, but the stock has recently hit some resistance around the 190 level. Boeing closed up 10 cents to 190.03.Disney shares have fallen about 10% from their April 27 peak of 116.10, hitting their lows of the year. But the stock found support Friday at the 200-day line. Holding above this long-term trend level is key. Disney is now working on a base with a buy point that's 10 cents above that recent high, at 116.20. But it's got a lot of work to do before then.After paring much of its gains from an all-time intraday high of 160.86 on May 16, Home Depot is testing support at its 50-day line. This is a second test of that level after the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base in late January. When a stock rebounds higher off the 50-day line, that's an opportunity to add a few shares to your position.

116,LEG,"LAS VEGAS – Robotic vacuum cleaner maker iRobot (IRBT) is facing more competition from big names like LG and Samsung, but its technology lead should give it an edge in the market, iRobot Chief Operating Officer Christian Cerda told IBD at CES 2017.IRobot's category-defining Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners dominate the market. But consumer electronics giants now want a piece of the action. At CES, which ended Sunday, LG showed off its Hom-Bot robotic vacuums, while Samsung unveiled its latest Powerbot robotic vacuums.""The huge advantage we have is that making robots is very hard,"" Cerda said Friday. ""So far, we've been able to stay ahead. And we continue to invest more and more in R&D. So as the bigger brands come in (to the market), we become a more robust player.""While iRobot may have the technology advantage, it still has to contend with the greater advertising and marketing muscle of the larger consumer electronics companies. IRobot's marketing budget has grown as the company as grown and more competitors have been drawn to the market, Cerda said.IBD'S TAKE: IRobot stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 84, meaning it has outperformed 84% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 3 out of 12 stocks in IBD's Household-Appliances and Wares industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""We are a medium-sized company and have two areas where we need to mature quickly,"" Cerda said. ""We need to be able to do technology like the big guys and to do branding like the big guys.""About 7% to 8% of U.S. homes have Roomba vacuums, he said.This holiday season, most consumers shopping for a robot vacuum purchased product from iRobot, a trusted brand, he said.""We were talking to one of the major retailers this morning and (they said) they were left with none of our product and with a significant amount of the competitors' products,"" Cerda said. ""In hindsight, we would have made a different call (on stocking the retail channel).""Rivals like Dyson are still on a learning curve about what makes a good robotic vacuum cleaner.Robot vacuum cleaners represent 20% of the global market for vacuum cleaners that cost more than $200.Meanwhile, iRobot is working to make wet-floor cleaning robots a second leg of its business. The company's Braava line of robot mops now contribute just under 10% of its total revenue.IRobot also is developing a robotic lawn mower, which could be a third leg of its business, Cerda said.RELATED:CES 2017: News From The World's Largest Consumer Tech ShowApple, iRobot, TV Makers See Brisk Sales Thanksgiving Weekend

Gasoline tumbled to the lowest since 2008.Crude fell 11.5% in two days. Supplies probably rose by 4 million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg survey before an Energy Information Administration report Wednesday. The Russian leg of Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino’s tour to persuade oil exporters to cut output gained little more than pledges for further discussion. BP PlcBP posted a 91% decrease in Q4 earnings, while Exxon Mobil’s (XOM) fell 58%.""February, March and April will be very tough for the oil market,"" said Scott Roberts, portfolio manager and co-head of high yield who manages $2.7 billion at Invesco Advisers Inc. in Atlanta.

119,LEG,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

120,LEG,"Jesse Jackson called it ""a crime scene."" Hillary Clinton said she was ""outraged by what's happening."" President Obama said, ""I'd be beside myself over my kids' health.""Those are the tame statements about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, where federal and state water and environmental officials bungled a supply switch and temporarily contaminated the city's drinking water with lead.The flood of news stories in recent days have played up the health risks faced by people who drank the water, especially children. But just how bad is the contamination? How much harm will it end up doing?That part of the story has largely been ignored, leaving the public with little or no context to judge the events there.It was left to USA Today's deputy editorial page editor David Mastio to do the leg work that reporters should have been doing all along. His conclusion: The crisis is ""getting a tad overdone.""""Flint's 8,000 children have not had their lives destroyed,"" Mastio writes. In fact, ""even after Flint's disaster, the city's children have far less lead in their blood than their parents or grandparents did at the same age.""He notes that in late 1970s, ""88% of Americans ages 1 to 5 had at least 10 micrograms per deciliter of lead in their blood, or twice as much as today's level of concern.""By the early 1990s, he says, only 4.4% of children were exposed to so much lead.Mastio also found out that Michigan had conducted an extensive blood-lead-level test in 2005 and found that more than 1 in 4 children under age 6 had levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter. ""In the hardest-hit parts of Flint now, only 10.6% of kids have such concerning levels of lead in their blood.""""How can that be? While drinking water management in Flint has obviously been a mess in recent years, it's a mess that comes amid one of the greatest public health and environmental triumphs in U.S. history,"" he writes.Mastio is not the least bit dismissive of the health problems related to lead contamination, but he correctly points out that ""after years of progress, context-free panic over events in Flint is counterproductive.""There's plenty of additional information in Mastio's piece. It is definitely worth reading the whole thing.Follow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.

122,LEG,"Ferdinand Magellan believed he could sail west to Asia from Spain when he set out in five ships in 1519. The result was the discovery of the Pacific Ocean.Six years before, the Spanish explorer Vasco de Balboa sailed across the Atlantic to Panama and saw a large body of water from its western coast.But no one knew whether it was a huge lake or an ocean or how to sail there from Europe.Magellan changed all that.He planned to sail down the eastern coast of South America to see if he could find a passage to a western ocean that would allow him to reach Asia.His 38-day voyage in the storms of the channel, now called the Strait of Magellan — at South America's southern tip — led him to what he named the Pacific, for its calm.""It was the single greatest feat in the history of maritime exploration,"" Vejas Liulevicius, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""History's Greatest Voyages of Exploration,"" told IBD. ""Only one of the vessels returned to Spain three years later and 70% of the crew died, including Magellan, but it's a miracle anyone survived.""It revolutionized the way people thought about the world and kick-started the global [PAGE[economy]].""Time magazine included Magellan in ""The 100 Most Influential People of All Time.""Portuguese StartMagellan (1480-1521) was born in northern Portugal (the town is disputed) to a wealthy farming family.His parents died when he was 10, and two years later he became a page to the queen at the royal court in Lisbon. He was tutored in mapmaking and navigating ships by the stars, critical skills as Portugal competed with Spain to expand their empires by trade and conquest.""The spice trade underwent an upheaval in 1453 when Constantinople fell to the Arabs, blocking the historic overland route carrying spices from Asia to Christian Europe,"" said Laurence Bergreen, author of ""Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe."" ""Whoever could find a sea route alternative could become very rich.""In 1494, the pope divided up the world by drawing a line down the middle of the Atlantic:The Portuguese were given the right to discover lands to the east and the Spanish to the west.While the most educated Europeans believed astronomy and math assured the world was spherical, the other side wasn't explored and divided up. Someone had to sail around the globe and report back.The Portuguese pioneered a route hugging the coastline of Africa, establishing trading posts along the way and on India's west coast.While in India, the Europeans heard that the Moluccan Islands (now in Indonesia) were the source of many spices.In 1505, when he was 25, Magellan set out with a fleet that landed two years later at Cochin, India.He was wounded in several battles to conquer western India for the crown.In 1509, he joined an expedition to the Moluccas, and within two years they had conquered and renamed them the Spice Islands.Next up for Magellan was Morocco in 1512 to fight the Moors. He ran into trouble beyond the battlefield when he was accused of illegally trading with the Muslim enemy. He was acquitted, but the Portuguese government refused to employ him again.Furious, Magellan went to Spain in 1517 to offer everything he knew about Portuguese navigation.He settled in Seville, where the royal court was, and married Maria Barbosa. They had two children.Magellan studied maps of the known world with the leading cartographer and astronomer, Ruy Faleiro. They devised the plan to sail down the coast of South America and formed a partnership.Magellan pitched Spain's King Charles I on the idea that if he and Faleiro found a way west, the Spice Islands might be determined to be within the Spanish sphere of discovery — though only Magellan would be on the voyage. Charles agreed to underwrite the journey, which was expected to take two years.The vessels were mostly 60 feet long by 23 wide, with the Trinidad the flagship. The rest of the crew of 260 were on the San Antonio, Concepcion, Santiago and Victoria.Magellan checked every detail, and then, on Aug. 10, 1519, the fleet set sail southwest from Seville.Soon the Magellan expedition moved across the equator, making it harder for the navigators to be guided by the unfamiliar stars.The ships endured fierce Atlantic storms before arriving in December in Rio de Janeiro, where the men resupplied.After sailing south along the coast, they established a camp in March 1520 for the southern hemisphere's winter at Port Saint Julian, Argentina.The next month, three of the five captains and most of the crew mutinied over the harsh conditions of the expedition. They planned to kill Magellan and return to Spain.He calmly negotiated, while persuading many to give up the fight, then executed or marooned the ringleaders. On Oct. 21, examining the briny water off the tip of South America, Magellan realized this was the way to the other ocean.But now came a 373-mile nightmare, with gales, rocks just under shallow water, strong tides and beds of kelp that could entangle keels and rudders.It was too much for the 57 aboard the largest ship, the San Antonio, which carried much of the food. They mutinied and turned back, arriving in Spain in May 1521.The remaining three vessels sailed into the Pacific on Nov. 28.After moving up the coast of what is now Chile and picking up supplies, the winds blew them west toward what they believed would be the nearby Spice Islands — it was inconceivable that the Pacific covered one-third of the earth.Magellan and his men faced a 99-day leg of the voyage that took them 7,000 miles, the longest in history without landing to that time.On March 6 they reached Guam; 10 days later came Homonhon in the Philippines, with 150 survivors.Asian EndIn April, they visited Cebu, where they baptized the Philippine island's king and queen.Magellan offered to attack their enemies and was directed to the nearby island of Mactan.On April 27, Magellan landed with 60 men. With natives pushing them from the beach, he ordered his men to retreat to the ships, but he fought to the death. His crew returned to Spain to complete his mission.""With the passage of time, men everywhere began to realize the great contributions Magellan had made to science,"" wrote Charles Parr in ""So Noble a Captain: The Life and Times of Ferdinand Magellan."" ""He settled the question of the sphericity of the world and the habitability of Australia and New Zealand. His expedition solved the problems of how big the globe was at its circumference and from north to south and made them innumerable additions to the world's navigational and geographical knowledge, including the recognition of the calendar's loss of a day on the westerly girdling of the globe.""The pope awarded the Moluccas to the Portuguese, but Spain received the Philippines.""Manila was founded in 1571, and it would become a linchpin in international trade, so one could date the global economy from that year,"" said Liulevicius.

123,LEG,"Investing in ETFs is an excellent way to build wealth, generate income and capitalize on opportunities in the stock market. And you are, no doubt, a smart investor who knows that already.Perhaps what is less evident is a way to hack through the tangle of roughly 2,000 exchange traded funds to find investment strategies that are the right fit for you. That's where our latest ETF special report may offer an edge.It spotlights the best ETF investment strategies for tackling issues and themes that are likely to be popular in the year ahead: managing volatility and hedging downside risk in investment portfolios, finding pockets of opportunity in a low- or no-growth world, and being smart and tactical while investing in stocks if the market gets sloppier yet.""Now the bull market is in its seventh year, and investors are nervous about the apparent lack of catalysts, such as earnings growth to fuel the next leg up"" for stocks, State Street Global Advisors wrote early in the summer for its 2016 Mid-Year ETF and Investment Outlook report.The potential headwinds that the investment management firm outlined then -- shocks to China's financial and currency markets, negotiations for Britain to leave the European Union, a divisive U.S. presidential election -- are still in place as a new year approaches. Investors are likely to keep displaying ""a glass-half-empty mindset as risks remain tilted to the downside.""ETFs are ideal for the risk-averse investor in such a climate. These investment vehicles hold a diversified basket of securities. Even in the best of times, that means less anxiety that the blowup of a single stock or bond could dash all your hopes for successful investing and your plans for a comfortable retirement.Several ETF investment strategies deliberately offer protection from downside risk in treacherous times. Some hunt and peck within the broad universe of stocks to find holdings with specific favorable attributes, such as low volatility or high dividends. Others combine ""factors"" or stock characteristics, such as quality and value, within a single ETF wrapper.Such approaches have been richly rewarded in 2016. For instance, iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) was up 10.4% year to date through Sept. 23 vs. a 6.8% gain for ETFs tracking the S&P 500. Investors poured $6.26 billion in fresh money into USMV, a top-performing ETF in the diversified fund category, this year through August, helping the fund double assets to $14.54 billion.Total assets in ETFs listed in the U.S. stand at $2.406 trillion, having more than doubled since 2010 and testifying to sharp acceleration in asset growth. Consider this: The ETF industry hit the $1 trillion milestone roughly 18 years after the first American ETF, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), launched in 1993.Investors of every stripe -- from novices to strategists to traders -- are attracted to ETFs for their diversification benefits, as well as their cost efficiency, tradability and transparency.Whether you're new to ETFs or an experienced investor looking to revamp your toolbox, whether you're focused on profiting from market opportunities or on avoiding risky areas, whether you're looking to make short-term trades or investing for the distant future, this special report contains ideas and insights to take your portfolio from average to top-notch.If you're a newbie, the story about how to get started investing in ETFs is just the ticket. It handholds you through the key questions in several areas that will guide your investment decisions. Chief among these is one that relates to ... you.""When looking for ETFs, first you need to ask what you're looking for,"" Alex Bryan, an ETF analyst at Morningstar, told IBD. Truly, no exchange traded fund -- no matter how great the strategy or how sound its implementation -- will give you the right exposure if it's not designed to do what you imagined.If you're far from new to ETF investing and just want the quick-and-dirty on how to make $1 million in ETFs, there is something for you too. IBD markets writer David Saito-Chung sets out how to take advantage of swashbuckling leveraged funds. In a gilded year for precious metals, some gold-backed ETFs have vaulted as much as 500% this year. David's story provides a step-by-step guide to playing the short-term moves of one such best-performing ETF, Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NUGT).A triple-leveraged strategy isn't for the weak of stomach, but David keeps both potential risks and returns firmly in sight while showing how ETFs can be used to generate wealth much as the best growth stocks can. At the same time, he assumes you're an investor who is comfortable delving into technical chart action and proper size positions.If you're bullish about precious metals but not crazy about the use of leverage, there's something for you too. Marie Beerens explores the various ways to invest with ETFs in precious metals -- through commodities, stocks and futures. Even as the story asks whether gold and silver have anything left in the tank after their hot streak, it probes the consequences of the different ETF approaches.The upshot is a small holding in precious metals can buffer your portfolio against drawdowns. The key safe-haven asset, notes State Street's Dave Mazza, tends to behave differently when your traditional assets do poorly.Another recent investing theme that is sure to survive and thrive in the months ahead is the hunt for income. That's why IBD's Nancy Gondo focuses on the best ETF strategies to generate steady income.It's not just about tapping stock dividends and bond interest through ETFs. Investors are ranging further afield for their income needs, from real estate to master limited partnerships to the hybrid securities known as preferred stock. If you're an income investor, you'll certainly want to keep up with these high-yielding strategies, and then decide whether or not they slot into your portfolio.In her survey of the landscape, Nancy also examines the potential impact of rising and falling interest rates on various equity sectors. Never forget to keep an eye out for risks, which tend to go hand-in-hand with higher yields as you reach further out for income.Speaking of sector equity ETFs, these strategies are popular with investors seeking to rotate into a hot area of the stock market or to tilt away from a cooling one. Money managers chime in with sector outlooks in Ken Shreve's look at which ETFs in major sectors such as technology, financials and health care could rev up.Betting on sectors for successful investing is similar to picking individual stocks -- both require a certain expertise and temperament. If you are skittish about making such tactical bets, a new crop of sector rotation strategies will do the hard work for you. However, many of these momentum-driven ETFs, such as First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 (FV), have slowed to a crawl after a heady 2015.Ken notes that WBI Tactical Rotation Shares (WBIR) also makes tactical allocations to capitalize on trends. Don't mistake it for a traditional sector-rotation strategy though. This new and actively managed ETF invests across asset classes and global regions, and it aims to protect capital from falling markets by holding large amounts of cash or cash equivalents if needed.One asset class that has seen tactical rotation this year is emerging markets. Investors sought a rare pocket of growth, but the case for a strategic allocation to these funds remains sound too. There are duds in this space too, so Paul Katzeff homes in on tips for playing emerging markets with ETFs.It's not a story you'll want to miss, especially since the bellwether iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) ETF has outperformed mutual fund peers as a group year to date.When index-tracking ETFs beat actively managed funds, is it any surprise that a top executive at one of the biggest investment management firms in the business is a fan of passive investing?Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told IBD that most of her own investment and retirement assets are in ETFs.Even the smart money listens when Sonders offers her typically astute economic analysis and outlook. Sonders called the 2009 stock market bottom and is a sought-after speaker in the investing world, which is why we profiled her in this special report.Not to mention that her work underpins portfolios at Schwab, helping it become the fifth-largest ETF provider this year.In fact, as ETFs grow their popularity, several of the biggest ETF firms are getting bigger still, and innovative smaller firms continue to make inroads too.""It's been a great year for ETFs,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. He expects some of the hottest asset classes in 2016, such as fixed-income ETFs, to continue to gain ground in the months to come. Others, such as low-volatility and dividend ETFs, could cool off if the Federal Reserve changes its tack on interest rates.No matter how the stock market wind blows, Rosenbluth expects 2017 to be another stellar year for ETFs. Of note: New federal regulations require those who serve investors to uphold a fiduciary standard, thereby putting their clients' best interests before their own profits.""That makes lower-cost products particularly appealing,"" Rosenbluth averred. ""Financial advisors are going to increasingly embrace ETFs.""RELATED:Choosing An ETF For Your Portfolio Made Easy

124,LEG,"Medical behemoths Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) could square off to acquire muscle biologist Cytokinetics (CYTK), while more than a dozen potential players prep for an M&A donnybrook over small-cap Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS), Needham analysts suggested Friday.Biotech M&A fodder heated up this week as Allergan (AGN) announced back-to-back deals to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for $639 million and Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for $1.7 billion. The Tobira deal gives Allergan a leg up in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where Gilead (GILD) and Intercept (ICPT) Pharmaceuticals also compete.IBD's 420-company biotech industry group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 173 just 13 weeks ago. Collectively, the group has a $771 billion market cap, No. 11 among all groups. The group fell 0.7% Friday, its first decline in the past eight trading days. The group was up 3.8% for the week.Needham analysts reviewed R&D pipelines, business development areas of interest and M&A activity for 26 large companies to gauge how interested Big Pharma is in biotechs -- ""an important theme in the biotech space,"" they wrote in a research report.Since 2012, Allergan, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Shire (SHPG) and Valeant (VRX) have been most acquisitive, buying (or prepping to buy) more than 100 companies, collectively. Shire has been most active, with 14 acquisitions.""We believe late-development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets,"" they wrote in a research report titled, ""What does Big Pharma want to buy?"" Peak areas of interest include oncology and cardiovascular, Needham research showed.But that may not be where Big Pharma takes its beaucoup bucks for M&A. Needham analysts suggested central nervous system (CNS) players Adamas and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, and liver disorder drugmaker Intercept could be of prime acquisition interest.Eight firms overlap in potential interest for Adamas and Acadia: AbbVie (ABBV), Allergan, Eli Lilly (LLY), Lundbeck, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Takeda Pharmaceutical.Needham lists 13 potential acquirers for Adamas, but Allergan makes particular sense considering the duo already partner on the next-generation formulation of memantine and the fixed-dose combination product Namzaric, both of which battle Alzheimer's.By year's end, Adamas plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ADS-5102, a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia -- involuntary movements -- in Parkinson's disease patients and multiple sclerosis walking impairments, Needham wrote.Meanwhile, Acadia's 11 potential suitors could be interested in Nuplazid, a drug to ease psychosis associated with Parkinson's launched earlier this year. Needham suggests Acadia could be looking to expand the label for other uses.Similarly, Intercept could draw interest from nearly a dozen potential buyers including Gilead, No. 2 biotech by market cap. On Thursday, an RBC analyst posited Intercept would continue to lead Gilead and Allergan in the battle against NASH.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks notched higher this week, up about 4% since last week.

126,LEG,"Medical behemoth Gilead (GILD) is trailing Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) liver disease, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Thursday, two days after Botox maker Allergan (AGN) jumped in with its $1.7 billion agreement to acquire Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA).Larger Gilead and Allergan — with $107.2 billion and $94.4 billion market caps — are later to the NASH race than Intercept ($4.1 billion market cap). Intercept began enrolling its Phase 3 trials in September 2015 and expects to complete enrollment early next year.IBD'S TAKE: Would you shove a stick in your eye to avoid daily eye drops to treat glaucoma? Glaukos can help. Check out IBD's New America.Intercept, and a handful of rivals, are attempting to treat NASH by targeting FXRs (farnesoid X receptors), a class of proteins found in the liver and intestines. FXRs can be stoked to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, bile-acid homeostasis and fibrosis — all tied to NASH.But newer players are looking at using non-bile acid FXRs, a departure from Intercept's chemistry. Still, Intercept's Phase 2 FLINT trial is the ""most mature data set in the space to show significance on both fibrosis and liver histology based on pre-specified parameters,"" Young wrote in a research report.Long-term, Young sees room in the NASH space for many players, but Intercept will be more successful than Gilead with a 75% success rate vs. 50%, respectively, she predicted. Intercept will also have to contend with Novartis (NVS), Encanta and now Allergan.Allergan entered the race on Tuesday with its plan to acquire Tobira to get a leg-up on NASH treatment. Yet, Tobira's CVC (cenicriviroc) missed its goal of improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLAD) activity score. The activity score is a severity measurement for patients who likely have NASH.Tobira'a CVC successfully reduced fibrosis without worsening NASH in 20% of patients vs. 10% treated with a placebo. Comparatively, Intercept's Phase 2 trial for OCAs (obeticholic acid) improved fibrosis in 35% of patients vs. 19% who received the placebo.Now, Allergan expects to combine Tobira's CVC, a diabetes treatment and a preclinical non-bile acid FXR from Akarna. Encanta has both bile and non-bile FXRs likely slated for human trials soon. Combining treatments will be key, Young predicted.""We think a combination of regimens will be an important part of the treatment paradigm and we think Intercept is positioned well here long term,"" Young wrote. She has an outperform rating and a 200 price target on Intercept stock.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Intercept stock rose 1% to 170.40, but are up nearly 15% so far this month. Shares are in a buy zone for the third consecutive day after pivoting from a 169.17 buy point out of a double bottom base on Sept. 20.Gilead Sciences shares fell 0.2% to 81.52. Allergan climbed 2.1% to 243.43.

128,LEG,"United Airlines (UAL) on Wednesday reported ""initial progress"" following an array of policy changes after security dragged a passenger from one of its flights in April. But shares struggled to make headway amid uninspiring May traffic data, guidance and ""incremental weakness"" in increasingly competitive Asia.Similarly, Southwest (LUV) also were marking time after releasing May traffic figures, but the stock was still in buy range.But Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) jumped after the company hiked its second-quarter unit-revenue forecast due to a mix stronger pricing power on airfare and expectations of cheaper fuel.United rose 0.5% to 81.66 in the stock market today after falling to 78.35 intraday and briefly moving back into buying range.Southwest fell 0.2% to 59.96 after briefly undercutting a 58.83 entry on the handle of a cup base.Hawaiian Holdings popped 12.3% to 59.35, clearing resistance in a larger consolidation.Delta Air Lines (DAL) rose 2%, American Airlines (AAL) 2.3% and JetBlue (JBLU) 1.7%. Delta and JetBlue are still within the 5% chase zone while American Air is now extended.United on Wednesday stuck with its second-quarter passenger unit revenue guidance of a 1%-3% percent increase.

The company also said that passenger traffic in May rose 2.6%, outpaced by a rise in capacity of 3.7%.The carrier also said that involuntary denied boardings — the practice that led to worldwide outrage against the industry's treatment of customers, a congressional hearing and, eventually, passenger reports of problems with scorpions, a large rabbit, a stroller, a birthday cake and a 17th-century violin — fell 79% in May.""We will continue to build on this momentum as we head into the busy summer travel season,"" President Scott Kirby said in a statement on Wednesday.However, United also warned that ""the Pacific region is experiencing incremental weakness due to unfavorable supply and demand dynamics in China and Hong Kong.""Air travel in Asia is expected to boom in the coming years, with China set to become the biggest air-travel market globally by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association.

129,LEG,"In less than a decade, the U.S. shale oil revolution has brought consumers worldwide billions of dollars in savings, driving down the price of gasoline, fuel oil, air travel, plastics and countless other household budget items. Before a fresh supply of shale oil drove U.S. crude output to records in 2013 and 2014, U.S. benchmark oil often traded above $100 per barrel.…
"
130,LEG,"OPEC is likely to extend its production cuts at the group's biannual meeting Thursday, but questions remain on the duration, size and scope of the reduction, as giants like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) join shale producers in the rush to pump more oil — and potentially send U.S. output to record highs later this year.In November, OPEC and top non-OPEC producers like Russia agreed to remove 1.8 million barrels of daily output off the market for six months starting in January. Prices rallied but then came back down as U.S. producers ramped up faster than expected and as inventories shrank slower than expected. By March, OPEC had started talking about extending the agreement by six months to the end of the year.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, along with Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria and Venezuela, who collectively represent more than 80% of OPEC's output, have already said publicly that they support extending the cuts in some form.But Russia and Saudi Arabia have suggested taking the deal even further, saying they support extending the deal to March 2018.""There has been a marked reduction to the inventories, but we're not where we want to be in reaching the five-year average,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at a briefing in Beijing with Russia's Alexander Novak on May 15.On Saturday, al-Falih told Bloomberg that ""everybody"" he has talked to backs a nine-month extension. But on Monday, al-Falih reportedly visited his Iraqi counterpart in Baghdad to convince him to back a nine-month deal instead of a six-month one. Last year, Iraq had pushed to be exempt from the initial cut, saying it needed money to fight the Islamic State. It agreed to participate in the cuts but is considered a major cheater.The International Energy Agency warned last week that merely extending the deal won't be enough to bring markets in balance. Instead, deeper cuts are needed.And analysts at Citigroup have said there is a 60%-70% chance OPEC and its allies will announce an even deeper cut, taking 300,000-500,000 more barrels per day off the market.""An extension is in the bag,"" said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""I would be shocked if it wasn't extended, and I wouldn't be surprised if OPEC announced an even bigger cut going forward.""On top of that, the scope of the output reductions could be broader, as Russia and Saudi Arabia are also pushing for non-OPEC members Turkmenistan and Egypt to participate in the next round. OPEC members Libya and Nigeria, which were exempt from reductions under the initial round, may participate in the next, while Iran, which was also shielded from cuts, has signaled it will maintain a cap on its output.In a note Monday, Goldman Sachs said a nine-month deal would help ""normalize OECD inventories"" by the start of next year. But the analysts warned that once the deal was over, stockpiles would start rising again.Goldman said that OEPC and its allies should ""gradually ramp up production to grow market share but keep stocks stable and backwardation in place,"" referring to the situation when a commodities' future contract price is below the current spot price.""Low forward prices could curtail shale's growth by reducing the ability to secure future cash flows and attract funding,"" Goldman said.Talk of more-aggressive moves has helped lift crude prices, with U.S. oil topping $50 a barrel again after rising 5% in the past week. Brent is now at a one-month high, above $53 a barrel.But OPEC members whose governments rely heavily on oil revenue need a higher price than that to stay out of red ink. Saudi Arabia's ""fiscal break-even"" price is $83.80 a barrel, according to an IMF report last month. Oman's is $79.20, Libya's is $71.30, and the United Arab Emirates' is $67. Others are in better shape, with Iraq's at $54.30, Iran's at $51.30 and Kuwait's at $49.10Meanwhile, U.S. producers learned during the oil crash how to become leaner and operate within cash flow at lower oil prices. They don't need to support government coffers either and are poised to boost production further if OPEC manages to raise crude prices again.Companies in the Permian Basin have break-even prices of $34 in some areas, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Earlier this month, EOG Resources (EOG) said it could hit its target of an 18% increase in oil production, while operating in its cash flow, if oil averages $47 per barrel this year.And Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) said recently that its break-even oil price is just $20 a barrel, and the company could make ""good returns"" at $40 oil. Plus, deep-pocketed heavyweights like Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) plan to focus more spending this year on U.S. shale plays.That leaves OPEC with another dilemma, but one it is unlikely to resolve next week, if ever.""There is of yet no long-term strategy for dealing with shale oil, so any rebalancing will be temporary,"" Omar Al-Ubaydli, an affiliated senior research fellow at George Mason University, said.U.S. production fell in the prior week for the first time since February, according to the Energy Information Administration. But output is on pace to top the April 2015 peak of 9.61 million barrels per day by July, and Flynn has said it could even reach 10 million barrels per day by August.Still, Flynn is more bullish on OPEC's future, noting that it takes time to boost production from unconventional wells due to their steep rate of decline, whereas traditional wells like those in Saudi Arabia can produce at a high rate for several years.""Even now with shale's resurgence, as demand grows in the coming years (OPEC) feels that because of the lack of investment in more traditional projects by oil companies, they will have a leg up in being able to ramp up production to meet demand in the future,"" he said.RELATED:EOG Shows Why It's The 'Apple Of Oil' With Gusher Of Mobile Apps, Data

131,LEG,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance will likely benefit most after the Food and Drug Administration required Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to warn patients of leg and foot amputations associated with diabetes drug Invokana, an analyst said Tuesday.In a letter to physicians Tuesday, the FDA cited two large clinical trials and concluded that diabetes meds Invokana, Invokamet and Invokamet XR ""causes an increased risk of leg and foot amputations.""The FDA will now require Johnson & Johnson to add a boxed warning to its Invokana/Invokamet labels. The trials, dubbed Canvas and Canvas-R, showed that leg and foot amputations occurred twice as often in patients treated with Invokana vs. a placebo.""Amputations to the toe and middle of the foot were the most common, however, amputations involving the leg, below and above the knee also occurred,"" the FDA wrote. ""Some patients had more than one amputation, some involving both limbs.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez expects Lilly to benefit from an influx of Invokana patients transitioning to one of its diabetes meds, Jardiance. Invokana and Jardiance belong to a class of drugs called SGLT2 inhibitors.SGLT2 — sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 — is a protein that facilitates glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. These drugs block the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, increase glucose excretion and lower blood glucose levels.""The increasingly differentiated labels and data to date suggest that Lilly's Jardiance likely will be a near-term beneficiary of further and perhaps accelerated market share losses for Invokana,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Stay on top of the biotech and drug industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Whether physicians move their patients off Invokana and onto Jardiance or AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga will likely depend on the full results of the Canvas and Canvas-R trials to be presented in June during the American Diabetes Association meeting.J&J's Janssen subsidiary began the Canvas trial in December 2009 to examine the potential cardiovascular benefit of Invokana. The Canvas-R trial began in October 2013. Researchers examined benefits of Invokana on the kidneys.Lilly's Jardiance was approved by the FDA in December to cut the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Jardiance was the first Type 2 diabetes drug to get approval for cutting the risk of cardiovascular death.""We believe a dramatic impact on the class is unlikely in the wake of Jardiance's cardiovascular death claim and could be further mitigated by directionally positive results in Canvas/Canvas-R on efficacy/cardiovascular risk reduction,"" Fernandez wrote.Still, the entire SGLT2 needs to grow for Jardiance to meet or beat forecasts. Fernandez sees $665 million in U.S. Jardiance sales in 2017 and $1 billion in Invokana sales in 2017. He forecasts the entire class growing to $4 billion in 2021 from $2.1 billion this year.""So even if Jardiance were to capture 100% of Invokana's estimates sales of $1 billion in 2017 in the immediate future, a major slowdown in category growth likely would be a bigger issue relative to consensus estimates,"" he said.At the close on the stock market today, Lilly stock was down 1.6% to 78.99, after a Goldman Sachs analyst removed the stock from her conviction list. But shares of J&J, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, advanced 0.6%, near 127.77.RELATED:Dow's Pfizer, Eli Lilly Topple To 3-Month Lows On DowngradesCan Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To Market?Drug Stocks Rally On Relief After GOP Health Bill Wins In House

132,LEG,"One of President-elect Donald Trump's major campaign promises is to ""repeal and replace"" ObamaCare.Vice President Joe Biden recently dared him to do so. Biden knows that 20 million Americans have health insurance that didn't before ObamaCare, and they represent 20 million stories on CNN, MSNBC and The New York Times — in the entire ""health care is a right"" crowd — when and if Trump follows through.Sure, despite President Barack Obama's promises to the contrary, some people lost their health care coverage and some people lost their doctors. And no, the average family did not save $2,500 per year as Obama insisted would be the case. And yes, health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles are going up even though Obama promised that his plan would ""bend the cost curve"" down.All that matters to the anti-Trump media is that there is now an entire class of people to exert pressure against the repeal of ObamaCare. Many Republicans say they want to keep ""the good parts of ObamaCare,"" specifically the prohibition against denying insurance based on a pre-existing condition and forcing insurance carriers to keep a ""child"" on his or her parents' policy until the child is 26. Republicans promised to not only repeal but to ""replace"" ObamaCare. How can they do this — and replace it with what?Republicans, despite their unanimous opposition against ObamaCare, bought into at least two premises that its proponents argued. The first is that health care is a right — or, if not a right, at least something whose costs the federal government should reduce. The second is that, having made the decision to intervene in health care, the federal government possesses the knowledge, wisdom and judgment to reduce its costs to make it ""affordable."" The feds, promised ObamaCare advocates, can even make health care affordable without reducing quality.For ObamaCare to ""work,"" it is particularly important for young people to ""buy in,"" because while they are forced to spend on health care insurance they are unlikely to consume health care services. ObamaCare transfers money from the pockets of young people (with a net worth smaller than that of seniors, by the way) into the pockets of older, health care consuming Americans.If the goal were truly to make health care more affordable, ObamaCare would be as laughably wrongheaded as other Obama boondoggles like ""cash for caulkers"" or ""cash for clunkers."" No, the real goal is taxpayer-paid health care.  Both ex-DNC chair Howard Dean and ex-Senate leader Harry Reid said so.To reduce costs in health care, or, for that matter, in any commodity, is to unleash the free market. Health care is particularly shackled by restrictions and regulations too numerous to mention. Here is just one example.In the biographical movie ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" a World War II medic, Private Desmond Doss, a pacifist, refused to carry a rifle. In the midst of the carnage, during the Battle of Okinawa, Doss carried wounded soldiers and rappelled them down a cliff face to safety then treated them alongside the medics. He was awarded a Medal of Honor for saving scores of lives.If, however, after the war, Pvt. Doss had opened an office with a shingle saying ""Doss' trauma unit,"" authorities would have thrown him in jail for practicing medicine without a license. His skills were good enough for the soldiers on the battlefield, but not good enough for civilians when Doss returned stateside.On a question-and-answer website, this question was recently posed: How do Marines feel about Navy corpsmen?Here are some of the responses: ""Personal experience — I had my middle finger sewn back on by an E-5 corpsman. When a real doctor first saw it, he shouted, 'Who did this?!' I asked why and the Doc said that it was the best he had ever seen. I have full use and feeling in that finger and that was 40 years ago.""""Personal experience — I was shot in the leg. An E-4 corpsman, assisted by an E-5, treated me. No doctor could have done any better than they did.""""History: Beginning in WWII, most ships the size of destroyers and smaller had enlisted men — corpsmen — as their only medical expert. Usually it was a Chief Petty Officer, but often was an E-6 and some had only an E-5.""Then, as now, they did everything — surgery included. In WWII and every war since then, U.S. soldiers have had a higher survival rate than any other country's military (enemy or allies) and most of that medical triage and vital systems treatment was by enlisted corpsmen.""Outside the service, enlisted corpsmen are by far the preferable hire for civilian EMT and rescue jobs.""If Congressional Republicans were serious about making health care affordable, they should sell the voters on the free market. Where's the slogan for that?

134,LEG,"Sometimes a stock just looks like it's ready to go.When a stock forms a flat base, characterized by tight, sideways trading in mostly light volume, or a bullish cup-with-handle pattern, astute investors know the chances are good for a breakout.It's human nature to want to be there early for a breakout. But buying a stock before a base completes is always fraught with risk.One of the hallmarks of a successful breakout is a surge in volume when the stock passes the buy point. That's the actionable time to buy, and not before then.Buying in anticipation often ends in unnecessary losses.Early buy points can often present themselves in flat bases, but the risk here is that the highs inside the base are still below the high of the left side of the base. That's the last resistance level that a stock must conquer for a legitimate breakout.In the double-bottom pattern, a stock shows a good shakeout as the second leg down undercuts the first. It may even start rallying in heavy volume from there, but even if that happens, it doesn't mean that the stock is buyable.""Overhead supply"" is a big obstacle when a stock bottoms out and tries to form the right side of a base. When the stock rallies back, those who bought on the way down are often tempted to sell to break even on their investment.That's why heavy-volume gains are good to see when a stock builds the right side of a base. The buying demand must be strong enough to offset overhead supply issues and launch the breakout.After a nice run-up, Acuity Brands (AYI) consolidated gains in 2011. Seeing a base taking shape, eager buyers may have bought when the stock surged 7% in heavy volume during the week ending April 1 (1).Weekly volume exploded to 3.5 million shares, well above its average at the time of 1.9 million shares. It wasn't a breakout, though. The stock stopped just short of a 60.83 buy point. So the buy was premature.Acuity went on to rally less than 1% past the buy point before it started moving sideways again. Another flat base formed with a new buy point at 61.55. Current stockholders were hoping for another breakout attempt, while others may have bought early during the second consolidation.A breakout never materialized from the second pattern. Acuity tried in the week ended June 3 but reversed (2). Acuity slumped as much as 46% from its high before bottoming in October.

136,LEG,"The Obama administration has shifted expectations about ObamaCare to such an extent that the latest enrollment data were, quite remarkably, reported as good news.Yet the best measure of how well ObamaCare is providing affordable care to the broad group that the exchanges were meant to help should ring alarm bells.Many journalists and policy analysts seem to be grading on a curve, perhaps thinking that ObamaCare has earned goodwill by making insurance affordable for the very-near-poor and many with pre-existing conditions who previously had to pay an arm and a leg for coverage.That attitude would be reasonable if ObamaCare was a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. But ObamaCare is a mandate for millions of modest-income people to buy unaffordable coverage or pay a penalty. There's a reason why the uninsured disapprove of the law by an overwhelming 2-to-1 margin: To paraphrase Jimmy Stewart, they know the difference between a blessing and a punch in the nose.Enrollment Dived In Late 2015One metric that's yet to be reported is what happened to enrollment in the final quarter of 2015, but the indications are that it continued to sink by 5% or more.Consider that HealthCare.gov ended 2014 with 4.3 million customers and re-enrolled 4.2 million of them. If customers don't actively renew their insurance or select another option, they get renewed automatically, unless they actively opt out, which almost no one did a year ago. Yet this year, of 9.3 million customers nationwide who were enrolled at the end of the third quarter, only 8.2 million re-enrolled.Now that doesn't mean that close to 1 million ObamaCare customers bolted in the fourth quarter. New York moved customers from 139% to 200% of the poverty level to a new public plan, and a handful of other states are still moving people into other coverage whose nonprofit co-op plans were shut down. Still, it seems clear that the number of people with exchange coverage shrank by at least 500,000 in Q4 to 8.8 million or fewer.Big insurers like Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and Molina Health (MOH) reported an average 8% drop in exchange customers in the third quarter. Then, in November, UnitedHealth (UNH) warned that it might get out of the exchange business in 2017, in part because it has seen people rack up big health bills and then stop paying their premiums.'New Enrollees' = 'The Usual Suspects'One amusing spin from the Obama administration is that the new group of enrollees — those who didn't re-enroll — is younger than the new group who signed up last year at the same point. But ""new enrollees"" includes anyone who previously dropped coverage before November. Enrollment sank by nearly 3 million from the 11.7 million total that signed up for 2015, so there is a big pool of young, uninsured former customers that ObamaCare is trying to woo back with the threat of an individual mandate penalty of $695-plus.A case in point comes from Abby Goodnough of the New York Times, who reported on a California couple who dropped coverage. The man, age 37, plans to stay uninsured and pay the fine, but his 26-year-old wife will sign up because she's now thinking about having a baby.Total signups through the first week in January are still about 300,000 below last year's 11.7 million final total, says Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net. If, say, one-third of the ""new"" signups are past dropouts, then the actual pace of new enrollment is running way behind last year's pace. The upshot is that demand appears tepid and the final signup total may not even break 13.5 million, a far cry from the 20 million annual average projected by the Congressional Budget Office.Of course, paying customers mean a lot more than signups. If past is prologue, a couple of million people will never pay or drop coverage for a variety of reasons as the year progresses, and many more people will be left with policies that do little to make care affordable.A Bigger Bronze TrapOne thing that's clear from the latest enrollment period is that those who sign up close to the wire are much more likely to choose bronze plans — 29% of HealthCare.gov signups did in last year's final month vs. 19% in the first two months. That makes sense, because people who drag their feet but sign up to avoid paying a fine are more likely to opt for the cheapest plan available.Thus, the bronze share of plan selections is sure to rise over the next month, yet bronze is already more popular among HealthCare.gov signups this year than it was in the first two months of enrollment a year ago: 21% have opted for bronze vs. 19% at the same point.This is a concern because even among those earning above 300% of the poverty level (just over $35,000 for a single), relatively few are in a position to handle bronze-plan deductibles of up to $6,850 this year. But it's a huge concern when a sizable share of lower earners opts for bronze, and it looks like more will do so this year.ObamaCare made a priority of limiting out-of-pocket medical spending for those with incomes of up to 250% of the poverty level, so that they wouldn't face a pileup of medical debt or avoid getting necessary care at the risk of worse health outcomes. That's why the law provides both premium subsidies and an extra slice of cost-sharing subsidies for households in this income range.But because Democrats were so focused on limiting unmanageable out-of-pocket costs, the law's crafters linked the extra cost-sharing subsidies exclusively to silver plans as an extra incentive for modest-income individuals to buy comprehensive coverage. Those who buy cheaper bronze plans lose out on the extra subsidies.In this signup period, like last year's, 20% to 25% of those who would be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies — based on their low income if they bought silver — have instead selected bronze. (Both years' data are missing some income information, so exact numbers aren't available.)The bigger problem is this: Not only are many low-income enrollees choosing bronze coverage that may not help them much in a pinch, but millions of low-income households are steering clear of the exchanges because all of their options are bad. On top of that, due to ObamaCare employer rules, a few million modest-wage, full-time workers are ineligible for the subsidies — even if their employer offers coverage that costs them close to 10% of income.The bottom line is that even in the modest-income group from 150% to 250% of the poverty level, ObamaCare isn't helping a wide majority of people who surely could use help, but it may cost them $695 if they don't sign up.Follow Jed Graham on Twitter @IBD_JGraham.

138,LEG,"Stocks struggled yesterday as a weak US eco data point revealed that pending home sales fell by 0.9% vs. the +0.2% expectation and another decline in oil prices ripped thru the mkts.....sending the broader mkt a bit lower while energy stocks went into a tailspin...or at least that is what they want you to believe.... Look - the curtain is about to come down on 2015, volumes light, asset managers taking advantage of some last min window dressing - traders jumping in and out as they try to ring the register....and the mkt did not collapse at all.  We remain well entrenched in the trading range we have been discussing which will leave us essentially flat on the year - add in dividends and maybe the S&P registers a small gain of 2%.....Chalk it up and let's move on.  Yes...oil fell by 3+%, - ending the day at $36.60/barrel,  crude oil supplies rose by 2.9 mil barrels and the Saudi's re-iterated their commitment to keep producing oil at a record pace to try and choke out everyone else.....Ok..but this is getting a bit long in the tooth now, no?  This has the story and will continue to be part of the story in 2016, so there is nothing new here at all...... Themes for 2016......oh boy.....This is sure to set up for an interesting year.....First we have the US Presidential election - and while the Democrats seem to have already anointed their candidate - the Republicans are still trying to clear the field.  There are still some 11 GOP candidates in the race - it is time for them to bow out and coalesce around SOMEONE - my sense is that the longer this circus drags on - the weaker the party gets.....Someone needs to take control... Next up - the FED and Monetary Policy  - Do we need to discuss?  Third will be a continued focus on China and the role it is playing in the global economy..... Fears of a continued slowdown will permeate the analysis and chatter - How will the global economy respond? Next - Oil - is the worst over or will we see another leg down and if we do - what are the implications for the world economy?   Yesterday - the IMF's (International Monetary Fund) Chief - Ms. Christine Lagarde - warned us of 'disappointing global growth for 2016' -  How's that for a  'Happy New Year Toast!' And the list goes on..... Technically speaking - we continue to get mixed signals from the mkts - We have a long term signal  that is hovering on the edge.....suggesting the beginning of a pullback....  Add this to the range of other early warnings - indexes that have already entered bear mkts and you need to at least be aware of a broader mkt pullback.   This signal is nothing more than the simple 10-month exponential moving average on the S&P 500 Index.  Back in August - this signal flashed a HUGE warning as the mkt crashed........ The October rally  took it back up and thru resistance on the S&P - causing some to think it was just an aberration.....Since then, the S&P has gone mostly sideways, gradually turning lower again in December - bit still not sending the definitive signal....which is why we are 'hovering'....Next look at the DOW Industrials vs. the DOW Transports.  If we are to believe that the bulls remain in control then the Transportation Index should be mimicking the Industrial index, according to the DOW Theory - which it is NOT. Since November -  the transportation index has been in a harsh and steady decline - vs. the sideways pattern of the industrials.   The decline in the Transports reflects a lack of shipping demand. So, regardless of headline reports about how much Amazon shipped and the role that UPS and FEDEX played - raw materials and finished goods are in serious trouble — evidence of serious demand degradation. Now I am not screaming FIRE at all - I am just putting it on the table to consider....add in the  'unknown exposure'  in the derivative mkts and you can see how it could get a bit dicey. Think August 24th....... (and I say unknown for a reason - because it IS UNKNOWN - no matter what they tell you.... - think the housing crisis and all of the insurance products created to protect everyone from loss - REALLY???)  I'm just sayin.......   If - like in August - the mkt hits a pocket of air and goes into free fall - the additional pressure created by all of the varied 'synthetic products' - products that are highly leveraged -  will only exacerbate the move......and then we'll get another SEC report 8 months later -  that will try to explain the move.......it's fairly simple - They have allowed the level of complication and risk to rise beyond what is reasonably considered to be controllable.......what do we need to see next to wake them up?This morning we see global mkts under a bit of pressure and as the year ends here are the ytd numbers: Japan +9.9%, Hong Kong -7%, China +9.4%, ASX -2.1% FTSE -4.8%, CAC 40 +9%, DAX +9.5%, EUROSTOXX +4.1%, SPAIN -7%, ITALY +12.6%US Futures are flat this morning.....as the S&P  ended the day at 2063 yesterday - essentially flat on the year.  I suspect that they will work hard to close the mkt above 2058 and they may even try to rally it to 2100......(wishful thinking.). For us - the year looks like this:  DOW -1.2%, S&P +0.22%, Nasdaq +7%.Let me take a min to thank each and every one of you for being a Morning Thoughts reader.   I appreciate the comments that you send back as I try to respond to everyone that  offers opinion or analysis.  It has been my pleasure to both feed you financially as well as physically.  I hope you enjoy the 'boots on the ground' down home style.  I wish each of you - continued good health, prosperity and love of family and friends as we enter the new year.    Take Good CareKPKenny Polcari is Vice President and director of NYSE Floor Operations on behalf of O’Neil Securities, Inc., a sister company of Investor's Business Daily.

139,LEG,"Two heads can be better than one. Or, if not better, at least less volatile. For proof, look no further than $25.6 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX).The $25.6 billion portfolio, which is sold through financial advisors, is up 4.75% this year going into Monday. Its stablemate is $108.5 billion Contrafund (FCNTX). Both funds have marquee manager Will Danoff at the helm. New Insights — once a clone of Contrafund — has behaved differently since John Roth became co-manager three years ago.Contrafund's 9.27% average annual gain ranks in the top 1% of large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 15 years. New Insight's 7.95% ranks in the top 38% over the past 10 years. But so far this year New Insights 4.75% gain is in the top 14% of the same peer group vs. top 38% for Contrafund's 2.62% gain.Roth's portfolio picks go a long way to explaining why two top-notch funds, sharing a lead manager, have performed differently in the short term. Roth and Danoff talk together a lot and powwow formally once a week. But they run separate sleeves of Insights' securities.Differences in their picks add diversification. ""That gives us more ability to weather volatility,"" Roth said.On Friday, New Insights had a trio of 2%-plus gainers, as Netflix (NFLX), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) each tacked on more than two percentage points.Netflix announced a deal last week with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to expand its global footprint. That's a key goal as the company nears saturation in the U.S. Customers of the jumbo global cable operator will be able to access Netflix content via Liberty set top boxes, but Netflix will retain a billing relationship with viewers. Netflix has recently announced other deals with other cable operators, including Comcast (CMCSA). And this month it is slated to become the exclusive viewing platform for certain films made by Walt Disney (DIS).Tesla rose amid an intensifying friction with former BFF (best friends forever, as the kids say) Mobileye (MBLY). Tesla accused Mobileye of trying to throw a monkey wrench into its efforts to develop vision chips on its own. Mobileye said it ended its relationship with Tesla in July because the electric car maker was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety.""Tesla said Mobileye bailed because Tesla was planning to rely more on radar systems and less on camera-based driver-assistance systems such as those developed by Mobileye.IBD'S TAKE: Our Ed Carson digs into details of the spiraling cat fight between Tesla and Mobileye in this report.Tesla's 6% share price surge Friday -- lifting it 6% for the entire week -- and Mobileye's pullback show which side investors favor in this feud.New Insights owns both stocks.As for UnitedHealth, its Friday rise was on good volume. The stock is shaping a flat base with a 144.58 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about UnitedHealth's prognosis, see how it stacks up against other stocks in its industry at IBD's Stock Checkup.Roth says some stocks he likes today reflect his past experiences at the helms of Fidelity's sector funds focused on multimedia, chemicals and utilities. ""I'm opportunistic, with a growth bias and a valuation sensibility,"" he said.Roth, who also runs $3 billion New Millennium (FMILX), says he prefers fewer stocks in his sleeve of New Insights than Danoff. He also tilts more to midcaps. His eye on valuation recently has led Roth to beaten-down names in energy and financials.Among the names in New Insights that are not in Contrafund, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence: American International Group (AIG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Antero Resources (AR), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Chevron (CVX), Energy Transfer Equity (ETE), Exelon (EXC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).""I'm more of the energy guy,"" Roth said. ""I do think there are points in time when you want different cyclical groups.""Share prices of most of the energy names, for example, have yet to perk up a lot. But Roth says the conditions for a rebound are falling into place. U.S. production is sliding, he says, adding, ""Share prices are down, demand (for energy) is relatively good and we've seen a massive amount of capital come out of the space over the past 12 to 18 months. Rig count is down 40% to 60%. Hundreds of billions of dollars in exploration-and-production cap ex has come out.""Roth describes his thesis as of his latest disclosure for Diamondback Energy (FANG): ""We have bigger diversified companies, some service companies and smaller U.S.-focused E&Ps,"" he said. ""Diamondback is a classic one of those. It is an independent E&P with a good spot in the Permian Basin. It has great acreage that it will exploit at attractive costs.""Energy accounted for about 8% of New Insights' assets, its fifth-largest sector by weight, as of July 31. Contra has about 2% in the sector and New Millennium 16%.Technology, with a 26% weighting, is tops. The fund's top-three holdings are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The fund has been trimming Facebook, but only to take profits and prevent the stake from getting too big. It was about 5% as of July 31. ""It's still our largest relative bet. It is our most important stock,"" said Roth.One leg of Facebook's appeal has been its success in shifting from a web focus to a mobile one. Another has been its success at remaining relevant to users through platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. A third has been its ability to show advertisers the link between an ad and a sale. ""That's the ability to optimize ad campaigns and (let advertisers) see the return on investment,"" he said.Google is a similar story, Roth adds.Amazon's retail and music businesses do well, Roth says. But Amazon's key improvement is its AWS web services business. It wasn't until mid-2015 that Amazon broke out AWS' financial results. ""Investors were surprised by how profitable the business is,"" Roth said. ""It is a complete game-changer.""AWS has proved more attractive than rival services from Google, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT), he adds.The cloud-services platform lets customers rent all the capacity they need at peak times, even if most of the time they need far less. Thus they avoid hefty capital expenditures.In summarizing their teamwork, Roth says that Danoff uses more small starting positions in individual stocks. Roth makes bigger initial buys. ""Our process keeps evolving,"" Roth said. ""I'm excited about it.""RELATED:Diamondback Dominates Shale-Rich Permian Basin With Conservative DealsHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The DownturnP-s-s-st!

140,LEG,"A number of biotech stocks rose Wednesday. Biotech is one of the few groups holding up well during a time when the market uptrend is under pressure.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) stock jumped 27% Wednesday, to an eight-month high of 32.45. It is recovering from a huge 75% decline early this year. Last week, a Food and Drug Administration staff member who had argued against approval for a key Sarepta drug left the FDA for a job in the private sector, raising hopes for the drug's approval, multiple media sources reported Wednesday. The Sarepta drug is eteplirsen, to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The FDA continues to review the drug.The exit of the FDA staff member, Dr. Ron Farkas, is a plus for the Sarepta drug, but not the biggest plus, Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a research note Wednesday, in which he hiked his price target on Sarepta stock to 47 from 26.  Farkas ""was not the only skeptic and frankly we do not believe he personally held enough power to be a deciding factor,"" Messer wrote.Instead, Messer said the company likely will provide the desired trial results to support approval of the drug.Sarepta had plenty of company on the upswing Wednesday. Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals (RARE) got a bullish report from Credit Suisse on Wednesday, ahead of Friday's start of the annual meeting for the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Credit Suisse expects Ultragenyx to report solid trial results for its drug to treat XLH, a bone disease with symptoms that include leg bowing in childhood and dental abscesses. Long-term medical therapy is the usual diagnosis for the disease.Ultragenyx stock rose 3.2% in the stock market today, to 72.13 and touching a three-month high. It remains in a deep price consolidation.IBD's 419-company biotech industry group rose 2% Wednesday. The group has been on the move, now ranking No. 15 out of 197 groups, up from No. 36 four weeks ago, No. 89 eight weeks ago and No. 171 13 weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: If a group is rising, it will almost surely soon be featured in IBD's weekly Industry Snapshot, if not already there. It's a good idea to regularly check out this feature for a deep dive into some of the best-performing industry groups.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) rose 1.2%, after Monday's gain of 3%, its biggest one-day jump since June. The ETF is forming a base with a 299.58 buy point.Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIA) rose 3.5% and extended from a July 28 breakout, Seattle Genetics (SGEN) jumped 4.6% and also extended from a July breakout, and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) soared 7.9% to an eight-month high as it tries to recover from  a severe decline. A rise of 5.7% sent Exelixis (EXEL) soaring to a 14-year high. It too is extended.In a research note Wednesday, RBC Capital Markets pointed to a related group, saying that ""select pharma names are beginning to show signs of stabilizing/bottoming: MNK, AGN.""Allergan (AGN) stock rose 2% Wednesday, while Mallinckrodt (MNK) rose 1%.RELATED:Top New Issue Patheon Helps Turn New Ideas Into RealityCelgene, Kite and Vertex Are 3 Biotechs To Watch In September

141,LEG,"Conspiracy theorists are having a grand ol' time trying to explain what was wrong with Hillary Clinton when she fainted/fell/collapsed/seized up during Sunday's 9/11 ceremony in New York. There's talk about the black van that she was hauled into being a disguised ambulance; conjecture about what appeared to be some mechanical part slipping out of her pants leg as she was being scooted across the sidewalk by helpers for boarding; and speculation that she's suffering from dementia or Parkinson's disease -- or possibly both.But maybe the explanation is not so mysterious and is, in fact, hidden in plain sight.In January 2013, aide Huma Abedin emailed Clinton a Fox News story headlined ""Hillary Clinton's Blood Clot Treatment And The Need For Privacy."" In that article, Dr. Marc Siegel discussed Clinton's condition -- right transverse sinus thrombosis.It is, he wrote, ""a fancy term for a blood clot forming in one of the main sinuses (a drain) of the brain."" The clot, Siegel added, ""can lead to brain swelling or a stroke, and it is certainly life threatening.""Symptoms that are associated with the condition, says the Johns Hopkins health library, include fainting or loss of consciousness, loss of control over movement in part of the body, and seizures. Anyone who has seen the video of Clinton collapsing Sunday would have to admit that they were watching the first two in that list. We don't know if she lost consciousness, but she sure appeared to faint. And she did lose some motor control -- that is beyond dispute.As for the seizures, well, maybe this wasn't one. But it would have been, according to our media, if a Republican candidate looked as if he or she were having a convulsion.More than three years ago, Siegel said that Clinton ""can look forward to a full recovery with the help of her careful devoted physicians,"" so maybe Sunday's episode wasn't related to what he discussed in his article. But he also mentioned that she has a history of blood clots. Was her spell evidence of another? The clots can return. Once treated doesn't always mean healed.Also consistent with Sunday's incident and Clinton's history was Abedin's admission four years ago that Clinton is ""often confused."" Clotconnect.org says sinus and cerebral vein clots ""can lead to severe headaches, confusion and stroke-like symptoms."" We can't see Clinton's face from the available videos, but from behind she did not look like someone who was acutely aware of her surroundings.She appeared to be unresponsive, which is not the same as confused, but the empty gaze of a profoundly confused person can make them look as if they are not there.It's not clear what happened to Clinton. But this much is obvious: Something out of the ordinary and quite alarming occurred, and her top aide expressed concern in the past about a life-threatening condition that shows symptoms much like those seen in the video. Maybe the media will now start trying to provide a public service and dig into her health problems.If a reporter can move next door to Sarah Palin to try to get dirt on her, then the press corps can spare a few of its sycophants to do some real journalism.

145,LEG,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 indicated modest gains at Monday's open following strong market gains last week. Investors will get a key reading on the U.S. economy Monday, with earnings from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on tap following Friday's selloff in chip stocks.Last week the Nasdaq composite rose 2.3%, its best showing since January, with the tech-heavy index hitting record highs. The S&P 500 index climbed 1.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.9%, both close to all-time levels.Futures for the Dow industrials rose near 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. In overseas trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.55%. Many major Asian and European markets were closed for the international labor day holiday.Advanced Micro Devices is one of a handful of earnings reports on Monday, ahead of Tuesday, when Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA), Papa John's (PZZA), a pair of fiber-optic plays and dozens more release quarterly earnings.AMD is expected to report a 4-cent per-share loss after Monday's market close, narrowing vs. a 12-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue should climb 18% to $984.38 million. For the full year, AMD is expected to turn an 8-cent profit vs. a 14-cent loss a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: All-time winning stocks tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of big price moves. Here are the five ""top 5%"" stocks with earnings due this week.AMD shares have been trying to get above their 50-day moving average, moving above that key support intraday on Thursday and Friday but turning back, falling 2.3% to 13.30 in Friday stock market trading.AMD is working on a double-bottom base. A double-bottom pattern is a ""W""-shaped consolidation in which the second leg of the W undercuts that first. As a result, AMD has a potential buy point at 14.85, jut above the center of the ""W.""AMD's chips are used for PC gaming graphics as well as new AI uses. Its results and guidance may offer clues for rival Nvidia (NVDA), which reports on May 9.AMD and Nvidia have similar-looking chart patterns at first glance. But there is a key difference. In Nvidia's case, the second leg of the ""W"" did not quite undercut the intraday low of the first leg. That means it did not shake out as many weak holders as AMD's true double-bottom. Thus, Nvidia's potential buy point for now is 121.02, just above the old high. Nvidia's stock has moved just above its 50-day line.AMD's report also will key for the chip sector, which has been a leading group but faltered at the end of last week. Intel (INTC), which just missed on sales late Thursday, fell 3.4%. But Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sank 4.3% and 5.2% despite better-than-expected profits and sales.Skyworks dragged down other Apple iPhone chipmakers, including Qorvo (QRVO), which fell 4.3%. Qorvo technically fell back into buy range but the heavy-volume decline to just below the 50-day line raises concerns. Qorvo reports earnings Wednesday.For iPhone chipmakers generally, Apple earnings late Tuesday may be the big mover. Expect another quarter of slim profit and sales growth. Investors are betting on strong demand for the upcoming iPhone 8, and perhaps new buybacks and higher dividends from Apple's huge cash pile.The Institute for Supply Management will release its April manufacturing survey at 10 a.m. ET.

""As part of the discussion on technical collaboration, Honda could initially provide Waymo with vehicles modified to accommodate Waymo's self-driving technology. These vehicles would join Waymo's existing fleet, which are currently being tested across four U.S. cities.If an agreement is reached, Honda R&D engineers would work closely with Waymo engineers.Waymo's technology is already being added to 100 Pacifica minivans from Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reportedly had previously sought alliances with Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, which recently confirmed that it is not interested in making cars itself. GM is testing self-driving cars in Michigan, while Uber is doing the same in Pittsburgh. Uber briefly tested such vehicles in California, but halted that after the state DMV revoked their registrations.Mobileye (MBLY) and Delphi (DLPH) plan to show off their autonomous driving tech for at CES show in early January.Apple (AAPL) also reportedly is working on autonomous driving, via its rumored Project Titan.

Facebook Live lets users stream up to four hours of video, which is stored and can be replayed. On Monday, Facebook announced a new way to go live on Facebook, by using its Live 360 platform.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. Strong earnings growth (the C and A in the CAN SLIM System) is the No. 1 factor to look for in a stock, but new products or services are what ultimately generate stellar profitability.To access the live video feature on Instagram, users swipe right from the home page to open the camera, then tap the ""Start Live Video"" button and start sharing for up to an hour. But the stories are not stored, meaning once the live video is over, that's it.Facebook stock closed 1.6% lower at 117.77 in the stock market today. The stock is trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Facebook acquired Instagram for about $1 billion in 2012.

150,LEG,"Tyson Foods (TSN) and Sanderson Farms (SAFM) are among the companies being asked by officials in Georgia, the nation's largest producer of chickens, to meet new requirements for a price index as the agency makes changes amid concerns about the reliability of the benchmark.The Georgia Department of Agriculture is asking the companies and their representatives to submit affidavits and attestations declaring the price data they supply for the weekly so-called Georgia Dock index is accurate. The documents are due Tuesday, agency spokeswoman Julie McPeake said Monday. Companies that don't meet the new requirements won't be able to participate in the index.Tyson, the largest U.S. chicken producer, continues to provide pricing data to the department but is considering whether to submit the affidavit, company spokesman Worth Sparkman said by telephone Monday. Sanderson said last week it's also considering signing the affidavit.""We've used it for 40 years and everybody's always had a lot of confidence in it,"" Sanderson Chief Financial Officer Mike Cockrell said of the index in a recent telephone interview. ""I hope they get this right because as I say, we've used it so long.""The changes to Georgia's pricing methodology come amid heightened scrutiny of the index. Tyson and Sanderson are among producers named as defendants in a series of lawsuits filed since September alleging supply collusion in the industry starting in 2008 to drive up prices. The companies deny the allegations.The Georgia Dock price index ""is highly susceptible to collusion,"" according to a revised complaint filed in Chicago federal court. The lawsuit previously mainly alleged supply collusion that led to higher prices.Another source of concern has been criticism of the weekly chicken-price report from Arty Schronce, director of the Georgia Department of Agriculture. Writing in September in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News, Schronce complained of inadequate resources and a lack of cooperation from the chicken producers, and said the department should perhaps consider eliminating the report altogether.Tyson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about Schronce's criticisms of chicken producers while Sanderson declined to comment. Schronce couldn't be reached for comment.Responding to the comments about a lack of resources, McPeake at the Georgia Department of Agriculture said one of Schronce's colleagues died unexpectedly. The agency made ""every effort"" to train him and brought in a retired employee to help Schronce with the transition, she said.McPeake also said there are conflicting reports about how important the index is to the industry, and that it could be terminated if it's determined not to be worthwhile. If the index is needed, the department is working to make sure the gauge is an accurate and informative trend analysis tool, she said.The Georgia Department of Agriculture compiles prices for chicken products such as breasts, leg quarters and whole birds, plus the benchmark Georgia Dock index, which is widely used as the basis of prices paid by wholesalers and retailers. Published on Wednesdays, the index is an average of offering prices for birds weighing 2.5 to 3 pounds (1.1 to 1.4 kilos) as reported by producers. Each company's contribution is weighted based on production capacity.Tyson spokesman Sparkman said the index was only used to price 3% to 4% of Tyson's chicken sales. While Sanderson has confidence in the accuracy of Georgia Dock, the potential disappearance of the index would have a minimal impact on the company, which would simply use another price-discovery mechanism, Cockrell said.Still, the Georgia Dock has been a benchmark used across the country by retailers and other large buyers. Until recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture used the index in its own poultry-market news report. The USDA said earlier this month it discontinued the report as it worked with the Georgia Department of Agriculture to ""ensure that poultry producers and retailers have access to the transparent and reliable data they need.""The state is working on the new pricing formula with the University of Georgia, the USDA and the Poultry Federation. McPeake said the state agency intends to release details in the near future.Tyson rose 0.1% to $58.40 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. The shares are up 9.4% this year. Sanderson climbed 1.3% to $81.62. It has gained 6.4% in 2016.

161,LEG,"Each year the U.S. Census Bureau releases its data on poverty. And each year the news seems even worse than the year before. This year is no different, with Census informing us in its annual report that some 43.1 million Americans, or about 13.5% of us, were officially poor in 2015.The number of poor fell during the year as the nation continued to climb out of the economic crater left by the economy's financial implosion in 2008 and 2009. But still, one out of seven of us were officially deemed poor. Could that be right?To start with, yes, we should all feel sympathy for those less well off and do what we can to give them a leg up. That said, the poverty report isn't what it seems, as Heritage Foundation poverty expert Robert Rector and Rebecca Sheffield write.They note that, contrary to the rhetoric of the left and the misleading data from the government, the 43 million in poverty number is vastly exaggerated.They cite 15 facts about poverty that most Americans don't know. Here are a few:By the way, the data on electrical appliances come from a 2009 survey, so the percentages are quite likely even higher today.OK, but what about things like hunger? Hasn't that come back with a vengeance?In a word, no.How can all this be?Well, Rector and Sheffield note, most measures of poverty don't take into account government welfare and aid of different types. They basically ignore the existence of a massive, quite generous welfare state.As they note, in 2014 the government laid out some $1 trillion on means-tested welfare for the poor. And no, that doesn't include Social Security or Medicare. Welfare outlays for cash, food and housing totaled some $342 billion.All told, that spending is enough to push all the poor to about 150% of the poverty level. There is, in fact, very little actual poverty in the U.S., thanks to a generous welfare system.The main thing, the authors suggest, is to stop just giving money to people -- and to do something to help them up and out of the welfare system, which at times can be a trap, and into a job.Yet, the left uses the poverty data as a bludgeon to boost their pro-union, anti-capitalist agenda, and to foist new taxes on gullible middle-income Americans who are made to feel guilty for all the poor.

162,LEG,"As you watch your children board the school bus for the first day back to classes, consider this: that school bus driver is likely forced to pay fees to a union as a condition of driving that bus, as are the teachers at the public school where the school bus driver will drop them off.Why? Because they work in one of the 24 forced-unionism states in America; states where union officials have been granted the power to force a worker to pay fees to a union as a condition of employment, and have them fired if they dare to refuse.You're not alone if this sounds absurd. In the last national Gallup poll that asked, nearly 80% of your fellow Americans agreed:  No worker should be forced to pay union fees as a condition of employment.  This overwhelming support for Right to Work included significant majorities of Republicans, Democrats and Independent voters.Big Labor union bosses in your state enjoy a special privilege allowing them to expand their ranks through compulsion. Union bosses can impose a monopoly bargaining contract which includes a forced-dues clause that requires every employee (even the ones who did not vote for the union) to pay tribute to the union officials, just for the privilege of having a job.While forced-unionism is just plain wrong, coercing workers into subsidizing union officials also holds back a state's economy.With West Virginia joining the ranks in February of this year, there are now 26 Right to Work states in America that have outlawed Big Labor union bosses' ability to force workers to pay them fees as a condition of employment.The absence of forced-unionism gives Right to Work states an economic leg-up.According to the National Institute for Labor Relations Research (NILRR), from 2005-2015, civilian employment growth was more than twice as high in Right to Work states compared to non-Right to Work states (9.1% to 4.0%).NILRR also reports that, last year, residents of Right to Work states had on average per capita nearly three thousand dollars more to spend in cost-of-living-adjusted disposable personal income ($41,112 to $38,212).Of course, the better economic climate might explain why NILRR reports that, from 2005 to 2015, Right to Work states saw their resident population in their peak earning years (age 35-54) grow by more than 3% while non-Right to Work states suffered a peak earning year population decline of more than 6%. Americans are voting with their feet and Right to Work states are winning.And that's why in just the last four years, four former bastions of Big Labor -- Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and most recently West Virginia -- have all passed Right to Work laws, freeing their workers from Big Labor's ironclad grip.Right to Work laws do not outlaw labor unions, and they do not prevent any worker from joining one.Right to Work laws merely state one simple principle of freedom: every worker should have the choice to join a labor union, but no worker should be forced to pay fees to a union as condition of employment.So as you celebrate this three-day weekend, consider the benefits of Right to Work. Consider your unemployed neighbor that might find a job. Consider the new manufacturing plant that might open its doors. Consider what you might do with an extra $2,900 of spending power in your pocket.Will your state be the next Right to Work state?

163,LEG,"Consumer confidence increased to an almost one-year high in August as Americans became more optimistic about the labor market, according to a report from the New York-based Conference Board on Tuesday.Confidence index advanced to 101.1 (forecast was 97), the highest since September, from 96.7.

Such optimism signals that consumer spending, coming off the best quarter since the end of 2014, will stay robust and provide the economy with a leg up in the third quarter.""Consumers' assessment of both current business and labor market conditions was considerably more favorable than last month,"" Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. ""Short-term expectations regarding business and employment conditions, as well as personal income prospects, also improved, suggesting the possibility of a moderate pickup in growth in the coming months.""Consumers were more optimistic about the labor market, as 14.2%, the most since October, said more jobs will be available in six months, up from 13.5%.

166,LEG,"President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order calling for the Commerce secretary and U.S. trade representative to prepare a report identifying the causes of the U.S. trade deficit and policies that have left U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. The report may prove quite useful — as long as it doesn't overlook harmful policies that are ""Made in the USA.""Yes, many other nations have enacted policies designed to give their domestic producers a leg up on foreign competition. But some of the biggest obstacles to U.S. commercial exports result from our own government's destructive policies.Consider U.S. budgetary policy, for example. Washington now habitually spends hundreds of billions of dollars a year more than it takes in from tax revenue. Last year alone, the federal deficit was over $600 billion.The government finances these deficits by selling U.S. Treasury securities. Some are bought by domestic lenders, while others are ""exported"" to people in other countries.This is a big deal. Since 2008, exports of treasury securities have exceeded combined exports of U.S. aircraft, cars, and agricultural products.Economists have debated the possible relationship between budget deficits and trade deficits for decades. But everything else being equal, if the $3.6 trillion dollars the government borrowed from abroad since 2008 had instead been spent on privately produced U.S. goods and services, the trade deficit would have been 79% smaller.Another made-in-the-USA challenge for exporters is that the United States has fallen behind other countries in the race to sign barrier-reducing trade agreements.For instance, after the North American Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect, Mexico negotiated trade agreements that enable European-based carmakers to send parts to Mexico tariff-free and to export autos back to Europe tariff-free. The Center for Automotive Research estimates that Europeans save $2,500 in tariffs when they import a midsize car from Mexico instead of from the United States, simply because Mexico has free trade agreements with the European Union and the European Free Trade Association and the United States does not.Mexico's free trade agreements give the country an increasingly significant edge in attracting investment from carmakers. As Audi Chairman Rupert Stadler explained when he announced the company's decision to produce its Q5 SUV in Mexico: ""With this facility, we have established an important site for the export of our automobiles to customers all over the world. The country has free-trade agreements with more than 50 countries and therefore offers ideal economic conditions. Mexico is a powerhouse for automobiles and automotive components.""There are plenty of other areas where the Trump Administration can do a better job than its predecessors, helping U.S. businesses become more efficient competitors around the world.For example, U.S. businesses struggle under the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. According to Heritage Senior Fellow David Burton, ""The current tax system is economically destructive, unfair and, due to its complexity, imposes high compliance costs on society. It needs to be substantially reformed.""Excessive and hugely expensive regulation also needlessly drives up the cost of doing business in America. During the Obama era, regulations added more than $100 billion to annual regulatory costs. Heritage's James Gattuso, co-author of the think tank's ""Red Tape Rising"" report, argues: ""Reforms of the regulatory process are critically needed. Without decisive action, the costs of red tape will continue to grow, and the economy — and average Americans — will be the victims.""The export-control system that governs sales of militarily sensitive products is also ripe for reform. Not only is the system itself needlessly complicated, it has erected standards that can be counterproductive, both economically and militarily. As a result, U.S. industries can find themselves at a disadvantage in marketing their products — even to close and reliable allies.The Trump administration is committed to developing an ""America first"" trade strategy that makes it more desirable for companies to stay here, create jobs here and pay taxes here. If it is going to succeed, it will first need to tackle U.S. government policies that make it harder for Americans to compete in the global economy.

That's just shy of its all-time high of 55.76, reached on Nov. 18.The Bedford, Mass.-based company has been on a tear since it posted better-than-expected third-quarter results on Oct. 25. IRobot earned 70 cents a share, up 67% year over year, on sales of $169 million, up 17%, in the quarter ended Oct. 1. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected iRobot to earn 43 cents a share on sales of $157 million.In addition to its Roomba line of robotic vacuum cleaners, iRobot also has a growing business in wet-floor cleaning robots in its Braava line of machines. Plus, iRobot sells Mirra pool-cleaning robots and Looj gutter-cleaning robots.IBD'S TAKE: IRobot stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

169,LEG,"The stock market's surge postelection marks another leg up in its solid rally this year. While ETFs investing in large, midsize and small companies are all notching new highs, the runts lead the pack.Investors in exchange traded funds may be rewarded ahead for thinking small.Interest rates are widely expected to accelerate their rise under President-elect Donald Trump. While rising rates generally go hand-in-hand with economic growth and are good for all equities, small caps could especially benefit.""Since small caps tend to have a higher sensitivity to the market, they historically have outperformed large caps on the upside,"" said Joseph Tenaglia, an asset allocation strategist at WisdomTree.During periods of climbing 10-year Treasury yields since 1964, small-cap companies — with a market capitalization of between $200 million and $2 billion — consistently outperformed large companies with over $10 billion in market cap, WisdomTree's research shows.That held true no matter whether the yields nudged up less than 0.5%, rose more sharply more than 1%, or rose more moderately between 0.5% and 1%.That finding may surprise some investors who believe rising interest rates weigh on stocks in general and especially on small-cap firms, which need to borrow more capital to grow.But what's key, Tenaglia told IBD via email, is the path and drivers of rising interest rates.IBD'S TAKE: Small companies can be especially tough to research. So IBD's Stock Checkup tool is a quick way to get a handle on the key traits of small-cap stocks and the top holdings of small-cap ETFs.When rates are rising because of better growth expectations and more government and/or consumer spending — as widely expected under Trump — small caps tend to respond more nimbly to those improving conditions.""If rates are rising for other reasons, then, of course, the ultimate results also could be different,"" he added.Investors in small-cap funds could be disappointed if economic growth and rate increases fail to materialize. Plus, investing in small caps entails higher risk alongside possibly higher returns.Looking ahead, market watchers generally expect a gradual path for rate hikes.When rates are rising moderately, factors such as earnings yield (the ratio of earnings per share to the share price) and operating profitability appear to become an even bigger determinant of outperformance than size, WisdomTree's research shows.""We recommend positioning toward strategies that are small-cap focused with high earnings yields and strong operating profitability, as those should do well in a rising rate environment,"" Tenaglia wrote on Nov. 14.These three ETFs feature ""smart beta"" strategies that use alternatives to the traditional cap-weighting of stocks:The largest exchange traded funds — including iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) and Vanguard Small-Cap (VB) — are cap-weighted.Critics of cap-weighting argue that it links the weight of a stock holding to its price, so the more expensive a stock, the bigger its stake in the portfolio.PRFZ has modestly outperformed these cap-weighted, small-cap rivals over the past 10 years with an 8.6% annual average gain. Smart-beta peers EES and FNDA do not have a 10-year history.Since the Nov. 8 election outcome, small-cap stocks have significantly outperformed their large- and midcap brethren.The bellwether small-cap ETF, iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) is up roughly 11% during this period.By comparison, iShares Core S&P 500 (IVV) gained 3% and iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH) added 7%.All three ETFs made fresh highs on the stock market today as they trade at their best levels since their May 2000 launch.Demand for small-cap ETFs has kept pace with the performance.IWM alone raked in $1.17 billion in the week ended Nov. 21, according to analytics firm Xtf.com. Flow of new money into the $36.34 billion ETF has sharply accelerated in the past 12 days relative to the past 200 days.RELATED:There's More To Small-Cap ETF Surge Than Trump AloneSmall-Cap Rally Offers Investors Alternatives To Big-Cap Multinationals

171,LEG,"Federal Spending: Republicans found room in their trillion-dollar budget for Planned Parenthood clinics, climate-change slush funds, sanctuary cities and nearly every other liberal priority, but one program actually got axed.Unfortunately, that was the Washington, D.C., school voucher program that has helped thousands of at-risk poor students attend private schools.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues worked with the teacher unions to prevent reauthorization of the vouchers, although all evidence shows that they're working. As far as we can tell, it may have been the only program killed this year.The D.C. scholarship program was launched in 2004, and parents of the voucher kids — almost all of whom are minorities — call it a ""godsend.""One 2010 study by researchers at the University of Arkansas for the U.S. Department of Education found that students who received the vouchers to go to private D.C. schools have been 21% more likely to graduate from high school than a control group that did not receive the funds.The social benefits from higher education rates in terms of lifetime earnings were found to be more than double the cost of the program. The private schools were also found to be safer, with higher levels of parental satisfaction.The results of the D.C. program mirror the success of other school voucher programs in cities such as Milwaukee, Wis.We spend billions a year on Head Start and other trendy education initiatives, and few can boast a comparable record of achievement. But the National Education Association couldn't care less, because vouchers for kids to go to nonunionized private and parochial schools threaten its steely handed control.The success story of the voucher experiment only redoubled its urgent resolve to shut it down.Democratic politicians have long been the handmaidens of the union bosses, and the well-being of school kids always comes a distant second to lining the unions' pockets. So their opposition to the voucher program comes as no surprise.The shocker is that none of the Republicans fought to save the program. The lame excuse from the GOP leadership: Democrats refused to allow the funding, so it was killed.Excuse us? Last time we checked, Republicans controlled both houses of Congress. Why didn't they go to war with the Democrats on this? Why didn't they stand with the thousands of black parents who pleaded with President Obama to restore the program? Even Washington's mayor lobbied for keeping it.Ironically, some of the voucher kids attend the same private schools as President Obama's daughters. Do liberals believe that only rich people should have access to great schools?As one voucher parent complained: ""We should be able to send our kids to the schools Obama does. He lives in public housing, too.""The vouchers provide about $10,000 of taxpayer assistance per child, or less than half of what it costs to educate a child in D.C. schools. So the program leaves more money per pupil in the government schools. At $180 million a year, the cost of the program is about 1% of the Department of Education budget.There is still a chance that the vouchers could be resurrected because the existing funding doesn't run out until the end of next year. But Republicans, including new Speaker Paul Ryan, need to go all-out to save it — even if it leads to a government shutdown.Liberals don't have a leg to stand on, and what better way for Republicans to persuade blacks and Hispanics that the party cares about them and their kids?This voucher program was designed as a real-life experiment on whether school choice improves student performance. We now know it does. Such programs should be expanded to other failing school districts, not shut down.If Republicans won't insist on reinstating the D.C. program, they're as big a part of the problem as the Democrats and unions.

175,LEG,"Gold stocks and gold exchange traded funds fell on Tuesday, pressured by a stronger dollar and data showing American consumer confidence hit a 12-month high in August.Additionally, a Fed official added to a recent chorus of hawkish remarks from policymakers. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said in an interview Tuesday that the U.S. job market is nearly at full strength, and that the pace of interest rate hikes will depend on the strength of the economy, according to news reports.Gold bugs await payrolls data later this week for further clues on the path of monetary tightening.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) slid 1% to 125.03 on the stock market today, approaching the July 25 consolidation low of 125.11. This commodity ETF sold off Friday in big volume after Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the case for raising interest rates has ""strengthened"" in recent months.GLD has fallen in six of the past 10 sessions and now sits nearly 5% below its early July high of 131.15.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) slumped 4.85% on Tuesday alone. Among its top 10 holdings, several stocks such as Newmont Mining (NEM) and Randgold (GOLD) fell 5.65% and 4.7%, respectively. Newmont crashed through its 50-day line last week. So did Randgold, which has now lost all its winnings from a late June breakout.GDX is one of the most popular ways to play a rally among 29 gold and precious metal stocks. Silver-backed exchange traded funds show a similar overall trend, including iShares Silver Trust (SLV), which lost 1.2%.IBD'S TAKE: To find sector equity ETFs from the best industry groups, check out ETF Center.""The price of gold (reflected in GLD) appears at risk to correct over the near-term following the strong year-to-date gains and breach of its 50-day moving average,"" Ari Wald, a senior technical analyst at Oppenheimer told IBD in an email Tuesday.Wald noted that this is GLD's first drop below its 50-day line -- a critical line of institutional support -- since the start of the latest leg of its rally. ""Many protective stops were likely placed here and triggered simultaneously given the rise in volume during the drop,"" he said. The 50-day at $127 now indicates near-term resistance.Wald does not believe the yellow metal's long-term bullish reversal is at risk ""because the drop wasn't confirmed with a simultaneous breakout in the U.S. dollar.""Due to the inverse correlation between gold and the dollar, Wald said he would be more concerned if there were significant signs of renewed strength in the greenback.He added: ""The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has instead been range bound between 92-100 over the last year (between $24-$26 for the PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish ETF (UUP)), and the recent rally over the last week hasn't altered this range. In addition, recent weakness for GLD is occurring following a strong uptrend rather than coming out of a major topping pattern. We'd be more concerned if GLD's breakdown was preceded by several months of distribution."" Distribution is a technical term for institutional selling.Overall, Wald interprets these factors as indicating a likely ""healthy"" correction for GLD, rather than a new downtrend. However, he cautioned a ""healthy"" correction still requires time.He suggested investors in GLD watch for near-term support at $125. ""The ability to hold this level, or not, should separate a sideways correction from one a bit steeper, because the next support level below here is $120, by our analysis.""GLD has jumped 23% year to date through Aug. 30, but has slipped more than 3% so far this month.GLD ETF tracks the price of gold and is the year's top asset gatherer among all exchange traded funds, according to analytics firm XTF.com. It has seen $12.61 billion in net inflow in 2016 through Aug. 29, but has leaked $46 million month to date.RELATED:Bank ETF Surges To Highest Level In 2016 Amid Rate Hopes; Oil Is ChoppyIs Gold ETF Rally Over?Gold ETF Breaks Key Support Level

176,LEG,"Gold prices slid further Wednesday as investors awaited clues on the Federal Reserve's next interest-rate decision later this week. Fed Chair Janet Yellen and other central bankers are set to meet in Jackson Hole, Wyo., this weekend for their annual symposium.The precious metal came under pressure last week when a slew of hawkish comments from policymakers following bullish jobs data raised the odds of monetary tightening.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), a commodity ETF, slipped 1.1% on the stock market today, closing below the 50-day moving average as it fell to its lowest level since July 27.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), which invests in gold stocks, tumbled 7.1% as it fell solidly under that 50-day key line of technical strength. Top holdings like Barrick Gold (ABX) and Newmont Mining (NEM) were gouged as much as 10%. (IBD)Gold prices hit a four-week low in early Wednesday trading, pressured by bearish outside markets, wrote Jim Wyckoff, a Kitco senior technical analyst.""Some sell-stop orders were triggered in the futures market after key near-term technical support levels were breached,"" Wyckoff said. ""Also, the outside markets are in a bearish posture for the precious metals on this day, as crude oil prices are lower, and the U.S. dollar index is higher.""In an email to IBD, Wyckoff noted that while gold prices are in a near-term downtrend, the trend over the past year ""suggests the path of least resistance will remain up, until a bearish technical signal occurs."" The close below the 50-day Wednesday for GLD and GDX could be interpreted by some investors as bearish.However, an Oppenheimer analyst believes the long-term turnaround for the precious metal commodity should stay in play.""Recent weakness is occurring following a strong uptrend rather than coming out of a major topping pattern,"" Ari Wald, an Oppenheimer senior technical analyst, told IBD in an e-mail. Wald said he would be more concerned if the weakness was preceded by a lengthy period of distribution. He also noted that the U.S. dollar was not breaking higher.""Due to their inverse correlation, I'd be more concerned that renewed strength in the dollar would derail this year's reversal in commodities priced in dollars. (The U.S. Dollar Index) has instead been more range-bound and is showing signs of continued long-term moderation, which is a positive for the price of gold rather than a negative.""Wald added: ""We would view any weakness over the coming weeks as healthy consolidation ahead of gold's next leg higher.""VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), investing in small-cap mining stocks, dropped roughly 8% Wednesday and also lost support at the 50-day.Silver commodity and mining ETFs also carved out losses, including a 1.7% fall for iShares Silver Trust (SLV).SLV fell below its 50-day Monday and remains stuck below that level. It has given up most of its gains since its late June breakout from a cup-with-handle base.Global X Silver Miners (SIL) fell 8% and also cut through its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: The gold, silver and gem mining industry group has outpaced 196 peers this year.

177,LEG,"Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) helped Nvidia (NVDA) grow ""a second leg to run on"" outside gaming, analysts said Friday, after the Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner reported 110% growth in fiscal Q2 data center sales.IBD 50 stock Nvidia rocketed to a record high for the sixth straight trading day, closing up 5.6% to 63.09 on the stock market today. Shares are up more than 80% this year.But Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill says Nvidia stock is trading at a premium. To justify that, Gill says he would need to see 15%-20% core growth in 2017, but he only models 11%. He retained his hold rating on Nvidia stock.Others were more bullish. ""Tough to find much (bearish) to pick on here,"" Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay said of Nvidia's fiscal Q2. Ramsay kept his buy rating on Nvidia stock but boosted his price target to 70 from 67.50.""We maintain our belief that Nvidia's transformation from a PC-leveraged GPU supplier to a diverse visual-computing company is essentially complete,"" he wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99, but so do five other companies in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, including Apple supplier Broadcom. Broadcom completed its Avago merger earlier this year and may be looking to punch its M&A card soon.For fiscal Q2 ended July 31, Nvidia reported 40 cents earnings per share on record sales of $1.43 billion, up a respective 700% and 24% vs. the year-earlier period. Those metrics easily topped analysts' model for 37 cents and $1.35 billion.Nvidia's gaming unit brought in $781 million, growing 18%. There, Nvidia still has a major runway with the new Pascal 1070/1080 GPUs still ""an immaterial percentage"" of the mix, and the circa-2015 Maxwell predecessor only at 33%, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh says.Gaming units have grown at a 9% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. Meanwhile, average sales prices have surged 11%, Rakesh wrote in a report. He kept his buy rating on Nvidia stock and lifted his price target to 66 from 60.Data center and automotive sales outgrew Nvidia's bread-and-butter segment, up 110% and 68% vs. last year, though only comprising 11% and 8% of total sales, respectively. Nvidia sees a $5 billion opportunity in its data center segment, Rakesh said.RBC analyst Mitch Steves forecasts 20%-30% growth for Nvidia's data center sales in fiscal 2017. The segment targets hyperscale cloud users like Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu (BIDU) and Alibaba (BABA), but 50% of the segment's sales in fiscal Q2 were for machine-learning.""Previously, we held a bullish stance on virtual reality with the automotive segment acting as a 'call option' on the stock,"" Steves wrote in a report. ""The company now has a second leg to run on and a growth profile that suggests 20%-30% in fiscal 2017.""Nvidia also expanded to 80 carmakers experimenting with its advanced driver-assistance system. The Drive PX 2 fuses radar, lidar and cameras for semi-autonomous driving. But the segment is bound to see some unfettered competition, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a report.""We note headlines on an autonomous driving partnership between BMW (BMWYY), Mobileye (MBLY) and Intel (INTC); Intel acquiring Nervana and Apple (AAPL) acquiring Turi for deep learning,"" he wrote.Alphabet (GOOGL) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are also working in autonomous driving.But main GPU rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is ""more constrained and resource-challenged,"" Ing said.He maintained his buy rating and 70 price target on Nvidia stock.

179,LEG,"As the Trump transition team works to determine the top priorities for the new administration, a very serious problem requires the immediate attention of the new president: the future of our manufacturing industry. A healthy manufacturing base is critical to America's survival, both militarily and economically. Yet China poses a significant threat to our nation's all important manufacturing sector.Right now there is an intensive cyberwar waged against the U.S. by China, in which the Chinese are aggressively hacking into thousands of U.S. companies, stealing their intellectual property, and then flooding markets with their own ripped-off, competing products. Even worse, China is ""dumping"" these products into the U.S. at prices so low that they could eventually drive our manufacturing industry out of business.Sadly, there are too many examples of China's illegal activities to mention here, but a top example is China's nonstop campaign to undermine the U.S. steel industry, the backbone of our manufacturing. Chinese actions will have disastrous consequences if left unchecked.U.S. Steel invested millions in the development of a lighter, stronger steel. The company is presently suing 30 Chinese companies and their distributors, saying Chinese hackers stole trade secrets for this steel and China is now manufacturing its own copycat steel products and dumping the products into the U.S. at prices so low that they are impossible to match.In 2000, China produced approximately 14% of the world's steel, according to the World Steel Association. China is now manufacturing nearly half of all the world's steel products and last year, exported 112 million metric tons of steel, a 20% increase over a record-setting 2014.At a time when domestic energy production has skyrocketed and labor costs are coming down, the United States should be experiencing a manufacturing revival. Instead, the U.S. steel industry has been the target of continued illegal foreign practices and suffered 16,000 layoffs since the beginning of 2015, with more job losses expected throughout steel-producing communities.Unfortunately, China's cyber-thievery is not limited to the steel industry. A 2013 report from a bipartisan Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property stated, ""The scale of international theft of American intellectual property (IP) is unprecedented — hundreds of billions of dollars per year, on the order of the size of U.S. exports to Asia.""It concludes, ""China is the world's largest source of IP theft.""The FBI acknowledges an alarming increase in the theft of American trade secrets. An official with the counterintelligence unit was quoted last year as saying American companies have lost hundreds of billions of dollars due to theft of trade secrets. The FBI surveyed 165 private companies and found that half of them had fallen victim to IP theft, with 95% of those cases linked to Chinese cyber-hackers.Sources at the Justice Department also acknowledge a relentless wave of cybercrime saying thousands of companies in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy have been targeted by the Chinese. Counterintelligence officials also say that despite public pledges by China to end cybertheft, there is no indication that China's hackers have backed off.Cyberattacks threaten our national defense as well. The Washington Post reports that it's believed Chinese cyber-spies are responsible for hacking into major defense companies Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon. The spies obtained data and designs for more than two dozen major military weapons systems, including aircraft designs, missile defense, and communications.And it's not just steel and defense companies, corporations across a gamut of industries are victims of cybertheft. Hackers allegedly stole years of emerging energy technology research from SolarWorld and Westinghouse Electric. Paint company Valspar lost $20 million, or one-eighth of its annual profit, after its proprietary information was stolen by a Chinese rival.Chinese cyber-thieves have become so adept and skillful, they are even hacking into companies to view international trade strategies, bidding information and other forms of proprietary data that give China's manufacturing industry a decisive leg-up in world markets.China is not only expanding its military presence in the South China Sea, but also has created a massive cyberattack army that works every day to crush American companies by stealing trade secrets and intellectual property. Donald Trump and the incoming Congress must demonstrate strong support for our companies and help punish cyberattackers, and they must invest more in U.S. counterintelligence capabilities so that America can win what so far has been a devastating cyberwar.

180,LEG,"The announcement that Facebook (FB) will repurchase $6 billion worth of company stock is a classic move that all companies make when they begin to transition from rapid growth into middle age, says Edison Investment Research.The Facebook buyback program was announced Friday, as the stock had seen a 12% drop since hitting an all-time high of 133.50 on Oct. 25. The repurchase program starts in the first quarter of 2017 and does not have a fixed expiration.""It is a sign that the company does not know how to invest the money that it has generated to earn a good return for shareholders and so it decides to return the money to them instead,"" wrote Edison analyst Richard Windsor in an email. ""This is a classic move that all companies make when they begin to transition from rapid growth into middle age.""Evidence of middle age appeared in its Q3 earnings report this month. While Facebook beat on the top and bottom lines, the stock fell sharply in reaction to the social networking giant saying growth rates would slow. Facebook executives sent a cautionary signal that the pace of ads placed on its website would decelerate, as would the revenue growth rate in Q4 and 2017.""As you get to mid-2017, we expect ad load will be a less significant contributing factor,"" aid Facebook CFO David Wehner on the Q3 earnings call. ""As we slow ad load growth, we're going to have a slowing in revenue as well.""Facebook stock, though, rose 4.1% to 121.77 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook on Monday moved above its 200-day trading average, showings signs of institutional support. Here a quick look at the 12-month performance of Facebook.Whether a stock buyback fully benefits shareholders depends on how it's done. Share repurchases are a popular way to return capital to shareholders, tending to boost a stock and per-share earnings, while dividends put cash in shareholders' hands. But, says Windsor, there is a big difference between buying back shares and actually returning that money to shareholders.Buybacks can increase shareholder value in various ways but doing so requires that the company retires, or cancels, the shares that it repurchased, he wrote. It is only as the total number of diluted shares declines, boosting per-share earnings, that this money be deemed to have been returned to shareholders.""Most companies in the technology sector do not do this and instead use the shares that they have bought back to cover options programs and restricted stock unit awards,"" Windsor wrote. ""Consequently, although they claim that they are returning cash to shareholders, very few of them actually do. Facebook will be just the same.""Facebook, in its 8K filing announcing the buyback, did not say that shares would be retired. Facebook said the program will be executed ""consistent with the company's capital allocation strategy of prioritizing investment to grow the business over the long term.""But Windsor sees big growth opportunities for Facebook.""Facebook continues to show all the hallmarks of becoming a maturing company, but there is another leg of very rapid growth just waiting to happen,"" he wrote.He says Facebook can expand in areas that will give it more ad and other digital economy spending. Analysts point out the company still has plenty of growth levers to push. These include increasing the ad rate on Instagram and also seeking ways to monetize its other mobile platforms: Messenger and WhatsApp.Another growth area is in virtual reality devices and content, where Facebook is investing heavily. On Monday, Facebook announced that users of Instagram will be able to broadcast live video.The problem is, Windsor wrote, is that some of these newer areas are not yet mature enough to start generating meaningful revenue, ""and this is why we see a period of much more modest expansion.""RELATED:Big Stock Buyback Boost Coming From Trump Tax Proposal: Goldman SachsFacebook Instagram Keeps Clicking As Advertisers Double In 6 MonthsFacebook Moves To Fix Glitches In Measuring User Engagement

184,LEG,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock popped early Monday after the drugmaker said its immuno-oncology drug combination significantly improved overall survival in melanoma patients — proving a long-standing theory in cancer treatment and giving the company a leg up over rival and Dow component Merck (MRK).After two years, previously untreated advanced melanoma patients who had received a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy showed overall survival rates of 64%. That compared with 59% for patients on Opdivo alone and 45% for patients on Yervoy alone.Combined, Opdivo and Yervoy reduced the risk of death by 45% vs. a 37% reduction for patients on Yervoy alone, Bristol said in a news release.The news is good for Bristol because it can't afford to lose in immuno-oncology, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said early Monday.""There is ample evidence that the competitive landscape can evolve quickly and painfully,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In Bristol's tests, the portion of patients whose detectable tumors disappeared compared with an earlier 18-month follow-up increased in the combination group to 17.2% from 12.1%, to 14.9% from 9.8% in Opdivo alone and to 4.4% from 2.2% in Yervoy alone.But the combination also appeared somewhat more toxic, per expectations. Grade three and four adverse events occurred in 58% of patients who received the combination and in 21% and 28% of Opdivo and Yervoy monotherapy patients, respectively.Other companies are working on immuno-oncology drugs that target different proteins or enzymes. Yervoy targets the CTLA-4 protein receptor. Incyte's (INCY) epacadostat targets the IDO enzyme. AstraZeneca's durvalumab and tremelimumab work on the PD-L1 protein and CTLA-4 protein receptor, respectively.Certain combinations are thought to be particularly potent in fighting cancer, though most analysts see PD-1 drugs as the ""backbone"" for immuno-oncology. To that end, Bristol announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Incyte to pair Opdivo and epacadostat in several tumors.Merck, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, and Bristol both plan to present data on their combinations with epacadostat in June. ""We expect the results to justify the advance to multiple Phase 3 (trials).""IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers Squibb has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms about half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it's still far and away from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, which leads among drugmakers with a CR of 83 out of a best-possible 99. Head to the Stock Checkup to see how your picks stack up.Drugmakers had long theorized that combining two immuno-oncology drugs could boost potency. Bristol's trial is the first to prove it. AstraZeneca (AZN) also is working on a similar combination in advanced lung cancer.In a separate study, Bristol was able to increase overall survival rates in patients with previously treated advanced lung cancer to 16% after five years. Historically, five-year survival rates for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer have been less than 5%, Bristol said.This is the longest survival follow-up in advanced lung cancer using an immuno-oncology drug that teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells, Bristol said. Opdivo and Merck's Keytruda do this by targeting a specific protein called PD-1.In midmorning trading on the stock market today, Bristol stock was down a fraction at the close to 54.21, after earlier rising as much as 1.4%. Shares pared back after Bristol announced Opdivo failed to improve overall survival over Roche's Avastin in patients with a brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.Shares of Merck were off fractionally to 63.47.RELATED:Will Bristol Prove This Longstanding Theory In Cancer Defense?Dow's Merck Swipes Immuno-Oncology Share From Heavyweight Rivals

185,LEG,"For years, Apple (AAPL) has teased the public with hints of big plans to reinvent television. And with its iPhone business maturing, no one could use a market-defining new take on video more than Apple itself.But all it has to show for that talk so far is a set-top box that lags rivals in features and a couple of original TV series coming soon to its Apple Music service.Long-running rumors that Apple would flex its considerable muscles and put together a ""best of cable"" package of channels for an over-the-top internet television service have gone nowhere. It has dithered over how to compete in the emerging internet video sector.Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) has grown into a giant in the on-demand video arena, with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Prime Video a fast follower.""Over the years, Apple and TV have been a laughingstock,"" Phillip Swann, an analyst with TV Predictions, told Investor's Business Daily.""They talk a hell of a game,"" he said. ""Their executives love to lecture the television industry on what they're doing wrong. They always hint that coming on the horizon they will have the solution. The only thing they have done is a set-top box, which is derivative of other set-top boxes.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple. By far the biggest company, by market cap and many other measures. Also, arguably, the most interesting company, at least at times. IBD groups its Apple stories, a convenient spot to keep up with the iPhone — and news — maker.The company needs new businesses to drive growth. Last year, its sales fell nearly 8% year over year. This year, they're forecast to rise about 6%. And streaming video is the most prominent of Apple's rumored possible businesses, but it's a question mark as to whether the company sees much urgency in pursuing ventures in that realm.The best evidence that Apple intends to do something big in the streaming video space could be the company's stated goal to double its services business over the next four years to $48 billion to $50 billion in sales in fiscal 2020. To do that, Apple will need to add a new services offering or two, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report March 6. Apple can't reach its goal with its current services, which include the App Store, iTunes, AppleCare, Apple Music and other offerings.""Apple will need to develop or acquire additional services in order to close the gap with the doubling goal,"" Long said.For now, analysts take Apple executives at their word that their original video programming efforts are limited to attracting and retaining subscribers to the Apple Music service. Still, executives like CEO Tim Cook and Senior Vice President Eddie Cue say they'll learn from the experience and see where it can take them.But don't expect Apple to come out with a streaming video service to compete with traditional pay-TV services or a subscription video-on-demand network to take on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Time Warner's (TWX) HBO and others anytime soon, analysts say.Apple's latest idea is to sell consumers a bundle of premium TV channels, namely HBO, Showtime and Starz, Recode reported Sunday. Apple already sells each of those channels separately. It offers HBO for $15 a month, Showtime for $11 a month, and Starz for $9 a month. No word on what a bundle of those three would cost.Apple has announced two shows for its Apple Music service: ""Carpool Karaoke,"" a spinoff of the popular ""Late, Late Show"" segment; and ""Planet of the Apps,"" a reality show contest, in which would-be entrepreneurs pitch ideas for iOS device apps in hopes of winning funding. Both shows will come out this spring.""Look, we are just starting out,"" Cue said about original video at the Code Media conference on Feb. 13. ""Where it goes, we don't know.""Apple hopes the videos will help distinguish Apple Music from streaming music rivals like Spotify and Pandora (P).On a conference call with analysts Jan. 31, Cook described its original video efforts as a ""toe in the water.""Apple aspirations in the TV business date back to when Steve Jobs was running the show. In the years since, it has been all bark and no bite. Stories on Apple's negotiations with major content producers would regularly leak to major news outlets, but nothing would come of it.""The Wall Street Journal has probably done two dozen stories that say 'Apple is in talks' with this company or that company about some television scheme that will rule the world,"" Swann said. ""It's ridiculous.""Apple had a leg up on competitors when it started offering video rentals and purchases through its iTunes store. But it stayed focused on that business for too long, even as the market shifted to streaming, nScreenMedia analyst Colin Dixon said.""Apple missed the boat,"" Dixon said. ""Not only has Apple failed to establish a serious footprint in video, they've actually lost ground on where they were four years ago.""Amazon.com has taken market share from Apple in the movie download business, Dixon said. Plus, Amazon has established a formidable on-demand streaming video business with Prime Video, which, like Netflix, boasts critically acclaimed original shows.""Amazon is beating the pants off of Apple in the video business and Apple should be embarrassed about that,"" Dixon said.Neil Cybart, an analyst with Above Avalon, said he can see a natural progression of Apple building an entertainment streaming service using Apple Music as a starting point. Apple Music has more than 20 million subscribers in less than two years after its launch. By comparison, Netflix, which started offering streaming video as a sideline to its DVD-by-mail business in 2007, had 93.8 million streaming subscribers worldwide at the end of 2016.Apple is positioning itself as a video content distributor and sees an opportunity to sell subscriptions to many different streaming video services as the traditional cable bundle starts to fracture, Cybart said.One sticking point with content companies is that Apple wants to control the user experience. But it has received pushback from some content providers that don't want to funnel their content through Apple's TV user interface. Netflix and others want to control that experience, which gives them the opportunity to suggest other shows to watch.Apple seems to be content to sell other companies' streaming video services through its App Store and take a fee for managing the payments. Apple gets 30% of the subscription revenue if someone signs up for a service through its App Store and 15% if they continue to subscribe after the first year.Apple recently hired Timothy Twerdahl, the former head of Amazon's Fire TV unit, as a vice president in charge of product marketing for its Apple TV set-top box. It shifted the executive who previously held the job to a position negotiating media content deals, Bloomberg reported Feb. 7.The moves suggest a renewed focus on Apple TV and on providing more content for the device, Bloomberg said. Apple TV hasn't had a hardware update since October 2015. The device doesn't offer 4K video streaming and doesn't carry Amazon Prime as a content offering — two big knocks on the device.""Apple TV is good, but it's a me-too box,"" Dixon said. Amazon and Roku have similarly priced streaming video boxes that have more capabilities and programming options, he said.""It's amazing to me that they haven't done more here,"" Dixon said. ""Apple needs to do what it said it was going to do, which is reinvent the TV experience.""Instead, Apple is ""playing around the edges"" of the market, he said.The longer Apple waits to make a move in streaming video, the harder it could be for the company to make a dent in the market.RELATED:Apple Music, Spotify Lead In Streaming Tunes, But It's Early Days5 Takeaways From Apple's 'Outstanding' Q1 Report

187,LEG,"Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) stock rose Tuesday amid reports that an investor group will soon complete its purchase of China's largest Internet security company in what would be the largest take-private deal for a U.S.-listed Chinese firm.Qihoo announced on June 17 that it had received a proposal from an investor group led by the company's CEO to pay about $77 a share for the company in a transaction worth $9 billion.The proposed buyout is expected to be completed in the coming weeks with financing from a mostly domestic investor group, according to a report in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal.Qihoo has enlisted Chinese wealth management firms to help raise funds for the buyout and plans to relist shares on a Chinese domestic stock exchange, likely via a reverse merger, according to the Wall Street Journal report. The idea is that the company would fetch a higher valuation in its home market.Qihoo's U.S. stock is now 9% below the nonbinding $77-a-share go-private offer made in June by Qihoo Chairman and China Internet billionaire Zhou Hongyi and other investors, including venture capital firm Sequoia Capital China and Chinese securities firm Citic Securities Co.Qihoo was up almost 4% in early-afternoon trading in the stock market today, above 70.But Qihoo stock has declined 3% from its year-to-date high of 72.65 set when the buyout offer was announced in mid-June.Since the start of the year, Qihoo 360 stock has risen 23%.Qihoo, which is expected to issue its Q3 earnings report within the next several days, did not give Q3 guidance. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting revenue of $502.4 million, up 33% year over year, and EPS ex items of 94 cents, up 49% year over year.Qihoo provides Internet search, online games and mobile security products, putting it in competition with China search leader Baidu (BIDU) and others. The company also provides search advertising and mobile services in the region.With an estimated 20% of the desktop search market, No. 2 search engine Qihoo has struggled to make headway in mobile search.In addition to Baidu, Qihoo's search rivals include No. 3 search engine Sogou, owned by Sohu (SOHU).Web giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) — the third leg of the Baidu/Alibaba Group (BABA) /Tencent Chinese Internet monolith — owns a major stake in Sogou. And Alibaba has its own mobile search engine, called Shenma.The Qihoo deal is part of a larger trend. In the first half of the year, 19 Chinese-owned companies that traded on the U.S. stock market reported plans to go private, according to research group Dealogic.That compares with just one in the first half of 2014, and 11 in all of 2013. Several of those stocks had been doing poorly on the U.S. markets, so the plan was to delist and come out again on the Chinese stock markets, despite the on-and-off upheaval on China's exchanges.While stock prices of Qihoo and many other U.S.-listed take-private targets dipped significantly from their offer prices earlier this year, Qihoo stock has rebounded in recent weeks, as have other U.S.-listed Chinese Internet companies.The closely watched relisting of Chinese outdoor advertising display firm Focus Media Holding, which was taken private off the Nasdaq in 2013, also boosted optimism about the buyouts of Qihoo and other China stocks.That deal was the first major successful relisting domestically, the Journal said, and values Focus Media at more than twice its $2.6 billion valuation when it was taken private by a group of private-equity funds.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook .

188,LEG,"The euro area and the United States are comparable in numerous ways, including population and relative economic size. Since the financial crisis, they have also shared a common goal of escaping from the jaws of a balance sheet recession, as deleveraging has posed a headwind to economic growth on both continents. One shorthand metric to judge progress is the inflation rate, which today rests at zero in both regions. Currently, both central banks are targeting an inflation rate of close to 2 percent.In the States, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has delayed raising interest rates largely because of the lack of inflation in the U.S. as measured by the Consumer Price Index or the personal consumption expenditure. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank's (ECB) president, Mario Draghi, recently signaled that he may take more aggressive action when the ECB convenes again on December 3. His statement on October 22 signaled that deflation remains a problem in Europe. As a result, investors are surmising that this could mean the ECB might further ease monetary policy or even boost its quantitative easing (QE) efforts, which were announced in January 2015.Yet even though both the ECB and the Federal Open Market Committee have similar monetary tools, the Fed has the benefit of a unified country, where key economic data points reflect national averages and thus are more easily targeted by federal fiscal and monetary policy. In Europe, the ECB is making policy for an entire region, but it is a region consisting of 19 sovereign states. Borrowing a term from Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, the ECB is left trying to hit an inflation target with only one arrow (monetary policy). Moreover, in Europe, deflation is a moving target, as some countries show price inflation, while the largest countries—Germany, France, Italy and Spain—still struggle to free themselves from the specter of falling prices.European Inflation RatesSince January, Belgium has seen a 1.3 percentage point increase in its inflation rate. Yet Spain, a country that was experiencing severe deflation, has only reduced the rate of deflation by less than half a percentage point. Likewise, Finland has actually seen prices fall 0.6% since the start of European QE. So when the ECB shoots, what is it aiming for?""The ECB's definition of price stability makes clear that the focus of its monetary policy is on the euro area as a whole,"" according to the ECB's website. But in 2011, Fernanda Nechio of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that by using the Taylor rule, ""a policy guideline that generates recommendations for a monetary authority's interest rate response to the paths of inflation and economic activity,"" the euro area's core countries and peripheral countries do not fall in line with the ECB's one-size-fits-all target rate.1 Essentially, the pieces work when pulled together, but when viewed separately, they tend to fall short of the ECB's target (especially in the case of the peripheral countries).Currently, all the countries on this list are falling short of the ""close to 2%"" target. This makes the possibility of additional ECB action in December likely. The larger question will be how the ECB will react when a majority of its members are closing in on the target but many of the ""peripheral"" countries, such as Spain, are left far away from the bull's eye. If history tends to repeat itself, it seems the ECB will continue to focus on the euro area as a whole and leave the less fortunate countries to fend for themselves.Presently, the euro area as a whole is still far from its inflation goal. Even excluding the impact of falling food and energy prices, core inflation across the continent is only 1.1 percent.2 The euro has weakened in the last few weeks in response to Draghi's public musings. Further euro weakness and additional credit easing in Europe would, in our view, be bullish for the local recovery now taking shape across the region. That could provide another leg up for the European equity rally, particularly for U.S. investors who make the effort to mitigate the impact of a depreciating euro to their stock portfolios.1Fernanda Nechio, ""Monetary Policy When One Size Does Not Fit All,"" Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 6/13/11.

190,LEG,"Unfair Housing: ""At a certain point,"" President Obama has admonished, ""you've made enough money."" So why doesn't that apply in government-run housing where some high-net-worth individuals are living at taxpayer expense?In Philadelphia, a local television station found that 181 families are far from poor while living in state housing intended for the indigent. Thirteen families, in fact, make six-figure incomes. This while more than 100,000 wait an average 10 years for public housing.Philadelphia officials justify the situation by saying richer tenants pay more. And besides, according to Housing Authority President Kelvin Jeremiah, mixed-income units provide an example to the less ""successful,"" a rationale we never seem to hear when public officials try to place indigent tenants in middle-class suburbs.Philadelphia's isn't the only place where federal cash subsidizes wealthy tenants. HUD has found 25,000 ""over-income"" families living off the taxpayer largesse. They include a New York family of four making nearly $500,000 a year and paying just $1,574 a month for a three-bedroom unit, a Nebraska individual worth $1.6 million paying $300 for a one-bedroom unit and a Los Angeles family of five making $200,000 a year entrenched in their unit since 1974.If this is the reality of public housing, then it's no longer a tool to help the impoverished get a leg up — if it ever was. It's just another government spoil being doled out to favored clients, and calls into question why the federal government is in the housing business at all.

191,LEG,"The largest biotech ETFs served up a reminder in March that investors in this high-growth industry should expect a bumpy ride. They hit their best levels in a year early on, then took a nasty tumble before bouncing back smartly from those losses.On Tuesday, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) were modestly lower but holding above the 10-week moving average — a bullish sign after a recent test of that critical marker of support. And despite a stumble in March so far, they are holding on to double-digit gains for the first quarter, vs. 12% for the S&P 500.That's a nice turnaround from a plunge of more than 10% for many biotech exchange traded funds the prior quarter, which coincided with hawkish election rhetoric about price-gouging in the drug industry.The latest rally comes despite major setbacks this month, including Trump tweets on drug prices and serious blows to big-name biotechs Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), which cast a pall on the entire industry.Biotechnology ETFs rallied sharply in January and February as higher beta names swung into favor after President Trump's shock election win. Plus, investors saw these stocks as a ""value play in a growth industry,"" said Matthew Bartolini, head of research for SPDR Americas.Some market analysts still see fair-to-attractive valuations in the sector, despite its year-to-date outperformance, helping IBB earn an upgrade recently.In light of improving valuations, however, two things will be key to the next leg up for this industry, in Bartolini's view.First, biotechs have to deliver on their promise of growth.Many smaller firms like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Esperion (ESPR) are unprofitable or have no sales, and even industry bellwethers such as Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Incyte (INCY) are in earnings slumps.However, earnings momentum for the sector as a whole is starting to look more favorable, some analysts say. Top biotech Celgene (CELG), which earns an extremely high EPS Rating of 98 from IBD, has scored upward revisions in forward estimates.Secondly, mergers and acquisitions must come to fruition to boost share prices. Intercept (ICPT), Regeneron (REGN) and Biogen are three names being bandied about as takeover targets.XBI has outpaced peers in 2017 so far, as it has consistently over the past three-, five- and 10 years. It is up 17.9% year to date through March 27 vs. a 10.6% gain for its iShares rival, which is cap-weighted and skews toward larger companies.Bartolini considers the SPDR biotech to be well placed looking ahead as well. An equal-weighted indexing method gives it a small-cap tilt. That may be beneficial in an industry such as biotechnology, where smaller and more speculative companies have strong potential as long-term growth plays, he said.Plus, relative to cap-weighted rivals, XBI is less tied to the fortunes of the largest names in the industry. On the one hand, that makes the SPDR ETF more immune to single-stock risk and ""tweet risk,"" in Bartolini's words. However, it also will benefit less from a big price gain for the industry giants.A Trump tweet on drug pricing hit XBI and IBB hard on March 7.RELATED:Which ETFs Are Making Big Moves?

193,LEG,"XMost institutions, as well as individual investors, hesitate to buy stocks at new highs. Everyone likes a good discount, so they wait for a pullback.The 10-week moving average serves as a key area of potential support. Why? Institutions will use that moving average to add shares to existing positions. Use this investing behavior to your own advantage.To form the 10-week moving average, drawn only on a weekly stock chart, first add up the weekly closing prices over the past 10 weeks and divide by 10. After each Friday, a new 10-week average is calculated, thus creating the line.A rising 10-week line is positive, pointing to an upward trend in the stock's price. A downward sloping line indicates a stock is in a downtrend.While the first two to three pullbacks to the 10-week line are considered proper to buy, the very first pullback to the 10-week line following a leading stock's strong breakout can provide the most compelling opportunity to acquire more shares, or even initiate a position if you missed the initial breakout from an excellent base. Make sure you buy a smaller amount of shares than your initial position, such as 20% or 30% of your beginning stake. You want to average up slowly in price, not swiftly.Check out Palo Alto Networks (PANW), one of the biggest market winners during the 2014-2015 time frame. The stock provided three separate classic situations in which to buy the stock.First, the stock broke out of a proper double-bottom base with a 72.60 entry on May 29, 2014. Notice how the second leg undercut the first leg of the pattern, shaking out weak holders before moving higher.Following the stock's breakout, the stock quietly formed a five-week flat base with an 85.88 buy point as the market underwent a brief period of weakness. Palo Alto's relative strength line remained near new high territory. The breakout occurred on Aug. 13, 2014.Finally, months later in October, the first 10-week pullback occurred as shares fell back to the 10-week line (1). While the stock fell under the 10-week average during the week, it recovered strongly to end the week on a high note.Over the next nine months, Palo Alto would rise 176% to its ultimate peak at 200.55 from its double-bottom breakout. The 10-week line remained a steadfast support level throughout the move. When the top arrived in the summer of 2015, shares finally broke the 50-day line (on a daily chart) and the 10-week line on heavy volume (2), a clear expectation-breaker and character change. The stock fell 45% in seven months.MarketSmith, an IBD company, just released its new Smart Alerts feature that provides both positive and negative alerts: first-time pullbacks to the 10-week moving average and heavy volume breaks of the 50-day line (see it on daily charts).Not only can you find ideas of stocks meeting these characteristics, but you can input your own watchlists and you'll be alerted when those conditions are met. These features are particularly useful if you can't monitor your positions throughout the day. Add your portfolio into the Smart Alerts list and it'll notify you if one of your holdings is triggering a potential add-on or sell signalRecently, JD.com (JD) and Primerica (PRI) triggered first-pullbacks-to-the-10-week-line after solid breakouts. JD.com broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Feb. 8 when shares surpassed the 29.01 entry point. After a 12% advance, shares have pulled back to the 10-week line near 29.86.Ideally, you should see light volume on the way down, followed by a surge in volume as the stock rebounds, indicating institutions are stepping in to halt the stock's retreat. Primerica, a current Leaderboard member, broke out of a flat base with a 73.15 entry on Jan. 13. After a solid 15% move higher, shares have used the recent pause in financials to fall back to the 10-week line where it is currently finding support.Other leading stocks haven't been so fortunate and have triggered sell signals to the downside. Thor Industries (THO), the leading maker of recreational vehicles, plummeted nearly 10% on March 7 on its earnings announcement. Not only did shares give back all of their recent gains from a 106.44 cup-with-handle buy point, but they closed sharply below the 50-day line, a clear sell signal. In subsequent days, shares have fallen an additional 9% from the gap-down day.RELATED:Breakout Watch: Primerica Gets Boost From BofA, JPMorgan EarningsRocky Road For JD.com: Will 2017 Finally Be Its Year?

194,LEG,"Ciena's (CIEN) entry into the merchant optical chip market through partnerships poses a challenge to some of its competitors, analysts say.Ciena announced a strategy Monday at the Optical Fiber Communication (OFC) exhibition in Los Angeles that noted alliances with Lumentum Holdings (LITE), Oclaro (OCLR), and NeoPhotonics (NPTN). Those relationships could give it a leg up over Inphi (IPHI) and Acacia Communications (ACIA).While analysts cheered the move in reports released today, they do not expect revenue upside from Ciena's chip strategy until late 2018 or early 2019.Ciena, a maker of fiber-optic communications infrastructure, develops its own chip technology for in-house products, much like Cisco Systems (CSCO). By selling optical chips to Lumentum, Oclaro, and NeoPhotonics, ""Ciena is better positioned to target the more than 30% of the ($900 million) market that uses modems based on merchant silicon,"" said Tim Long, a BMO Capital analyst in a report.Lumentum Holdings, Oclaro, and NeoPhotonics are expected to build modules that plug  into communications subsystems using Ciena's chips.""Ciena's move is a direct challenge to Acacia, NEL (NTT Electronics), and Inphi's ClariPhy unit,"" said Alex Henderson, a Needham & Co. analyst in a report.IBD'S TAKE: Inphi is rated No. 1 in IBD's Sector Leaders while Applied Optoelectronics and Lumentum hold the highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric,  in IBD's Telecom-Fiber Optic group. The oft-volatile fiber-optic group is ranked No. 12 out of 197 industry groups.Ciena, which builds higher-margin system-level products, doesn't compete directly with component makers. Ciena rivals include the likes of Cisco, Huawei, Juniper Networks, and ZTE.Meta Marshall, analyst at Morgan Stanley, says Ciena could make inroads into China, where Acacia Communications is a chip supplier to ZTE and Huawei.""Ciena has increasingly been looking for ways to diversify their revenue sources, something today's announcement reinforces,"" said Marshall in a report.James Kisner, a Jefferies analyst, says Ciena's chips are expected to be built into modules for next-generation network gear sending data at 400 gigabits-per-second. Most customers of fiber-optic companies are upgrading to 100 Gbps technology currently.Ciena stock fell 0.9% to 23.53 in the stock market today, reversing from morning gains along with the major market averages.

195,LEG,"The spike in borrowing costs in response to President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda is causing some heartburn in America's housing industry. San Diego mortgage broker Shanne Sleder said a third of his clients, many of whom were already stretching budgets to buy homes in pricey Southern California, are having to reconsider what they can afford as rates soar.""With a number of the people we were in the middle of preapproving, as rates are going up, it's getting tighter and tighter qualifying them,"" Sleder said. He's urging them to lock in rates. ""In some cases, the higher rates are making it so they are not as comfortable with the payment.""With investors anticipating faster expansion and inflation from Trump's policies, the yield on the U.S. 10-year note — a bellwether of changes in mortgage rates — has jumped more than 35 basis points since the Nov. 8 presidential election, the biggest three-day increase since 2009. Home loans may be beginning to follow suit: The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.94%, up from 3.57% last week and the highest since January, Freddie Mac (FMCC) said in a statement Thursday. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.14% from 2.88%, the McLean, Va.-based mortgage-finance company said.A sustained surge in borrowing costs could further hinder first-time purchases at a time when rising values are already hurting affordability and pricing out buyers in many markets. What's more, the backup in rates would leave the economy wanting of a boost from residential construction that's failed to contribute to growth for two consecutive quarters.""It's not helpful at all for the housing market, and it also bears watching in terms of how bad it gets,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James Financial (RJF) in St. Petersburg, Fla. The housing rebound ""could be even more moderate than it has been.""Larry Seay, who retired in March as chief financial officer of builder Meritage Homes (MTH), said rising rates will also limit the ability of developers to raise prices, pinching margins. Buyers will look for smaller, cheaper homes and builders will probably look for opportunities to accommodate them, he said.""It's going to be incumbent on builders to manage cost better because they won't be able to pass on the cost increases with higher home prices,"" Seay said.While mortgage rates remain near historic lows, action in funding markets is reminiscent of the so-called ""taper tantrum"" in 2013. That's when yields surged after then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the central bank would soon start slowing the pace of bond purchases.In August 2013, after mortgage rates climbed above 4.5%, sales of previously owned homes proceeded to fall nearly 8% by year-end. Existing-home purchases are tallied a month or two after a contract has been signed.An increase in mortgage rates may prove temporary, though, because ""we still have a backdrop of slow global growth, low inflation and an aging populace in most developed markets,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at financial services company Bankrate. ""Those are factors that brought about low rates and kept rates low.""The nation's housing market has been grinding higher, helped by sturdy employment gains, nascent wage growth and attractive borrowing costs. A potential next leg up was first-time buyers. Higher mortgage rates that are sustained, however, would mean less buyer traffic of that segment of the market.""First-time buyers look at the monthly total, at what they can afford, so if the mortgage is eaten up by a higher interest expense then there's less left over for price, for the principal,"" said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies. ""Buyers will be shopping in a lower price bracket, thus demand could shift a bit.""Home prices are currently rising about 5% on a year-over-year basis. That's kept an index of housing affordability hovering near the lowest level since the end of 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors.Many buyers ""are already stretching to begin with,"" said Sleder, the San Diego broker, who works at West Coast Mortgage. ""If it continues in this direction, it's going to push more and more people out of the market.""""Eventually, if rates go up to where people are not putting offers in any more, sellers are going to lower their market price,"" he said.MORE ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET:Mortgages Slump While Homebuilder Confidence Climbs, Data ShowWhich Rebounded Higher After The Recession — Home Prices Or Stocks?A Flare-Up In Foreclosures

196,LEG,"Eli Lilly (LLY) has a giant albatross hanging from its neck.RBC analyst Michael Yee calls the Clinical Trials for Alzheimer's disease conference next month in San Diego, ""the most important event in biotech."" And it's up to Eli Lilly to deliver strong results from its phase 3 trial on Alzheimer's drug solanezumab to stoke the industry, he says.Biotechs spiked higher after Donald Trump's election. Trump is seen as less likely to tackle mounting drug prices and has proposed incentives for companies to bring more cash stateside. That could spark more M&As for small-cap biotechs.Intraday on the stock market today, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group was down a fraction but still above its 50-day moving average, a key level of support. The group closed higher the past seven straight trading days and ranks No. 27 out of 197 IBD industry groups.IBD'S TAKE: Alzheimer's isn't the only area of opportunity in biotech. Biogen and Ionis are partnered on a spinal muscular atrophy drug that could have interesting results. Delve into IBD's Industry Themes for some ideas on what success could do for the stocks.Outside the Trump effect, analysts have seized on Eli Lilly's solanezumab as a key driver for the industry, including rival Biogen (BIIB), which has a similar Alzheimer's drug on the line. Solanezumab is an antibody that could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's disease""We believe this event (the CTAD) will be an important near-term driver to potentially rally biotech higher and really take another leg up and bring in more generalists to the space,"" Yee said in his research note Tuesday.Eli Lilly's presentation is still just tentative. It is slated to present on Dec. 8, but Lilly has also said it could instead present data from Expedition, its phase 3 solanezumab trial, in a medical meeting in 2017. Positive data could give strong credence to Lilly's theory that Alzheimer's is the result of plaque buildup in the brain, Yee wrote.He sees a 30%-40% chance of positive, statistically significant data from the Expedition trial and, as a result, ""investors will get more bullish on Alzheimer's and 'innovation' in biotech.""Biogen is slated Dec. 9 to report phase 1b results of its 12-month titration study attempting to reduce ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) in patients with a specific type of allele (an alternative form of a gene). It will also present a 24-month extension examining safety and efficacy.Biogen stock, which is consolidating and has a possible buy point of 333.75, ticked up 0.3% to 322.58 at the close Tuesday. Lilly stock inched up 0.4% to 77.32 and just above its 200-day support line.Novartis (NVS), which is partnered with Amgen (AMGN), will discuss it efforts at pairing Alzheimer's patients with trials based in part on genetics. Amgen's BACE inhibitor, which acts to block the buildup of beta-amyloid, has been proposed as one of two drugs in the study. Lilly, Merck (MRK) and Biogen also have BACE inhibitors.Roche (RHHBY), with partner Genentech, is expected to have posters on its phase 3 trial for crenezumab, looking at higher-dose response in prodromal/mild patients.

197,LEG,"Samsung Electronics Co. is spending $8 billion to buy its way into a burgeoning market for automotive technology alongside Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google as the smartphone business wanes.The company is making its largest-ever overseas acquisition with an offer for Harman International Industries (HAR), angling to become the go-to supplier of everything from in-car entertainment to connected auto services. It comes days after Samsung Group heir-apparent Jay Y. Lee formally ascended to the board of the electronics firm, a move expected to shore up his influence over the family-run conglomerate's prized asset.The Harman acquisition will lift Samsung into the top ranks of auto technology suppliers and give it existing relationships with BMW, Volkswagen (VLKAY) and General Motors (GM). While Harman became a legendary name in high-end audio equipment, it's pushed deeper into automotive supplies and now gets 65% of sales from the sector. Samsung's $112-a-share offer stood 28% above Harman's closing price of $87.65 in New York on Friday.Harman shares soared by more than 25% to 109.72 by Monday's close.IBD'S TAKE: Graphics chipmaker Nvidia soared 30% Friday on blowout earnings. While the stock is nowhere near a proper buy point, Wall Street is bullish on Nvidia because it's also a leader in automotive, AI and cloud semiconductors.""This is the first deal cut after Jay Y. joined the board and shows his management style is different from his father. He is an aggressive deal maker,"" said Park Kang-ho, an analyst with Daishin Securities. ""In the longer term, Samsung is thinking that life after smartphones is electric vehicles.""The Korean company joins a growing list of global technology companies moving into automobiles. The companies see cars as an industry that hasn't yet been remade by software and online technologies.But outside of Elon Musk's Tesla Motors (TSLA), the efforts haven't yet reached customers. Google has for years been working on self-driving software but its systems haven't yet reached the market. Apple went on a hiring spree to add staff to build its own car before recently recalibrating the initiative to focus more on software, leading to job cuts. Privately held Uber Technologies joined the fray over the past year, hiring engineers and making acquisitions to build its own autonomous car technology.Samsung itself has bought a stake in Chinese electric-car maker BYD (BYDDF) and at one point considered an offer for sections of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU) parts unit, a deal said to have broken down just weeks ago. With the Harman purchase, it's taking a different approach that's more in keeping with its history has a component maker.Rather than designing a car or building a self-driving system, Harman's technology focuses on the growing number of services available as automobiles get connected to the internet — navigation, multimedia entertainment, security systems and analytics tools.This transformation of the auto into a full-service mobile device adds up to a potential gold mine. Revenue from the data streams and connectivity components could become a $200 billion market by 2020, McKinsey & Co. estimates.""Samsung may have figured that it can't become the biggest player in the car component business by itself, so it needs a big brand to get into the market,"" said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities.For Samsung, establishing a foothold in automotive technology offers the company a chance to shed its reliance on a smartphone market undergoing its worst downturn on record. The company is the world's biggest supplier of displays and memory for mobile devices — replicating that dominance in autos will inject new life into the business. It's now struggling to put the embarrassing death of the fire-prone Note 7 behind it, while searching for its next leg of growth.Samsung said Harman is the market leader in connected car solutions, with more than 30 million vehicles equipped with its connected car and audio systems and telematics. Telematic devices allow in-vehicle access to specific services, including car parks and anti-theft security. The Stamford, Conn.-based company has an order backlog for the auto market of $24 billion as of June 30.""Harman has a scale and premium in the car-infotainment and audio businesses, so it would definitely help Samsung move faster. But it alone is not enough for Samsung to become the leader in this space,"" said Roh.The audio company can trace its roots back to the 1950s, when Sidney Harman teamed with Bernard Kardon to make high-fidelity machines. The company would later acquire brands including JBL and Infinity, among other audio equipment makers, and become a leader in high-end car stereo systems. It also owns the Bang & Olufsen brand for cars after acquiring the business last year.Evercore is serving as financial advisor to Samsung, while JPMorgan and Lazard are advising Harman, according to the statement.""Harman perfectly complements Samsung in terms of technologies, products and solutions, and joining forces is a natural extension of the automotive strategy we have been pursuing for some time,"" Vice Chairman Kwon Oh-hyun said in the statement. ""Harman immediately establishes a strong foundation for Samsung to grow our automotive platform.""

198,LEG,"Return on equity is a measure of a company's profitability. It's also an important tool for investors trying to gauge a stock's chances of success. ROE is calculated by dividing net annual income (before accounting changes and one-time gains or losses) by average shareholders' equity over the past two years. Shareholders' equity, which is equal to total assets minus total liabilities, is also referred to as owners' equity, book value or net assets.Essentially, ROE helps to identify well-managed companies by measuring how much profit a company generates from its total net assets. For example, a company that earns 10 cents on each dollar of equity has an ROE of 10%.IBD research shows that the greatest growth stocks of the past 50 years had ROEs of 17% or more. The biggest winners had ROEs of 25% to 50%.Such companies typically have a competitive advantage that gives them a leg up on the competition, whether it's a new product or new service, or new method of doing business.A company's return on equity can be found in IBD Stock Checkup, which you can access via the Research section of Investors.com. It also appears in the IBD 50 list; the annual ROE and other additional data show up when you download the list into a spreadsheet file (see the ""Export"" link at the bottom of the list.)ROE, along with profit margins and sales growth, is a component of the SMR Rating, which is one of the five proprietary IBD ratings used to identify leading stocks.The SMR Rating is on a scale of A to E, with A indicating that a stock is in the top 20% of all publicly traded companies.Nevertheless, it's important to keep in mind that companies can show misleading ROE figures by, for example, borrowing more money, which increases liabilities. In this case, net assets are divided by a smaller shareholders' equity, yielding a higher ROE.That's why it's best to look at a company's ROE over several years or more to get a feel for the long-term trend.Also, companies that have high ROEs and low debt-to-equity ratios are usually doing a better job of boosting their return on invested capital.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the July 13, 2012, edition of IBD.)

199,LEG,"Hillary Clinton has been booed, serenaded with the chant ""Lock her up!"" and accused of being complicit in election fraud. No, these things didn't happen at last week's assembly of Republicans, they happened this week, at the Democratic National Convention.The Democrats' convention in Philadelphia was supposed to be a coronation for Clinton. This of course is what the media have long been telling us and it therefore must be true. At the same time, Hillary has fully expected to be crowned this week because she is infected with the Clinton Entitlement virus, having contracted the condition from Patient Zero likely before she married him.But Clinton hasn't had it so easy this week or in the days leading up to the convention. She continually trips over her email problem. Bernie Sanders made what was expected to be an easy walk during the primaries a treacherous and rocky march on the edge. The word ""Benghazi"" has become a set of leg irons she has to drag along with her. Hillary's connection with shady behavior has made it obligatory to include the word ""corruption"" in every article and blog post written about her – even if her media cheerleaders refuse to go there.Clinton's slog hit even thicker mud when Wikileaks published hacked DNC emails last week that showed, among other insults to integrity, the party rigged the primaries in her favor. That earned her jeers when Sanders mentioned her by name Monday during his convention speech. (Wikileaks founder Julian Assange promises ""a lot more"" to come.)Further stumbles in what was supposed to be her week are the resignation of ally Debbie Wasserman Schultz – who was heartily booed by her own party – from her post as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, and polling numbers showing Donald Trump in the lead while Hillary's favorability ratings are at their lowest in 24 years, according to Gallup. She has not been forgiven by Sanders' supporters who will neither surrender nor pardon her for the lousy way she and her party treated their candidate.(That's not to say that socialists don't deserve lousy treatment; they do. Anyone who wants to use government to accrue power to run other people's lives should be held in contempt, and this includes nearly every Democratic politician of the last 40 years and more than a few Republicans.)As much as the media tried to paint last week's Republican National Convention in Cleveland as the funeral of a party cracking up, the real mess is in Philadelphia. Clinton expected to leave the city basking in the grandeur worthy of an empress. She will instead depart as a critically wounded candidate. It's not what she's been expecting all these years.

200,LEG,"More than 1 billion people now use Facebook (FB) Messenger each month, joining WhatsApp, another Facebook messaging platform, which hit the 1 billion user level in February.Facebook announced the Messenger milestone in a blog post Wednesday, ""making Messenger one of only a handful of apps worldwide that touch so many lives,"" it said.Facebook has yet to monetize Messenger and WhatsApp. Both apps, along with Instagram and its 500 million users, are seen by analysts as powering the next leg in long-term revenue growth for Facebook.Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju, in a research note Friday, said the three Facebook apps will be able to drive long-term revenue growth without a material lift in ad loads.""We remain buyers as we believe the Street is not only undermodeling Instagram, but also not yet assigning additional optionality to the eventual monetization of Facebook's two additional billion-user properties -- Messenger and WhatsApp,"" Ju wrote. Ju has an outperform rating on Facebook stock, and a price target of 145.Facebook is scheduled to report Q2 earnings after the market close July 27. The consensus estimate is for revenue of $6 billion, up 50% year over year, maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. The consensus on earnings per share minus items, as polled by Thomson Reuters, is 81 cents, up 62%.Among other internet stocks, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) report earnings after the close July 28. The consensus on Alphabet is EPS minus items of $8.06, up 15%, on revenue of $20.75 billion, up 17%. On Amazon, the consensus is EPS of $1.11, up from just 19 cents in Q2 2015, on revenue of $29.6 billion, up 28%.Facebook stock ended trading up 1.1% to 121.92 on the stock market today.IBD'S Take: Facebook cleared a 121.18 buy point of a flat base in volume that was running well above normal in Wednesday trading. Facebook is trying for its third straight gain after getting support at its 50-day moving average. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a neutral C, indicating a standoff between buyers and sellers, but it remains an IBD Leaderboard stock.Cowen analyst John Blackledge also rates Facebook stock outperform, with a price target of 145. Blackledge in a research note, said investor sentiment has been mostly positive for Facebook this year, with shares outperforming most large-cap internet stocks, including Alphabet and Amazon.""With its massive, highly engaged user base across its family of apps, we believe Facebook continues to be well-positioned to benefit from the secular shift to digital, especially digital video with several monetization levers forthcoming,"" Blackledge wrote.Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser also spotlight Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp in a research note last week. Wieser said Facebook has additional upside from improved monetization at Instagram and the establishment of commercial models at WhatsApp and Messenger.In the report, he reiterated buy ratings on Facebook and Alphabet. Wieser has a price target of 166 on Facebook stock. His price target on Alphabet is 1000. Alphabet stock was up a fraction, near 756, Wednesday afternoon.

229,LEG,"The Food and Drug Administration has approved Merck's (MRK) Keytruda to treat classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but needs more time to review the drugmaker's application for Keytruda in a DNA repair disorder tied to several colorectal cancers.Merck announced the developments late Tuesday. The FDA gave Merck the OK to sell Keytruda as a treatment for children and adults whose classical Hodgkin lymphoma has relapsed after three or more prior treatments.But the FDA needs more time to examine Keytruda as a treatment for previously treated microsatellite instability-high cancer. The disorder is caused by a deficiency in the DNA repair sequence, leading to cancer.""We believe that patients whose tumors harbor DNA repair defect may be especially responsive to Keytruda,"" Merck said in November when it first applied to have the FDA consider Keytruda as a treatment for the disorder.The new Prescription Drug Fee User Act date for Keytruda in microsatellite instability-high cancer is set for June 9.IBD'S TAKE: What if your body could target cancer the way it does common bacteria? It's no longer theoretical. Dive in with this feature on the immuno-oncology space on IBD's Technology page.Keytruda competes directly with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo in melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and now classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Both drugs belong to a class of drugs that use the body's immune system to fight cancer.Specifically, Keytruda and Opdivo aim to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and the PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell. Doing so allows the immune system to identify the cancer cell and destroy it.AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY) and Incyte (INCY) are also working on varying checkpoints. Roche's FDA-approved Tecentriq targets the PD-L1 protein on the surface of the cancer cell. Incyte's epacadostat belongs to another class, targeting IDO enzymes. Bristol's Yervoy works similarly, targeting the CTLA-4 protein.Merck stock closed up 0.8% at 64.70 on the stock market today. Shares of Bristol-Myers rose 1.7% to 57.65, after Bristol gave a presentation at the Barclays Global Healthcare Conference.RELATED: Could Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Merck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

230,LEG,"The sell-off Tuesday on Tesaro (TSRO) stock was overdone, an analyst argued Wednesday, after rival AstraZeneca (AZN) revealed strong ovarian-cancer trial data — prompting shares of Tesaro and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) to diverge.On the stock market today, that trend continued. Clovis Oncology stock rose 7.4% to 71.93, the highest since late 2015 after soaring 10.5% on Tuesday. Shares of Tesaro dipped 0.6% after Tuesday's 10.6% crash. AstraZeneca stock fell 0.3% to 30.21 after Tuesday's 0.8% rise.AstraZeneca, Clovis and Tesaro are working on a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. The drugs work by inhibiting an enzyme associated with DNA repair. In patients with the BRCA mutation, errors can occur in DNA rebuilding, leading to cancer.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca unveiled data showing that its FDA-approved Lynparza was able to delay the reoccurrence of ovarian cancer by 30.2 months. In a separate trial, Tesaro found its drug, niraparib, could delay reoccurrence by 21 months in a similar patient population.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro has an IBD Composite Rating of 60, meaning it has outperformed 6 in 10 stocks in key growth metrics over the past 12 months. But it's still far behind Celgene, which tops the group with a CR of 99. Head to the IBD Stock Checkup for the best ideas in biotech.""This offers additional data to support the notion that PARPs are generally more similar than different with respect to efficacy,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Terence Flynn wrote in a research report. He kept his neutral rating on Clovis stock.Clovis is working on phase three data for its FDA-approved Rubraca as a maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer. But Janney analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay noted that Tesaro and AstraZeneca are expected to have first-line data in the next nine months to a year.""Assuming a fundamental shift in ovarian cancer treatment paradigm in favor of PARPs, the commercial opportunity in the ultra-competitive second-line maintenance and later lines may be limited, which is a negative for Clovis,"" he wrote. He has a neutral rating on Clovis stock.Analysts continue to see Tesaro as a potential takeover candidate, though No. 3 biotech Gilead Sciences is reportedly looking at Incyte, rather than Tesaro.RELATED:Tesaro Trips On AstraZeneca's Ovarian Cancer Trial While Clovis ClimbsAstraZeneca Could Give Pfizer, Tesaro Leg Up In Breast Cancer: LeerinkTesaro Eyes Immuno-Oncology As AstraZeneca, Clovis Loom: Analyst

Excluding funds that do a lot of shorting, hedging and relying on leverage, large-cap growth funds fared best by losing the least, down 2.27% in the week.Within those traditional market-capitalization-and-style categories, among stock mutual funds with at least $100 million in assets, $148 million Virtus Small-Cap Sustainable Growth had the best week, but only because it lost the least — down 0.17%. That left it up 3.48% for the year going into Friday.Next best was $308 million Morgan Stanley Institutional Opportunity , which lost 0.18% for its investors in the week. That trimmed its year-to-date gain to 23.55%.And the third best performer was $458 million Natixis CGM Advisor Targeted Equity .

260,LEG,"Remarks at the Medal of Honor Ceremony for Army Capt. Florent GrobergTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning, and welcome to the White House. A little more than three years ago, as Captain Florent Groberg was recovering from his wounds as a consequence of the actions that we honor today, he woke up on a hospital bed, in a little bit of a haze.He wasn’t sure, but he thought he was in Germany, and someone was at his bedside talking to him. He thought it was the lead singer from the heavy metal band Korn. (Laughter.) Flo thought, “What’s going on? Am I hallucinating?” But he wasn’t. It was all real.And so today, Flo, I want to assure you, you are not hallucinating. You are actually in the White House. Those cameras are on. I am not the lead singer from Korn. (Laughter.) We are here to award you our nation’s highest military honor -- distinction, the Medal of Honor.Now, Flo and I have actually met before. Three years ago, I was on one of my regular visits to Walter Reed to spend some time with our wounded warriors -- and Flo was one of them. We talked. It turns out he liked the Chicago Bears -- so I liked him right away. (Laughter.) And I had a chance to meet his parents who could not be more gracious and charming, and you get a sense of where Flo gets his character from. It is wonderful to see both of you again.I also want to welcome Flo’s girlfriend Carsen, who apparently, Flo tells me, he had to help paint an apartment with just the other day. So there’s some honeydew lists going on. (Laughter.) His many friends, fellow soldiers and family, all of our distinguished guests. A day after Veterans Day, we honor this American veteran, whose story -- like so many of our vets and wounded warriors -- speaks not only of gallantry on the battlefield, but resilience here at home.As a teenager just up the road in Bethesda, Flo discovered he had an incredible gift -- he could run. Fast. Half-mile, mile, two mile -- he’d leave his competition in the dust. He was among the best in the state. And he went on to run track and cross country at the University of Maryland.Flo’s college coach called him “the consummate teammate.” As good as he was in individual events, somehow he always found a little extra something when he was running on a relay, with a team. Distance running is really all about guts -- and as one teammate said, Flo could “suffer a little more than everyone else could.” So day after day, month after month, he pushed himself to his limit. He knew that every long run, every sprint, every interval could help shave a second or two off his times. And as he’d find out later, a few seconds can make all the difference.Training. Guts. Teamwork. What made Flo a great runner also made him a great soldier. In the Army, Flo again took his training seriously -- hitting the books in the classroom, paying attention to every detail in field exercises -- because he knew that he had to be prepared for any scenario.He deployed to Afghanistan twice; first as a platoon leader, and then a couple of years later when he was hand-picked to head up a security detail.And so it was on an August day three years ago that Flo found himself leading a group of American and Afghan soldiers as they escorted their commanders to a meeting with local Afghans. It was a journey that the team had done many times before -- a short walk on foot, including passage over a narrow bridge.At first, they passed pedestrians, a few cars and bicycles, even some children. But then they began to approach the bridge, and a pair of motorcycles sped toward them from the other side. The Afghan troops shouted at the bikers to stop -- and they did, ditching their bikes in the middle of the bridge and running away.And that’s when Flo noticed something to his left -- a man, dressed in dark clothing, walking backwards, just some 10 feet away. The man spun around and turned toward them, and that’s when Flo sprinted toward him. He pushed him away from the formation, and as he did, he noticed an object under the man’s clothing -- a bomb. The motorcycles had been a diversion.And at that moment, Flo did something extraordinary -- he grabbed the bomber by his vest and kept pushing him away. And all those years of training on the track, in the classroom, out in the field -- all of it came together. In those few seconds, he had the instincts and the courage to do what was needed. One of Flo’s comrades, Sergeant Andrew Mahoney, had joined in, too, and together they shoved the bomber again and again. And they pushed him so hard he fell to the ground onto his chest. And then the bomb detonated.Ball bearings, debris, dust exploded everywhere. Flo was thrown some 15 or 20 feet and was knocked unconscious. And moments later, he woke up in the middle of the road in shock. His eardrum was blown out. His leg was broken and bleeding badly. Still, he realized that if the enemy launched a secondary attack, he’d be a sitting duck. When a comrade found him in the smoke, Flo had his pistol out, dragging his wounded body from the road.That blast by the bridge claimed four American heroes -- four heroes Flo wants us to remember today. One of his mentors, a 24-year Army vet who always found time for Flo and any other soldier who wanted to talk -- Command Sergeant Major Kevin Griffin. A West Pointer who loved hockey and became a role model to cadets and troops because he always “cared more about other people than himself” -- Major Tom Kennedy.A popular Air Force leader known for smiling with his “whole face,” someone who always seemed to run into a friend wherever he went -- Major David Gray. And finally, a USAID foreign service officer who had just volunteered for a second tour in Afghanistan; a man who moved to the United States from Egypt and reveled in everything American, whether it was Disneyland or chain restaurants or roadside pie -- Ragaei Abdelfattah.These four men believed in America. They dedicated their lives to our country. They died serving it. Their families -- loving wives and children, parents and siblings -- bear that sacrifice most of all. So while Ragaei’s family could not be with us today, I’d ask three Gold Star families to please stand and accept our deepest thanks. (Applause.)Today, we honor Flo because his actions prevented an even greater catastrophe. You see, by pushing the bomber away from the formation, the explosion occurred farther from our forces, and on the ground instead of in the open air. And while Flo didn’t know it at the time, that explosion also caused a second, unseen bomb to detonate before it was in place. Had both bombs gone off as planned, who knows how many could have been killed.Those are the lives Flo helped to save. And we are honored that many of them are here today. Brigadier General James Mingus. Sergeant Andrew Mahoney, who was awarded a Silver Star for joining Flo in confronting the attacker. Sergeant First Class Brian Brink, who was awarded a Bronze Star with Valor for pulling Flo from the road. Specialist Daniel Balderrama, the medic who helped to save Flo’s leg. Private First Class Benjamin Secor and Sergeant Eric Ochart, who also served with distinction on that day. Gentlemen, I’d ask you to please stand and accept the thanks of a grateful nation, as well. (Applause.)At Walter Reed, Flo began his next mission -- the mission to recover. He suffered significant nerve damage, and almost half of the calf muscle in his left leg had been blown off. So the leg that had powered him around that track, the leg that moved so swiftly to counter the bomber -- that leg had been through hell and back.Thanks to 33 surgeries and some of the finest medical treatment a person can ask for, Flo kept that leg. He’s not running, but he’s doing a lot of CrossFit. I would not challenge him to CrossFit. (Laughter.) He’s putting some hurt on some rowing machines and some stair climbers. I think it is fair to say he is fit.Today, Flo is medically retired. But like so many of his fellow veterans of our 9/11 Generation, Flo continues to serve. As I said yesterday at Arlington, that’s what our veterans do -- they are incredibly highly skilled, dynamic leaders always looking to write that next chapter of service to America. For Flo, that means a civilian job with the Department of Defense to help take care of our troops and keep our military strong.And every day that he is serving, he will be wearing a bracelet on his wrist -- as he is today -- a bracelet that bears the names of his brothers in arms who gave their lives that day. The truth is, Flo says that day was the worst day of his life. And that is the stark reality behind these Medal of Honor ceremonies -- that for all the valor we celebrate, and all the courage that inspires us, these actions were demanded amid some of the most dreadful moments of war.That’s precisely why we honor heroes like Flo -- because on his very worst day, he managed to summon his very best. That's the nature of......_________________________________________________                                   More Than A MedalThe Medal of Honor has been awarded 3,513 times, 70% to Army soldiers. Besides a lifetime of honor, it carries other perquisites. Recipients receive pension supplements. They get automatic invitations to all presidential inaugurations and balls. Their children may attend any United States military service academy free of the normal nomination process. And although there is no regulation, all members of the military, including the highest-ranking generals and admirals, traditionally render salutes to each Medal of Honor winner, regardless of their military rank or duty status.___________________________________________________.......courage, not being unafraid, but confronting fear and danger and performing in a selfless fashion. He showed his guts, he showed his training; how he would put it all on the line for his teammates. That’s an American we can all be grateful for. It’s why we honor Captain Florent Groberg today.May God bless all who serve and all who have given their lives to our country. We are free because of them. May God bless their families and may God continue to bless the United States of America with heroes such as these.MILITARY AIDE: The President of the United States of America, authorized by act of Congress, March 3rd, 1863, has awarded in the name of Congress the Medal of Honor to Captain Florent A. Groberg, United States Army.Captain Florent A. Groberg distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a personal security detachment commander for Task Force Mountain Warrior, Fourth Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Fourth Infantry Division during combat operations against an armed enemy in Asadabad, Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on August 8, 2012.On that day, Captain Groberg was leading a dismounted movement consisting of several senior leaders to include two brigade commanders, two battalion commanders, two command sergeants major, and an Afghanistan National Army brigade commander.As they approached the provincial governor’s compound, Captain Groberg observed an individual walking close to the formation. While the individual made an abrupt turn towards the formation, he noticed an abnormal bulge underneath the individual’s clothing. Selflessly placing himself in front of one of the brigade commanders, Captain Groberg rushed forward using his body to push the suspect away from the formation.Simultaneously, he ordered another member of the security detail to assist with removing the suspect. At this time, Captain Groberg confirmed the bulge was a suicide vest. And with complete disregard for this life, Captain Groberg, again, with the assistance of the other member of the security detail, physically pushed the suicide bomber away from the formation.Upon falling, the suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest outside of the perimeter of the formation, killing four members of the formation and wounding numerous others. The blast from the first suicide bomb caused the suicide vest of a previously unnoticed second suicide bomber to detonate prematurely with minimal impact on the formation.Captain Groberg’s immediate actions to push the first suicide bomber away from the formation significantly minimized the impact of the coordinated suicide bombers’ attack on the formation, saving the lives of his comrades and several senior leaders.Captain Groberg’s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty at the risk of his life on keeping with the highest traditions of the military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, Fourth Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Fourth Infantry Division, and the United States Army. (Applause.) [The benediction is offered.]THE PRESIDENT: That concludes the formal portion of this ceremony. I need to take some pictures with the outstanding team members, as well as the Gold Start families who are here today, as Flo reminds us this medal, in his words, honors them as much as any honors that are bestowed upon him. And on Veterans Day Week, that is particularly appropriate.I want to thank all of our service members here today, all who could not attend. And I hope you enjoy an outstanding reception. I hear the food is pretty good here. (Laughter.) Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Give Captain Groberg a big round of applause again. (Applause.) Thank you. ####

"
281,LEG,"""When you are being tortured, you concentrate on the moment and getting through that and not worry about what happens next,"" Robinson, 72, told IBD from his home in Madisonville, Tenn. ""The key to survival mentally and physically for me was being brought up by my mom in a Christian home.
"
282,LEG,"""I always remembered that she told me I would never be given a burden greater than I could bear. But I had to do a lot of tall praying for 2,703 days.""
"
283,LEG,"Robinson was born in the cotton mill town of Roanoke Rapids, N.C., in 1943. His mother, Lillian, had trouble making ends meet because his father, William, was with the Army overseas, on the road selling something or with a girlfriend, and rarely sent money.
"
284,LEG,"Lillian died when Bill was 15, and he moved in with his grandparents.
"

""One was Jesus Christ for your sins, the other was the American soldier for your freedom. In World War II, there was 100% mobilization, where everyone on the home front was involved. During the Korean War, it was 50%. By Vietnam, it was 10%. Now 1% are still willing to give their all. For me, every day is a good day when I'm not in handcuffs and leg irons.""Airman 1st Class Bill Robinson was part of the team trying to rescue a downed pilot in North Vietnam on Sept. 20, 1965. Enemy ground fire nailed their helicopter.After crash landing, the four-man crew and pilot were captured.The Vietnamese would not release Robinson for 7-1/2 years, making him the longest-held enlisted man in U.S. history.""When you are being tortured, you concentrate on the moment and getting through that and not worry about what happens next,"" Robinson, 72, told IBD from his home in Madisonville, Tenn. ""The key to survival mentally and physically for me was being brought up by my mom in a Christian home.""I always remembered that she told me I would never be given a burden greater than I could bear. But I had to do a lot of tall praying for 2,703 days.""Robinson was born in the cotton mill town of Roanoke Rapids, N.C., in 1943. His mother, Lillian, had trouble making ends meet because his father, William, was with the Army overseas, on the road selling something or with a girlfriend, and rarely sent money.Lillian died when Bill was 15, and he moved in with his grandparents.Three years later, he joined the Air Force and did basic training in San Antonio, then stayed on to learn to repair helicopters.Off To AsiaAssigned to a B-52 bomber wing in Altus, Okla., he was with a group that flew parts and personnel to 12 Atlas nuclear missile sites. In 1963, his unit ferried negotiators between North and South Korea.In April 1965, Robinson went to Bangkok, Thailand, to provide support for a helicopter rescue group.President Lyndon Johnson had ordered Operation Rolling Thunder over North Vietnam that February, and it would continue for nearly four years, the longest bombing campaign in U.S. history.Crews of planes shot down were being captured by North Vietnamese. Trying to prevent that were rescue teams in the modified Kaman HH-43B Huskie, a chopper with heavy armor and firepower that could travel 110 miles on one trip.Robinson flew on two rescue missions as the crew chief or flight engineer. For the one in May, he would receive the Silver Star, the third highest combat decoration, eight years later.On Sept. 20, his crew consisted of Capt. Thomas Curtis, the pilot; 1st Lt. Duane Martin, the co-pilot; and Airman 3rd Class Arthur Black, the pararescue medic.They flew as the low bird assigned to pick up Capt. Willis Forby; the high bird hovered to scout and provide covering fire.Escorting them all were A1-E Skyraider fighters.Arriving at the site at 3,700 feet, Robinson's chopper fell into communist cross hairs, with harrowing results: The local militia took all five men prisoner.Robinson, just 22, arrived Oct. 1 in Hanoi. During the war, fifteen prison camps operated in the region, most of them filthy, with rats, mosquitoes, cockroaches and ants crawling over the prisoners' plates of rice. Soup was often boiled grass.Occasionally came a hairy piece of pork fat or a vegetable that had been fertilized with human feces.Sometimes the Americans went weeks without being allowed to bathe. Temperatures were often blistering or freezing, with inadequate clothing and blankets.Disease was rampant.At first, the enemy used torture to try to extract confessions of war crimes.Pointing to the trials of Nazi and Japanese leaders after World War II, North Vietnam wanted to justify executions. After an international backlash, it backed down but attempted to use confessions for propaganda purposes and to gain information about military operations.The code of conduct for the U.S. military urged noncompliance, which POW leaders saw wasn't realistic. ""Our officers told us to resist until we were going to suffer permanent bodily harm and then to try our best to avoid divulging anything that was of importance,"" Robinson said. ""We would joke about it, like when I came back after a beating and told my cell mate, 'You should have seen what I did to him,' because a sense of humor helped us survive.""I developed my three-day motto: Yesterday was the day that I was captured, today is today, and tomorrow is the day that I go home.""The communists used a variety of techniques to force the POWs to talk, making the Americans: Sit bent over for days in caves that were only 4 feet high and half-filled with cold water. Run through trenches blindfolded and with hands tied behind their backs, which resulted in hitting their heads against obstacles. Kneel for long periods with an iron bar between their kneecaps and the concrete floor; it made their knees bleed and swell up. Sit — in a darkened room, a single beam of light shining in their faces — on a cinder block that rose eight inches high, with their hands behind their backs, putting all the weight on their tailbones.Surviving""Virtually every early captive in the North has stated that the two keys to survival and resistance were the chain of command and the development of ways to communicate with other prisoners,"" said Glenn Robins, author of ""The Longest Rescue: The Life and Legacy of Vietnam POW William A. Robinson."" ""Early on, they were often in separate cells and developed a code to tap messages. They found they could talk through brick-and-mortar walls by pressing a tin cup against the wall, used sign language and scratched messages on the bottoms of plates and cups.""Occasionally, the POWs were allowed to write to their families and receive replies, in compliance with international rules of war.Robinson became one of the most famous POWs when he was one of seven pictured in the April 7, 1967, issue of Life magazine.Robinson found that helping others gave him a sense of purpose.

325,LEG,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a maker of robotic-surgery systems, late Tuesday posted Q2 earnings and revenue that handily beat Wall Street expectations, sending shares rising after hours.Earnings per share minus items rose 23% from the year-earlier quarter, to $5.62, while sales rose 14%, to $670 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $4.97 and $640.7 million.The maker of da Vinci surgical systems, for minimally invasive surgery, didn't provide guidance in its earnings release. Analysts expect EPS ex items this quarter of $5.16, down 1.5%, on sales of $647.5 million, up 10%.Intuitive Surgical stock was up nearly 5% in after-hours trading, after the company released its results. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 671.90. Intuitive stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base at a 654.98 buy point on June 23. So, shares remain within buy range.Da Vinci's success has spawned more competition. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Verily unit, formerly Google Life Sciences, has teamed with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) on advanced surgical robots. Early Tuesday, J&J posted a Q2 earnings beat, and Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high Tuesday, closing up 1.7% at 125.25. Medtronic (MDT) made a big move into this field with its acquisition last year of Covidien.The company said the number of da Vinci procedures rose nearly 16% in Q2 vs. Q2 2015, while it shipped 130 da Vinci systems vs. 118 in Q2 2015.In a pre-earnings research note, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter said Intuitive was increasingly benefiting from the ""next leg of growth"" for its da Vinci Xi system, launched in 2014.
"
326,LEG,"While many medical stocks have been having a tough year, makers of medical devices and systems have been popular lately, especially large-cap names that offer stability in uncertain times. This week some of the biggest names will show whether their Q2 performance justifies investors' trust.Reporting late Tuesday, robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is expected to continue its recent growth rebound, though at a slower pace as year-over-year comparisons have been made tougher by a strong 2015. Analysts currently expect both earnings and sales to grow 9% over the year-earlier quarter, after growing 24% and 12%, respectively, in Q1.In a July 15 preview of the second half of the year, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter wrote that he'll be watching the continued uptake of the da Vinci Xi surgical system, whose 2014 launch helped Intuitive Surgical turn around after a rough couple of years.""Importantly, we see Intuitive Surgical at a turning point as it transitions to its next leg(s) of growth (general surgery, outside-U.S. expansion) -- amid stabilization in urology/gynecology franchises -- and increasingly begins to benefit from the Xi new product cycle,"" Newitter wrote.Intuitive Surgical's stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base in June. Intuitive rose fractionally to 670.54 on the stock market today.On Wednesday morning, medical-device titan Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and the company it's in the process of acquiring, St. Jude Medical (STJ), are both due to report earnings. Both companies have struggled in the growth department in recent quarters, but St. Jude's top line has been accelerating: from 1% in Q4 to 8% in Q1 and an estimated 10% in Q2. Abbott, which did not grow at all the previous two quarters, is expected to report single-digit percentage growth on both the top and bottom lines.The global footprint of both companies hit them with foreign-exchange headwinds, which RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro expects to continue in the Q2 report.""Given a stronger U.S. Dollar, especially against several emerging-market currencies, we are lowering our 2016 sales forecast (for Abbott) by $55 million to $20.7 billion (up 1% reported, up 4% constant currency),"" Novarro wrote in a July 11 preview note. ""Despite the greater FX headwind for 2016, we would expect management to reaffirm its 2016 revenue guidance (up low-single digits reported, up mid-single digits constant currency) and EPS guidance range.""Abbott has also said it would buy diagnostics company Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion, but the closing has been in doubt since the company has admitted to accounting problems. Last week Alere reported preliminary 2015 and Q1 financials, leaving some analysts to believe the deal will go through. They will no doubt be interested in what Abbott's management has to say about this on the conference call.Abbott shares shaved off a penny to close the day at 42.09. St. Jude shares inched up 7 cents to 80.56. Alere slipped 0.8% to 43.26.IBD'S TAKE: Medical device stocks have lately been a mainstay of IBD's Big Cap 20, stocks chosen for strong potential gains without the volatility of smaller growth stocks. See who else is on the Big Cap 20 list.Finally, late Thursday orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK) is set to report a Q2 of modest but accelerating growth, with an estimated 15% sales rise that would be the highest since 2011. Stryker's been having a gangbusters 2016, with its stock up more than 30% and an IBD Composite Rating putting it in the top 6% of all stocks.""Stryker has been growing its top line in the 5.0%-6.0% range for the last couple of years, and we see this momentum continuing over the next several years, as U.S. reconstructive volumes are stable, U.S. hospitals' capital spending is stable, and recent tuck-in acquisitions should drive faster sales growth than the corporate average,"" analyst Novarro wrote in a preview note Friday, in which he raised his estimates and his price target on Stryker. ""Furthermore, the company is gaining share in each of its core segments (Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology/Spine).""Styker stock ended trading down 0.4% to 121.62.

327,LEG,"Phil Knight just does it.He turns Nike into a champion.He makes icons out of the Swoosh and the athletes who wear it, from track king Carl Lewis to tennis queen Serena Williams.He has $24 billion, ranking 17th among America's wealthiest, reports Forbes.As CEO for four decades and now chairman, he's overseen Nike (NKE) stock sprints of 9,000% (1984-97) and 613% (2009-15).He's out with a book, ""Shoe Dog,"" a tale of his long slog in the footwear industry.By next year, the Nike co-founder will wear a new title: former executive. He'll be leaving the world's No. 1 sports merchandising company, with 63,000 employees and $31 billion in annual sales.""Pretty good when you consider that in 1964 we had $8,000 in sales and $234 in profit,"" Knight, 78, told IBD. ""We had to run a tight ship.""And what waves he's created.""He built an empire on a vision of shoes,"" said H.W. Brands, author of ""Masters of Enterprise."" ""He made lots of money, employed lots of people and gave great satisfaction to his customers. He could have done a lot worse.""Knight also has made lots of impressions with Nike's advertising, especially with the ""Just Do It"" campaign.""When the Bulls won their third straight National Basketball Association title in June 1993,"" Donald Katz wrote in his book, ""Just Do It,"" on the Knight endeavor, ""the most popular line imprinted on caps and sweatshirts was a play on Nike's famous call to arms of the reinvention years: 'Just Did It' went the variant apothegm. 'Again And Again And Again.' ""That repeat success has led to Swoosh equipment all over the field. They're all so colorful these days, with Olympic track shoes and college football helmets especially going Nike neon and glossy.The college football uniforms ""have all sorts of fingerprints,"" said Knight, lauding Todd Van Horn and Tinker Hatfield in the Nike design department.As for what gets the chairman going, ""I'm still a good shoe guy. New shoes light me up.""Which brings up the Olympics, running Aug. 5 to 21 in Rio de Janeiro.""I always get pumped up for the Olympics,"" said Knight. ""I'm a running guy, and I like that this is really the chance for track and field to shine.""We get to display our product. If this were a fashion show, that would be our runway.""The Olympics always bring back memories, especially with Tiger shoes at our first Games, the 1968 Olympics.""By that two-week extravaganza in Mexico City, Knight's dream was still fresh. As he noted in ""Shoe Dog,"" the sneaker idea germinated during a 1962 run in his native Portland, Ore., not long after graduating from the University of Oregon, Stanford's business school and the Army.He thought of one of his teacher's points: ""The cowards never started, and the weak died along the way -- that leaves us.""He also thought of what inspired him: ""The secret of happiness ... lay somewhere in that moment when the ball is in midair, when both boxers sense the approach of the bell, when the runners near the finish line and the crowd rises as one. ... I wanted that, whatever that was, to be my life, my daily life. ... So that morning in 1962 I told myself: Let everyone else call your idea crazy ... just keep going. Don't stop.""He didn't. Soon he was off to Japan to land a deal selling sneakers in America. He went on to travel more of Asia and beyond, finally settling home in early 1963 and seeing that first box arrive: ""12 pairs of shoes, creamy white, with blue stripes down the sides. God, they were beautiful. ... I'd seen nothing in Florence or Paris that surpassed them.""Knight was infatuated, something crucial in what drives him: ""Your business has to be something you really love. Remember that there will be a lot of dark moments. You never make it overnight. You have to be prepared for the tough times. As my Stanford Small Business Management professor Frank Shallenberger liked to say, 'The only time you must not fail is the last time you try.' ""Knight simply kept trying. He asked for shoe input from his Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman, and over lunch in January 1964 he told him ""about my trip around the world. Kobe, Jordan, the Temple of Nike.""Bowerman was hooked: ""Those Japanese shoes. They're pretty good. How about letting me in on the deal?""Knight: ""When the waitress dropped off the check for the two hamburgers, we split that too. Fifty-fifty.""The Knight-Bowerman team became Blue Ribbon Sports, distributing Japanese-made shoes in the American West.""I quit my job at the accounting firm,"" wrote Knight, ""and all that spring I did nothing but sell shoes out of the trunk of my Valiant.""By July, he had sold out his first shipment. He ordered 900 more and got a bank loan to back him. It was part of a hot 1964, with every Japanese runner at the Tokyo Olympics wearing the same Tigers that Knight was selling.The next year, Knight made his first hire, Jeff Johnson, who would brainstorm the firm's new name: Nike, for the Greek goddess of victory.Knight cheers such wisdom: ""Underlining all the hurdles are people. We've hired a lot of creative people, whether they're the lawyers to think or the accountants to count. The people are the life and death of our company.""Then there was Carolyn Davidson. Knight met her in a college hallway and asked her to design print ads. She created the Swoosh that ran as hard as any company's logo, including the McDonald's (MCD) arches.Johnson put it this way: ""It was a holy mission, you know, to Swoosh the world, to get Swooshes on everybody's feet. We were Knight's crusaders. We would have died on the cross.""Knight's company was alive and kicking in the late 1960s, doubling sales yearly to today's equivalent of $2 million. Still, he taught accounting at Portland State University for needed cash. And while there he met a student, Penelope Parks, who became his wife and mother of their two sons.The next decade brought Knight his first big-name endorsement athlete, Romanian tennis star Ilie Nastase, and college basketball coach Dick Harter of Oregon. Such recognition helped Nike ignite sales from $8 million in 1974 (worth $38 million today) to $140 million in 1979 (or $457 million now).The 1980s saw Nike factories humming in Taiwan, Korea, England and Ireland, and Knight's fortune multiplying to the $200 million range.The CEO was sitting pretty at Nike's Beaverton, Ore., headquarters, which expanded to 200 acres with buildings named after endorsement stars: Joan Benoit, Ken Griffey Jr., Mia Hamm, Tiger Woods, Dan Fouts, Jerry Rice, Steve Prefontaine.The biggest Nike get was Michael Jordan, fresh out of college in 1984. Knight saw him as an NBA giant before many others did and signed him to beat sneaker rival Reebok.""I just don't want to be like my competitors,"" noted Knight, who also says: ""We take a lot of our culture off the athletic field. Just like with tackles and running backs, we have to have better people than the competition.""He recalled a remark by Bowerman, who died in 1999: ""Play by the rules, but be ferocious.""As Jordan soared, so did the firm he sported. ""Air Jordan proved to be a very good thing for Nike,"" wrote Brands. ""The line sold more than $100 million in its first year, the largest figure for any endorsement in history until then.""From 1985 to 1993, wrote Katz, ""Nike's ad budget swelled from under $20 million to well over $150 million -- new Nike commercials projected billions of Michael Jordan impressions with each new selling season.""Knight, the former middle-distance runner, was on another lap toward becoming ""the most powerful man in sports,"" as the Sporting News dubbed him.Now in his last leg as Nike's chairman, Knight spends half his time on projects at the Beaverton office a half-hour from his home, in what he calls a good relationship with CEO Mark Parker.Knight doesn't run anymore, no thanks to his age. Instead, he walks for exercise and stays atop his old sport.Watching a race once, he said: ""There was much to be learned from such a display of passion, whether you were running a mile or a company.""Co-founded Nike.Overcame: A culture that hadn't caught on to the running mania.Lesson: Get ahead of the pack and keep going.""I believed in running. I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves. Belief, I decided. Belief is irresistible.""Related:Nike Climbed 38,673% On A Powerful Brand, InnovationHenry Crowell, Oatmeal Tycoon And Marketing PioneerCan Stephen Curry Be Under Armour's Michael Jordan?

328,LEG,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's health care plan, released over the weekend, could have a positive impact for some companies in the medical hardware and development market, says Evercore ISI.Analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research report that Clinton's plan to encourage research and development spending should give a boost to providers of life science tools and services used in pharmaceutical development.""The added focus on generics and biosimilars can add an additional leg of growth to the pharma end market, largely continuing to benefit chromatography (Agilent (A), Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)), Waters (WAT)) and separations players (Pall/Danaher (DHR)),"" Muken wrote. ""The one potential offset would be if the increased scrutiny on drug pricing led to fewer total dollars spend on R&D (we view that as unlikely).""All the above stocks are currently highly rated by IBD metrics -- especially Danaher, which hold a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99 and is trading at all-time highs. Danaher stock closed down 1% at 80.08 on the stock market today, after touching a record high of 81.28 on Friday.Agilent shares fell 0.2%, Thermo Fisher also lost 0.2% and Waters eased 0.5%.Clinton also wants to clear out the backlog of generic drug applications in the FDA and shorten the seven-year exclusivity period granted to biosimilar drugs. Muken says this should accelerate production by companies making these drugs and drive business for contract research organizations (CROs).""Additionally, the plan's intention to hold drug companies accountable and require value-based studies to justify the high drug prices could accelerate pharma's adoption of real-world data services,"" he said. ""This adoption could provide CROs another avenue of growth outside the traditional clinical trial outsourcing and is one of the reasons highlighted by Quintiles' (Q) management for the Quintiles/IMS Health (IMS) merger.""Parexel (PRXL) has also named real-world data services as a growth driver, Muken noted.Quintiles stock, with a middling CR of 58, fell 0.8% Monday. Parexel, which holds an excellent IBD EPS Rank of 97, dipped less than 0.1%.The outlook is more mixed for clinical devices and systems. On the one hand, if the plan succeeds in expanding the number of covered lives it will help boost demand for things like orthopedic and cardiovascular implants, and the focus on women's health could be positive for Hologic (HOLX), Muken wrote. On the other hand, it could increase the pricing pressure that's already been dogging the industry.""Players like Medtronic (MDT) who are already shifting to a value-based business model are best positioned for the next leg of evolution in the health care space,"" Muken wrote.Medtronic stock, with a strong CR of 90, hit a new intraday high of 88.91 Monday before closing at 88.51. Hologic stock, which has been consolidating as the company goes through a financial turnaround, fell 0.9% to 35.61.

329,LEG,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Ono Pharmaceuticals could benefit from a ""meaningful"" royalty stream on Merck's (MRK) Keytruda following a $625 million settlement announced Friday, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday.In the stock market today, Merck and Bristol-Myers stocks split the difference. Merck stock dipped 1.2% to 61.81, while Bristol-Myers stock lifted 1.6% to 50. That was a reversal from Friday, when Merck rose 3.6% but Bristol-Myers plunged 11% to a more than two-year low.Merck will make Bristol-Myers a one-time payment of $625 million to settle all patent infringement litigation related to Keytruda. Merck will also pay a 6.5% royalty on Keytruda sales from January 2017 through December 2023. The rate will drop to 2.5% for the following three years.Bristol-Myers will get 75% of the royalties. Japan's Ono will get the remainder. Bristol-Myers and Ono developed Opdivo in 2014, using the PD-1 antibody to target cancer in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Japan. The duo say Merck's Keytruda infringed on their patent.IBD'S TAKE: Merck tied Biogen and Eli Lilly for most drug approvals in 2016 (two apiece). But that was the slowest year in nine years for the FDA. Read IBD'S Industry Themes for deeper analysis.Keytruda also targets cancer via the programmed cell death-1 receptor (PD-1). Keytruda is approved as a monotherapy for metastatic melanoma and head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma. Late last year, it got an indication for non-small cell lung cancer in patients with a high expression of the PD-L1 gene.Now, Merck is testing Keytruda (an immuno-oncology drug) in combination with Eli Lilly's Alimta chemotherapy. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers is looking at combining Opdivo and Yervoy (both I-O drugs) in NSCLC. Though Bristol-Myers isn't looking for accelerated approval for the combo.Divan estimates Keytruda will garner $4.6 billion in sales this year, rising to $10 billion in 2022. The royalty on those sales could be ""quite meaningful,"" he wrote in a research report. Still, Divan has an outperform rating on Merck stock and a neutral rating on Bristol-Myers stock.""The settlement will provide some underappreciated upside to Bristol-Myers and remove some of the economic contribution that is currently assumed for Merck,"" he wrote. ""But overall we still prefer Merck given the impact we expect Keytruda to have on Merck's sales and earnings growth.""RELATED:Bristol-Myers Threatens Merck's 'Head Start' In Lung Cancer: AnalystMerck Lung-Cancer Drug May Get OK For Large Patient PopulationMerck Carries Incyte On Keytruda Coattails In 4 'Hot' Tumors: Leerink

Since late 2015, Ametek has been in base-building mode, consolidating its big gains.Cosmetics name Estee Lauder (EL) also appeared within the top 10 holdings of the Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund, also featured on the same day. The stock went on to build a number of bases amid a slow yet steady rally.As you scan through these top funds' holdings, you might feel vindicated by seeing names you may already have identified. You'll also find others that haven't grabbed your attention.Now scan to another column in each box. ""Top New Buys"" shows stocks that have recently hit the fund's radar. This gets very interesting. You're seeing stocks that this top-rated fund is in a hurry to buy. The MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund has been pushing to rake in shares of Starbucks (SBUX), which has been rising for months in tight trade. The stock has since climbed more than 150% through its recent peak of 64.10.Finally, the fund's Top Sells tell you what the fund is unloading.

"
331,LEG,"Do you know someone who's said, ""IBD investing is simply momentum investing?"" Well, you know that person is dead wrong. How about the officemate who believes that the IBD method is all about marrying the search for fast-growing companies with a preference for stocks boasting high relative strength?Well, yes, but even that explanation is off target.If you have a deep desire to find great stocks and achieve superior returns, you must always be cognizant of the third critical aspect of investing -- the overwhelming buying and selling power of financial institutions.Outstanding fund sponsorship is what ultimately gives a stock the strength to outstrip its peers and the market itself.It's the reason why in a good market year -- when the major indexes are up 15%, 20% or more -- the best stocks are up 200%, 400% or more in the same time frame.If you're new to investing, you might ask: ""OK, just who are these institutional investors?""Practically every adult has heard of mutual funds, which have been around for decades. Today, it's a multitrillion-dollar industry in terms of the assets these investing professionals manage.These funds make up just part of the investing universe. Large insurance companies, public and private pension plans, hedge funds and registered investment advisors also hold most of the biggest chips on the table. And many of these players join the stock-market game with billions of dollars in client money.Don't forget the investment divisions of corporations, sovereign wealth funds, ETF companies and university endowments, too. Got the picture?The 2008-09 Lehman-Bear-WaMu-Countrywide debacle certainly damaged the fund management industry. But in June of 2011, Pensions & Investments reported that total managed assets of 716 firms surveyed worldwide rebounded to $29.24 trillion in 2010, surpassing the precrisis 2007 peak.In other words, institutional power is as strong as ever.Keep that in mind the next time you buy shares. The success of your investment hinges totally on whether smart investment managers are hoarding the same stock.Over the next week, this new Investor's Corner series will spotlight the unique tools and features in IBD and sister charting and screening service MarketSmith (access it via the home page of Investors.com) to help you find the stocks that are becoming institutional favorites.Remember, most of the biggest market winners need at least a year to rise from proper buy point to peak. So, even if IBD profiles on the current holdings of top-notch mutual funds (see stories in the ETFs & Funds section, found underneath ""Research"" on the home page of Investors.com, as well as stories in IBD Weekly) might seem dated, but it is still useful because a good mutual fund takes months or even a few quarters to build a large position in a single stock. That's definitely been the case with IBD 50 name NetEase (NTES), a big winner lately. As the table shows, mutual and hedge fund sponsorship has been growing for more than a year.When you see strong volume in a market leader's chart and you know that outstanding funds have been buying funds, your conviction in that stock will likely solidify.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD Stock Checkup allows you to quickly see which companies are leaders in their industry group in terms of Accumulation/Distribution Rating. A good Accumulation rating of A or B implies that institutional demand for the stock is strong or rising. Also, when fund managers are crowding into a stock, their big buys trigger a breakout, the best time to buy a stock. Read this Investor's Corner to learn how to spot good breakouts.(Editor's Note: This story originally published in the Feb. 10, 2012, edition of IBD.)

332,LEG,"Rep. Sam Johnson gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksWednesday is Veterans' Day, and as you might imagine, it has a very special meaning for me. Today, I want to tell you why.I served in the Air Force for 29 years. I flew combat missions in both the Korea and the Vietnam wars. And in 1966, when I was serving in Vietnam, I was shot down and taken prisoner. I spent nearly seven years in the Hanoi Hilton. And when I got out, I weighed about 140 pounds. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)I got through those years by the grace and mercy of God and He gave me all the support I needed in my fellow POWs—great men like Jerry Denton and Jim Stockdale. We weren’t allowed to talk. So the first night in my cell—after I got out of the torture room—they taught me the tap code. The three of us did everything we could to fight back against our captors. So we were blacklisted as hardcore resisters.Soon we were moved to the place we called 'Alcatraz' POW camp along with eight others. The 11 of us became the 'Alcatraz Gang.' There, we spent 42 months in solitary confinement with our legs shackled.There was no news from home, and our captors did their best to make us feel forgotten. But my Alcatraz buddies and I were a family. We banded together, encouraged one another, and kept each other’s spirits up.I still remember one night in particular. I had spent 74 days in leg irons, and it had been a long time since I had seen the sky and the sun. I felt finished. But that night, a typhoon tore through the city of Hanoi. The floor of my cell filled with water, and I huddled against the wall as far away from the rain as I could. I began to pray as I had never prayed before. And I felt a strange sense of peace in the darkness.The next morning, my cell was flooded with the light of dawn. The storm had stopped. The boards off our window were taken off and I had an overwhelming sense of the presence of God at that moment. I knew I was going to be all right. And just a few hours later, guards came into my cell and removed my legs from the stocks.Telling that story reminds me of something a fellow captive etched on one of the walls.It read, 'Freedom has a taste to those who fight and almost die that the protected will never know.'You know, freedom isn’t free. It has a cost. And that cost is paid first by our veterans and their families—because when one member joins, it is the whole family that serves.When our veterans come home, we should do all we can to make sure they get the care they need when they need it. That is the least we can do.For now, I just want to wish all our servicemen and women a very happy Veterans’ Day.God bless you all, and God bless America. I salute you. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:GOP: Let's sell U.S. energy abroadThank you, Mr. President, for all you've done to DemocratsMost transparent presidency closes more meetings than everObama aides explain how deadly gunfight with ISIS isn't combat

348,LEG,"Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY) has spiked nearly 7% so far this week in a two-day rally that broke shares above an 82.81 buy point to a new high.The company's fiscal-second-quarter report on Monday ignited the gain. Chief Executive Michael O'Leary pointed to a ""bumper summer"" for the economy airline, with results boosted by a strong pound, effectively flat industry capacity and ongoing savings from cheap fuel.The Dublin-based airline started the year expecting to haul 100 million passengers. It now expects 105 million, adding an additional 1 million to its September forecast. It has hedged 95% of its fuel costs for 2016 at an average of around $62 a barrel — a much better price than most rivals.O'Leary also said the company planned on holding air fares steady in its fiscal third quarter, its ""Christmas quarter,"" then reduce fares 4% as capacity increases 22% in the following quarter.O'Leary told Bloomberg that, ""extraneous events"" notwithstanding, the next two summers should be stronger, with weaker winters. But whereas Ryanair had previously been forced to ground planes during the winter lull, this year ""we're essentially grounding nothing,"" he said.Ryanair's earnings dipped 2% in 2014, then shot up 62% last year. This year, the company is on track to hit analyst estimates of 30% EPS growth. On Monday, the airline reported earnings up 41%, which was 36% above consensus expectations, despite a slender, 3% rise in revenue.A strong pound and strong dollar are giving a leg up to euro-based airlines, including Ryanair, and economy peers like EasyJet, as well as larger players such as Deutsche Lufthansa.Ryanair was the first to launch a low-cost carrier in Europe following deregulation in 1992. Now there are a slew of economy carriers, including EasyJet and Air Berlin. Large air carriers have also begun cutting rates for short-hop flights within Europe.But the Financial Times reported Monday that larger carriers ""have been pulling back from short-haul routes and are ceding market share to smaller airlines.""O'Leary pointed out that the company had launched a new website over the weekend aimed at linking ""a platform of 105 million passengers"" into travel deals. ""We've been late to Big Data, we've been late to the mobile app,"" he said, ""but we're catching up very quickly.""

350,LEG,"The political drama of recent days has left investors feeling shaken, stirred and altogether out of sorts. That's giving another leg up to the asset classes investors favor in turbulent times: gold and long Treasury bonds.Low-volatility stocks, another safety play, have fallen along with the broad market as the Brexit vote's impact continues to be felt. But they're holding up better than the benchmark S&P 500.IShares Edge MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) fell 1.8% on the stock market Friday – or about half the 3.6% decline for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). That price move for USMV came in heavy trade – nearly three times the average daily dollar volume.On Monday, USMV fell 0.5% vs. a 1.7% loss for SPY. Year to date through June 24, USMV is up 7.5% vs. a 0.7% gain for SPY.Friday was a ""perfect example"" of how low volatility exchange traded funds can lower overall risk in a portfolio, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence.""They did exactly what they are supposed to do,"" he added.USMV tracks an index of U.S.-listed companies selected and weighted to create a low volatility portfolio. It holds 177 stocks including AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The strategy studies how holdings interact with one another and limits sector bets – a point of difference from peer PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), which simply invests in the 100 least volatile stocks in the parent index.This choppy year, the USMV strategy has resonated with investors. It has seen $5.91 billion in net inflow year to date, topping every other equity exchange traded fund.Some investing experts point out that low volatility ETFs are starting to look pricey and that late-comers to the party are performance chasing.Rosenbluth thinks investors should be buying them not for their strong record, but for the low risk profile of the securities inside them. That's certainly worth paying up for, he added.With Brexit – Britons' exit from the European Union – adding to the mood of uncertainty, Rosenbluth expects volatility will increase in both the U.S. and international equity markets.Low volatility ETFs give them a way a way to stay in the equity markets with less whipsawing, he added.

351,LEG,"When poring over stock charts for proper bases, you should look for instances of positive action, such as upside reversals and shakeouts.Basically, positive reversals and shakeouts tell you that there's demand for shares. Both are good things to see on charts, and at times, they can be buying opportunities.An upside or positive reversal is when a stock sells off and then bounces back, finishing higher on the session. A stock may open lower on disappointing earnings news, lowered guidance or a downgrade, but battle back to close higher on the day. The action is bullish and is even more so if it takes place in robust volume.Upside reversals show strength in times of adversity. Sometimes they occur at key moving averages such as the 50-day or 200-day lines on a daily chart. They can also take place at prior lows or consolidation levels.While positive reversals are good things to see on the daily chart, investors should also look for them on the weekly time frame. Erasing a good part of a loss and finishing in the upper 60% of the week's range in strong volume are good signs.For stocks that stage weekly upside reversals, volume should be above-average or at least up from the previous week. This could be a sign of support from institutions.Shakeouts can come in several ways. A pullback that creates a handle can be a shakeout. The retreat scares out weak holders and sets the stock for the next leg up.At other times, a shakeout involves a more prolonged downturn and subsequent bounce that takes place over several days or weeks.A shakeout can also take place when a stock takes out a prior low and then rebounds. It doesn't have to close higher, but well off the time frame's worst levels. For example, the second low in a double-bottom base is a shakeout.SunPower (SPWR) cleared a deep cup-with-handle base at 40.10 back in January 2007. The correction was 47%, which is unusually deep.The stock staged a huge upside reversal in the week ended July 21, 2006, in big volume (1), thus showing solid demand. Turnover that week dwarfed that of the prior week. The stock also staged a solid reversal in mid-June, finishing in the upper half of the week's range (2). The reversal week marked the 23.75 low in the base. After breaking out, SunPower rallied 310% by November the same year.(Editor's note: This column originally published in the Feb. 4, 2013, edition of IBD.)

352,LEG,"Health Reform: The health care law President Obama signed six years ago was supposed to fix the individual insurance market with enlightened rules and regulations. Instead, ObamaCare is destroying this market. Just look at what's happening to Blue Cross Blue Shield.If any insurer could cope with ObamaCare, it should have been Blue Cross Blue Shield.Blue Cross companies came into the ObamaCare exchanges with decades of experience writing individual policies. Most of them are non-profits, which gives them an automatic leg up on the competition. And their plans captured the largest share of the exchange markets across the country.But as with everything else about ObamaCare, it hasn't work out that way.Last week Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota made a stunning announcement that it was pulling out of the state's individual insurance market altogether, after losing $500 million.It might not be the last of the Blues to abandon ObamaCare. Across the country Blue Cross affiliates are losing staggering amounts of money thanks to the law, and are putting in for premium hikes that would have been unimaginable before ObamaCare.For example, Health Care Services Corp. -- which owns Blue Cross affiliates in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas -- lost $1.5 billion on its ObamaCare-compliant plans last year.As a result, it's requesting a nearly 60% rate hike in Texas, and almost 50% in Oklahoma. HCSC pulled out of the New Mexico exchange last year after the state turned down its 50%-plus rate increase.Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, meanwhile, lost about $300 million in ObamaCare's first two years and is likely to lose another $100 million this year. It wants a 62% increase in premiums, on top of the 36% it got last year.Highmark Group, which owns Blue Cross affiliates in Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia, lost $266 million in just the first nine months of 2015.Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina lost $280 million on ObamaCare in 2015. Earlier this year, CEO Brad Wilson talked about possibly pulling out of ObamaCare, saying that ""we can't offer something for sale in this marketplace that we know every time it's purchased we're losing money.""Arizona'S Blue Cross wants a 65% rate hike after reporting $185 million in losses in ObamaCare's first two years.In Alabama, Blue Cross figures it lost $135 million last year, and $64 million in Nebraska.Then there's the departure of UnitedHealth Group from most of its ObamaCare markets, Humana's exit from several, and the demise of 13 of the 23 ObamaCare-created insurance co-ops, and double-digit rate requests across the country.Cynthia Cox of the Kaiser Family Foundation admitted to NPR that ObamaCare isn't exactly working out as intended. ""The hope was that these markets would encourage exchange competition and (get) more insurers to come in.""I don't know if we're at a point where it's completely worrisome,"" she went on, ""but I think it does raise some red flags in pointing out that insurance companies need to be able to make a profit or at least cover their costs.""We are well beyond the point where it's ""worrisome."" Obama and his fellow Democrats tried to refashion the insurance market to their liking, and failed.The question now isn't whether ObamaCare exchanges will somehow stabilize someday, but what comes next.Follow IBD Editorials on Twitter and Facebook.

353,LEG,"Oil gained Monday, extending its advance from a one-month low last week, as equities rose and the dollar slipped on speculation the U.K. will vote to remain in the European Union.Futures rose 2.9% in New York. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell for a fourth day and global equities surged as a poll showed the campaign for the U.K. to stay in the EU leading by three percentage points. Oil prices closed at a one-month low on Thursday as speculation the U.K. would leave the EU intensified and central banks signaled their worries about global growth. Gasoline futures climbed the most in a month.""The market is being moved by the vagaries of the upcoming vote and the emotions around it,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, a New York-based hedge fund focused on energy. ""Prices are going to move up and down through the end of this week on Brexit headlines.""Crude has advanced more than 80% from the lowest level in 12 years as disruptions from Nigeria to Canada and falling output in the U.S. trim a global glut.West Texas intermediate for July delivery, which expires Tuesday, rose $1.39 to settle at $49.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Total volume traded was 31% below the 100-day average. The more-active August contract climbed $1.40 to $49.96 a barrel.Brent for August settlement climbed $1.48, or 3%, to end the session at $50.65 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude was at a 69-cent premium to August WTI.The referendum on June 23 is being watched by governments and investors around the world amid worries that a so-called Brexit would spark a wave of turmoil across global markets. The S&P 500 Index jumped the most in about a month and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index had its biggest gain since August after bookmakers' odds suggested the chances of a ""Leave"" vote faded since the murder of a pro-European lawmaker on Thursday.""The financial markets don't think the British will leave,"" said Michael Corcelli, chief investment officer of hedge fund Alexander Alternative Capital in Miami. ""A vote to leave Europe would probably lead to a global recession, which would lead to the next major leg down for the oil market.""

354,LEG,"Crude fell to the lowest level in more than a week as investors anticipated turmoil ahead of the upcoming Brexit vote and the U.S. oil rig count climbed for a second week.Futures dropped 0.4% in New York to settle at the lowest level since June 3 as investors looked ahead to a June 23 referendum that will determine Britain’s membership in the European Union. Oil rose briefly to touch as high as $49.28 a barrel as the dollar retreated during intraday trading. Shale drillers have added 12 oil rigs in the U.S. over the past two weeks in the first consecutive weekly gains since August, according to Baker Hughes data.“It’s a little hard for oil to rally when it looks like the rest of the world has fallen apart and that has been the problem,” Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, said by telephone. “There is no doubt that if the U.K. votes to leave the eurozone, it will create economic turmoil.”Oil has surged about 86% from a 12-year low in February as the global glut is trimmed by unexpected disruptions and a slide in U.S. output, which is under pressure from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ policy of pumping without limits. New York crude closed above $51 a barrel on June 8, the highest in more than 10 months, before sliding every day since.“Prices will be choppy in a range over the next several weeks and months, but near the end of the year we do think that prices will take another leg higher,” Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said by telephone.West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 19 cents to settle at $48.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after dropping to as low as $48.16 during intraday trading. Total volume traded was 13% below the 100-day average.Brent for August settlement dropped 19 cents to end the session at $50.35 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark crude was trading at an 83-cent premium to WTI for August.Oil rigs in the U.S. rose by 3 to 328 last week, after 9 were added the week before, although the nation’s output is still well below last year’s peak. The U.S. oil rig count “has proven it still has a pulse,” Nomura Securities International analyst Matthew Johnston wrote in a report. “Land permitting activity is grinding higher and customer inquiries for service equipment are accelerating.”U.S. shale producers are “trying to ramp up and get going. They’ll continue to come online just in case we do see a surprise and oil goes back up over $50, but I think we’ve set a top,” Phil Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, said by telephone.

355,LEG,"Bill Veeck's surname rhymes with deck.As in how he KO'd baseball's tradition.A transformational baseball owner, he:""I would rate him on a separate scale of innovation,"" Paul Dickson, author of ""Bill Veeck: Baseball's Greatest Maverick,"" told IBD. ""He could take a team down in the dumps and make them a winner financially and on the field. He was one reason the Dodgers could sell for $2 billion just a few years ago. With Veeck, baseball ceased to be a system of men in white shirts and fedoras in the stands and became family entertainment. He was the most innovative owner I ever covered.""Other owners have called me and thanked Veeck: 'This is what we do now.' ""And he did it all on one leg. ""How he endured his pain from his wound, infection and amputation was extraordinary,"" said Dickson. ""He took adversity and turned it into a gag.""Tom Weinberg, a Chicago TV/film producer who was a minor shareholder during Veeck's second stint with the White Sox, said: ""I loved him. We hung out together a lot the last 10 years of his life. He was always my hero. When I was at NYU, I got an assignment with the question: Who is your hero in business? While the other students were writing about stiff company men, I wrote about Veeck. He did what he cared about doing, and he did it very well. He was a fan, not a businessman. He loved the fun of it. The corporate owners -- remember that CBS once owned the Yankees -- were playing a different game.""The Veeck lesson?""Be genuinely interested in what your customers want,"" said Weinberg, president of the video archive MediaBurn.org. ""It's not about giving discounts in the Thursday paper. It's about caring, being with the fans all the time. People who worked for him would jump out of windows for him. Why? They drank together, did everything together. They were pals.""More applause came from Lou Boudreau, who managed Veeck's Indians to the 1948 world title: ""Bill introduced entertainment to baseball. ... He was in the fans' corner at all times.""Harry Caray, the announcer who sang ""Take Me out to the Ballgame"" for Veeck's White Sox before taking that act across town to the Cubs, said: ""He's the only owner I've run across who really thinks about the enjoyment of the fan.""Hank Greenberg, the Hall of Fame first baseman and Veeck business partner, put it this way: ""Before Veeck, it was just going to the ballpark and winning and losing. Veeck made it fun.""Mary Frances Veeck, his widow, said in ""Bill Veeck: A Man For Any Season,"" a documentary produced by Weinberg and Jamie Ceaser: ""He introduced Bat Day, Jacket Day, Cap Day, a Music Day and many others. He was criticized by other owners for innovations such as putting names on uniforms, but they didn't hesitate to copy the ones that worked.""Veeck (1914-86) was born where he made his grandest mark: Chicago. His father was a sportswriter who became president of the National League's Cubs in 1919. The son never finished high school, but he passed the test that got him into Kenyon College in Ohio. He played football and left early to join the Cubs' front office before his dad's death in 1933.That decade saw Veeck already wreaking havoc on habit. As an aide to Cubs owner Phil Wrigley, the youngster remade their stadium with new bleachers, an electronic scoreboard and vines on the outfield wall, or as Veeck called it, ""The world's best-known horticultural display.""He kept his eye on the ball, forever aiming higher. In 1941, at the ripe age of 27, he bought the Milwaukee Brewers and promoted them from minor league slop to Triple-A dynasty.How dire were the Brewers when he took over? ""We found 22 loyalists in the stands,"" he wrote in his memoir, ""Veeck -- as in Wreck."" ""Theoretically, it was supposed to be Boy Scout Day, but all except three of the Boy Scouts had apparently decided to stay home and tie knots.""Veeck wasn't about to be roped in by a foul stadium and sour team. He quickly cleaned up the ballpark with paint and refurbished restrooms, especially for female patrons. He gave away wacky prizes such as a keg of nails, a stepladder and livestock: turkeys, geese, rabbits and pigs.Milwaukeeans loved it, flocking to the tune of 15,000 to Opening Day of 1942. In one season, attendance vaulted from 98,000 to 280,000. The Brewers rewarded the crowds with winning performances.In the midst of that, Veeck tried buying the Philadelphia Phillies and turning them into an all-black team, reports Dickson, but National League owners said no.With America in the thick of World War II by 1943, Veeck wasn't about to miss the biggest show on earth, even at age 29 and as the father of three. He dived in as a Marine private and soon headed to the Pacific. He couldn't pull rank, but he sure pulled strings, drawing baseball equipment to his outpost for a sportin' life between bombs.Yet Veeck paid dearly in the combat zone. After his right leg was crushed in an artillery accident, he faced marathon operations and the loss of that limb.What he didn't lose was his levity. Upon falling at an airport, he heard an attendant ask, ""Can I call you a doctor?"" and replied, ""No, it's a wooden leg -- get me a carpenter.""Chicago sportswriter Bob Verdi quoted Veeck as saying: ""I have an advantage over you. ... People say I can drink beer as though I've got a wooden leg.""Said son Mike Veeck: ""Dad was a guy's guy with zero pretense -- he built an ashtray into his wooden leg, for crying out loud.""The smoking, drinking, hurdling stadium seats while reveling with fans, boosting baseball for half a century, fathering nine children with two wives -- no wonder the baseball scribe Tom Boswell anticipated Veeck's death with ""His cause of death should read: Life.""Veeck's wound came while he still owned the Brewers. Returning to the States and out of uniform just as the atomic bomb ended hostilities in 1945, he sold the team for a profit of $275,000, worth $3.4 million today.Now Veeck was ready for the big leagues again, this time as owner of the Cleveland Indians by the middle of the 1946 season.""He had a talent to attract investors,"" said Dickson. ""His genius was managing packages, such as teaming up with Bob Hope to buy the Indians. More important than good wealth was his goodwill.""On the new ownership's first day, the Tribe drew a paltry 8,000 fans. Veeck gave notice: ""You don't sell your baseball without dressing it up in bright colored paper and red ribbons.""The Veeck touch soon gripped Municipal Stadium: mirrors in the restrooms, Ladies' Day flush with free nylon stockings, radio broadcasts, posting of National League scores, telephone service for reserve ticketing, snappy ushers, delicious hot dogs.Attendance sped past the 1 million mark for first time in Cleveland history that first Veeck season.Then came 1947. Eleven weeks after Jackie Robinson of the National League's Dodgers became the first black big leaguer in modern baseball, Veeck signed outfielder Larry Doby as the first American Leaguer to break the color barrier while getting advice from Louis Jones, the majors' first black PR man. Attendance rocketed to 1.5 million.The next season, Cleveland broke baseball's record with 2.6 million fans, a record that lasted 14 years. Veeck juiced the team by signing the great Negro League pitcher Satchel Paige, who at 41 was the oldest of all rookies. He packed stadiums and helped the Indians win the world championship.Veeck lasted one more year in Cleveland before selling for a profit of $500,000, worth $5 million now.From running a contender, Veeck in 1951 veered to the St. Louis Browns, perennial American League deadbeats. How to jazz up a team playing second fiddle to the city's Cardinals? With curves.Veeck tuned into the crazy idea of a pregame radio call-in show. He had 3-foot, 7-inch tall actor Eddie Gaedel step to the plate to walk and promptly leave for a pinch runner. He brought Paige back at age 45, helping boost attendance in 1952 to half a million, the second-best number in Browns history.Then Veeck sold them for a 38% profit in 1953 to investors, who soon moved the team to Baltimore.Veeck might've been out of the majors as an owner, but he made major waves.He produced a report for Phil Wrigley that paved the way for the National League's move to Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1958.He also joined executives in buying a minor league team that became the Triple-A Miami Marlins, forerunners of the current Florida big-league franchise. The high point came in 1956, with Paige back on the mound and filling the Orange Bowl with 57,000 fans, who also cheered the pregame show of jazz legend Cab Calloway and TV star Merv Griffin.Veeck made a solid profit selling the Marlins that year, and then in 1959 returned to the bigs. Now he was in his kind of town, Chicago, running a team that hadn't won anything since the Black Sox Scandal 40 years before.Veeck wasted little time zipping up Comiskey Park. He painted much of it white, tore down useless pillars, laid cloth towels in the restrooms, had ushers escort women to their seats and redecorated powder rooms. Forever courting female fans, he gave free tickets and orchids to women with pictures of children on Mother's Day. And for kids came a circus between games of a doubleheader.Fans loved it, pouring into Comiskey at a record rate of 1.4 million in 1959, while watching the Sox capture the American League flag. The next year saw the gate rise to 1.6 million as Veeck sparked fireworks and electrical sound effects from the scoreboard to celebrate home runs.Veeck sold his part of the Sox in 1961 for today's equivalent of $20 million.But he was hardly through with them. In December 1975, he retook control of the White Sox in time to keep the perennial losers from moving beyond Illinois.Veeck woke Chicago to the Sox via -- what else? -- promotions. He held a Greek Night, replete with belly dancers. He turned on a shower in the bleachers to attract women in bathing suits. He adorned the team in shorts and pullover tops. The gate rose by 200,000 in 1976, despite the club's lousy play.Veeck changed that in 1977, bringing in sharper players. They rewarded him with a pennant run, leading the division after the All-Star break. The ""South Side Hit Men"" eventually fell out of the race, but they became legend with the adopted Sox theme song, ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye."" And drew 1.7 million fans.In 1979, Veeck turned to one of his sons for a fiery idea. Recalled Mike: ""I'm the one who came up with the idea for Disco Demolition Night, when fans were encouraged to bring disco records to Comiskey Park, and we'd blow 'em up between games of a doubleheader. Did it work? So well that more than 100,000 people tried to get in, traffic was snarled for miles, and when we did blow up the records, our customers -- bless them all -- rioted in celebration, forcing us to forfeit the second game.""In January 1981, unable to afford the high salaries of players as they became free agents, Veeck left baseball for good, selling the Sox for today’s equivalent of $45 million.""It was the bitter end, but 66-year-old Bill Veeck was laughing,"" wrote sports columnist John Schulian. ""Looking back on the career of baseball's reigning Barnum, with his pinch-hitting midgets and exploding scoreboards, there's really no other way he could leave. Sadness for another time, another place.""A decade later, in July 1991, Veeck posthumously entered the Baseball Hall of Fame. It was the same year the White Sox moved into their new digs, U.S. Cellular Field.Veeck's ultimate message?""Pay attention to your customers,"" said Dickson, whose next biography will be on another Chicago baseball character, Leo Durocher. ""He turned that huge interest into creating loyalty. He wasn't afraid to push the envelope, to give away nylon stockings when that was a wild idea in the 1940s. Every team today is a reflection of what Bill Veeck did.""Revolutionized baseball's entertainment as owner of three major league teams.Overcame: Wartime wound and subsequent leg amputation.Lesson: Deal with pain by diving into inspiring endeavors.""I happen to have a very ridiculous theory. Baseball should be fun.""Related:Jackie Robinson Sped Past Baseball's Color BarrierAlbert Spalding Pitched Baseball To AmericaDavid Stern's Vision For The NBA Proved A Slam Dunk

396,LEG,"Back on July 20, with U.S. stock indexes not far from their yearly highs, I said on CNBC that I expected the market to become choppier over the next three months. I pointed out that with the S&P 500 Index trading at nearly 19 times—and corporate earnings unlikely to advance in the second half of the year—the market would need to digest not just the slowdown in China but also the uncertainty that would accompany a pending Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hike, scheduled European elections and our own budget process and debt limit debate come this fall. Over the five days following July 20, the S&P 500 declined 3%. In a follow-up blog post, I elaborated on why I thought the August-to-October time frame was the most likely period for the U.S. stock market to correct.When the 1,000-point sell-off in the Dow arrived a month later on August 24, not only had the correction cleared out excess investor exuberance, it showcased a selling frenzy that rivaled Wall Street's worst days over the last two decades. The Volatility Index (VIX), which measures the level of fear in the market, catapulted to over 40 intra-day—only the eighth time in the last 20 years it had done so. Two months after those August lows, the question now becomes, is the worst of the sell-off behind us? And if so, is there another leg up to this aging bull market? Is the Correction Over? On October 21, I said on CNBC that I now believed it was, provided that Congress votes without undue drama to pay its bills. With weak third-quarter earnings now being reported, one could make a good case that the lows for the year have already printed—especially if one believes aggregate earnings on the S&P 500 will rebound in 2016, which I do. However, the market has one more hiccup to digest in 2015: a congressional vote to raise the Federal debt limit. The last time the debt ceiling became hostage to political brinksmanship, back in the summer of 2011, the market sold off nearly 20% and Standard & Poor's downgraded the credit quality of the U.S. government. The debt limit was only raised after a tense round of high-stakes horse trading: more borrowing capacity in exchange for reductions in future spending. The uncertainty surrounding this outcome could yet unleash a new round of volatility into the system. But it would take a colossal act of legislative incompetence and political stupidity to allow the federal government to default on its debt, so I view the threat of actual default as minimal. This does not mean a deal will get done without some drama (watch for debt limit countdown clocks on cable). If the market sells off into the deadline, I would view that as a potential buying opportunity for investors with time horizons that extend at least a year into the future. Spikes in the VIX Often Create Buying Opportunities Over the past 20 years, spikes in the VIX have generally coincided with major market lows. This makes sense, as the VIX moves in the opposite direction of the S&P 500 when risk is being re-priced and stocks are typically being sold. More often than not, spikes in the VIX create buying opportunities for long-term investors who have the courage to buy into markets when others are selling. That may be hard to do in the moment, but the data suggests that investors have historically been rewarded for it. If we measure the total returns of the S&P 500 over the 12 months following each of the periodic VIX spikes over 40, we notice that the market was notably higher in six of the seven periods and that the average one-year return over all the periods was 21%.

399,LEG,"The market's more uncertain, key world economies are sending interest rates to zero- or negative-land, and the dollar's near a four-week low. That's all bullish for gold -- so why has price action in the largest gold ETF been so dull?SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) was added to IBD Leaderboard as a top stock idea on March 4 and booted off the elite list on May 24. It did little but shuffle along in the intervening period. It spiked again on Friday, following an ugly jobs report that almost certainly took a June rate hike off the table. But the ETF remains stuck for now below its 50-day moving average.For many ETF investors, GLD's current trend is a bit of a head-scratcher. Has the ETF put a bottom in the near-term downtrend? Is it poised for the next leg up?
"
400,LEG,"Jim Wyckoff, a senior technical analyst at commodity news site Kitco, describes this bellwether commodity ETF as ""right back in the middle of a choppy trading range"" bound by the May highs and May lows.In a phone call with IBD, Wyckoff said that the current trend was ""neutral"" and that investors should watch whether GLD manages to breach its trading range.A downside breakout, marked by a price move below 115, would be bearish for gold. However, the price action of the past three trading days gives the gold bulls some reinforcement, Wyckoff said.He is bullish on gold on a longer-term basis.""The raw commodity sector is just now ending a bust cycle and entering a boom cycle,"" Wyckoff said. Both crude oil and some grains have rebounded recently, he pointed out.GLD, which tracks the price of physical bullion, is up 17% year to date through June 6. That's way better than Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) -- all laggard stocks this year -- or even Facebook (FB) or Amazon (AMZN).SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. stock market, is up 4.2% so far in 2016.The outlook for gold is bright in a negative-interest-rate world, according to the World Gold Council. Japan, Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark are among countries that have cut the interest rates on bank reserves to below zero. Negative rates signal that central bankers in those countries are battling low economic growth, low inflation or deflation, and financial market volatility.""Gold thrives against a backdrop of economic uncertainty and distress,"" James Steel, chief commodities analyst at HSBC, wrote in the Gold Council's June Gold Investor report.Year to date, the GLD ETF has seen $11.14 billion in net inflow, more than any other U.S.-listed exchange traded fund, according to global research firm XTF.com.The ETF's recent range-bound action isn't curbing the flow of money from investors. GLD has absorbed a net $741.4 million in the past week, $2.94 billion in the past month and $3.81 billion in the quarter to date.GLD's 0.3% dip on the stock market today reflected some corrective, profit-taking pullback as investors booked recent gains, according to Wyckoff.
"
401,LEG,"Big Media: The Beltway pundits were all atwitter over Donald Trump's apparent ignorance of the term ""Brexit"" -- a recent coinage referring to the referendum over Britain's exit from the EU. Fact is, ""Brexit"" should be the lowest thing on Trump's or any other candidate's agenda.The matter came up when Michael Wolff of the Hollywood Reporter asked Trump where he stood on Brexit.""Huh?"" Trump answered.""Brexit,"" said Wolff.""Hmm,"" said Trump.""The Brits leaving the EU,"" Wolff helpfully prodded.""Oh, yeah, I think they should leave,"" said Trump.As Politico noted, ""Wolff wrote in the piece that Trump's 'lack of familiarity with one of the most pressing issues in Europe is for him no concern nor liability at all.'""First off, if we had to guess, we'd say Trump may have been pulling Wolff's leg. But even if not, contrary to Wolff's assertion, Brexit is not one of the most pressing issues. Britain uses its own currency. So that won't be affected. It has huge amounts of trade with the rest of Europe — does anyone believe that other EU countries will stop trading with Britain if it leaves the formal restrictions of the EU? Not likely.What Brexit really is is a major distraction from all the calamities that the EU's bureaucratized mismanagement has caused — ranging from the fiscal bankruptcy of many of its members, like Greece, to its ongoing protectionist policies against American firms like Google and Microsoft, to the EU's almost unfathomably foolish decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of unassimilable Muslims from North Africa and the Mideast.Brexit, however it comes out, is a sideshow to the EU's greater failings. So Trump's absolutely correct to see this as of little import for the U.S., at least in the short run.And, despite claims of disaster by economists and foreign policy analysts, the dissolution of the EU won't lead to anything other than the regaining of sovereignty by European nations. There's no reason why they can't keep open their doors to the free flow of goods and services, which is the main benefit of the EU. It's important to remember: Since 2000, Britain's trade with non-EU countries has grown faster than its trade with the EU, and in 2012, for the first time since the EU was formed, more than half of all British trade was with non-EU countries.Trump rightly gets that it's not at all important for him to be weighing in on something that average Americans know next to nothing about. That's the opposite of President Obama, who butted into British affairs during his recent trip to the U.K., coming out strongly against Britain leaving the EU and threatening to make them go to ""the back of the queue"" in trade deals from now on.Do the media who poke fun at Trump think it's OK for a U.S. president to meddle in the affairs of another nation? If it were a Republican president, wouldn't he be accused of imperialism at worst, or bullying behavior at best? By the way, most Brits agree with Trump. The latest poll on the EU referendum shows 52% support leaving the EU, while 48% support staying, according to the ICM Poll.Of far greater concern to Americans, in our view, should be that Trump appears to share an aversion to free trade with his political foes Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. A rollback of free trade or a sudden turn to managed trade by the U.S. would have far greater consequences for average Americans than Brexit.

402,LEG,"In the late 1800s, it took railroad companies six years to lay 1,907 miles of track for what was to become the Transcontinental Railroad (or as Barack Obama calls it, the Intercontinental Railroad).Building that railroad line required tunneling through mountains — at one foot a day — building bridges — including one that spanned 700 feet — and doing all the work almost entirely by hand.As best, it will now take seven years for California to lay 119 miles of track — on relatively flat ground in the middle of nowhere.That news came from a contract revision that the Obama administration approved late last week. Instead of finishing the first leg of what is supposed to be a High-Speed Rail service from San Francisco to San Diego by 2018, the new deadline is 2022, which will be seven years after the January 2015 groundbreaking.Even when completed, the first leg will only run from Madera (population 63,105) down to Shafter, a small town north of Bakersfield. Not exactly a heavy transportation corridor.That stretch, by the way, was picked because it was deemed the most “shovel ready” when the Obama administration was passing out stimulus funds. But even now, the state’s High Speed Rail Authority hasn’t put down any tracks, and has bought up less than half the land it needs in the Central Valley, according to Politico.A few months ago, California revised its plans, pushing back the completion date for the first leg of the rail line — which will run north to San Jose — off to 2025. But if it can’t even get a track built in the middle of the desert in seven years, does anyone honestly believe it can finish the remaining 120 or so miles — through much less forgiving terrain — in three?And these delays only add to costs, the Los Angeles Times notes, because they ""have forced contractors to leave equipment idle, which is likely to result in multimillion-dollar claims of losses. Some outside construction experts are projecting the first 29 miles of construction alone could be as much as $400 million over budget.”Keep in mind that the original plan had 800 miles of high-speed rail up and running by 2020.Worse, unlike the Transcontinental Railroad, even if California does manage to bring this massively expensive boondoggle over the finish line, it’s unlikely that anyone will want to use it.RELATEDDid Elon Musk Just Make California’s $64 Billion Bullet Train Obsolete Before It’s Even Built?California’s Bullet Train Will Take Even Longer To Go Nowhere

403,LEG,"Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) on Monday said it was ""cautious"" on airfare guidance heading into fiscal 2017 and warned of weaker financial results due to expansion from rivals, the fallout from the Brussels terror attacks, and the U.K.'s referendum next month on whether to stay in the European Union.The carrier expects 13% profit growth for its fiscal 2017, well down from 2016's 43% surge. The forecast, the company said, depends on the U.K. currency's strength, winter yields -- a reflection of airfare pricing power -- and close-in summer bookings, or flights booked closer to their departure date.Shares closed up 1.2% at 80.31, hitting resistance at their 200-day moving average, as they form a flat base with a 87.04 buy point. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 0.35%, American Airlines (AAL) lost 0.9% and United Airlines (UAL) dropped 0.65%.Still, Ryanair said forward bookings were getting stronger and fuel hedges were cheaper for this year and next. The company also said it expected 9% traffic growth this year and sees load factor, or seats filled, staying similar to 2016's 93%.""Our competition can no longer compete with Ryanair's low costs, and the gap is widening between ourselves and themselves,"" CFO Neil Sorahan said in a company earnings presentation.Nonetheless, Ryanair said pricing would be ""softer, particularly in Q1 & Q4,"" which won't benefit from the Easter holiday. Greater flight capacity from competitors, who like the rest of the industry, have benefited from cheap fuel amid a worldwide oil glut, are also likely to weigh on airfares.As European rivals and even Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines compete more aggressively on economy offerings, the company touted the success of its Always Getting Better service.Ryanair said it had improved schedules, passenger options and added leg room on flights, and said it would work on enhancing its business travel options. The company also said it would work on easier mobile payment options and offer lower checked bag fees.""While AGB Years 1 & 2 were about fixing things that our customers disliked and improving our offering, Year 3 will be about digital acceleration and innovation, particularly through Ryanair Labs,"" Ryanair said in its earnings release.Revenue rose 16% to 6.5 billion euros ($7.3 billion), just missing analyst forecasts. Net income jumped 43% to 1.242 bil euros, as unit costs fell 6% during the year.The company said the fourth quarter took a hit from 500 flight cancellations following the attacks in Brussels in March.It also said that recently, ""unjustified strikes"" from air traffic controllers have resulted in more than 200 additional flight cancellations, which would likely hurt yields for the first quarter.""Sterling weakness in the run up to the Brexit referendum on June 23"" could also harm Ryanair's results, the company said.Ryanair said it was ""actively campaigning for a 'Remain' vote,"" saying that the UK's departure from the EU would hurt the economy over the next two to three years.

422,LEG,"It was the top of the ninth inning in Game 1 of the 1968 World Series. Bob Gibson was on the mound for the St. Louis Cardinals, who were aiming for their second straight world championship.This was an era before teams carried several relief specialists. Thus, Gibson was pitching into the ninth for the 27th time that year.With the Cards leading Detroit 4-0, the man nicknamed Hoot (after the Western movie star) gave up a leadoff single to Mickey Stanley. That meant Gibson would face the Tigers' power hitters: Al Kaline, Norm Cash, Willie Horton.Gibson always kept something in reserve. He struck out Kaline, tying Sandy Koufax's World Series record of 15, a feat he was unaware of until catcher Tim McCarver came out and told him.Cash was his next K victim. Then Horton succumbed to what Gibson describes as a bad pitch that just nicked the corner of the plate.""It's probably the game I'm best remembered for,"" Gibson, 79, told IBD. ""It happened in the season I'm best remembered for, and it happened at the time of year I'm best remembered for.""Game For The AgesThe Tigers won that World Series in seven games, but baseball experts call Game 1 one of the most masterful pitching performances in baseball history.Those 17 strikeouts still stand as a World Series record, part of Gibson's Hall of Fame career that ran 17 seasons, all with the Cardinals.Over that 1959-75 period, he produced a 251-174 record, a super-low 2.91 earned run average and 3,117 strikeouts. He participated in nine All-Star Games, won two world titles and was twice named Cy Young Award winner and World Series Most Valuable Player.Those World Series titles came in 1964 and 1967, with Gibson nailing down Game 7 both times.Even though he couldn't pull that off again in 1968, he had a masterful season, turning out a minuscule 1.12 ERA and collecting the National League MVP trophy.Nowadays he's the author of ""Pitch by Pitch,"" an account of that World Series Game 1 of 47 years ago.Before he even stepped onto the field, Gibson had numerous health problems. In addition to suffering from rickets as a youngster, he developed a heart murmur in high school and needed permission from a physician to play sports.Gibson owed much of his success to a brother. Gibson's dad died before he was born, and Josh, 15 years older, served as a surrogate father.Josh served in World War II and returned to Omaha, Neb., to get a college degree but could not get a teaching job. So he wound up coaching at the YMCA.""I was kind of the kid he practiced (coaching) on,"" Gibson said. His brother ""not only made athletes out of the kids in our crowd, but he kept us out of trouble.""Josh and high school coach Neal Mosser ""taught us to demand respect and not take defeat lying down,"" Gibson noted.He wanted to advance to college, but it wasn't easy. Mosser wrote the University of Indiana and received this reply: ""Your request for an athletic scholarship for Robert Gibson has been denied because we already have fulfilled our quota of Negroes.""So Gibson stayed local, becoming a rare black basketball scholarship player at Creighton. He majored in sociology and did well enough as a multisport athlete to attract the attention of the Cardinals and Harlem Globetrotters.After graduating in 1957, he did double duty, pitching for the minor-league Omaha Cards, then shooting for the Globetrotters.Gibson never got down on himself, even after a shaky start in Omaha. ""I can't say that losing a ballgame ever affected my confidence,"" he said. ""More than anything, my confidence came from throwing the ball where I wanted to throw it.""Riding his optimism and fastball, Gibson reached the majors in 1959.After two losing seasons, he found his stride in 1961, going 13-12.""I never caught anyone like him,"" said McCarver, who joined the Cards the same year as Gibson. ""He was tenacious, and there was an explosion at the end of his pitches.""McCarver, a longtime broadcaster who analyzes St. Louis games on TV, added: ""We were both strong-willed individuals who ultimately yielded to each other. And when that happens you have something special.""Fast WorkMcCarver remembers an early problem: ""Bob wanted to work fast, lightning fast. But Johnny (Keane, the manager) wanted me to work Bob slower. It was 1963, and I was 21 years old. I went to him and said, 'Bob, you're putting me in a bind. You want me to do one thing, and the manager wants me to do something else.'""Bob told me, 'I'm the one with the ball, and I have to do it at my pace, not John's. It looks like I'm getting more hitters out.' That made all the sense in the world, so when Bob was out there, I was putting the fingers down (calling pitches) as quick as I could.""Gibson didn't like anyone altering his quick delivery.""I probably went four or five years without going to the mound with Bob,"" McCarver recalled.Famously, on one trip to the mound, Gibson told McCarver: ""What are you doing out here? The only thing you know about pitching is that it's hard to hit.""For Gibson, baseball wasn't a game. It was a war, a battle between hitter and pitcher.Unlike more congenial contemporary athletes, he wouldn't acknowledge opponents.""I wouldn't even say hello to hitters on other teams,"" he has said. ""They were the enemies.""The plate was his, and opposing batters knew that they crowded it at their own peril. Intimidation — full of the Gibson glare and blazing, high-and-tight fastball — was just another pitch in his arsenal.Not surprisingly, Gibson doesn't agree ""with the way umpires protect the hitters these days, by warning pitchers who throw the ball too far inside. To me, that was what inside meant. You threw the ball a few inches off the inside corner to prevent batters from stepping into a pitch on the outside corner.""Hitters today already have extra protection from all the pads they wear up at the plate; they don't need more from the umpire. In my day, hitters understood if they dove out over the plate, they were liable to get plunked. To me that was an unwritten rule that made sense.""And it worked. In 1964, Gibson pitched the Cardinals to a stunning upset of the New York Yankees in the World Series. He won two of the three games he pitched.Champs AgainThree years later and just back from a broken leg, he pitched three complete-game victories against the Red Sox, allowing just three earned runs and 14 hits in his command World Series performance.Then came 1968, the Year of the Pitcher. Denny McLain won 31 games for Detroit. Don Drysdale pitched 58-2/4 consecutive scoreless innings for Los Angeles.And Gibson went 22-9 with 14 shutouts and that 1.12 ERA, the lowest in the live-ball era and a major league record for anyone pitching at least 300 innings.Gibson rode his right arm hard: ""Mental capacity kind of tweaks or complements the physical ability. Also, there's a little help available to a pitcher on the mental side (from coaches, catcher). A large part of 'Pitch by Pitch' involves my relationship with ... McCarver and the ways we were able to work in sync.""""That's overly charitable,"" said McCarver.Admitted Gibson: ""On days I pitched, I was pretty anti-social. On days I didn't pitch, I was in a better mood but tried not to let anyone know it. I'd yell at guys on the other team. And I'd yell at guys on our team if they did something stupid. Other than that, I wasn't hard to get along with.""Still, another side to Gibson existed. Take 1964, when the Cardinals had to reshoot the championship team photo because the original showed the star pitcher and Bob Uecker — the backup catcher who would become a national star as a fun broadcaster — holding hands.""I'd like to say it was a symbol of racial unity we achieved on the Cardinals or that it represented the connection between pitcher and catcher,"" said Gibson. ""Nah, the fact is, we were just goofballs.""Of course, you already knew that about Uecker.""

423,LEG,"If Republicans view their control of congressional operations this year and next as a chance to audition on a national stage for winning control of the White House, thanks for trying out, folks. We'll be in touch with your agent. Do lunch.The coup Thursday of congressional conservatives forcing heir-apparent Speaker Kevin McCarthy out and opening a new race to run that chamber where all financial legislation originates was indeed unexpected.Our smart colleagues on IBD's Editorial Board argue, accurately here, that this is a great opportunity to elect a genuine conservative House leader to seriously confront the destructive runaway executive branch of liberal B. Obama.They have much more confidence in this bickering bunch of political clowns to look beyond tonight's Happy Hour. Like most events every election, public or within a political caucus, is about opportunity. Losing a leg is an opportunity to learn about walking again. That doesn't make it desirable.So, lets examine the mechanics of this ""change."" Last January as part of the transition to a newly-enlarged GOP House majority, conservative members disgruntled with John Boehner's less-than-consultative leadership style could have staged their coup. Start a new session with a new leader for the run-up to 2016.But they didn't. They dithered, spent 10 months grumbling and pouting. Boehner for his part was seemingly deaf in an old-fashioned speakerly way to the simmering tribal dissatisfaction. Politics would be so much simpler without people.Boehner finally saw the coup coming, set his departure. Kevin McCarthy intended to step up from the No. 2 spot, as seniority requires. But wait. The so-called Freedom Caucus, a band of about 40 more interested in principle as they see it than winning, withheld their support because Kev is too Boehner-like.McCarthy needed 218 votes total to become speaker. Never mind any other problems. He said he didn't have the numbers.Look, I'm not a big Boehner Booster. His strategy, talk and actions, or lack thereof, don't come close to salving my anger at Obama's arrogance and executive over-reach. On the other hand, Boehner raised $100 million-plus for candidates in recent years, recruited and helped elect two straight majorities (one of them historic) and held the caucus solidly against many bad Obama plans, including ObamaCare.Our national peril would be much worse without the bartender's decent son from Ohio.Now, as the strongest GOP presidential field in generations leaves the locker room for politics' real Super Bowl next year, is not the time to start an argument over who's quarterback.And here's the deal: Every two-bit banana republic colonel knows if you're planning a coup, you need a ready replacement as leader.Who did the Freedom Caucus et al want as speaker? They had no one realistically. But it felt really good to fight over Boehner not being sufficiently conservative and then defeating McCarthy. Like the pointless suicide squad in ""Life of Brian.""Reminiscent of the elections of conservative Sen. Christine O'Donnell, conservative Sen. Todd Akin and conservative Sen. Richard Mourdock. They had zero chance of winning the general. And proved it. But, by golly, it felt really good to primary-out alleged RINOs. Three more GOP senators could make a real difference now, but.....At its core, politics is about winning in America's democracy. It takes principle, yes. Also judicious compromise and careful timing. This isn't Japan. There's no respect or point to going down to glorious defeat, as principled conservative Barry Goldwater did in 1964 in the worst popular vote thrashing in U.S. history.And with the festering -- and deadly dangerous -- messes at home and abroad that Obama bequeaths, Nov. 8, 2016 is a day of decision that will set the course of our country toward long-term repair or continued decline.Who's in as would-be speaker? Mad scramble to find a replacement acceptable to all sides. What about Paul Ryan? Let's rob Ways and Means of a Paul, a solid conservative chair, to plunk him in the thankless speakership.So right now, just 56 weeks from a presidential election, we have the Republican House squabbling over who will control the Republican House. Great spectacle and entertaining TV for Democrats, who got arguably the worst Hillary email revelations yet drowned out Thursday by GOP fighting.Oh, and look here! After all this, that same John Boehner still holds the Speaker's gavel.RELATED:Obama apologizes for bombing; Putin doesn'tPutin imposes his own reset on a helpless ObamaObama diplomacy: Walk softly and carry a big Nerf stickObama still maintains global warming is worst threat facing US

424,LEG,"Human nature and the law of supply and demand never change in the stock market. It was the same in the 1920s as it is now. That's why history repeats itself.Decades of IBD research have shown that distribution days are always seen at market tops and follow-through days are always seen at market bottoms.And when it comes to individual stocks, past market winners looked a lot alike before big price moves. Not only was there a compelling fundamental story in place, but charts were telling a bullish story as well.This latest Investor's Corner series debuted in Wednesday's edition with an analysis of Cisco Systems ' (CSCO) breakout from a double-bottom base in October 1990. The series will look at qualities of winning stocks before they took off on their big price runs.Amgen (AMGN) is today's focus. It cleared a similar pattern in March 1990. Amgen and Cisco were two very different companies. But for both, innovation was fueling big growth ahead of major price moves.The double-bottom pattern generally should not correct more than 30%. Amgen's was reasonable at 29%.Keep in mind, though, that a growth stock can often correct 1-1/2 to 2 times what the broad market does, so a 20% pullback in an index could cause some bases to correct up to 40% and still be normal.Amgen's pattern had nice symmetry. It looked like the letter W, with the second leg down undercutting the first (1), a key attribute of the pattern. When the second low undercuts the first, it shakes out sellers, making a successful breakout more likely.The shakeout week was positive, but so was Amgen's close that week. It rebounded off its lows, closing in the upper 59% of its weekly range. It showed that buyers were around despite a weekly decline of nearly 6%. Shares had fallen as much as 17%.The breakout in a double pattern is when the stock clears the middle part of the W-shaped pattern. Amgen broke out over a buy point of 27.85 in mid-February, but volume was slow to come into the stock.Sometimes, big volume takes a while to show up. Volume was heavy when shares surged nearly 7% about a month later (2).In the early 1990s, the ""N"" — for ""new"" — component of CAN SLIM was there in spades for Amgen.A new CEO was in place after George Rathmann handed the reins to Gordon Binder. On the heels of its blockbuster drug Epogen, which the FDA approved in 1989, Amgen launched the cancer treatment Neupogen in 1991. In 1992, product sales for both drugs hit $1 billion, and Amgen became an S&P; 500 component. Heavy spending on research and development was finally paying off.Most impressive about Amgen's breakout was how it was able to sustain itself after the Nasdaq went into a sharp correction in the summer. The Nasdaq corrected 31% off its high after Iraq invaded Kuwait, causing oil prices to spike and throwing the U.S. economy into recession.Amgen was unfazed by weakness in the broad market. It rode its 10-week moving average even when selling in the broad market started to pick up. The most it ever pulled back was 20%, when it formed a base in the fall. After a breakout in November (3), it doubled in about three months.

426,LEG,"Everybody loves a bargain. But when it comes to investing, a cheap or laggard stock may not be the best deal. You could very well end up getting what you paid for.“Many investors can’t resist $2, $5 or $10 stocks, but most stocks selling for $10 or less are cheap for a reason,” IBD founder and Chairman William O’Neil wrote in “How to Make Money in Stocks.” “They’ve either been deficient in the past or have something wrong with them now.”Perhaps the company continually misses earnings or sales estimates, or shows shaky fundamentals. Lower-priced stocks also carry more risk because they often feature less dollar-based trading liquidity and big spreads between the bid and ask prices.Better to buy fewer shares of an institutional-quality stock that’s rising soundly, rather than thousands of shares of a cheap stock. In the IBD 50, which you can access by hovering over the Stock Lists tab at Investors.com, you’ll see stocks trading at prices of 30 a share or higher.Top mutual funds and other big players prefer companies with sound earnings and sales track records, and share prices of at least 15 on the Nasdaq and 20 on the NYSE. They tend to favor stocks that trade at least 400,000 shares a day, which allows funds to make trades with less impact on the share price.Let’s take a look at Joe's Jeans, a maker of high-end jeans and other apparel. In February 2007, the former Innovo Group announced plans to acquire Joe’s and change its company name. At the time, the stock was trading below 1.50 a share.It rose as high as 3.60 in April 2010, as double-digit sales growth fueled the premium denim trend. But by mid-November 2011, the stock was back down to 50 cents. While money could have been made, one had to be nimble and accept higher risk.Joe’s broke out of a sloppy 11-month base in February 2013 but didn’t get far. It pulled back to start work on a poorly formed double-bottom base. This one had two down weeks in heavy volume (1) and no up weeks in above-average turnover until the week ended July 12, forming the base's right side (2) in just one week.The second leg of the double bottom formed mostly below the 10-week moving average, a red flag (3). The next week after the stock's breakout, Joe's reversed badly, falling 28% in its biggest weekly volume in years (4). It sliced through its 10-week and 40-week moving averages.The culprit? Its second-quarter earnings and sales disappointed Wall Street. Shares have since fallen as much as 50%.(Editor's Note: This story originally ran in the Jan. 8, 2014, edition of IBD. Sequential Brands (SQBG) bought Joe's Jeans in September 2015.)

428,LEG,"Stocks were near lows Wednesday afternoon as better-than-expected economic data boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.The Nasdaq fell 1.3%, the S&P 500 1.1% and Dow Jones industrial average 1.2%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow dropped back their 50-day moving averages a day after regaining that key support area. Volume was slightly higher on the NYSE and the Nasdaq compared to the same time Monday.The major averages sold off at the open as stronger-than-expected readings on April housing starts, industrial production and consumer prices strengthened the case for the Fed to raise interest rates later this year. But stocks took another leg down in the afternoon.Food and utility shares were among the biggest decliners in the stock market today, while oil stocks continued to rise as crude prices climbed above $48 a barrel.Chicken producer Sanderson Farms (SAFM) dropped 5%, slicing through its 50-day moving average. The stock has halved a 15% gain from an 83.13 buy point of a flat base.Rival Tyson Foods (TSN) fell 3%, also undercutting its 50-day line. The stock is still more than 20% above a 54.52 flat-base buy point. Investors who bought when the stock cleared the buy point in early February should consider selling now, since many stocks correct at that point to form new bases.Which chicken processor owns better ratings?

429,LEG,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

430,LEG,"The 1990 bear market took 22% off the Dow Jones industrial average between July 17 and Oct. 11. Then on Oct. 18, the fifth day of an attempted rally, the Dow rose 2.7% in volume greater than the previous day. It was a follow-through day that signaled the beginning of the great bull market of the 1990s.And one of the greatest stocks of that bull market broke out the next day: Cisco Systems (CSCO). It would march 1,602% higher in the next 169 weeks. It would ultimately top in 2000 after running up an incredible 75,000%.On the day it broke out, it had an EPS Rating of 99 and a Relative Price Strength Rating of 97. The three-year annualized EPS growth rate was 257%. It had nine straight quarters of big quarterly earnings increases. Estimates for 1991 earnings called for a 145% increase. Pre-tax margins were up 33%, and the return on equity was 36%.Cisco set up in a double-bottom base. The time to buy was when the stock was completing the base's W shape, and the buy point was the high of the middle peak plus 10 cents. That price was 27.10. The second leg undercut the first (1), an important characteristic for a double-bottom.An investor would have had to be alert to be on top of Cisco. It had hit bottom just seven days earlier, gapping down to a new low. Besides sterling fundamentals, the stock was a fast-growing new issue undiscovered by many institutional investors.Fast-growing new issues are fertile hunting grounds for growth investors. The stock had set up in a cup-with-handle base and broke out on June 5, but the base failed. Stocks were getting wobbly as the bears approached. The lesson of that base failure is that if you're forced out of a stock with a loss, don't give up on it. It might set up again. And that's just what happened with Cisco.When it broke above the buy point, it gapped up and finished the day with volume 328% above average. A few days later, the stock pulled back intraday to 26.50, just below the buy point (2), then closed with a gain for the day. That was a nice shakeout.There's another rule that would have allowed the alert investor to get in earlier: Famed investor Jesse Livermore's Shakeout + 3 rule. For stocks trading below 30, buy when the stock is 3 points above the first low. In Cisco's case, that was 22. So the buy point was at 25.
"
431,LEG,"Your mom probably told you not to judge people by their looks. But when deciding on what stocks in bases to buy, you should focus on appearance. When you're studying bases for possible buys, two traits that you want to see are symmetry and smooth price action. Having both features in your target stocks will give you a better shot at a successful trade.Smooth price action means exactly like what it sounds like. It's the opposite of jagged, wild and loose price action, a flaw.When a stock is forming the left side of a base, you want to see it retreat in a controlled and sometimes even gentle fashion, where price action is not all over the place. Pullbacks can occur, but they should not be too wild or out of character with the stock's past history.Not every week within the base absolutely must show mild action. But smoothness signals that the pros are supporting the stock and steadily building their positions.Armed with millions of dollars to put to work, institutions spread their buying over a period of time. It can last weeks or longer. Because of their size, they can't enter a stock all at once without running up the price too much. Deep pullbacks and wide-and-loose action point to a real battle going on.Smooth price action on the right side of a cup pattern lets you know that institutional buyers are in charge, which bodes well for a future breakout.Look at it from another perspective. When you buy oranges at the supermarket, do you grab the ones that are perfectly round, shiny and fresh-looking or the ones that have indentations or extra lumps here and there? How about those that are already all dried up?When you buy stocks, you want as many positive traits lined up in your favor as possible.A proper base should also show symmetry. Simply put, the base shape should have a balance in proportions. Lopsided price patterns tend to be faulty.For example, in a cup pattern, the amounts of time on the right and left sides don't have to be equal, but they should be similar. In a 10-week cup, the low of the pattern should occur at or around Week 5, the halfway point.In the case of a double-bottom base, both sides should resemble each other. If you're looking at a 12-week double-bottom pattern, the amount of time needed to create both legs should be similar.If the first leg took six weeks to form, then ideally the second leg should also take about six weeks. It doesn't have to be exact. You just don't want a situation where the first leg formed over, say, only two weeks and the second formed over 12 weeks, or vice versa.Spirit Airlines (SAVE) formed a nine-week cup-with-handle base with a 35.26 buy point in late 2013. There were a couple of down weeks with wide spreads (1), but nothing too out of the ordinary. The left side of the base spanned five weeks. The right side was four weeks in length.Spirit gapped up and cleared the 35.26 trigger in the week ended Oct. 11 in heavy turnover. Shares of the deep-discount airline bolted 81% by late March before settling into another base (2).

It'll be expanded to flights between Boston and San Francisco in March.
"
443,LEG,"At the end of June, JetBlue started charging for bags that used to fly free, part of ""Fare Options,"" a new tiered pricing scheme that still includes free checked bag options.
"
444,LEG,"For this past September, Deutsche Bank projects that JetBlue will have been the only airline of the top six U.S.-based carriers to show a year-over-year increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile — up an estimated 2%. It forecast declines of 3.5% at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and up to 7% declines at American Airlines (AAL). 
"
445,LEG,"On Friday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) was the first of the carriers to report on September: unit revenue was down 5%.
"
446,LEG,"Beginning in mid-2016, JetBlue will add 15 more seats to A320 aircraft, for a total of 165 seats. But analysts say that its leg room will still be more generous than the competition's.
"
447,LEG,"JetBlue says that all of the new initiatives will add $450 million in operating income, starting in 2017.
"
448,LEG,"In a research note last month, the Buckingham Research Group estimated that the current Mint service alone likely generates an incremental $120 million in revenue and 10 cents per share annually. If expanded to the airline's other routes of 2,000 miles or more, the report noted, it could translate to $500 million in incremental revenue and 40 cents in earnings.

450,LEG,"The New York-based carrier flies to more than 90 cities in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America. Its leading markets are New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Orlando and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Service to Mexico City launched on Oct. 1 from Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.
"
451,LEG,"JetBlue is essentially positioned between the consolidated legacy carriers, with their extensive routes, and ultralow-fare airlines such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Allegiant Travel (ALGT), which boost cheap fares with add-on fees.
"
452,LEG,"""It still has lower costs than peers, but it is not a low-fare carrier in the traditional sense,"" Corridore said.
"
453,LEG,"While changes made so far have already had a positive impact on JetBlue's financial performance, so have lower fuel costs and easing competition in key markets.
"
454,LEG,"JetBlue is benefiting from rivals' relatively low-capacity increases in its key markets New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Becker says.
"
455,LEG,"While capacity increases are up around 3% in JetBlue markets, she adds, the airlines' average is somewhat higher, and some markets such as Seattle and Dallas are up in the double digits.

"
461,LEG,"Oil Eases Slower Sales Growth
"
462,LEG,"Lower-priced oil — down more than 60% from a year ago — is a ""good trade-off"" to slower growing airline-industry revenue this year, Corridore says. Jet fuel accounts for a third of an airline's costs.
"
463,LEG,"With domestic revenue growth slowing, capacity growth in the industry will remain tempered, analysts say. That's unlike past stretches following oil-price declines, when airlines would order new planes using their excess cash.
"
464,LEG,"Now U.S. carriers (JetBlue included) have been using excess cash to buy back shares and pay down debt, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report on Sept. 30.
"
465,LEG,"Still, JetBlue expects capacity to increase at the high end of its 7%-to-9% range for the full year. It sees operating expenses per available seat mile rising 0% to 1.5%, excluding fuel and profit-sharing.

The carrier's strong presence in Florida, especially South Florida, should put it in a favorable competitive position when travel to Cuba opens, Corridore says. ""Cuba could be a lucrative market for them,"" he said.In an industry of vanished perks, JetBlue Airways (JBLU) has long stood out from its peers for offering everyday amenities, such as generous leg room and free baggage checks, at no extra cost.It famously led the way in placing TVs in front of passenger seats, now ubiquitous on most airlines.But going the extra mile for passengers didn't translate into extra dollars, analysts and investors complained. Unit revenue and ancillary sales, which include baggage fees, lagged peers.""The fact of the matter is, customers have not shown a willingness to pay more for a better product,"" said Jim Corridore, airline equity analyst with S&P Capital IQ.JetBlue isn't lagging peers anymore. ""It's clearly outperforming at this point,"" said Helane Becker, an analyst with Cowen & Co.""Unit revenue has outperformed the industry. Their balance sheet has improved dramatically. You can see that in the stock price,"" up about 63% year-to-date.What changed? JetBlue's relatively weak financial and stock performances led to a series of changes that cut away some perks and added a premium business class at a price below rivals.Several executives left last year, followed by the announcement in September that CEO Dave Barger would leave when his contract expired in February of this year.New Captain, New InitiativesHe was replaced by company executive Robin Hayes, a former British Airways executive, who also holds the title of president.Under Barger's final months, the firm implemented some new initiatives to get customers to pay up for more, such as a premium ""Mint"" business-class service launched in mid-2014 on flights between New York and the West Coast. It'll be expanded to flights between Boston and San Francisco in March.At the end of June, JetBlue started charging for bags that used to fly free, part of ""Fare Options,"" a new tiered pricing scheme that still includes free checked bag options.For this past September, Deutsche Bank projects that JetBlue will have been the only airline of the top six U.S.-based carriers to show a year-over-year increase in passenger revenue per available seat mile — up an estimated 2%. It forecast declines of 3.5% at Southwest Airlines (LUV) and up to 7% declines at American Airlines (AAL). On Friday, Delta Air Lines (DAL) was the first of the carriers to report on September: unit revenue was down 5%.Beginning in mid-2016, JetBlue will add 15 more seats to A320 aircraft, for a total of 165 seats. But analysts say that its leg room will still be more generous than the competition's.JetBlue says that all of the new initiatives will add $450 million in operating income, starting in 2017.In a research note last month, the Buckingham Research Group estimated that the current Mint service alone likely generates an incremental $120 million in revenue and 10 cents per share annually. If expanded to the airline's other routes of 2,000 miles or more, the report noted, it could translate to $500 million in incremental revenue and 40 cents in earnings.JetBlue is the fifth largest U.S.-based airline by revenue, after Delta, American, United Continental (UAL) and Southwest.The New York-based carrier flies to more than 90 cities in the U.S., the Caribbean and Latin America. Its leading markets are New York, Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles, Orlando and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Service to Mexico City launched on Oct. 1 from Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.JetBlue is essentially positioned between the consolidated legacy carriers, with their extensive routes, and ultralow-fare airlines such as Spirit Airlines (SAVE) and Allegiant Travel (ALGT), which boost cheap fares with add-on fees.""It still has lower costs than peers, but it is not a low-fare carrier in the traditional sense,"" Corridore said.While changes made so far have already had a positive impact on JetBlue's financial performance, so have lower fuel costs and easing competition in key markets.JetBlue is benefiting from rivals' relatively low-capacity increases in its key markets New York, Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Becker says.While capacity increases are up around 3% in JetBlue markets, she adds, the airlines' average is somewhat higher, and some markets such as Seattle and Dallas are up in the double digits.""Nobody's really been growing aggressively in New York and Boston and to some extent Fort Lauderdale, which are all big markets for JetBlue,"" she said.Operating income in the second quarter doubled from a year earlier to $282 million. Per-share earnings jumped 132% to 44 cents per share.Passenger revenue per available seat mile — a closely watched metric in the airline industry — increased 1.4%. Revenue passenger miles rose 8.7% on a capacity increase of 7.5%, for a load factor of 85.6%, up 1 percentage point.Meanwhile, JetBlue's operating expense per available seat mile decreased 8.6%. Excluding fuel and profit sharing, it rose a slight 0.6%.With lower oil prices and only 19% of its fuel consumption hedged, JetBlue's realized fuel price in the quarter fell 31% to $2.13 per gallon.Oil Eases Slower Sales GrowthLower-priced oil — down more than 60% from a year ago — is a ""good trade-off"" to slower growing airline-industry revenue this year, Corridore says. Jet fuel accounts for a third of an airline's costs.With domestic revenue growth slowing, capacity growth in the industry will remain tempered, analysts say. That's unlike past stretches following oil-price declines, when airlines would order new planes using their excess cash.Now U.S. carriers (JetBlue included) have been using excess cash to buy back shares and pay down debt, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report on Sept. 30.Still, JetBlue expects capacity to increase at the high end of its 7%-to-9% range for the full year. It sees operating expenses per available seat mile rising 0% to 1.5%, excluding fuel and profit-sharing.The airline's earnings for the year are seen as growing 170% over last year to $1.89 per share, according to Thomson Reuters.More tailwinds could be ahead for JetBlue. The carrier's strong presence in Florida, especially South Florida, should put it in a favorable competitive position when travel to Cuba opens, Corridore says. ""Cuba could be a lucrative market for them,"" he said.

469,LEG,"Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the New York GOP primary was a game-changer. It ended his Wisconsin slump and set the stage for an across-the-board sweep next Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island.Trump’s vote count exceeded his pre-primary polling average by nearly 10 percentage points. Perhaps most important, the win gave him 89 more delegates for the RNC July convention.So Trump is now the prohibitive favorite to win the GOP nomination -- although there is still much dispute about this. But I believe, even if he comes up short of a majority 1,237 delegates, he will still get a first-ballot victory. There will be roughly 190 uncommitted delegates at the Cleveland convention. And Trump, with his art of the deal, can be very persuasive.But what hasn’t gotten enough attention following New York is how Trump did it, and how it will enhance his position in the rest of the primaries. My theory is this: Trump cleverly turned the tables against Ted Cruz in regard to the nationwide delegate fight, especially in Colorado. Trump outflanked Cruz.By calling the delegate-selection process “rigged,” and arguing that Colorado had an election without voters, Trump turned a loss into a victory. Why? Because he put Cruz in the unenviable position of defending the status quo delegate-selection process.Now, Cruz played by the rules in Colorado and elsewhere. And Trump was caught flat-footed, and to some extent was embarrassed by his own weak delegate-gathering team.However, and this is the key point, Cruz argued time and again that the rules were the rules and that he simply played by them. And as Trump continuously attacked the RNC rules as being undemocratic, disenfranchising to voters, and creatures of out-of-touch Republican-party regulars, he put Cruz in the position of backing the establishment. A bad place for Cruz.Moreover, in attacking the delegate process, Trump was able to restore and even enhance his position as the anti-establishment outsider. The agent of change. That’s precisely what GOP voters favor.Now, Colorado was a bad delegate story to begin with. A planned direct primary vote was cancelled. But a friend relates the disturbing story of his moderate Republican brother who owns a small railroad and who caucused for Trump. Trump won that local caucus by 60%. But as the process moved up to the county level, then the congressional district level, and finally the state level, Trump got zero delegates.At a minimum, this process was whacky, convoluted and opaque. At its worst, it was rigged against GOP voters.Other states have produced similar horror stories. And Pennsylvania may be positioned to deliver the most ridiculous. Whoever wins the direct Pennsylvania primary next Tuesday gets only 17 out of 71 delegates. So no matter who wins, 50-something delegates will still be uncommitted. That’s crazy.Actually, I think the whole GOP selection process is crazy. Why not a simple, direct, winner-take-all primary election? The person with the most votes gets all the delegates. Nice and simple.RNC chair Reince Priebus might want to think about this progressive democratic reform. After 100 years or so, it’s time for a change.But back to the Trump New York win. Trump trashed the current delegate system while Cruz defended it. It was bad politics for Mr. Cruz.And Trump expanded his critique into a full-blown issues platform. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, five days before the New York primary, Trump argued that the old order, the governing elite, the establishment and the special-interest donors, consultants, pollsters, and pundits are the same people “who were wrong on taxes, on the size of government, on trade, on immigration, on foreign policy.”In very clear terms Trump connected Cruz with exactly those establishmentarian elites who have bred so much anger and resentment in Republicans everywhere.Trump completely outflanked Cruz while turning a process issue into a policy issue. The more Cruz defended the delegate process, the more Trump hammered away at his new theme that Cruz is defending the elite old order. In that Journal op-ed, Trump charged that Cruz is actually a member of the very “Washington cartel” that Cruz criticizes.And like other state primaries, the New York exit polls showed that 88% of voters were either dissatisfied or angry at government, while 64% wanted a president who was outside the political establishment.Much of this may be unfair to Cruz’s issue positions and beliefs. But the distinguished senator, in his defense of the status quo delegate process, made a serious strategic error. Heading into yet another Super Tuesday, Trump is making sure that the Cruz error is compounded and magnified.By turning delegate caucus defeats into an overall message victory, Trump has given himself a yuge leg up for the GOP nomination.

470,LEG,"Verizon Communications (VZ) early Thursday reported Q1 revenue that missed Wall Street views, putting its recent acquisition spree -- and its strategy to pursue growth from mobile video and advertising -- in the spotlight on its earnings call.Verizon stock was down nearly 4% in afternoon trading Thursday, after the phone company reported EPS in line with analyst consensus estimates but revenue that missed views. High-dividend-paying Verizon and AT&T (T) were among top-performing large-cap stocks in Q1, but both have fallen in April.Verizon provided no update on its interest in acquiring struggling Web company Yahoo (YHOO). Verizon said that AOL, which it acquired last June for $4.4 billion, had its best March quarter in five years; but Verizon did not break out the digital media company’s results. Nor did Verizon provide subscriber or other data for its ad-supported Go90 mobile video service, launched in late September.CFO Fran Shammo, on Verizon’s earnings conference call with analysts, defended Verizon’s acquisitions and investments in digital media firms that cater to young adults and teenagers. Verizon is turning to advertising as the next leg of wireless revenue growth, as growth from wireless data products slows amid fierce competition with AT&T, T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S), says Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson.Shammo says that Verizon will provide more transparency later in 2016 on how its push into digital media is progressing.“On AOL performance, I think I’m not going to get into a lot of details on AOL, but they’ve had the best quarter in revenue in the last five years,” Shammo said. “We will, as I said before, open the box at some point in time to give you more visibility to this, and I continue to say that that will be midyear to maybe third quarter of this year where we’ll start to produce some numbers around some of these more specific platforms.”The CFO said that he expects more operating synergy between AOL and the Go90 service.Along with AOL’s ad platform last year, Verizon acquired online brands such as Huffington Post, TechCrunch and Engadget. Verizon also snapped up ad firm Millennial Media for a reported $250 million.Verizon recently bought a 24.5% stake in DreamWorks Animation’s (DWA) AwesomenessTV, a digital network for teenagers and young adults. Verizon also teamed with Hearst to acquire video website Complex Media, while Verizon-AOL acquired virtual reality studio RYOT for a reported $10 million to $15 million.Those deals followed Verizon’s 2014 acquisition of Intel’s (INTC) Internet video business OnCue. In 2013, it also purchased EdgeCast Networks, a content delivery network.Amid the acquisition spree, some analysts worry about regulatory moves that could hinder Verizon’s ability to increase ad revenue.  Verizon aims to use wireless customer location data to support its advertising business, analysts say.The Federal Communications Commission in March proposed a rule that would require mobile and fixed Internet service providers to get customer consent to collect data for targeted advertising. Under the privacy rules, ISPs would need to tell consumers what information they are collecting, how they are using it and when they will share it.“Privacy and security has always been a priority for Verizon,” said Shammo. “The issue that we have right now is that the FCC’s proposed rules would apply to broadband (service) providers but not to companies like (Alphabet’s (GOOGL)) Google or Facebook (FB).""If we’re going to have rules, we need to make sure we don’t single out certain industries. That’s something our legal department continues to work with the FCC on.”Verizon’s buyout of Vodafone Group’s (VOD) 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion in 2014 gave it more flexibility to use cash for acquisitions and pursue a new strategic direction.  Verizon had $104 billion in net debt as of March 31, down slightly from $109 billion in Q1 2015.On April 1, Verizon closed a deal to sell wireline assets in California, Florida and Texas to Frontier Communications (FTR) for $10.5 billion. The deal could lower Verizon’s debt, unless it acquires part or all of Yahoo.Verizon on Thursday reiterated guidance for flat full-year adjusted earnings. Verizon said that the strike of 39,000 wireline workers, which began April 13, could pressure current-quarter profit.Verizon said that its Q1 profit rose 4% to $1.06 from the year-earlier period, with revenue rising less than 1% to $32.17 billion. Analysts had modeled revenue of $32.46 billion. Excluding AOL, acquired in June 2015, Verizon said that its Q1 revenue fell 1.5%. Wireless revenue fell 1.4% to $22 billion.Wireless revenue from IoT (Internet of Things) products, mainly Web-connected cars, rose 25% to $195 million, Verizon said.

473,LEG,"Technical analysis still has its shares of naysayers, but decades of IBD research show that there's something to it. Actually, there's a lot to it. At its most basic level, technical analysis is the study of supply and demand in a stock. Understanding when institutional investors are accumulating a stock can result in big profits for individual investors. Similarly, understanding when they're selling can protect your portfolio from big losses.Basic technical analysis skills helped many IBD readers sidestep the market carnage when tech stocks topped in 2000. It also helped them reap big profits at the start of the bull markets in March 2003 and March 2009.An Investor's Corner series kicked off last week, introducing the concept of what it means when a stock ""bases."" After the initial column, we discussed two patterns that have yielded successful breakouts for decades: the cup with handle and flat base.Today's focus is the double-bottom pattern. The pattern looks like the letter W. The correction on the left side depends on what the market is doing, but it generally should be 20%-30%. If the major stock indexes correct 15%-20% off their highs, a 30% pullback by a stock is common.The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the middle peak.Every good base should have a shakeout where the last remaining sellers exit the stock. In the cup-with-handle pattern, the handle is where the shakeout occurs. Shakeouts can also occur at the bottom of a base. In the double-bottom pattern, the shakeout occurs when the second leg down undercuts the first, but not excessively so.Netflix (NFLX) formed not one but two double-bottom patterns in 2009-10. The first was a nine-week base (1) with a buy point of 58.10. In the week ended Jan. 29, Netflix shot up straight off the bottom as shares surged 22% in huge volume. It never looked back and more than doubled over the next five months.After that, Netflix formed another double-bottom base (2). This one just met the minimum length of seven weeks and had a more symmetrical look. After the breakout past 124.10 in big volume, Netflix more than doubled again over the next 11 months.Of course, not all double-bottom breakouts yield triple-digit gains. They tend to have the best chances of success in the early stages of a new market uptrend.

521,LEG,"It is very hard to publicly affirm a position for nearly a year and to then, at the last minute, change one's mind.Nevertheless, even as late as Election Day itself, I wish to address those conservatives and Republicans who have declared themselves Never-Trumpers.I was one of you in vigorously opposing Trump's nomination -- on my national radio show and in my syndicated column. And I paid a price, as you have, in losing longtime supporters -- in my case any number of listeners who supported Trump from the outset and found my strong opposition to him disappointing and worse.Unlike you, however, I did say from the beginning that if he were to be the nominee, I would vote for him.On this Election Day, I am more convinced than ever that this was the right position. I even have to believe that in the wee hours of the night -- when worrying about the current and future state of our beloved country keeps you awake -- many of you have at least wondered whether you have taken the right position.Most of you are simply too intelligent, too idealistic and too self-questioning not to have at least on occasion had second thoughts. If you understand -- and I cannot believe that most of you don't -- how destructive another four years of any Democrat in the White House, let alone the truly corrupt Hillary Clinton, would be, it is inconceivable that you have never questioned your Never-Trump position. Never-Trump, after all, is not the same as Never-Question.To prove my point, one of my favorite Never-Trumpers, Jonah Goldberg, wrote in May: ""If the election were a perfect tie, and the vote fell to me and me alone, I'd probably vote for none other than Donald Trump.""In that moment of exquisite honesty, Jonah acknowledged one of the most important moral arguments to be made for voting for Trump -- the Lesser of Two Evils argument.To which conservatives who won't vote for Trump often respond: ""The lesser of two evils is still evil.""Now, forgive me, but that it is a complete non sequitur, morally and intellectually unworthy of any conservative, religious or secular, who makes it. The only relevant moral lesson here is not that the lesser of two evil is still evil; it is that choosing the lesser of two evils, by definition, increases good. Would you amputate your leg if it might save your life? Or would you say that because losing your life and losing your leg are both evils, you won't amputate your leg because the lesser of two evils is still evil?Then there is the Never-Trump argument that Donald Trump isn't a conservative. I agree that he hasn't been his whole life, because he probably never gave the subject of the differences between left and right five of minutes of serious thought (nor, if we are to be honest, did Republican presidential nominee John McCain, whom I also worked hard to elect). But Trump and Mike Pence and his top political advisors are well to the right of Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.As Victor Davis Hanson wrote last week, in his plea to Never-Trumpers:""On the Supreme Court, Obamacare, the debt, rebuilding the military, the Second Amendment, school choice, abortion, reforming the tax code, re-examining regulation, energy exploration and production, illegal immigration, sanctuary cities, and a host of other issues, the Republican ticket is the antithesis of Clinton/Kaine -- and is recognized as such by nearly all progressives.""Why isn't all that enough to vote for Trump?Then there is the argument that electing Trump means that in the eyes of many Americans, especially young Americans, Trump will embody conservatism and Republicanism, and that would be a calamity.On that noble concern, I am not willing to turn America over to four more years of leftism. First of all, the damage the left will do, if not permanent, will almost certainly last a generation. And I happen to think it could very well be permanent. Can you name a country outside of some formerly Communist countries (which had Communism forced on them), that chose to go left and has fully recovered from a generation of leftism?Given the arguments in favor of voting for Trump, I see only three possible explanations for conservatives helping to elect Hillary Clinton.One is that they are certain Donald Trump is so psychologically imbalanced that he will jeopardize America and the world. But they have to be certain of this. If they have any doubts, they have to vote for him -- because they are certain about Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. And between certitude and incertitude, one must always act on what is certain.The second is their self-image: How can they, truly decent people, vote for someone who has exhibited the uncouth speech and behavior that Trump has? Or, as some have expressed it, ""How can I explain to my daughter that I supported Donald Trump?""As someone who also thinks of himself as decent, I think that saving America from Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, and the left is the most decent thing I can do. And as for your daughter, just have her speak to any of the millions of wonderful women who are voting for Donald Trump. They will provide your daughter with perfectly satisfying moral and woman-centered answers.And the third explanation for the Never-Trump conservatives is they that they believe we will survive four more years of left-wing rule, and that America is really not in such bad shape anyway. That argument was made this weekend by a writer for National Review. ""The United States of America is not a wreck,"" he reassures us. ""The people who are telling you that it is -- on both sides -- are trying to sell you something. Don't buy it.""Question: What exactly am I, or Victor Davis Hanson, or Thomas Sowell, or at least half of The Wall Street Journal columnists, or millions of religious Jews, Protestants, Catholics and Mormons trying to ""sell you""?And second, that writer and others who think like him seem to be living in a different country than I am. Because compared to America at any time in its history except for the Civil War years, the country I am living in is indeed a wreck -- and getting worse each day, and in every way. After another four years of a Democrat in the White House the country called the United States will still be here, but America as envisioned since its founding -- as the world's beacon of individual liberty, Lincoln's ""Last Best Hope of Earth"" -- won't.To think otherwise is willful self-delusion.

522,LEG,"Biotech stocks climbed for the third consecutive day Tuesday, with mid-cap Tesaro (TSRO) forging the way, but among the largest companies, Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG) are buyable now, says Mizuho analyst Salim Syed.Syed initiated coverage Tuesday on Amgen, Gilead and Celgene stocks with buy ratings. He also initiated on Biogen (BIIB), but with a neutral rating on the lack of near- or medium-term catalysts and uncertainty after former CEO George Scangos resigned in July.""To be clear, we still think Biogen has some good programs and it could be a matter of time before we get excited again ... just not right now,"" Syed wrote in a research report. He has a 290 price target on Biogen stock, which slipped 2 cents Tuesday to 295.60.IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group lifted a fraction on the stock market today. But the volatile election season has strangled shares, causing the group to topple 16% over the past seven weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Syed has a neutral rating on Biogen stock, but shares are looking better after Biogen and Ionis announced early efficacy in phase 3 testing of a spinal muscular atrophy drug. Check out Industry Themes for the full take.Syed likened Amgen to a jogger. He has a 164 price target on the stock, down a fraction to 138.45 on Tuesday.""Before Amgen's most recent Q3 call, we thought of Amgen largely as a 'ho-hum' steady stock, a jogger if you will,"" he wrote. ""However, since Amgen's Q3 call (about 1.5 weeks ago), the stock has come down about 12%.""Enbrel commentary during the Q3 call spooked investors, he says. Sales of the immunosuppressant were flat at $1.45 billion and, given contract negotiations, Amgen expects ""relatively little benefit from net selling price changes in 2017"" for Enbrel.Wall Street has been predicting a decline in Amgen's legacy businesses for some time. But Syed sees a silver lining in new drugs, like Amgen's Repatha, a cholesterol-busting PCSK9si rival of Sanofi (SNY) and Regeneron's (REGN) Praluent.Repatha already has U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but sales have suffered on restricted access, Syed wrote. Repatha is currently in phase 3 testing to treat cardiovascular outcomes and, in September, met primary and secondary endpoints in a phase 3 test for coronary artery disease.CV data are expected in Q1. Syed calls this ""the most important data event for Amgen."" A positive event could pull Amgen stock out of the dumps. Shares hit a two-year low Friday, though they managed to close up fractionally for the day.Gilead managed the impossible in 2013-14 after it launched Hepatitis C (HCV) drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and tripled its revenue to become a $30 billion company, Syed wrote in a separate report. But the duo are cures for HCV and, therefore, won't last forever.""The flip side of developing a cure is eventually the disease will be eradicated,"" he wrote. ""While great for patients, this means declining revenues over time. This has been weighing on Gilead's stock as the answer of slope of decline isn't exactly clear.""For Q3, Gilead's hep C trio -- Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa -- brought in $3.3 billion in sales, down 31% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Epclusa, which launched in June and July in the U.S. and Europe helped to offset declines in Sovaldi and Harvoni.Syed models 10% year-over-year declines in HCV sales for Gilead.But Gilead is working on its next leg of growth, Syed says. He has an 88 price target on Gilead stock. Its nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Hepatitis B (HBV) drugs are still too early in their pipelines. Plus, Gilead is facing NASH competition from Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) and Allergan (AGN).Gilead isn't ""a table-pounding buy,"" but the stock is undervalued and the company will likely perform over time, rewarding patient investors, Syed wrote.Gilead stock rose 4 cents Tuesday to 74.04.If Celgene is a castle, chemotherapy drug Revlimid is its moat, Syed says. During Q3, Revlimid sales grew 30% vs. last year to $1.89 billion, driven by new market share gains and increased duration. Revlimid is used to treat myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), multiple myeloma, and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).Revlimid ""allows Celgene to grow its next sources of revenue,"" Syed wrote in a separate report. ""(Revlimid is) still a growing part of the business and a value add to Celgene, but this part of the business is fairly well established and mature.""Inside its moat, Celgene has cancer drugs durvalumab and CAR-T in conjunction with AstraZeneca (AZN) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), respectively. Celgene is also working on its next-generation replacement for Revlimid, which is expected to go generic in 2022 and be fully generic in 2026.At its core, Celgene has ozanimod, currently in phase 3 testing for multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, and GED-301, an investigational Crohn's disease drug. These are central to Celgene's investment thesis, says Syed. He has a 130 price target on Celgene stock, which rose 0.89% Tuesday to 108.45.RELATED:Which Four Biotechs Are Derisked And Buyable Ahead Of Election Day?Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: AnalystGilead NASH Drug 'Active And Promising,' But Lagging InterceptAllergan Challenges Intercept With Tobira NASH Drug

523,LEG,"Irish budget carrier Ryanair (RYAAY) on Monday boosted its traffic outlook in the coming years and said it expects its low fares to force rivals out of some markets.The bullish expectations come as low-cost carriers in Europe and the U.S. force their larger non-budget rivals to cut fares to compete. Ryanair said it has already seen rivals shrink their footprint across Europe and that they were likely to pull back further.During the first half of the year, ""we've observed a growing trend of competitors closing bases and routes where they are unable to compete with Ryanair's lower fares, and we expect this trend to continue, especially in markets such as Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium, where significant restructuring of loss making operators (even at lower oil prices) continues,"" the carrier said.The low-fare battle prompted Air France-KLM last week to launch a low-cost airline that may eventually offer flights to the U.S., potentially ratcheting up pressure on Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines and United Airlines (UAL), which together control about a third of U.S.-Europe flights. But Delta has said it won't create a budget airline.Nearer term, however, Ryanair said low fares and the U.K.'s Brexit vote have made them cautious about fiscal 2017.Still, it was raising its long-term traffic forecast by more than 10% to 200 million passengers annually by March 2024.""Despite the uncertainty of Brexit, Ryanair believes that we can deliver profitable growth across Europe by controlling costs, lowering airfares, and maximizing load factors in a manner that will most benefit our customers, our people and our shareholders,"" the company said in a statement.U.S.-listed shares of Ryanair jumped 5.2% to close at 79.20 in the stock market today, popping above its 200-day line for the first time since September. Delta climbed 3.1%, American jumped 4.4% and United added 2.3%.IBD'S TAKE: With low-cost carriers outside the U.S. starting to offer their own trans-Atlantic flights, carriers like Delta are looking at a variety of ways to compete. Still, Ryanair said the fallout from the U.K.'s decision this summer to leave the European Union would likely ""continue to overhang our business"" during fiscal-year 2018. And it said ""weaker airfares and Brexit uncertainty will be the dominant features"" of the second half of its fiscal 2017, which ends in March.The vote, which caused the British pound to tank and made foreign exchange difficult, has prompted the carrier to slash 2017 flight-capacity growth in the U.K. to around 5% from 12%.The carrier, a vocal opponent of Brexit, said it would, in turn, shift that capacity growth toward Italy, where the government has cut taxes, and Germany and Belgium, where it said rivals were cutting back.While Ryanair has become known for its bare-bones approach to service and its CEO's brash approach to language, the carrier has tried to improve bookings, benefits, business-travel offerings and even leg room.Meanwhile, U.S. discount carrier Southwest (LUV) on Monday said that it continued to expect fourth-quarter unit revenue to fall 4% to 5% based on its October results. October traffic rose 5.2% on a capacity increase of 5.4%.Southwest shares finished 3% higher.RELATED:Southwest Is Only Airline That Sees Worse Unit Revenue; Stock DivesJetBlue Eyes Flights To Europe As Premium Service Expands

524,LEG,"""History repeats itself"" is an aphorism we all learn as children. There's much truth to it in the stock market, but many novice investors don't believe it.They can't bring themselves to concede that the seemingly random squiggles carved out by stocks on a chart are anything other than, well, random. Some scholar even wrote a booked entitled ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" that made that very point. In some circles, it's become the conventional wisdom.But to the trained eye, these patterns do repeat themselves -- and with good reason. The stock market is governed by a set of two principles: supply and demand; and fear and greed. Both are based on human nature, and human nature doesn't change.In a bear market, all stocks are taken down. Greed gives way to fear, and investors can't sell fast enough. But the smart money sees value in the best stocks and will begin accumulating shares, bidding these stocks up. So, when the market hits bottom, some of these stocks will have already built bases and are back near highs. They get ready to break out and rush to new highs, leading the way once a new bull market begins.And these bases have certain characteristics that show up repeatedly in market cycle after market cycle. IBD's founder and Chairman William O'Neil studied these characteristics in model books of great stock market winners after every bull market going back to 1888. He did this because he knew he would see these bases with the same characteristics again.Take two double-bottom bases from different eras: Nokia (NOK) in 1998 and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) in 2014.Both companies were in hot new industries and were growing exceptionally fast. Nokia made high-quality and easy-to-use cellphones (it later sold its phone operations to Microsoft (MSFT)); Palo Alto protects networks from intrusion. Nokia broke out in the early part of the final, frantic advance of the dot-com era. Palo Alto came during a milder bull market, but during a period when business and government were growing increasingly concerned about data theft.Nokia built its base over 12 weeks and corrected 36%. Palo Alto took 10 weeks to build a base that corrected 29%.Even a casual observer can see the similarity in both charts. They carved out patterns resembling the letter W. In both cases, the second leg down undercut the first. That's a critical feature in a double bottom. The second leg serves as a final shakeout of weak holders. But it's still too early to buy.Both bases had very bullish features at the bottom of both down legs. As seen in Nokia's daily chart, the stock reversed off lows and finished with gains for the day (1). Ditto for Palo Alto (2). Though not a requirement, it's a feature that would cause an investor to sit up straight. It indicates institutional investors have come in to support the stock.After forming a double bottom, a stock breaks out when it rises above the high point of the middle peak by at least 10 cents. In Nokia's case, the volume was well above average. In Palo Alto's case, the volume was only average. An investor would prefer to see better volume, but in Palo Alto's case, the trade worked.After breaking out, both stocks had pullbacks, but didn't undercut the buy points, before advancing to highly profitable gains.

525,LEG,"Are you maybe worried over the state of the country, the tenor of politics and leaders, discouraged by the behavior of some? You're not alone.So, this column is perfect for you. It's an inspiring tale of a brave dog and good people, all instinctively taking care of each other in the smoky horrors of war and finding happiness ever after. A good news story. When's the last one you can recall?This story concerns Lucca, a 12-year-old German Shepherd, one of hundreds of military dogs who live, sleep and eat with their handlers through good times and bad. She was assigned to Marine Gunnery Sgt. Christopher Willingham 10 years ago next week.She knew nothing of Marine protocol, not even when to sit.Military sergeants, however, have a way of turning raw recruits into wary warriors. During the next nine months Lucca and Willingham become a tight, bomb-hunting team, even communicating with soft sounds or hand gestures. Her job would be detecting explosives and alerting teammates before any detonation.During her two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, Lucca would take the most dangerous position, walking point on patrols out in front of everyone, sniffing a safe path through dangerous places. Time after time, Lucca's delicate nose identified deadly IEDs and she alerted the patrol.The Marine dog loved her work. She'd get excited when she saw her handler donning battle gear. She dutifully kept everyone in her care safe and healthy every day.During Lucca's more than 400 combat missions in two theaters of war, no one was ever killed or injured -- except Lucca. On a routine Afghan patrol in March of 2012, Lucca's second handler, Corp. Juan Rodriguez, was out in front with her.She signaled an explosive find. Rodriguez alerted his ordnance expert and the pair began searching for the second device always hidden nearby. Suddenly about 30 feet in front, a loud, yellow flash! Lucca disappeared in an immense explosion and cloud of smoke.When it cleared, there was Lucca struggling to get up and return to Rodriguez. Much of her left front leg was missing. Rodriguez ran over, scooped up his partner, headed for a protective treeline. As he tied a tourniquet on her shattered leg, other Marines called in medevac.The chopper arrived in 10 minutes. ""But it seemed like an eternity,"" recalled the corporal.Through those early days of recovery, Lucca was often unconscious to mask the pain. Her leg was amputated. Burns on her neck received treatment. But Rodriguez was always there with her -- in the O.R. or in the kennel, where he even slept with her. Semper Fi.In just 10 days Lucca was up and walking. Tough girl! ""Through all of her treatment,"" Rodriguez reports, ""and despite the pain she was in, her temperament never changed.”Military rules were changed in recent years, allowing for adoption of retired service dogs by their original trainers. Rodriguez took Lucca on a commercial flight to join Gunny Willingham and his family. The airline put both veterans in first class departing from Gate K-9.When the corporal and Lucca came up the ramp, there was Willingham in dress uniform on his knee to greet his battle buddy. He uttered her name as she came into view.Now, Lucca was not known for effusive behavior; after all, she's no Irish setter. But despite the distracting crowd of greeters Lucca hopped straight over to Willingham. She pawed him, then licked his face over and over. Judging by the reunion video below, she was very happy.In London the other day, Lucca, wearing her best camo collar, and Willingham in dress uniform accepted the world's highest honor for military dogs, the Dickin Medal for Gallantry from the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. The next recipient will be Diesel, a Paris police dog killed in a raid on terrorists last year.“Lucca’s conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty makes her a hugely deserving recipient of the Dickin Medal,” said Jan McLoughlin, PDSA's director general.“Her ability and determination to seek out arms and explosives preserved human life amid some of the world’s fiercest military conflicts.”Willingham reports his three-legged pal remains as playful still in retirement as that two-year-old puppy he met a decade ago in basic training. Lucca particularly enjoys romps at the beach and in the woods, where the protective shepherd still instinctively takes point for the family.See, I said you'd feel better.Thank you for your service, Lucca. And Gunny. Juan. The surgeons. And everyone who cares about important little tales like these.RELATED:

After six weeks of consolidation, the stock attempted a breakout above 131.88 in the beginning of February but was quickly turned…
"
528,LEG,"The double-bottom base is one of the basic chart patterns among huge stock market winners in the CAN SLIM catalog, alongside the venerable cup with handle. If a good double bottom is identified during a bull market, a strong breakout in big volume by the stock can lead to handsome gains in a stock.The double bottom is shaped like the letter W. An important distinction is that the second leg down should undercut the first. IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil, who developed the chart-reading strategy over the past six decades, says the undercut of the second leg -- even by just a penny -- is a necessary shakeout as a final purge of weak holders before the stock can advance. In that respect, it serves a similar use to the handle in a cup-with-handle base.A second leg that doesn't undercut the first down leg is failure prone, O'Neil says. The buy point is 10 cents above the high of the middle peak.Many of the requirements for a double bottom are similar to those for a cup with handle. There should be a prior uptrend. The base should be a minimum of seven weeks. The correction should be moderate, usually 20% to 30% from high to low. Or a bit more if the market has had a severe correction.Double bottoms can have handles, but they aren't necessary for a sound base. Many stocks form double bottoms and shoot straight past the buy point into profitable territory. It's ideal to see the stock's volume pick up at least 40% to 50% above its 50-day average at the breakout.Nokia (NOK) formed a classic cup with handle in late 1998. The general market began a severe and painful bear market in July of that year. But an Oct. 15 follow-through day kicked off one of history's great bull markets, led by tech stocks.Cellphones were just gaining in popularity, and Finland-based Nokia and Sweden-based Ericsson (ERIC) practically owned the space. Both made huge advances during the bull market.The Nasdaq carved out a double bottom of its own as a September recovery attempt failed, sending stocks to new lows. That helped Nokia form a double bottom.Nokia completed its first leg down during the week ended Sept. 4, 1998 (1). Notice that the stock finished higher and in the upper half of its weekly range. That's bullish. The second leg undercut the first on the week ended Oct. 9 (2). Nokia fell for the week, but again it finished in the upper half of its daily range. The careful chart reader could have spotted a pattern developing and put it on a watch list before it broke out.Nokia broke out during the week ended Oct. 23, rising 7.7% that week and sprinting past an 85.10 entry point (the chart shows the entry adjusted for later stock splits). That big move helped make it one of the first big winners to emerge in the new bull market.

555,LEG,"Mahatma Gandhi led India to independence while becoming the conscience of the world. In the process, he transformed himself, the attitudes of his followers and the political order — from America and South Africa to the Philippines and Eastern Europe.Time magazine ranked Gandhi the third most influential person of the 20th century, behind Albert Einstein and Franklin Roosevelt.""Gandhi's mission was not really the liberation of India,"" wrote Eknath Easwaran in the preface to the 2002 edition of ""The Essential Gandhi,"" edited by Louis Fischer. ""India was essentially a showcase, a stage for the world to see what nonviolence can accomplish in the highly imperfect world of real life.""He began with his personal relationships, aware that he could not expect to put out the fires of anger elsewhere if the same fires smoldered in his own home and heart. ... He gives us a glimpse of our potential as human beings.""Mohandas Gandhi (1869-1948) was born in the state of Porbandar in northwest India on the coast of the Arabian Sea, part of the British Empire, where his father was a state administrator. His mother, Putlibai, was much loved by Gandhi, the youngest of four children to the couple.At 13, Gandhi was married to the 14-year-old Kasturba and they would have five children. At 36, he would take a vow of celibacy to focus his passion on social action.Off To EnglandHe was a mediocre student and barely passed the entrance exam for college at 18. His parents wanted him to get a law degree and succeed his father, so they sent him to the prestigious Inner Temple law school in London in 1888.He graduated and returned to India to pass the bar in Bombay in 1892, but was too shy to effectively cross-examine witnesses. So he accepted a job in Pretoria, South Africa, to give legal advice to Indians.Soon after his arrival, he was in the first-class section of a train when an official ordered him to leave because ""coloreds"" weren't allowed. He refused and was ejected at the next stop, but raised such a commotion that the stationmaster arranged for him to be permitted in first class the next day.During the final leg of the trip by stagecoach, a white passenger who was boarding wanted his seat, pulled him out of it and beat him until other passengers intervened.The experience turned Gandhi into a fiery activist, leading a movement the next two decades to protect Indians' rights in South Africa.He promptly read writings on civil disobedience by Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy, as well as Indian scriptures on the importance of not killing, to develop his philosophy of nonviolent action.Hoping to earn goodwill from the British, Gandhi led a 1,100-man medical corps in 1899 during the war with the Boers, settlers of Dutch ancestry, as well as another in 1906 in the fight against the Zulu. Afterward, he achieved many of his goals to protect Indians, but often spent time in jail on the way there.Gandhi returned to India in 1915 at the request of the Congress Party, which wanted to help improve the lives of Indians and increase self-government.By the time of Gandhi's birth, the British East India Co., licensed by the crown, had controlled most of the subcontinent for a century and drained its wealth.In 1857, after Indians in the British army revolted against abuse, London imposed direct rule.""Forced to grow crops for export instead of local use and then taxed heavily, hundreds of thousands of villages lost all capacity to sustain themselves,"" wrote Easwaran. ""Cities became nightmarish extremes of wealth and poverty, Calcutta the most notorious example. Some 400,000 Indians died of starvation in 1825-50, rising to 15 million in 1875-1900, the years in which Gandhi would come of age.""The odds were long for 390 million poor and illiterate Indians to throw off the rule of an empire that controlled a quarter of the world's land. To do it nonviolently seemed preposterous; the only success had been the American Revolution.During World War I, Gandhi hoped to gain goodwill by encouraging Indians to join the British army. But in 1919, the massacre of 379 unarmed demonstrators at Amritsar shattered hope for government cooperation with his movement to improve the lives of the majority of poor Indians.Gandhi organized successful protests against landlord abuses of peasants and worked on Muslim grievances to broaden his base of Hindus. In 1920 he urged a boycott of British goods, advocating economic self-sufficiency.In 1930 he organized defiance of a law that banned Indians from making salt, with the government having a monopoly.He marched with thousands to the Arabian Sea and sparked salt-making protests all over the nation, resulting in 60,000 arrests.On A Roll""Gandhi was jailed for almost nine months, but what authorities had dismissed as a minor act of political theater swelled into a nationwide cry for independence,"" wrote Tom O'Neill in National Geographic magazine. ""A broad array of India's populations — high caste and low, male and female, Hindu and Muslim — for the first time joined in protest against British rule. He had infused India with a revolutionary blend of politics and spirituality.""Gandhi also sought advances by his own people. Starting in 1932 he demanded better treatment by Hindus of the Untouchables, who did the dirtiest work that made them impure, according to tradition.He also advocated more rights for women, including more educational opportunities and a ban on child marriage. His efforts to lift the masses earned him the title Mahatma (Great Soul), but he also made enemies at home and abroad.""Gandhi was a complex human being and his moral views evolved considerably as he became a national leader,"" Srikumar Rao, author of ""Happiness at Work,"" told IBD. ""Much of the criticism uses selective quotes form a young Gandhi, even when he later espoused a different vision, and ignores the cultural context in which he functioned. He is revered not because he was perfect, but because of his unremitting efforts to grow morally and spiritually and his unique ability to evoke the best in those he came in contact with.""When World War II broke out, Gandhi offered non-battlefield support for the British army, but Congress leaders were offended as Indian forces were marshaled without consultation.Jail And DeathHe then cooperated with British war aims, conditional on immediate self-government as a colony, but was rebuffed and imprisoned from 1942 to 1944 along with 100,000 other protesters.During this time, his wife died in prison and he caught malaria that almost killed him.As for not helping resist the fascist Axis powers, his defenders point out that most Americans did not want to get involved until the Pearl Harbor bombing in December 1941.As the Indian independence movement gained strength after the war ended in 1945, Muslim leaders demanded a separate state in the northwest and northeast, to be called Pakistan (the eastern part split from Pakistan in 1971 and was renamed Bangladesh).The British granted freedom to India and Pakistan in August 1947, prompting 12 million to move across the borders, sparking riots in which half a million died.Gandhi vowed to fast to the death unless the slaughter stopped, bringing it to a halt.Norwegian historian Jens Seip observed that had Gandhi not exerted his influence, the bloodshed would have been much greater.Joseph Lelyveld, author of what many call the the most balanced study of Gandhi's career, ""Great Soul,"" said the keys to his success were ""moral commitment, selfless courage and persistence that still has the power to inspire.""In January 1948, a Hindu nationalist, furious with Gandhi's concessions to Muslims, shot him point-blank. Over 2 million joined his funeral procession as the nation mourned.Louis Mountbatten, the last British viceroy of India, who had come to admire him, said that Gandhi's ""death is truly a loss to mankind which sorely needs the living light of those ideals of love and tolerance for which he strove and died. ... The world will not see the like of him again, perhaps, for centuries.""

559,LEG,"The 26th annual Schwab Impact conference kicked off at the San Diego Convention Center on Monday, spotlighting investing themes for 2017 and the strategies without which investment advisors risk being left behind.Here are some key take-aways from the event, which drew roughly 4,000 attendees and concludes Thursday:Earnings will grow in 2017, likely in the single digits and almost certainly not in the double-digit numbers that are being bandied about as corporate profits turn around, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in Monday's keynote speech.The political rhetoric surrounding the November presidential election has some investors worrying about the multinationals in their stock portfolios, but Kleintop called the fears overdone.""The death of free trade has been greatly overstated,"" he said, describing any pullback in multinational stocks as a potential buying opportunity. It is especially reassuring to him that earnings growth across sectors globally looks fairly balanced, with no bubble in any one segment.Investors wondering where exactly to put their money to work internationally should consider Canada — ""one big levered energy ETF"" -- as well as Japan — ""one big financial ETF,"" Kleintop said.While Canada's biggest sector is financials, not energy, the banks are big lenders to the nation's massive natural resources industry and tend to track oil prices too, he explained.Meanwhile, Japan's stock market tends to tracks banks even though consumer discretionary is its biggest sector. A steeper yield curve may help to lift the Japanese stock market, an underperformer so far in 2016, Kleintop said.ETFs that offer exposure to multinationals include the S&P 500 trackers such as Vanguard 500 (VOO), as well as the more international First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend (FGD).IShares MSCI Canada (EWC) and iShares MSCI Japan (EWJ) are among the most popular ETFs to target the respective countries.For U.S. stocks to break out of their range, earnings have to improve, especially for the large U.S. multinationals, one investing strategist told IBD on the sidelines of the Impact event.IBD's TAKE: For a quick look at how high your stocks' earnings rate, run them through Stock Checkup.""I expect one more leg up"" for the stock market, said Luciano Siracusano, WisdomTree's chief investment strategist. He believes that a move higher will require some fiscal stimulus too, in the form of infrastructure spending or tax reforms to spur the repatriation of corporate money stashed abroad.""That's the kind of thing companies would likely use for stock buybacks and raising dividends, which would be another catalyst"" for the stock market, he said.The earnings contraction is starting to bottom out in emerging markets (EM) as well as in the U.S., according to Siracusano. Many countries in this asset class are commodity driven and have benefited from this year's oil rally.Siracusano sees little reason to favor one single EM market over another right now. ETFs offering broadly diversified exposure to emerging markets include WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend (DEM), which yields 4.90%.If rates head higher in 2017, as they seem likely to do, currency hedging could be hot again after a long hiatus, according to Siracusano.Currency hedged ETFs tend to outperform nonhedged peers when the local currency slides against the greenback. Rate hikes would strengthen the U.S. dollar and further weaken the yen, for example, benefiting Japan's export-heavy markets.Japan stock ETFs have already rallied strongly since July 8, as the yield on U.S. 10-Year Treasury notes started to move back up and the Japanese currency weakened.Amid those shifts, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) edged out its unhedged rival EWJ with a 10.8% gain in the third quarter.Domestically, a tactical tilt toward the economically sensitive technology and financial sectors could pay off if rates were to rise. Siracusano advised investors to focus on quality companies in these areas.""You want to be conscious of the creditworthiness of companies"" at this late stage of the market cycle, he said.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) is an ETF investing in companies with high earnings expectations and has a roughly 20% portfolio stake in the technology sector.Its top three holdings are Coca-Cola (KO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL).In breakout education sessions, audience members discussed the outlook for advisory services, cybersecurity standards and the millennial opportunity, among other topics.The commodification of investment management by ETF-based roboadvisors and asset managers, such as Betterment and Schwab's subsidiary Windhaven, came under special scrutiny. Some panelists said the trend was forcing the advisor industry toward being more planning-centric.One Schwab expert pointed out that successful financial advisors have evolved with the marketplace over the past 20 years — initially from a role that involved pure investment management to wealth management, and now to what is described as lifestyle management.Financial advisors have to find ways to differentiate themselves as competitors encroach upon the value they provide to investors, said Jon Beatty, Schwab's senior vice president of advisor services.""This is a profession that's on the move,"" he added, describing ""lifestyle management"" as an umbrella term for new services such as generational wealth transfer, executive relocation and retirement downsizing.RELATED:Latest News On ETFs On The Move

560,LEG,"A common question that IBD receives from readers is a smart one.The question: How can someone improve his or her market vision at spotting sector rotation?IBD is one of the most qualified organizations in the world to answer this. How so?The newspaper's founder, William O'Neil, pioneered the study of changes in price momentum among various industries. With the help of an IBM mainframe computer in the 1960s, O'Neil began presenting institutional clients a market picture that framed not only leading stocks but top-notch industry groups over specific time frames, such as the past six months.Thanks to those efforts, every IBD reader today can track the market like a pro.If you become savvy at spotting the emerging winners in terms of industries, you've got a leg up. The rationale: If the airline stocks as a group are outstripping the ethical drug firms, then an investor is going to likely make more money with timely purchases of the best stocks in the airline industry. O'Neil's research determined that up to half a fantastic stock's move is connected to the strength of both its specific industry group and its broad sector.Here are some tips:Look at top industry groups: Keep an eye out for those that jump into the top 20, or even the top 40 among the 197. An easy way to do this: Check the bottom of the General Market page, which is a PDF link at the bottom of the daily Big Picture column.What is that breakout stock's industry group? Find out fast at IBD Stock Checkup. When a market uptrend warms up, more breakouts tend to come from the same sectors or industry groups. Lumentum (LITE), Oclaro (OCLR) and Finisar (FNSR) hail from the fiber-optics industry group. Telecoms have thrived in 2016, and the Telecom-Fiber Optics group has ranked No. 1 among 197 IBD groups for weeks.As you check the industry group rankings, also scan the ranking of 33 broad sectors listed in IBD's stock research tables, which begin on page B6 in the latest IBD Weekly print edition. These rankings can change dramatically over time. Sector Leaders and other young companies with outstanding EPS and RS ratings receive special attention at the top of each sector.New High List: The stocks are categorized by sector. Lately, bank, financial, medical and select tech plays have led. At Investors.com, the list is updated each day under ""IBD Data Tables"" in the Stock Lists section.Scan Stock Market Today: This Investors.com-only feature highlights breakouts. Lately, Wall Street banks such as Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), have joined the breakout train.What's on Leaderboard? Sector Leaders? The former is curated, the latter is computer screen-driven. Both lists tend to show high-growth companies that are coming from the strongest industries.See Stocks On The Move: This incredibly useful table, found on both the home page and under the ""Stock Lists"" tab of Investors.com, shows only those stocks making big price moves. Write down the tickers, especially the ones you don't know, then check out their industry group in IBD Stock Checkup. Maybe certain sectors are sticking out. Don't forget the stocks going down too; it can help you spot emerging weakness in a leading sector.Follow top-performing ETFs: IBD's ETF Leaders column, which appears in the ETFs section of IBD Weekly, has noted strength in certain commodities such as coal, mining as well as tech-oriented sectors such as semiconductors.Take a step back: Consider what trends at work and in life are emerging. Cisco Systems (CSCO) wouldn't have been a top growth stock in the 1990s if the internet didn't take root. In the mid-2000s, Apple (AAPL) would have stayed an also-ran if it didn't keep innovating in the field of computers, digital music and phones.RELATED:Why This Coal ETF Is Really A Bet On The Pacific RimWhy Is This Mining-Related ETF Thriving?When Did Goldman Sachs Break Out?

All right, not really, but Disney's (DIS) newest addition to the ""Star Wars"" franchise made its entrance Thursday morning in the form of a two-minute teaser trailer, which is sure to get fans frothy with excitement for December.But it is not necessarily expected to do as well as its long-awaited predecessor, ""The Force Awakens,"" which is Disney's highest-grossing film domestically.""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" will be the eighth installment of the space epic and the second one made by Disney, which agreed to buy Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012.Felicity Jones stars as Jyn Erso, a young delinquent tasked with investigating the Empire's new weapon of mass destruction. The prequel takes place prior to the events of the original 1977 film.""A major weapons test is imminent, and we need to know what it is and how to destroy it,"" says Mon Mothma, the original one to utter ""Many Bothans died to bring us this information."" (It should be noted that in ""Return of the Jedi,"" she is referring to plans for the second Death Star, so this is not that mission.)But devoted fans aside -- and there are quite a few -- how will ""Rogue One"" fare at the box office come Dec. 16?""The Force Awakens"" has raked in over $2 billion globally and hit No. 3 on the all-time worldwide box office list. Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said in January that the ""blowout success"" of that film means that the upcoming franchise installments will likely also do well.But ""Rogue One ... will probably not replicate TFA's success due to (1) the lack of returning, high-recognition cast members, and (2) the fact that the film is set just before the events of the original film and thus does not really advance the ongoing multi-generational Skywalker family storyline.""Disney shares closed down 1.35%, dipping below their 50-day line.Meanwhile, Comcast's (CMCSA) Universal Studios Hollywood on Thursday officially opened The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, giving the Southern Californian amusement park a leg up in competing against neighboring Disneyland.Comcast shares fell 1.3%.

563,LEG,"Large-cap stocks moved a couple steps behind their small-cap brethren with an hour left to go in the final trading session of the first quarter. Meanwhile, the big market question was whether Tesla Motors (TSLA) was doing the all-too-familiar dance of ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" ahead of its important Model 3 debut Thursday evening.Regardless of what the market action will look like on Friday, the first trading day of April, the rebound by the leader in all-electric vehicles reflects a renewed mojo for the brand and the stock. Tesla shares gained 3% to 233 in volume that accelerated to more than 30% above its 50-day average of 5.27 million shares. That steamrollers the nearly 0.1% gain by the S&P SmallCap 600 and a decline of 0.3% for the S&P 500, the key benchmark for large-cap names.The Dow Jones industrial average was off nearly 0.2%, but the Dow utilities average continued its outperforming ways, rising 0.3% for a stunning quarter-to-date advance of 15.5%.Tesla looks poised to close above the crucial 200-day moving average for the third time in four sessions. Stocks that hold above their 200- and 50-day lines are not only showing healthy price action, but are also more likely to break out to new highs ahead of their peers.So that said, does Tesla, which is set to enter the more affordable segment of the electric vehicle market, show a leg up on its peers in terms of its technical chart action?Yes. The large-cap name ($31 billion market cap, $4.05 billion in 2015 sales) has rallied to within 17% of its 52-week peak of 286.65. That's still a bit shy of the 5%-to-15% range below the 52-week or all-time high in which great stocks normally complete a base (such as a cup with handle or a double bottom) and break out to new highs.In contrast, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) is slogging 27% below its 52-week peak of 11.13. General Motors (GM) is 16% below its 52-week high, but it's still below the 200-day line. The Chevy Volt maker's Composite Rating is poor at 41. Nissan Motor (NSANY), which sells the all-electric Leaf, lies 15% off its 52-week high, yet the stock too has not been able to reclaim its 200-day moving average.Ferrari (RACE), the Italian legendary racing car company that debuted on the NYSE in October, is 31% off its 60.97 peak.Numerous A-rated funds are big holders of Tesla, ranging from Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) (4.2 million shares as of the end of Q4 2015) to JPMorgan Large Cap Growth (OLGAX) (953,000 shares). In all, 1,052 mutual funds and hedge funds owned Tesla shares as of Dec. 31, 2015, up from 962 funds on March 31 the same year.Tesla's RS Rating is still mediocre yet improving at 49, while the IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now positive at C+, indicating that over the past 13 weeks institutions are net accumulators of the stock.

564,LEG,"Trust: Donald Trump explicitly renounced the pledge he signed at Trump Tower, in the presence of the GOP's chairman, to support whomever the Republican Party nominates. Will America elect a president whose word is valueless?Politicians have been lying since the first caveman ran for the position of chief hunter. But dishonesty today has somehow become easier. Even effortless.Even that disturbing lowering of the standards of public trust, however, has just been, er, trumped. When asked during CNN's Tuesday night Milwaukee town hall, if his pledge to support the Republican nominee still stood, GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump answered, ""No, I don’t anymore,” and later remarked, “I have been treated very unfairly.”Now, it's true that Trump's remaining rivals, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, also failed to offer ringing confirmations of their own less flamboyantly made pledges to support the party nominee, come what may. Kasich was dubious about endorsing a candidate he believed would be ""really hurting the country,"" while Cruz doubted he could back someone who attacked his wife and family. It was obvious that both were referring to Trump.But there is a stark difference to what Trump did. It wasn't a shock, because it was expected -- and maybe because it's impossible to shock in 2016. And how can he be charged with breaking his word when there's no such thing as the quaint concept of someone's word anymore?The Republican nominee of four years ago, Mitt Romney, who was governor of liberal Massachusetts, ended up defending a record of flip-flopping on a great many issues by the time he ran nationally. New York Times columnist William Safire 20 years ago famously called then-First Lady Hillary Clinton ""a congenital liar."" Bob Kerrey, the same year, while he was a Democrat senator from Nebraska, publicly called her husband, then his own party's sitting president, ""an unusually good liar. Unusually good."" The Medal of Honor winner, who lost a leg in Vietnam, then, for emphasis, asked the reporter to whom he was speaking, ""Do you realize that?""The man President Nixon asked amidst Watergate to serve as party chairman, George H.W. Bush, hurt himself, the GOP and the country when he, as president, broke his ""no new taxes"" pledge. ""I'm the one who won't raise taxes,"" he told the Republican convention crowd in New Orleans in 1988, basking in the glow of Ronald Reagan's two terms of success.""My opponent won't rule out raising taxes,"" he said. ""But I will: The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no. And they'll push, and I'll say no. and they'll push again . . . and I'll say to them, 'Read my lips: No new taxes.'""Less than two years later, under pressure from congressional Democrats, he announced ""the need for . . .  tax revenue increases."" Later in the year, he jogged away from a TV camera after quipping, ""Read my hips.""In 1992, Pat Buchanan would use the breaking of the pledge to humiliate the incumbent president with a strong showing in the New Hampshire primary, and Bill Clinton unseated him from the White House that November.All of this has been prelude to Trump. Because of the fact that in the past he has given so much money to liberal Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, and has supported the most extreme big-government schemes, including not just European-style socialized medicine but even a massive tax on assets that smacks of socialism, we must conclude that all he proposes are potentially preemptive lies.""What is truth?"" -- the mysterious question Pilate asked Christ -- should not be the motto of a president of the United States.

Sony is ranked No. 5 out of 10 stocks in IBD's Consumer Products-Electronic industry group. The top stock in the group is Universal Electronics.

Sony expects to have about 50 VR games available by year-end.Sony's VR system is cheaper than PC-connected headsets offered by Facebook's (FB) Oculus and HTC. Sony's headset costs $400 compared with $600 for Oculus Rift and $800 for HTC Vive.Sony has a leg up on its rivals because the PS VR is compatible with the more than 40 million PS4 systems already in consumers' homes. The Oculus and HTC systems require high-end personal computers, which aren't as prevalent.""We believe PS VR has the power to make VR gaming a reality for the mainstream, and the impact that PS VR will have on the future of both games and entertainment will be transformative,"" Shawn Layden, president of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios, said in a statement.Virtual reality systems are designed to make players feel like they are inside the world of a video game by using surround video and audio.Sony's U.S. shares finished 1.7% higher at 33.27 on the stock market today.Upcoming games for the Sony PS VR include ""Resident Evil 7: Biohazard"" from Capcom, ""Star Wars Battlefront: Rogue One X-wing VR Mission"" from Electronic Arts (EA), and ""Star Trek: Bridge Crew"" from Ubisoft.Last week, research firm IHS Markit predicted that Sony will sell 1.4 million PlayStation VR headsets this year, but will be supply constrained.Video game market research firm SuperData Research forecasts that Sony will sell 2.6 million PS VR units by year-end.RELATED:Virtual-Reality Headset Sales To Soar With Sony PlayStation VR Launch
"
567,LEG,"A big question for those venturing into swing trading is how is it different from day trading? A few distinctions have a common theme: time.First, the time frames for holding a trade are different. Day traders are in an out of trades within minutes or hours. They are the 100-meter dash sprinters of the trading world. Swing trading is generally over days or weeks, so they are more like the 800-meter runners.Day traders' shorter time frame means they don't generally hold positions overnight. As a result, they avoid the risk of gaps from news announcements coming in after hours and causing a big move against them. Whether a macroeconomic news item or stock related news, the swing trader does have to be wary that a stock could open significantly different from how it closed the day before. News announcements still come out during the day, which can significantly move stocks, but the day trader is betting on their constant monitoring and quick action to put them a step ahead of the other players.But there is an added risk with the shorter time frame. A wide spread between the bid and the ask and commissions can eat too large a portion of your profits. Swing traders can struggle with this too, but the effect is amplified for the day trader. You can easily find yourself doing all the work and the market makers and brokers are reaping the benefits.To offset this, day traders are often offered the ""opportunity"" to leverage their portfolios with more margin, four times the buying power rather than double. Taking larger leveraged positions can increase percentage gains to offset costs. The problem is that no one is right all the time. A lack of focus, discipline, or just plain bad luck can lead to a trade that goes against you in a big way. A bad trade, or string of bad trades, can blow up your account, where the loss to the portfolio is so great the chances of recovery are slim. For a swing trader, a string of losses or a big loss can still have a dramatic effect, but the lower leverage reduces the likelihood that the results wipe out your portfolio.That leads to another time related difference: the time commitment. Proper day trading requires focus and attention on numerous positions and constantly looking for new potential opportunities throughout the day to replace exited positions. That means it isn't a side job; day trading is your only job.The extra time commitment of day trading comes with its own risk. Not having a steady paycheck makes all your income reliant on your trading success. That can add an extra level of stress and emotions to your trading. More emotions in trading lead to poor decisions.A swing trading style, by contrast, may have a few transactions some days and nothing on others. Positions can be checked periodically or handled with alerts when critical price points are reached rather than the need for constant monitoring.Since IBD launched its SwingTrader product in beta on March 10, there have been 147 trades put on over the last 148 days. That's an average of just under one position a day. The average holding time was 5.2 days per position. Both those factors mean less of a time commitment compared to day trading. IBD's SwingTrader product also saves you time by doing some of the leg work for you, sending alerts and providing research. Free trials are available.RELATED:Swing Trading Strategies And TipsHow To Trade: Margin Accounts Amplify Gains, LossesGaps Can Be Frightening But Also Profitable

568,LEG,"Taking a big step on its path of being a video behemoth that spurs ad revenue, Facebook (FB) on Tuesday boosted the power of Instagram.Users of Instagram will now be able to record videos of up to a minute, vs. its previous load of 15 seconds. The update is available just to a small group to start but that will expand to everyone in the coming months, Instagram said in a blog post.Facebook began offering advertisers on Instagram the freedom to post 60-second ads, up from 30 seconds previously, in February. Facebook derives more than 96% of its total revenue from advertising, with video ads drawing a premium price. More video is now viewed on Facebook than any other system except for the YouTube platform owned by Alphabet (GOOGL).Coming soon: Longer video on Instagram https://t.co/Xt3hIxnL1M— Instagram (@instagram) March 29, 2016Facebook does not break out Instagram revenue, but analysts estimate that its sales could top $1 billion this year. Analysts have kept a close watch on Instagram as a key revenue-growth leg for the social media leader. Facebook and Instagram are the company's two most important mobile ad platforms, company executives say.Facebook has always closely monitored user engagement and satisfaction before expanding ads. Allowing users to now post 60-second videos on Instagram should enable Facebook to closely monitor and analyze how active and engaged viewers are with longer-form video on the Instagram platform. The time that people spent watching video on Instagram has increased more than 40% in the last six months, Instagram said in a blog post announcing the video expansion.Facebook began testing ads on Instagram about three years ago. One month ago Facebook announced it now has more than 200,000 advertisers on Instagram.Facebook competes with Apple (AAPL), Alphabet, Microsoft (MSFT), Twitter (TWTR) and others to attract more advertisers.Instagram is one of multiple growth engines that Facebook can accelerate.They include Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. While Instagram has more than 400 million users, WhatsApp has about 900 million users and Messenger more than 800 million. Facebook is in position to make its widely popular Messenger platform an all-in-one tool that could include a partnership or a battle with Apple and its Apple Pay system.Image provided by Shutterstock.

569,LEG,"Identifying a stock's buy point on a chart is often a straightforward endeavor.Recognizing a cup-with-handle buy point (10 cents above the high of the handle) or flat-base buy point (10 cents above the high of the left side of the base) isn't tough, as long as it's a sound base. Earlier, more aggressive entry points, are also possible.When it comes to the double-bottom pattern, learning to recognize a Shakeout + 3 setup can help get you into a potential leader before it crosses a conventional buy point. The pattern was discovered by Jesse Livermore in his book ""How To Trade In Stocks.""Livermore was a legendary trader in the early 20th century, perhaps best known for making and losing four stock market fortunes, each running into the millions of dollars at the time -- a huge sum now and an even bigger sum back then.To recognize the Shakeout + 3, you first have to know what a proper double-bottom pattern looks like. The double-bottom looks like the letter W. There are two legs down in the pattern, and it's important that the second leg down undercut the first so that sellers get adequately shaken out of the stock.The conventional buy point comes when the stock starts to rally after the second leg down. The entry is when the stock crosses above the middle peak in between the two down legs. Add 10 cents and there's your buy point. The Shakeout + 3 pattern also comes when a stock starts to rally after the second leg has formed. The buy point is derived by adding three points to the low of the first pullback. So if the first low was 27, add 3 points to get a correct entry at 30. Note that adding three points generally applies only to stocks that are trading in the 20-40 range. Always demand strong volume when a stock clears the proper buy point.With higher-priced stocks, it's prudent to add more than three points to the first low. A general rule of thumb to follow is to add around 10% to the price of the stock. If the stock is priced at 60, you can added five or six points to the low to get the buy point. For a stock that trades at 100 or more, adding 8 to 10 points should suffice.At the start of the 1990s bull market, Cisco Systems (CSCO) set up in a bullish double-bottom base. It also yielded an early Shakeout + 3 entry. It hit a low of 22 during its first leg down on Aug. 23, 1990, then rallied back to a high of 27 almost four weeks later. The next leg down saw Cisco hit a low of 19.75. It undercut the first low, resulting in a good shakeout.When the stock started to rally again, astute investors could have begun buying shares at the Shakeout + 3  buy point of 25 (3 points added to the first low of 22). Cisco cleared the entry on Oct. 18, one day before it gapped over the traditional double-bottom entry of 27.10 (10 cents above the high of the middle part of the W). Cisco rallied 143% by February 1991 before building a new base.

570,LEG,"Breakouts don’t always work the way an investor would prefer.Ideally, you want to see steady gains after a breakout. When a stock rolls over after a breakout, it’s easy to close the position and then forget about the “loser” stock.Yet, sometimes a loser is a winner that just needs to foul off a few of the market’s pitches before connecting for a long drive.The individual investor needs to stay awake and alert after an apparent failure. The stock could form a base-on-base pattern.The base on base’s story runs like this: A stock creates and breaks out of a base. After rising modestly, the stock retreats and forms a second base on top of the first base.The overall pattern might look like two ladles with the second hung a little higher than the first.Often the lows of the second ladle are at or near the highs of the first.A base-on-base pattern is often the depiction of a strong stock fighting weak market conditions. IBD founder William O’Neil describes it this way in “How to Make Money in Stocks”:“What happens is that a powerful stock breaks out of its base and advances, but is unable to increase a normal 20% to 30% because the general market begins another leg down. The stock therefore pulls back in price and builds a second back-and-forth price consolidation area just on top of its previous base while the general market averages keep making new lows.“When the bearish phase in the overall market ends ... this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain.”On Sept. 3, 1999, Oracle (ORCL) broke out in heavy volume (please see a daily chart). The buy point was 39.91 (before a pair of 2-for-1 splits taking place in 2000). The Composite Rating was 97. The industry group rating was A.The market was doing well. On the same day as Oracle’s breakout, the Nasdaq surged 4% in heavier trade. But it didn’t last, and the Nasdaq delivered four distribution days over the next three weeks.Oracle stumbled with the market. The tech stock also delivered quarterly results that only matched views. The Street was hoping for better. Oracle slipped.The stock then shaped a base on base. The base showed positive characteristics.

Why do you focus on just your 40 best ideas?Rao: We don't think there are that many great ideas at any point in time. I take my cue from Warren Buffett, who called diversification ""di-worsification."" He said you should know your ideas one to 10 better than ideas 70 through 80. And ideas one through 10 should have more conviction.For us, 40 is a naturally comfortable level in terms of having the ability to know the companies we invest in.IBD: Does concentration entail a greater risk of volatility?Schommer: I wouldn't say it that strongly. We help to manage volatility by holding different buckets of growth stocks.IBD: How do stocks in each bucket differ?Schommer: Seventy percent to 80% of our portfolio is in compound growth companies. Those are companies with well-defined competitive moats, which have years of growth ahead of them, high earnings visibility and lower risk. They trade at a slight premium to the market but have much better growth.Ten percent to 15% is in blue-sky companies. Those are growth companies that have less well-defined competitive moats than compound-growth stocks. But we expect blue-sky companies to solidify their moats and graduate into compound-growth companies. They have big opportunities. But we make their positions small to manage risk.The third bucket holds special situation stocks. These are future compound growth stocks. Meanwhile, there is a business issue or a financial leverage issue that the company has to execute against. For example, GE over the past year has been divesting its GE Capital business. It hasn't been very attractive, but GE has been reinvesting in its (remaining industrial, nonfinancial) business and returning capital to shareholders. One of the keys to the success of blue-sky and special-situation companies is that they have to graduate into being compound growth companies. That's what we want with GE.IBD: What other key traits do stocks in each bucket share?Rao: We start with the same filter: Does the company have a competitive advantage? Do we believe it is sustainable? Whichever bucket a stock is in, we look at that the same way.IBD: What percent of blue-sky and special-situation companies do graduate?Rao: I'd guess about 65%. Maybe 75%.IBD: The fund was in the top 2% of its Morningstar large-cap growth category in 2015. This year it's more middle of the pack. Why has this year been more challenging?Schommer: In general, the market this year rewarded lower volatility sectors, areas without a lot of growth, sectors where naturally we tend to (take a pass on investing). The sectors that were rewarded this year were consumer staples, utilities and energy. Those tend to be sectors that are not large positions in the portfolio.Those companies may meet our business-model hurdle, but not a lot of them meet our growth hurdle. And now, particularly, they are not attractive from a valuation perspective.The market has treated them as income substitutes and given them premium valuations due to low yields in fixed income. We have instead focused on investments like Zoetis (ZTS), an animal health care company that has characteristics similar to a consumer staples company but with better growth prospects and a more reasonable starting valuation.Energy is another area that has been a good performer this year after a difficult 2015. There are a limited number of energy companies that meet our business model criteria. Most are price-takers tied to the commodity price.IBD: You've slightly trimmed your stake in Facebook. What are your concerns?Rao: It's hard to talk about it without talking about Google (GOOGL) (Alphabet). Both have become dominant platforms for advertising dollars shifting from traditional channels to digital.The reason Facebook has been so effective in monetizing these digital advertising dollars is that they have high consumer usage of their properties. (Chief Operating Officer Sheryl) Sandberg and her team, under the leadership of CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have done a good job of pivoting the company away from being desktop-computer-based to being one of the dominant app providers on a global basis outside China.With WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook itself, the consumer is engaged with it to such an extent that advertising dollars move there.IBD: Which bucket is Boston Scientific in?Rao: It's in compound-growth. We bought it maybe two years ago. It started as a special situation. It had a fairly significant legal overhang with Johnson & Johnson suing them for $5 billion or $6 billion.We thought the case was questionable. They brought in a new CEO named Mike Mahoney, who had been at Johnson & Johnson. He came in to reinvigorate their cardiology franchise, which had missed a product cycle. He felt there was a pipeline there that needed to be pushed toward commercialization. The market was concerned with the litigation and factoring little growth for their cardiology products.Soon, they settled the Johnson & Johnson suit for about $1 billion. They've accelerated revenue growth and their margin growth, which had been half their competitors'. They've closed the gap. Execution has been fantastic. We expect more.IBD: Why is Activision Blizzard another position you've increased?Rao: This was another special situation. They bought King Digital, which had the popular Candy Crush game. But the market soured on King after it went public.CEO Bobby Kotick has made a number of strategic pivots. The King acquisition got them into mobile. They've gone from being a company serving 60 million to 70 million consumers through desktops and consoles to serving 500 million consumers... Another 1 billion-plus people watch those games played.Also, they've transitioned more to digital downloads than (dependence on customers) buying a console. That removes the middle man, so Activision's margins become higher.But it's still a special situation because mobile users from the King acquisition have been shrinking. We would like top see them re-engage those consumers.IBD: Amazon (AMZN) has gone up and down in size in the portfolio. Why is that?Rao: We had reduced exposure at the end of last year. They had a disappointing Q4 announcement in January, and the stock got punished. We added back after it sank dramatically.Amazon is the dominant player in e-commerce, and e-commerce as a percentage of retail sales continues to increase. And as Amazon continues to deliver faster fulfillment times, it will gain market share.Another leg of the stool is Amazon Web Services. This gets us to the idea of investing with owner-operators. In 2014, many people saw AWS as a money pit. Fast forward to today, most analysts see its worth as over $100 billion. Microsoft is doing a nice job in web services, but AWS is the dominant provider. Everyone from the CIA to GE is moving more of their business onto AWS. You don't have to have an electricity plant at your house. So why do you need your own data center?IBD: Celgene (CELG) is yet another company in which you've built your stake. What's your thesis?Rao: We reduced our position in the middle of last year. Then this year it went down about 35% from its high in mid-2015. Our analysts felt confident that it was trading at a big discount to our view of its intrinsic value.IBD: Did you trim your Priceline (PCLN) stake because slow global growth means less travel?Rao: This is another business that benefits from network effects. Their core business is Booking.com, which is hotel booking for Europe. They have a similar business in Asia called Agoda. We reduced it given its exposure to Europe and terrorist attacks and higher levels of management turnover than we were comfortable with.IBD: You've also trimmed NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). What are your concerns?Schommer: It's in special situations because it was the merger of two leading semiconductor companies, Freescale and NXP. They are the No. 1 or 2 in their end markets, which gives them a disproportionate share of profits in those lines. And they can invest more in R&D than competitors.But after the merger, the financial leverage of the business increased to a level that was above normalized operating levels. So part of why it is a special situation is that we're watching for reducing the balance sheet to a more comfortable level.IBD: Adobe (ADBE) is another trim. What's your thesis?Rao: They were one of the first to transition from selling software in shrink-wrap to a subscription model. The transition was to a much larger market. But in the transition, revenues and margins declined.We trimmed because the company has largely made the transition to a subscription business and the market is now rewarding them for this higher quality revenue.RELATED:This Top Fund Manager Likes Three Types Of Growth StocksWhat To Do When Your Fund Gets A New ManagerMutual Fund Awards 2016: Top U.S. Equities Funds

576,LEG,"Citigroup (C) became the second of the four largest U.S. banks to face calls for its breakup -- not from Sen. Bernie Sanders or similar quarters, but from business analysts.The New York-based bank would provide ""meaningful shareholder value"" by splitting up because the current regulatory environment makes it difficult to provide higher returns, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a research note.The KBW analysts argued that a three-step breakup -- selling off Citi's Mexico business, jettisoning its non-Mexico global consumer unit and splitting what's left into a U.S.-based consumer business and global corporate bank -- would deliver a cumulative sales gain and market value of roughly $198 billion, or a 57% increase from current levels.""We fully believe that regulators are more than comfortable having capital build at the largest banks, and adding (global banking) surcharges into the stress-test process will be the next leg up in capital requirements,"" wrote KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl in Sunday's research note.As banks have been forced to adhere to strict capital rules after the financial crisis, their revenue and share prices have suffered. Citigroup shares have fallen 16% so far this year, though they ticked up 0.1% on the stock market today.Citigroup has struggled in recent years, not only to boost shareholder value but also to pass the Federal Reserve's stress tests. Citi passed last year but failed the year before, its second stress test failure overall.Last year, Goldman Sachs analysts said that JPMorgan Chase (JPM) -- the nation's largest bank -- likely also would benefit from a breakup.KBW argued that General Electric’s (GE) decision to wind down its GE Capital unit, which once provided more than 40% of its profits, led to increased capital return and improved valuation multiples.Besides Sanders' constant campaign calls to break up big banks, Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, who oversaw the bank bailouts during the crisis, last month called for banks to be broken up.

577,LEG,"If you ever need proof of how traditional market forces can get turned upside down, look no further than the auto parts retail sector, where leaders like O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) continue to churn out strong financial and share price growth despite what would normally be a big threat to business.Normally, one would think auto parts retailers would worry in the wake of last year's robust market for new car sales. In the past, a rise in new car sales would have been bad news for the aftermarket auto parts business. New cars require less maintenance and repair work than older ones, meaning there is less demand for the kind of parts and services supplied by O’Reilly, as well as rivals such as AutoZone (AZO), Advance Auto Parts (AAP) and Genuine Parts (GPC).But that dynamic no longer applies, analysts say.""The kinds of things that benefit new vehicle sales -- an improving economy, improving employment, higher income -- also benefit the auto parts sector,"" CRT Capital Group analyst Ali Faghri told IBD.The figures might seem daunting. In 2015, the U.S. auto industry posted sales of 17.5 million light vehicles, according to the Automotive News Data Center, breaking the previous record of 17.4 million set in 2000 and marking a 5.7% increase from 2014.But a rise in new car sales doesn’t necessarily mean older cars end up at the junkyard. Thanks to advances in technology, cars last much longer nowadays.So when someone buys a new car, chances are his old car will be resold instead of junked. It’s not unusual for vehicles with 120,000 miles or more to make their way onto used car lots.This trend has led to an ever-aging fleet of cars in the U.S. The average age of cars on the road is a record 11.5 years, according to industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to creep up to 11.6 years in 2016.The obvious benefit to auto parts retailers is that as cars get older, they require more replacement parts, as well as repair and maintenance services. This feeds demand for the industry’s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics; as well as the ""Do-It-For-Me"" segment that targets professional technicians and installers.The sector has also gotten a lift from the improving economy and job market, which have given many consumers more cash to spend on replacement parts and repairs.Meanwhile, O’Reilly and its peers have benefited from lower gasoline prices, which encourage people to drive more.""Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled -- leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales -- and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,"" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a research report to clients.It all adds up to a robust market for O’Reilly. The company’s stock price trades near 269 and has been creeping back up toward the high of 277.96 set in late October. Shares have risen about 6% since the beginning of the year.Financially, O’Reilly is in the midst of a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth, helped by a stock repurchase program that began more than four years ago. Revenue has risen in double digits the last four quarters.The company earned $2.19 a share during the 2015 fourth quarter. That was up 24% from the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Revenue gained 10% to $1.95 billion, slightly above views. Comparable-store sales increased 7.7% vs. a 6.3% rise during the third quarter.""Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable-store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher,"" O’Reilly Chief Executive Greg Henslee said on a conference call with analysts. ""For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O’Reilly to grow full-year EPS 16% in 2016 and another 13% in 2017.For all of 2015, O’Reilly’s comparable-store sales rose 7.5% -- the biggest annual gain since it grew comps 8.8% in 2010. O’Reilly opened 209 stores in 2015, bringing the total store count to 4,571 at year's end. It plans to open another 210 stores this year.""DIY market share gains have accelerated, and this is adding a new leg to same store-sales growth, which could lead to earnings upside,"" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a report.Many of those market share gains have come at the expense of Advance Auto, he says, especially in East Coast markets.Because the fourth quarter includes parts of the winter season -- when cars tend to undergo more wear and tear -- O’Reilly and other parts retailers benefit when the weather is severe. That wasn’t the case during much of the 2015 fourth quarter, however.""While O’Reilly noted that its retail business suffered slightly in November due to abnormally warm weather, pressuring demand for products like anti-freeze, it successfully captured this demand in December as temperatures fell,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a report. ""Management believes winter weather has been fairly neutral to its business.""

578,LEG,"“It’s not a government takeover of the Internet.” That was the mantra of those who backed the Federal Communication Commission’s “net neutrality” rules, which the FCC approved a little over a year ago.“Not only are the new rules not a government takeover,” argued one supporter in Variety, “they are well in keeping with how communications have been successfully fostered and regulated in America in the past.”The rules were only meant to keep the Internet “free and open,” advocates said. All the government was doing was blocking ISPs from discriminating against users by charging more for faster speeds.But to impose “net neutrality,” the FCC reclassified the Internet so that it could regulate it in the same way it regulated the telephone monopolies. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler promised that -- despite the fact the FCC had just granted itself wide-ranging control over ISPs -- it would use a “light touch” when it came to regulating ISPs.But now, 12 months later, the FCC tipped its heavy hand with a proposal for a new set of regulations that could, as the Morning Consult put it, “reshape the tech industry.”The proposed new rules don’t have anything to do with “net neutrality.” They are about privacy. Now that the FCC can do so, Chairman Tom Wheeler has decided that the government should impose what it determines are the appropriate privacy protections on all Internet service providers.On the surface, the purpose of the rules seems perfectly reasonable. “Consumers should have effective control over how their personal information is used and shared by their broadband service providers,” Wheeler says.In practice, however, it would anything but simple or straightforward.As the Morning Consult notes, “the impact of new FCC rules on the industry would be huge.”For one thing, a new set of FCC rules would conflict with long-standing privacy rules set by the Federal Trade Commission. Data-hogging websites sites wouldn’t have to comply with the stricter FCC rules.In a letter to the FCC, various “consumer advocacy” groups said those FTC rules aren’t good enough, and want the commission to “exercise the full extent of its rule-making authority to protect consumer privacy.”Industry groups say the result would be “regulatory chaos” as businesses try to figure out what rules apply where.The point is that anyone who thought the FCC had finished its work when it imposed “net neutrality” is sorely mistaken. The commission’s privacy rules will only be the first of many as regulators flex their newly acquired Internet muscles and as advocacy groups, well-connected businesses, or anyone looking to get a regulatory leg up on the competition will be pressuring the commission to add new rules, always wrapped in a “good for the consumer” package.Further intrusion into the ISP world will only worsen the damage already being done by the FCC’s decision to treat the 21st century Internet like a 20th century telephone monopoly.As FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai explained in a recent speech at the Heritage Foundation, in just the first year, “growth in broadband investment has flat-lined,” and smaller ISPs “have reduced investment in the communities they serve.” As an example, he noted that Verizon (VZ) recently decided to acquire AOL for $4.4 billion because “it made more sense than increasing fiber deployment.”Pai, who fiercely opposed the FCC’s actions, says home broadband adoption has declined for the first time “since the advent of the commercial Internet.”He notes that the rule is hampering innovative services like T-Mobile’s (TMUS) Binge On program, which lets customers stream videos without it counting against their data usage. Despite the obvious consumer benefit, the FCC thinks Binge On might violate the government’s new Internet “conduct standard,” and so has opened an investigation.“At least three other companies have received similar treatment,” Pai noted.Pai and others had warned about all these outcomes from the get go. Those who are surprised by the FCC’s actions over the past year have only themselves to blame.

579,LEG,"Few things feel as homey and comfortable to chart readers of the CAN SLIM ilk as cup-with-handle bases.Cup-with-handle bases are common and easy to identify, and often preface powerful rallies. Most cup bases possess a number of basic traits, discussed in Tuesday's column.  They can be as short as seven weeks long. But they are generally longer -- occasionally reaching lengths of a year or more.This time frame can make even a common, familiar base type tricky to spot. The tendency among growth investors is to set aside leading stocks that slump into long-term consolidations. Many of them take years to recover. Others never do.One recent example of a long-term cup was Dollar General (DG), which cleared an eight-month cup with handle on Thursday. Lululemon Athletica (LULU), on the other hand, has been struggling to clear a buy point in a similar, six-month base.A model case was Biogen (BIIB), which crafted a cup-with-handle base throughout most of 2010, when it was called Biogen Idec.The base began late in March. Seven of 12 weeks on its down leg were weekly declines in above-average volume. Yet this action showed institutional investors selling in a controlled rather than panicked fashion. Six of seven weeks on the upside were advances, and four of them occurred in above-average trade. During the last two, trade rose 46% and 57%, respectively, above Biogen’s weekly average.Both of those weeks closed below the midpoint of their weekly ranges. This activity raises a warning flag. But unless other flaws appear, it is not a deal killer for a base. The depth of the base was 24%, well within the 35% maximum limit from intraday high to low for normal cups.The right side of the cup topped out in the weeks that ended July 30 and Aug. 13, 2010. In both weeks, the stock notched a high of 58.16. The handle slipped 9% lower in quiet trade, retesting its converging 10- and 40-week moving averages.A burst of heavy trade shook out the final sellers and left the stock perched atop its 10-week moving average in the week that ended Sept. 24. Biogen traded quietly for a few more weeks. On the day of its breakout past a 58.26 buy point, Biogen held a 92 Composite Rating from IBD. Its EPS Rating was a powerful 96, and its RS rating -- despite nearly seven months of basing -- was an imperfect but still healthy 81. Its Sales, Margins and Return on Equity grade was an A, Accumulation/Distribution a B+.The outcome: a 725% rally over the next 53 months.

580,LEG,"Top-performing organizations and individuals demand the best of themselves and use smart practices to ensure that they get it.They always see opportunities, giving them a leg up in tough economic times because “they know their competitors will hunker down, go MIA to the customer, thus leaving them unguarded and open to switching,” said Jeffrey Fox, author of “How to Be a Fierce Competitor: What Winning Companies and Great Managers Do in Tough Times.”He’s found that such companies “relentlessly, legally and appropriately work in all ways, every single day, to get and keep profitable customers, and never stop innovating.”Tips on keeping your foot on the gas pedal for a smooth ride:Seed financial precipitation. Fox, who is also the founder of Fox & Co., a marketing consultant, says only 5% to 10% of all corporate salespeople are rainmakers. These devotees to cash deluges rain down the most gross margin dollars.""While every company should want rainmakers, too many organizations look down on salespeople, thinking they are a lower class of employee,"" Fox told IBD. “Fierce competitor companies totally understand that nothing happens until the cash register rings and are willing to invest the time and money to recruit, pay and train rainmakers.”Cultivate expertise. The highest return on investment comes from training, Fox says. The cost is comparatively small and can lead to huge advances.Fox offers these examples:Teaching a salesperson how to overcome a price objection reduces discounting and increases net operating profit.Training an assembly worker how to clean a printed circuit board properly reduces or eliminates reworks, product returns and warranty claims.“Managers should be constantly training, educating, showing, demonstrating,” he emphasized.Assess people properly. Andy Glockner, author of “Chasing Perfection: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the High-Stakes Game of Creating an NBA Champion,” says that while there’s no better investment for an organization than smart, driven, well-connected employees, “it's equally important for a business to have the processes in place to properly evaluate them as they do their jobs.”Know who is growing and getting better, who is stagnating and who isn’t reaching their potential.Evolve. One of the reasons a winning company can be toppled by a new one armed with new technology is because the older one will not change, Fox has found.“The older company’s culture is built on what made the company originally successful,” he said. ""The changing business environment includes government regulations, consumer demographics, technology and competitor shifts.”Be ready to read and react.Scrutinize data. New technology has brought analytics to the fingertips of National Basketball Association team executives, Glockner points out. This has led to “massive changes to the way basketball players are sourced and developed, and how teams are constructed and maintained. The smartest teams are able to absorb all of this newfound data and create and communicate plans across their organization to implement strategies to benefit from them.”He notes that while analytics aren't a magic salvation, when you see the teams most deeply invested in them “consistently making the playoffs and pushing for championships, you can't help but suspect that it's all connected in a positive way.“Analytics don't make for a smart team, but smart teams make analytics an important part of their overarching philosophy.”Create an identity. Have a clear vision of what you are and what you want to be as an organization, Glockner says. That top-end vision “will drive your other key decisions like hiring practices, infrastructure investments and development."" The franchises that struggle in the NBA are those that “have unstable management teams and philosophies, from the owner on down.”Stay positive. A winning culture is a sustaining factor for business success. It’s a “company’s immune system,” Fox said. “It keeps germs out and rejects antigens within. Work every day to protect and burnish a winning culture.”Push the envelope. Regardless of what the situation may be, said Fox, “the facts are indisputable: Those companies who outsell, out-hustle, out-innovate, out-promote their competitors always emerge … in a stronger share and profit position.”
"
581,LEG,"New exchange enrollment data released by the Obama administration on Friday reveal in multiple ways that ObamaCare is failing to live up to its goal of providing affordable care.That's no small problem when the law mandates that people buy coverage or face a fine. The fact that enrollment grew only modestly in the law's third year despite the ramping up of the mandate penalty underscores the reality that ObamaCare only offers poor options to far too many millions of people.No one is getting a worse deal than the people of Mississippi. Despite the fact that the state ranked near the bottom last year with enrollment of just 38% of those eligible for subsidies, the number of people signing up for subsidized exchange plans in 2016 was virtually flat from a year ago (97,943 vs 97,606 in 2015).IBD predicted last fall that Mississippi would be ""ground zero for ObamaCare's individual mandate"" because stagnant state sign-ups looked like a sure bet with after-subsidy premiums set to jump on the order of 60%, far more than in any of the 36 other states using HealthCare.gov last year.For 30-year-olds in Yazoo City earning about $25,000 (214% of the poverty level), the after-subsidy cost of the cheapest bronze plan spiked by about $550 to just under $1,500, or 6% of pay. Because this plan from Ambetter, a unit of Centene (CNC), covers little before the $6,800 deductible is met, it may make the $695 mandate tax look like the best among bad options for someone who isn't expecting big medical bills.It's becoming clear that millions of working-class Americans face a choice between paying a penalty they surely can’t afford and buying a policy — if they can foot the bill — that may still wreck their finances if they land in the hospital.While this reality is pretty pervasive, it's especially harsh in some areas, Mississippi and Washington state among them, partly due to competitive pricing decisions made by Centene. While the cheapest bronze-plan premium (before subsidies) rose about $250 in Mississippi for a $25,000-earner, the subsidy fell $300, yielding the $550 increase. That came about because the subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan, and Centene cornered the market on low-cost plans in a number of states this year by attaching bronze-like deductibles ($5,500 and $6,500) to silver plans.Centene took the same tack in Washington state, with a similar result. This year, Washington's exchange signed up 140,000 people for subsidized plans. At first blush, the 10.5% growth over last year's 126,650 total looks good, but it's deceptive because last year, unlike this year, the state only counted paid enrollment. Once nonpayers are scrubbed from the total, the number of subsidized customers in 2016 may end up being equal to, perhaps even lower than, last year's.Centene, along with other Medicaid managed care players like Molina Health (MOH), moved into the individual market with the launch of ObamaCare and has been credited with navigating the market more adeptly than bigger players such as UnitedHealth (UNH).Still, Centene's subsidy-squeezing shift isn't widespread yet. Overall, the average HealthCare.gov subsidy rose 10.3% to $290 per month from $263 a year ago, as the average share of premiums paid by those eligible for subsidies rose just under 5%, to $106 a month from $101.The Department of Health and Human Services also revealed that the exchanges ended 2015 with just under 8.8 million paid enrollees nationwide, down 25% from the 11.7 million sign-ups to start the year. As of last March, once the unpaid total was culled, there were 10.2 million members.The data also indicate that the paid ObamaCare insurance pool gets older as the year progresses. Among the 5.6 million people who renewed their HealthCare.gov coverage this year (out of 6.3 million who held policies at year-end), just 1.35 million, or 24%, were in age 18 to 34. That's down from a 28% young-adult share of sign-ups in the 2015 enrollment period.It's worth recalling that the Obama administration and Kaiser Family Foundation both set a target of about 2.8 million young-adult enrollees in ObamaCare's first year, or roughly 40% of the total, in keeping with the young-adult share of the eligible population. It's clear that the exchanges ended the second year far below that initial target, with as few as 2.1 million 18- to 34-year-olds.  This year, 3.5 million of the 12.7 million sign-ups are age 18 to 34, though it remains to be seen how many fail to pay or later exit the exchanges if they get workplace insurance.A higher share of young adults could help keep down premiums because, under ObamaCare's age-rating limit, younger people are charged more than their expected cost to restrain premiums for older adults. This helps turn ObamaCare's market upside-down relative to pre-2014 markets, with a bronze plan now costing $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if both earn $25,000.Still, there is some evidence in the new data that the higher individual mandate penalty may be convincing people to enroll. About 38% of the additional sign-ups compared to a year ago chose bronze or catastrophic plans. Generally, people who are signing up to avoid a penalty can be expected to lean toward the cheapest plan available.The number of people with subsidized coverage via HealthCare.gov rose just 6.1% from a year ago. While a clear assessment won't be possible until we know how many people actually pay for their coverage, the weak sign-up total has left ObamaCare in much the same place that it was a year ago.Millions of people are benefiting from the exchanges, especially near-poor households that qualify for the most generous subsidies and people with pre-existing conditions that no longer have to pay an arm and a leg. But likely fewer than 1 in 3 people with income from 150% to 250% of the poverty level are now getting silver coverage that will protect their finances if they land in the hospital. The vast majority even in this modest-income group either have high-deductible bronze coverage, remain uninsured or are ineligible because they, or a spouse, work full-time for an employer who offers insurance — even if that insurance is far from affordable.

The MSCI All-Country World Index has declined almost 1% including reinvested dividends.""That tells me the problems out of China are really significant, and they aren't going away,"" said Guy Haselmann, an interest-rate strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York, a primary dealer.Haselmann said he thinks that will support Treasuries, and predicted that the yield on the 10-year note will fall below 2% in the next few months.The probability that the Fed will raise interest rates at this month's meeting is 2%, rising to 74% by year-end, based on futures data compiled by Bloomberg.Treasury will sell $35 billion of five-year securities Wednesday, as well as $29 billion in seven-year securities the following day.

"
628,LEG,"The 50-day and 200-day moving averages get a lot of attention and often are the most widely used for spotting key sell signals. Investors should also get to know the 10-day moving average, as it too can generate sell signals. Please note: This tool should be used only for short-term traders, who tend to be more active with entering and exiting trades.
"
629,LEG,"Short-term traders are focused on capturing smaller moves, and thus they will not give a stock as much wiggle room as traders that hold on to positions for weeks to months or even longer.
"
630,LEG,"Here are some sell rules in which to apply the 10-day line. Rule 1: Sell if the stock makes its first clean break below the 10-day moving average after gaining 20% to 25% from a base breakout.
"
631,LEG,"This makes sense; many stocks correct after rising 20%-25% from a breakout. But note that this is a more aggressive exit signal. You're not giving the stock much leeway to do any more wrong after a period of strength. Sometimes, investors can use the break of the line as a sell signal even though the gain didn't hit 20% to 25%.
"
632,LEG,"On the plus side, you'll be able to keep more gains if the stock starts a deep pullback after breaking below the line. During its advance, some stocks will trend above the 10-day moving average. Sometimes the breach of the line marks a change in the strength of the trend.
"
633,LEG,"But other times, a move below the 10-day moving average won't be too serious. It will just give the stock a chance to digest gains, setting for the next leg up. There is always a trade-off when it comes to trading.
"
634,LEG,"Rule 2: Sell if a stock takes out its 10-day moving average after posting a double-digit gain. The kicker to this is that it only applies if the market outlook, as noted in the daily Big Picture column (today on B3), gets downgraded to ""Uptrend under pressure"" or ""Market in correction.""
"
635,LEG,"Again, this is more of a cautionary sell signal. But recall that the M in CAN SLIM stands for the market, which can have a big effect on how your stock trades. A strong uptrend will act as a tailwind and carry most stocks higher, whereas a harsh downtrend will push many issues lower.

The line is also available on Leaderboard and MarketSmith charts. But both require separate subscriptions.GrubHub (GRUB), a wild new issue from 2014, formed a cup-with-handle base with a 41.85 buy point earlier this year. Price action wasn't exactly tight, but new issues tend to be more volatile.The stock cleared the 41.85 trigger Feb. 25 in double its average trade. GrubHub rallied 15% by March 31, but it also staged a big downside reversal that day. The next day, April 1, the stock sliced its 10-day line (1).Although it bounced back after that, a sell-off breached the 50-day moving average and erased the entire gain from the 41.85 entry, triggering two more sell signals (2).

691,LEG,"Some investors building equity income portfolios seek out ETFs holding big dividend payers. Others focus on exchange traded funds that consistently grow dividends. But what's more important than high yields or dividend growth?A stable income stream, says a leading ETF expert.""After all, investors looking to these funds as a source of cash flow would be disappointed to find that their income stream is volatile,"" said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar.Johnson recently studied 11 dividend ETF strategies that focus on U.S. large caps.Of these, the five that screened stocks for steadily paying or growing dividends also generated stable income vs. their peers. Their ""dividend drawdown"" — the year-on-year decline in annual dividend payment — was relatively muted even in 2009, post-financial crisis.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), the $20.71 billion bellwether ETF, counts IBM (IBM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) among its top three holdings. The stocks are classic income plays. J&J earns the most stable possible IBD Dividend Stability Factor: 0. IBM has a DSF of 1. The score shows how stable a firm's dividend history is over a five-year period. A lower number means a more stable history.First Trust Value Line Dividend (FVD), with $1.2 billion in assets, holds furniture maker Leggett & Platt (LEG). The stock has a DSF of 0.PowerShares Dividend Achievers (PFM) has $343.5 million in assets and big stakes in J&J and IBM, as well as Altria Group (MO). The tobacco firm has a DSF of 1.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), with $13.62 billion in assets, holds Johnson & Johnson, Leggett & Platt and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) among its top 25 holdings. The Huggies maker has a DSF of 1.The 12-month yield of these four ETFs ranges from 1.95% for PFM to 2.25% for SDY. But when comparing dividend funds, investors who look at yield in isolation may be running a risk.Yield can be volatile over time. WisdomTree Equity Income (DHS) yielded roughly 10.3% in February 2008. It yields 2.9% today.""Some ETPs (exchange traded products) are clearly taking on more risk than others when they go about building an income-oriented portfolio,"" Johnson said.For less volatile yields, he said, ""It's important to look for funds that track benchmarks which incorporate some sort of (dividend) sustainability screen.""He added: ""Investors should place a premium on income stability, particularly in bear markets .""Dividend Yield Vs. GrowthDividend growth provides a historical context for yields. Investors in ETFs with growing dividends have a better shot at a cash stream that beats the rate of inflation over time.VIG screens for stocks that have increased their dividend for at least 10 consecutive years. It has an 0.1% expense ratio, the lowest among dividend-focused ETFs.SDY looks for stocks that have raised their dividends for the past 20 consecutive years. It has a 0.35% expense ratio, or $35 in fees for every $10,000 invested.VIG was up 1.4% year to date as of Wednesday. It produced an annual average 14.3% gain in the past five years, as opposed to 0.8% and 15% for SDY over those same periods.

Thirty-year bonds led the gains as yields close to the highest levels since October reignited demand with the outlook for inflation subdued. Treasuries were supported as reports showed existing-home sales were lower than forecast and Americans' expectations for the economy slumped in May by the most since October 2013.""We had poor data today — that's what's driving this thing,"" said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government-debt trading at R.W.

It may even start rallying in heavy volume from there, but even if that happens, it doesn't mean that the stock is buyable.""Overhead supply"" is a big obstacle when a stock bottoms out and tries to form the right side of a base. When the stock rallies back, those who bought on the way down are often tempted to sell to break even on their investment.That's why heavy-volume gains are good to see when a stock builds the right side of base. The buying demand must be strong enough to offset overhead supply issues and launch the breakout.After a nice run-up, Acuity Brands (AYI) consolidated gains in 2011. Seeing a base taking shape, eager buyers may have bought when the stock surged 7% in heavy volume during the week ending April 1 (1). Weekly volume exploded to 3.5 million shares, well above its average at the time of 1.9 million shares. It wasn't a breakout, though. The stock stopped just short of a 60.83 buy point. So the buy was premature.Acuity went on to rally less than 1% past the buy point before it started moving sideways again. Another flat base formed with a new buy point at 61.55. Current stockholders were hoping for another breakout attempt while others may have bought early during the second consolidation.A breakout never materialized from the second pattern. Acuity tried in the week ended June 3 but reversed (2). Acuity slumped as much as 46% from its high before bottoming in October.

743,LEG,"Vice President Joe Biden gives weekly remarksLadies and Gentlemen, this is Joe Biden and I’m here filling in for President Obama, who is traveling abroad.And I’m here with a simple message: middle-class economics works. Our economy has gone from crisis to recovery to now to resurgence—with the longest streak of consecutive job growth ever recorded in the history of this country and more than all other advanced countries combined.But to make sure everyone is part of this resurgence, we need to build on what we know widens the path to the middle class—and you all know what it is, access to education.Folks, the source of our economic power and middle class strength in the 20th Century was the fact that we were among the first major nations in the world to provide twelve years of free education for our citizens.But in the 21st Century, other countries have already caught up and twelve years is simply no longer enough—a minimum of fourteen years is necessary for families to have a surer path to the middle class and for the United States to be able to out-compete the rest of the world.Consider that by the end of the decade, two out of three of all jobs will require an education beyond high school, from an 18-week certificate to a two-year associate’s degree to a four-year bachelor’s, or a PhD.And consider that folks with an associate’s degree earn 25% more than someone who graduated just from high school. And folks who graduate with a four-year degree make 70% more.But today, the cost of higher education is too high for too many Americans. Too many folks are priced out of a piece of the middle-class dream. And that’s why the President and I have a straightforward plan to remove that barrier and expand the pathway to the middle class—by bringing the cost of community colleges down—down to zero. Zero—for anyone willing to work for it and for the institutions that meet certain basic requirements.Our plan is no give-away. Students must keep up their grades and stay on track to graduate. States must contribute funding and hold community colleges accountable for the results. And community colleges must maintain high graduation and job placement rates.And here’s a key point—community colleges will have to offer courses that are directly transferrable to a four-year degree.If two years of community college are free—and credits can transfer to a four-year university—that means the cost of a four-year degree will be cut in half for a lot of working families struggling to send their children to college, qualified children.And under our plan, students from low-income families will be able to keep the benefits that flow from other financial aid, like Pell grants, to cover childcare, housing, transportation—costs that often keep them from attending class and completing a degree in the first place.But here’s another key point. Not every good-paying job will require a two-year or four-year degree. Some of these jobs will require just a training certificate that can be earned in just a few months.For example, you can go to an 18-week coding boot-camp—with no previous experience in computers—and become a computer programmer making up to $70,000 a year.There are other jobs in fields like advanced manufacturing and energy that pay $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year—jobs you can raise a family on.It’s a simple fact that community colleges are the most flexible educational institutions we have. I’ve traveled all over this country, from New York to Iowa to California, to see how community colleges create partnerships with Fortune 500 companies and local businesses to generate jobs; support apprenticeships with organized labor, and prepare hardworking students for good-paying jobs in the areas in which they live. Making community colleges free is good for workers, it’s good for companies, and it’s good for our economy.Here’s what we propose: Close loopholes for the wealthiest investors and levy a .07% fee on the biggest banks to discourage the kind of risky behavior that crashed our economy just a few years ago.Doing just that would pay for free community college—and provide a leg up for working families through tax credits to cover necessities like childcare.That’s what middle-class economics is all about—giving folks a fair chance to get ahead. A fair tax code. No guarantees. Just a fair chance.It’s simple, folks, two years of community college should become as free and as universal as high school is today if we’re to make this economic resurgence permanent and well into the 21st Century. So I want to thank you all for listening. I hope you have a great weekend and God bless you all and may God protect our troops. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:Hillary gets more 🙁 poll newsGovernor orders Californians to shower even lessRick Perry: 'Leaders of both parties have gutted our defenses'Rand Paul asks 'What kind of America will our grandchildren see?'

808,LEG,"The stock market skidded Tuesday, disrupting the rebound that began last week. The Nasdaq and S&P; 500 both lost 0.9% as a tide of sellers swept over the exchanges in the final hour. Tuesday was the end of the quarter, a time when many fund managers make last-minute portfolio adjustments to make their quarterly reports look as favorable as possible.…
"
809,LEG,"Kevin Laue is all about rebounding.Take the day he met the president of the United States.It was Jan. 30, 2008, and the skilled 17-year-old basketball player from Northern California's Amador Valley High School was on the tarmac of San Francisco's airport to see George W. Bush.The president had read an article in Sports Illustrated about how Laue — who was born without a left hand — persevered to become one of the top players in his Pleasanton, Calif., league.The short meeting and handshake were a score, but the rest of Laue's day was a brick.After racing back to the East Bay to lace up his sneakers for tipoff, the 6-foot, 11-inch senior broke his leg during the game, ending his season.As Laue lay in his hospital bed watching news coverage of his meeting with President Bush, he knew he'd bounce back.A year later, he did in a major way, becoming the first player with one hand to receive a Division I college basketball scholarship.After three years playing D-I hoops at Manhattan College, Laue now travels the world delivering his motivational message to others.""My arm isn't my disability,"" Laue, 24, told IBD. ""My disability was the recruiters who doubted me.""Tough BirthKevin Clinton Laue has battled since the beginning.When his umbilical cord wrapped around him in the womb, Laue's left arm was caught between the cord and his neck. The squeeze cut off blood circulation to the arm, so he was born with a limb that ended just below the elbow.In essence, to save his brain, he sacrificed part of his arm.Or, as Laue often jokes, ""it was either my arm or my head.""All kidding aside, adversity struck often during Laue's childhood in the Golden State.His father, Wayne — who stood 6 feet 9 inches — died of melanoma when Kevin was 10.Laue coped by playing sports. The redhead played football, baseball and soccer before taking a shot at hoops in the seventh grade.Laue figured out that he could palm the basketball with his big right hand and utilize his short left arm — which he calls his nub — to pin passes against his right one.Shooting and passing were a cinch. The outside forces were sometimes a chore.His classmates weren't always kind to a tall kid with a missing limb, but Laue made the best of it.""When I was 10 years old, I was 5-10 with one arm and shaggy red hair, so I was a big target for being made fun of,"" said Laue. ""Kids would call me Captain Hook or One-Arm Jack, but when I accepted myself for who I was and what I was ... that was when my whole world changed for the better.""Laue took advantage of his big size in elementary school, calling his first job ""a personal bodyguard"" for a peer who was being bullied.When he was cut from his seventh-grade basketball team, the move turned out to be the assist that he needed to up his game.Even as the coach who dropped him told Laue that basketball was ""a two-handed game,"" the middle schooler boxed out the negativity.He simply soared to new heights with a travel team called the Tri-Valley Outlawz.Laue's mother, Jodi, called Outlawz coach Patrick McKnight to see if her son — who was now a dunking, 6-9 eighth-grader — could get a tryout.McKnight leapt — and was hooked on the conspicuous baller.""He was a tall kid with red hair who looked like a Crayola crayon,"" McKnight said. ""You don't miss a guy with one arm, but he blended in really well. I was a tough coach, and he never quit. His perseverance and attitude of never giving up really stood out.""Laue ran the court for McKnight's Outlawz for four years — earning individual defense and inspirational awards — and improved vastly under his tutelage.Laue's biggest asset was one that couldn't be taught.""His biggest strength was his shot blocking; he was phenomenal at it,"" said McKnight, a basketball coach for 25 years. ""Some of the shots he blocked I would never believe if they weren't on film. You couldn't shoot over him; that's what gave me most of my wins.""Then it was on to Amador Valley High's varsity team.Laue stood tall his junior year, averaging 14 points, eight rebounds and eight blocks per game.When he wasn't rejecting shots on the court, Laue had to block out doubters off of it.After his broken leg, recruiters stopped calling and Division I colleges gave up looking at him.So Laue pivoted.The Californian headed east — to Fork Union Military Academy in Virginia — to get back on track.Laue spent the 2008-09 season playing at Fork Union, a competitive prep school with a solid record of athletic success, counting Heisman Trophy winners Vinny Testaverde and Eddie George as former student athletes.Shooting For New YorkLaue's postgraduate year — which let him play an extra season of high school basketball without losing college eligibility — helped.He became Fork Union's starting center, then in March 2009 landed the scholarship to Manhattan.The achievement was not only historic but also timely. Laue's mother and stepfather had just lost their house in the recession.""It was a tremendous experience because no one had ever done that (gotten the scholarship) with a disability,"" said Laue. ""And it was so essential with the situation my parents were in, so it took a lot of pressure off.""During his time with the Jaspers, Laue reached highs on the court and in the classroom.The big man played sparingly — averaging less than one point and one rebound in 60 games over three seasons as Manhattan went 38-58 — but graduated with honors and a business degree in three years while racking up a 3.5 grade point average.Since then, Laue has advanced to a new career: motivational speaking. His message?Ride perseverance and innovation to overcome obstacles.In the speaking gig, Laue, who wears size 17 shoes, has been a giant. He has spoken all over the map — to and for Google (GOOGL), the United Nations, the Taiwanese government and schools.Laue's home court is New York, but he makes the rounds while represented by the Fisher Agency out of California.Worldwide ViewLaue calls traveling the world to share his message ""an incredible experience,"" and he hammers home a main motto, no matter the crowd: ""Nothing is out of reach. You must change your mentality and perspective; those are the two biggest speed bumps for people.""Laue receives hundreds of letters and emails each year from people battling obstacles similar to his. While answering them, he's guided by a tip that one of his idols who lacked a right hand and won a gold medal as an Olympic baseball pitcher once offered.""It's unbelievable,"" said Laue. ""Jim Abbott was my hero growing up, and he gave me great advice: This all comes with a great responsibility. I used to think I was the only one going through things — being bullied — but it's great to be that pillar of strength for others.""Laue's tale is the subject of a 2012 film that qualified for Academy Award consideration last year in the category of best documentary feature.Directed by Franklin Martin — who met Kevin while coaching against his Tri-Valley Outlawz — ""Long Shot: The Kevin Laue Story"" follows Laue's life for four years from high school through the beginning of his days at Manhattan.The flick — which is currently in negotiations with a studio for wide distribution — is donating a percentage of proceeds to the Challenged Athletes Foundation, a charity that helps those with physical limitations realize their dreams through fitness and competition.According to his former coach and mentor, Laue embodies a fighting spirit while influencing others.""Kevin is a perfect example for people because he is one of a very few,"" said McKnight, who now coaches basketball in Coos Bay, Ore. ""He has taken a disability and turned it into a positive. He's made people all over the world feel differently about what they can and can't do. He's changed people's lives.""

Wall Street was expecting a $1.04…
"
811,LEG,"Following a brief dip in October tied to the Ebola scare, airline stocks are trading at their highest point in years as the industry benefits from cheap oil prices and a growing U.S. economy.
"
812,LEG,"One of the biggest gainers in recent weeks is Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the low-cost carrier that has made a name for itself by providing a bare-bones flying option for budget-conscious travelers.
"
813,LEG,"Its shares have risen nearly 60% since Oct. 13, when IBD's Transportation-Airline group hit an eight-month low as investors worried that a spreading Ebola outbreak might curb air travel.
"
814,LEG,"Spirit's stock gain compares favorably with the performance of other airlines highly rated by IBD, such asSouthwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).
"
815,LEG,"Shares of Spirit got a lift on Oct. 28, rising 7% after the company beat third-quarter earnings views.
"
816,LEG,"""We're very pleased with how the market is responding to our track record and growth story,"" Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza told IBD. ""People like our return on investment and growth profile.""
"
817,LEG,"That track record includes years of solid profits despite the ups and downs of the air travel industry. More recently, the airline has run off seven straight quarters of at least double-digit sales and EPS growth.
"
818,LEG,"Baldanza's Bonanza
"
819,LEG,"Spirit has an all-Airbus (EADSY) fleet of 60 narrow-body planes and operates more than 280 daily flights going to more than 55 destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.
"
820,LEG,"The recipe for success is pretty simple, Baldanza says. Spirit offers cut-rate fares — about 40% lower than other airlines on average, according to Department of Transportation data — to travelers who value cost savings over all else.
"
821,LEG,"Those travelers represent the majority of the airline market, according to evaluations Spirit conducted.
"
822,LEG,"""Our evaluations found that when you ask customers how they pick an airline, more than half say they just want the lowest price,"" Baldanza said. ""That's more important than other features such as more leg room or in-flight entertainment.""
"
823,LEG,"To reach those customers, Spirit offers a basic ""bare fare"" option that includes a seat and one piece of carry-on luggage. If you want anything else — even a beverage — it costs extra.
"
824,LEG,"The company caters to passengers who order and pay for their own tickets, which basically means leisure and small-business travelers. Business-class travelers who work for corporations with large travel budgets are not the target demographic.
"
825,LEG,"Baldanza notes that what you'll find on a Spirit flight reflects the low fare.
"
826,LEG,"""If you are paying for the ticket yourself, you tend to be more realistic,"" he said. ""Our planes don't have as much leg room as other airlines, our seats don't recline, we tend to only make one or two flights a day from many markets.""
"
827,LEG,"That's a compromise, he concedes. ""But what you get is the absolute lowest total price. That's why our planes are very full and why we continue to grow very profitably.""
"
828,LEG,"Spirit keeps its fares low by keeping its own costs low, Baldanza says. ""We don't have wide-body planes, which add weight. We don't have a sales force. We don't have the kinds of things you need to have to win corporate accounts.""
"
829,LEG,"In addition, he says, Spirit puts more seats on its planes than competitors, which means that it has more potential customers for each flight, albeit those customers are squeezed in tighter.
"
830,LEG,"Most Profitable Airline?
"
831,LEG,"In a recent research note, Morgan Stanley analyst John Godyn said that during the second quarter, Spirit ranked the second most profitable airline in the world based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (or restructuring) costs, or EBITDAR.
"
832,LEG,"Airline Weekly also cited Spirit as the second most profitable airline in the world for the 12 months ended June 30, based on operating profit as a percentage of operating revenue. The Panamanian Copa Holdings (CPA) was No. 1, while Las Vegas-based low-fare carrier Allegiant Travel (ALGT) ranked No. 3.
"
833,LEG,"Godyn reckons that Spirit can move to the front of the line based on his metric.
"
834,LEG,"""Following a strong 3Q result, we forecast SAVE generating about 36% EBITDAR margins in 2015 — a level likely to make it the most profitable airline in the world,"" he said.
"
835,LEG,"Spirit posted third-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, up 28% from a year earlier and 3 cents above what analysts expected.
"
836,LEG,"Revenue for the quarter climbed 14% year over year to $519.8 million, slightly below estimates. Revenue per available seat mile declined 0.8% to 12.45 cents as the company's load factor fell to 87.6% from 89.1% a year earlier.
"
837,LEG,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 34% in 2014 and another 38% in 2015. Spirit shares moved to a record high above 84 on Friday, amid optimism about the effect of low oil prices on airline profits.
"
838,LEG,"Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent recently noted that he is ""optimistic"" about Spirit's ability to continue growing profits. He cited several factors, including the company's steady base of target customers as well as ""strong capacity growth and lower oil prices.""
"
839,LEG,"CEO Baldanza says that he expects Spirit's business model to become more prevalent in the airline industry. ""When somebody creates a better mousetrap, people copy it,"" he said.
"
840,LEG,"Baldanza points to Europe, where about 20% of travelers fly on carriers similar to Spirit, including Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). In contrast, Spirit carries just under 2% of the total U.S. air passenger traffic.
"
841,LEG,"""We don't see anybody doing what we are doing yet, though over time we expect they will,"" Baldanza said.
"
842,LEG,"Meanwhile, Spirit continues to expand its operations.
"
843,LEG,"On Nov. 17, it announced plans for nonstop flights to 10 new destinations, including Tampa, Fla.; Baltimore/Washington, D.C.; and Oakland/San Francisco Bay, as well as seven locations in Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. The new flights will begin in the spring.
"
844,LEG,"Spirit also recently boosted nonstop routes, saying it will soon have a total of ten from Denver and nine from Los Angeles, in addition to its other nonstop and connecting-flight routes.
"
845,LEG,"The company plans to add five more planes to its fleet by the end of the year and 15 more in 2015.Following a brief dip in October tied to the Ebola scare, airline stocks are trading at their highest point in years as the industry benefits from cheap oil prices and a growing U.S. economy.One of the biggest gainers in recent weeks is Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the low-cost carrier that has made a name for itself by providing a bare-bones flying option for budget-conscious travelers.Its shares have risen nearly 60% since Oct. 13, when IBD's Transportation-Airline group hit an eight-month low as investors worried that a spreading Ebola outbreak might curb air travel.Spirit's stock gain compares favorably with the performance of other airlines highly rated by IBD, such asSouthwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).Shares of Spirit got a lift on Oct. 28, rising 7% after the company beat third-quarter earnings views.""We're very pleased with how the market is responding to our track record and growth story,"" Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza told IBD. ""People like our return on investment and growth profile.""That track record includes years of solid profits despite the ups and downs of the air travel industry. More recently, the airline has run off seven straight quarters of at least double-digit sales and EPS growth.Baldanza's BonanzaSpirit has an all-Airbus (EADSY) fleet of 60 narrow-body planes and operates more than 280 daily flights going to more than 55 destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.The recipe for success is pretty simple, Baldanza says. Spirit offers cut-rate fares — about 40% lower than other airlines on average, according to Department of Transportation data — to travelers who value cost savings over all else.Those travelers represent the majority of the airline market, according to evaluations Spirit conducted.""Our evaluations found that when you ask customers how they pick an airline, more than half say they just want the lowest price,"" Baldanza said. ""That's more important than other features such as more leg room or in-flight entertainment.""To reach those customers, Spirit offers a basic ""bare fare"" option that includes a seat and one piece of carry-on luggage. If you want anything else — even a beverage — it costs extra.The company caters to passengers who order and pay for their own tickets, which basically means leisure and small-business travelers. Business-class travelers who work for corporations with large travel budgets are not the target demographic.Baldanza notes that what you'll find on a Spirit flight reflects the low fare.""If you are paying for the ticket yourself, you tend to be more realistic,"" he said. ""Our planes don't have as much leg room as other airlines, our seats don't recline, we tend to only make one or two flights a day from many markets.""That's a compromise, he concedes. ""But what you get is the absolute lowest total price. That's why our planes are very full and why we continue to grow very profitably.""Spirit keeps its fares low by keeping its own costs low, Baldanza says. ""We don't have wide-body planes, which add weight. We don't have a sales force. We don't have the kinds of things you need to have to win corporate accounts.""In addition, he says, Spirit puts more seats on its planes than competitors, which means that it has more potential customers for each flight, albeit those customers are squeezed in tighter.Most Profitable Airline?In a recent research note, Morgan Stanley analyst John Godyn said that during the second quarter, Spirit ranked the second most profitable airline in the world based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (or restructuring) costs, or EBITDAR.Airline Weekly also cited Spirit as the second most profitable airline in the world for the 12 months ended June 30, based on operating profit as a percentage of operating revenue. The Panamanian Copa Holdings (CPA) was No. 1, while Las Vegas-based low-fare carrier Allegiant Travel (ALGT) ranked No. 3.Godyn reckons that Spirit can move to the front of the line based on his metric.""Following a strong 3Q result, we forecast SAVE generating about 36% EBITDAR margins in 2015 — a level likely to make it the most profitable airline in the world,"" he said.Spirit posted third-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, up 28% from a year earlier and 3 cents above what analysts expected.Revenue for the quarter climbed 14% year over year to $519.8 million, slightly below estimates. Revenue per available seat mile declined 0.8% to 12.45 cents as the company's load factor fell to 87.6% from 89.1% a year earlier.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 34% in 2014 and another 38% in 2015. Spirit shares moved to a record high above 84 on Friday, amid optimism about the effect of low oil prices on airline profits.Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent recently noted that he is ""optimistic"" about Spirit's ability to continue growing profits. He cited several factors, including the company's steady base of target customers as well as ""strong capacity growth and lower oil prices.""CEO Baldanza says that he expects Spirit's business model to become more prevalent in the airline industry.

864,LEG,"The European economy at large had been moving forward in the wake of the 2007­—2009 global financial crisis and subsequent sovereign debt crisis, spurred by European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi's pledge to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro in 2012 and the implementation of austerity measures in the eurozone periphery. In recent months, the recovery seemed to have stalled, with some countries, including the eurozone's engine of growth—Germany—flirting with recession. Heather Arnold, director of research, portfolio manager and analyst, Templeton Global Equity Group™, shares her perspective on whether the ECB's most recent efforts, including its Asset Quality Review (AQR) and Stress Test, can help Europe turn the pages of its recovery story forward again.

"
866,LEG,"The European recovery has been hampered by the limitations of its banking system, and we believe the European Central Bank's (ECB's) Asset Quality Review (AQR) and Stress Test are important steps in addressing this. Importantly, as of November 4, bank supervision shifted from local central banks to the ECB, which we believe should greatly improve transparency, comparability and accountability across the banking sector. In our view, this should likely lead to lower spreads and funding costs and also facilitate further bank consolidation; the differential funding costs between the different countries in Europe, particularly those in the so-called periphery (i.e., Spain, Ireland, Portugal, Greece) and the core (most notably Germany) widened considerably at the height of the euro crisis and have narrowed considerably due to ECB actions. Also, the AQR confirmed that the vast majority of European banks are adequately capitalized. This should likely pave the way to a restart of bank lending, which is critical for the smooth functioning of any economy. Additionally, we think it should serve to rebuild confidence in the European banking sector, which to date, has been sorely lacking. 
"
867,LEG,"The ECB has fulfilled an essential role by facilitating liquidity and solvency of the pan-European banking system. Also, by helping bring down funding costs for peripheral banks, it should keep capital affordable across Europe. What remains to be seen is to what degree the ECB is committed to actually doing ""whatever it takes,"" namely, expanding its balance sheet through aggressive quantitative easing to devalue its currency and, hopefully, reflate its system, assuming, of course, that such Keynesian measures actually work. Clearly, compared to the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan, the ECB is a laggard here. To date, this seems to have kept the pressure on European governments to bring about much-needed structural reform.

868,LEG,"Europe's Recovery Hits a Rough Patch 
"
869,LEG,"The European recovery has hit a rough patch. It seemed to begin with the slowdown in emerging markets, which have been a meaningful source of demand for European exports and services. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has also weighed on confidence. What has drawn us to Europe, though, has always been compelling valuations. If anything, recent weakness—particularly compared to the relative strength of the US market—has only reinforced the value case for European equities, in our view. 
"
870,LEG,"Europe has been suffering from both cyclical and structural problems. Although the economic downturn was severe following the financial crisis of 2007—2009 and the subsequent recovery has been anemic, we do believe the cycle will improve, and we reflect this spirit of ""normalization"" into the financial models that we build for companies over a five-year investment horizon. Due to the severity of the downturn, Europe has been addressing some of its structural problems. As already noted, structural improvement of the banking sector is now underway. Also, countries such as Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece have improved their competitiveness by tackling their debt, labor inefficiencies and entitlement programs. Italy now appears to be stepping up, and, hopefully, France will, too. 
"
871,LEG,"In terms of tweaking our models, the recent slowdown has largely impacted a handful of industrial, energy and consumer discretionary companies, in part due to weakness in Europe but also due to the slowdown in emerging markets and in Asia. Interestingly, our bank models have not been greatly impacted. Generally, though, a few tweaks do not tend to derail our five-year-out investment case for many of our holdings, which is underpinned by compelling valuations, solid balance sheets, and strong recovery and growth potential.

873,LEG,"We should remember that, for over a decade, China has had one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and yet one of the worst-performing stock markets. It all goes back to valuation—and valuations in Europe are currently at a 40% discount to the US market.1 In fact, nine of the 10 cheapest equity markets in the world, based on cyclically adjusted long-term earnings, are currently found in Europe.2 Europe also trades well below the United States on a number of other measures, including market cap-to-GDP, which is extreme; the market capitalization of corporate Europe constitutes roughly 40% of European GDP compared with some 120% in the United States.3 The average dividend yield on European equities also stands near an all-time high relative to benchmark sovereign credit yields and corporate bond yields.4 
"
874,LEG,"In terms of recovery, Europe's share of global earnings in the MSCI World Index was at a 28-year low, as of August 31, 2014.5 European corporates generally have geographically diverse revenues and high operating leverage, which we believe should enhance an eventual profit recovery. The export-oriented region also stands to benefit from a weaker euro, in addition to better-than-expected US growth. Finally, Europe has both monetary and fiscal policy tools at its disposal, which it has yet to fully deploy to support the economy. 
"
875,LEG,"We are finding potential opportunity across the board in Europe, but most notably in the energy sector given recent weakness there. Despite their recovery to date, financials are still lowly priced and continue to offer recovery potential, in our view.

902,LEG,"Maybe the race wasn't to the swift during biblical times, but in the 21st century you'll get left behind in a hurry if you're slow out of the gate with new technologies.Rivals of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) are finding that out.Ultimate makes workforce management software designed to help clients better manage employee-related services such as payroll, benefits, recruiting, performance management and time management.The core product is UltiPro, software that manages the employment life cycle from recruitment to retirement. Ultimate delivers it via the Internet cloud.That last part — the cloud — is what separates Ultimate from others in its industry, analysts say. Ultimate was an early mover in designing an integrated, cloud-based human resources/payroll system, giving it a leg up on rivals who have taken longer to leverage the cloud.""As the move to the cloud has accelerated, Ultimate has been one of the biggest beneficiaries,"" said Samad Samana, analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""They are taking a lot of customers away from ADP (ADP), Ceridian and Paychex (PAYX).""Clout Of The CloudCloud-based systems have several advantages over hardware-based systems, Samana told IBD.""There is a lower overall cost of ownership because you don't have to purchase hardware,"" he said. ""There's less staff cost in terms of management. And there are more frequent updates to the software, which helps you keep up with the pace of innovation.""Ultimate's ability to trot out new products and innovations has been one of the keys to its consistent financial growth through the years. The company posts double-digit sales and earnings gains with regularity and is expected to keep doing so well into the future.""The market for Ultimate's solutions is large and growing rapidly. The company has strong, highly regarded products, increasing scale, and a business model that better balances revenue growth and profitability than many SaaS (software as a service) peers,"" MKM Partners analyst Kevin Buttigieg noted in a report last month initiating coverage on Ultimate with a ""buy"" rating.Ultimate boasts 2,700 customers with employees in 150 countries. Its client list features a diverse range of firms, including software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE), restaurant operators Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) and Texas Roadhouse (TXRH), auto parts retailer Pep Boys (PBY) and Major League Baseball.Ultimate mainly focuses on two types of customers: enterprise companies, defined as those with more than 1,500 employees, and mid-market companies, or those with around 500 to 1,500 employees.Ultimate's enterprise sales team, which consists of 75 sales reps, has ""an unusually low turnover"" rate with an average tenure of 10 years, Barrington Research analyst Jeff Houston noted following Ultimate's third-quarter earnings report on Oct. 28.He cites several reasons for the low turnover, including ""not penalizing successful salespeople by narrowing their territories as well as world-class benefits.""Winning BusinessDuring a conference call with analysts, Ultimate CEO Scott Scherr noted a number of enterprise wins during the company's third quarter, though he didn't divulge the names of the customers. These included a ""high-profile"" restaurant chain with 18,000 employees, a security company with 6,500 employees and an education services company with 3,600 employees.While most of Ultimate's business comes from large and mid-sized clients, the company has lately increased its efforts to land more smaller companies of 500 or fewer employees, analyst Houston says.""Management was clear that it has been selling to companies with fewer than 500 employees for a long time, and that it is just adding more salespeople to target the low end of the market,"" he noted.FBR's Samana reckons it will be some time before the move to land more smaller clients begins to have much impact on Ultimate's financial results.""The move downstream is a newer initiative for them, so it's something where we will see a bigger contribution a couple of years from now,"" he said. ""It's not as big a driver in the near term.""What About Job Gains?Although analyst Houston says Ultimate stands to benefit as the economy adds jobs, CEO Scherr mentioned on the third-quarter conference call that with new customers being Ultimate Software's biggest growth driver, changes in employment ""are not that material"" to the overall growth goal.During the third quarter the company logged revenue of $127.4 million, up 24% from the prior year and just ahead of consensus analyst views. Earnings gained 25% to 50 cents a share, topping estimates by a penny.Recurring revenue, or revenue that is likely to continue in the future, increased 26% during the quarter.""The increase was primarily attributable to revenue growth from our cloud offering,"" Scherr said in a statement.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Ultimate to post full-year 2014 earnings of $2.02 a share, up 26% from a year earlier. EPS is seen rising another 22% to $2.46 in 2015.The company's stock price touched a nearly eight-month high of 156.20 on Tuesday. Shares are up 20% since Oct. 10.Ultimate is part of IBD's Computer Software-Enterprise group, which ranks No. 7 out of 197 industries tracked. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, which ranks fifth in the group. Three stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 99: Manhattan Associates (MANH), Paycom Software (PAYC) and Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR).

The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, following its best weekly gain since the start of February. The guage erased an earlier advance in the final 15 minutes of trading. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.7%. U.S. crude advanced from near a six-year low and gold rose with copper.Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said there won't be a ""smooth upward path"" for interest rates even as the first increase may be warranted by late 2015. Global equities rallied the most in almost two years last week after the Fed signaled a delay in higher interest rates amid record stimulus in Europe and Japan. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached out to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, saying his country belongs in Europe and she wants its economy to succeed.""I don't see any reason to think we need to take another leg up to start the week today,"" Michael James, a Los Angeles-based managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc., said in a phone interview. ""The market is going to remain in a trading range, and we're in the upper band right now.""The rate on 10-year Treasury notes slipped and the dollar dropped against all but one of its 16 major counterparts Monday, as investors parsed comments from Fed officials for clues on the timing of their first interest-rate increase since 2006. The greenback weakened 1.3% to $1.0965 per euro.Fischer's comments came after Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in in a Bloomberg Television interview in Paris Monday that it is appropriate to raise rates this year. San Francisco Fed President John Williams and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard also speak this week.""Whether it's going to be June or September, or some later date, or some date in between, will depend on the data,"" said Fischer, responding to a question from the audience following a speech at the Economic Club of New York. Labor market readings would be an important guide. The next Labor Department payrolls report comes April 3.Data Monday showed sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell short of a 5 million annual rate in February for a second month.

942,LEG,"The University of Kentucky basketball team stood No. 1 in last year's preseason polls.And no wonder.John Calipari had what many called the top recruiting class, with forward Julius Randle, twin guards Aaron and Andrew Harrison and swing man James Young.But losses piled up in the 2013-14 season. The Wildcats fell victim to Michigan State, Baylor and North Carolina while seeing their ranking plummet to 25.Coach Calipari isn't used to that. With another season starting, he has a 597-177 college record, good for a .771 winning percentage.He'd made four Final Four appearances and captured the NCAA title with his 2012 Wildcats.Still, Calipari put a positive spin on his team last season while taking the blame for what went wrong.His strategy — to take the pressure off the players — worked.Almost All The WayThe Wildcats forced their way to the NCAA championship game before losing 60-54 to Connecticut.And here they are again: ranked No. 1 on the eve of the new season.Asked if last season's team met expectations or fell short, Calipari told IBD: ""It did both. We didn't win all 40 games, but we started five freshmen, and we got to the final game with a chance to win. The biggest thing is that I tried to take all the weight of the world off them, that they felt empowered, that it was their team, not my team.""Calipari, 55, has had a long love affair with basketball. Growing up, he particularly liked the idea that if you dedicated yourself to the game, you could lift your skills.Calipari's skills improved, yet ""I was slow,"" he said.So he ended up at Clarion, a Division II school in Pennsylvania.In his senior year, he averaged five points and five assists a game, not necessarily a sign of playing proficiency.So he zeroed in on coaching.In his native western Pennsylvania, ""the only professionals in our lives were the teachers. We didn't know any other professionals. So all I wanted to be was a high school coach and teacher. I majored in business and marketing in case it (didn't work out).""But after I got to college, I started to wonder if maybe I could coach in college. (My shift in viewpoint) was more of a process. Every year, at least for me, you grow in a different way, you learn things, you see how the game is changing and the family is changing.""The last is particularly important, since many of today's top hoopsters come from impoverished homes. Calipari identifies with that, and his empathy fuels his success and rapport with his players.""If I had a credit card when I was growing up that my dad paid, if I had everything I needed, I don't know if I would have had the same drive to succeed,"" he said.After graduating in 1982, Calipari landed prestigious assistant jobs at the universities of Kansas and Pittsburgh before becoming head coach at Massachusetts in 1988.UMass mastered the game under the young coach, reaching the NCAA tournament five times and soaring to the Final Four in 1996.The Pros And CollegeCalipari coached briefly and unhappily in the National Basketball Association before returning to the college ranks at the University of Memphis. His 2008 Tigers were moments away from the title before succumbing to a furious Kansas comeback.By the fall of 2009, he had switched to Kentucky. The Wildcats were historically one of the country's elite basketball teams but lately weren't competing for national titles. Calipari changed that fast, reaching the Final Four in his second season. How did he do it?In his 2014 memoir, ""Players First: Coaching From the Inside Out,"" he wrote that his record improves when he sets the right tone. ""The more I focus on the players,"" he said, ""the more we seem to win.""Tweet And SweetThat is perhaps best exemplified by the Josh Harrellson incident. The big man took to Twitter in the fall of 2010 when he felt the coach didn't properly praise him after an outstanding effort.Most coaches would have cut him, and that was Calipari's first instinct: ""When I first heard about it, I said, 'He's off the team.'""Yet Calipari reconsidered and learned a lesson: ""What it showed me was to keep things in perspective. Every kid needs to be coached differently. They're not machines. They're not cookie cutters. Josh was someone's child.""For Calipari, the process starts with recruiting — and honesty. The coach evaluates a high school kid's game and expresses whether he's a good fit with the Wildcats.When Calipari visited the home of the Harrison twins, he was blunt: ""I've seen you two be the best players in the country,"" he started, then added, ""I've also seen you where you act like it doesn't matter, where you don't care. Let me tell you, those guys are not playing on my court.""Calipari knew that he risked alienating potentially valuable additions to his team. But, he told IBD, ""If you tell them what they want to hear when you are recruiting them, it's really hard to tell them the real deal when they're here.""Being upfront worked with the Harrisons, who've returned to Kentucky for their sophomore season. Andrew told IBD that the coach's comments ""opened up my eyes. It made me realize you have to play hard every possession. Someone is always watching. ... It kind of made me want to come here more, because I knew he would always be honest and tell the truth.""His twin, Aaron, agrees: ""I was surprised, because most coaches wouldn't tell you that. Most would just tell you what you want to hear. I respected it a lot, and my dad respected it a lot.""Rather than turn them off, Calipari's honesty attracted the pair. ""He has a way of being straightforward and blunt,"" Aaron continued. ""That draws a lot of us here.""While Calipari consistently recruits top players, he contends that he doesn't pursue every highly rated prospect. ""The kids we go after are all pretty good athletes being recruited by other coaches,"" he said. ""When a kid tells me he can score 25 points a game and other coaches promised him he'd start, those are guys I don't want. We get to a point where if we think a guy won't succeed here, we shouldn't recruit him (even if he's a skilled athlete). You have to have guys you feel will succeed.""Karl-Anthony Towns, a 6-foot-11 freshman as part of another glitzy Calipari class, says that, yes, he was attracted by the school's blue-chip tradition of eight national titles: ""That speaks for itself."" As important, Kentucky ""had better educational (options from the) standpoint of what I wanted to do with kinesiology. It made my decision a little easier"" — as did the coach's encouragement of ""student athletes to be part of the community.""That may sound disingenuous about a team where many of the players aim to leave after their freshman year, expecting to be drafted into the NBA. But Calipari insists: ""I may have some of these young men for only a season, but I ask myself: 'Have I done everything I can to show them the importance of gaining what they have?'""That includes advice about their professional prospects. For some, such as Randle — chosen seventh by the Los Angeles Lakers in this year's NBA draft before signing for $3 million per year and breaking his leg in their opener — the decision to go pro is a no-brainer.For picks further down the spectrum, the choice is fuzzier.Calipari has told players, ""If you (stay in school), it will be very difficult, because here's what you have to do to become a better player. Don't think it's going to be easy. It will be twice as hard.""That appealed to Patrick Patterson, who played at Kentucky from 2007 to 2010. ""He told me he wanted to come back so he could graduate,"" Calipari said. ""He also said, 'You'll play me out on the floor instead of just with my back to the basket.' And he said, 'I've never played in an NCAA tournament.'""Patterson got his wish. He learned to play away from the basket. He made it to the Elite Eight of the 2010 tournament. He earned a degree. And now he plays for the NBA's Toronto Raptors.

944,LEG,"Ray Kroc steered McDonald's to the top of fast food. His winning recipe? He was flexible, nurtured franchisee relationships and reacted to business challenges with an open mind.""Just as Henry Ford's idea was brought to reality through hard work, perseverance, just plain doggedness and above all faith, so McDonald's astounding success was achieved through those same qualities,"" Kroc wrote in a 1969 company newsletter. ""We can never rest on our laurels. We must always keep our ideal dream before us and work with faith so that we can accomplish ever more than we have.""Despite initial low profit, Kroc (1902-84) used an entrepreneurial spirit to grow McDonald's, revolutionizing the fast-food industry through a standardized approach to restaurant franchises and an openness to new ideas.Today, McDonald's (MCD) is still cooking. 2014 sales hit $27 billion, a 29% rise since 2006. Its stock has climbed 640% in the past 12 years.Kroc drove himself from the start. A high school dropout in Oak Park, Ill., he lied about his age in 1917 to sign up as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross as World War I raged in Europe.The war ended before his training did. So he steered to various jobs: piano player, paper cup salesman, milkshake machine salesman.Life Begins At 50Kroc was in his 50s during his milkshake mixer career, but he was just getting started.The big turn came in 1954, when a large order for Prince Castle Multimixers, which could mix five milkshakes at once, came from a San Bernardino, Calif., restaurant owned by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald.Kroc flew to California to meet the brothers and was amazed by their booming operation, which focused on a few key items — burgers, fries and drinks.The duo's emphasis on quality set them apart from competitors.Kroc was hooked. He shared with the brothers his vision of opening McDonald's restaurants all over the country. Then he cut a deal with the duo and started McDonald's Corp. in 1955.Now head of the operation, Kroc laid out the strategy: From its headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., the company would sell franchises to individual restaurant owners for the low price of $950 and in exchange receive 1.4% of all sales. Also in the mix, the McDonald brothers would receive 0.5%.In 1961, Kroc purchased the exclusive rights to the McDonald's name and bought out the duo for $2.7 million.Now running the operation, he initiated an enterprise that grew from that one restaurant into more than 7,700 at his death in 1984.Today, McDonald's is the world's leading global food-service retailer, with over 36,000 locations in over 100 countries.Paul Facella, a longtime consultant at McDonald's and the author of ""Everything I Learned About Business I Learned At McDonald's,"" notes that Kroc had a slogan that epitomized his unique relationship with the franchisees: ""You make the first buck, I'll make the second buck.""When Kroc first opened for business in 1955, contenders in the fast-food arena were A&W, Dairy Queen, Tastee-Freez and Big Boy.""Kroc took great pains to differentiate McDonald's from these players. ... The crucial difference between Kroc and his rivals was one of world view. He saw franchises as business partners, not mere customers,"" wrote Daniel Gross in ""Forbes Greatest Business Stories of all Time."" ""In his travels selling the multimixer, he had observed the way franchisers milked franchisees for profits without concern for their long-term viability. Kroc vowed not to fall into that lucrative, but ultimately unproductive, trap,"" wrote Gross.Facella added: ""Kroc understood the franchises were a long-term relationship. He wanted to make sure the franchises were successful, because the success of the franchise would ultimately make the company successful. In the beginning years, if a franchise was struggling, if he had to help, he would work with it. He realized it was to the company's advantage as opposed to saying, 'Hey you missed your franchisee payment.' ""Ultimately, Kroc left his competition in the dust as he expanded his operation while focusing on quality every step of the way.Three Legs, Sturdy CompanyKroc promoted a philosophy of a three-legged stool in which one leg was McDonald's, the second the franchisees and the third McDonald's suppliers and vendors.""He understood the need for all three to be strong. That principle was a hallmark of Ray Kroc,"" Facella told IBD.Mike Bullington, corporate archivist at McDonald's, said that Kroc stressed that the firm ""would only be as successful as its franchisees.""Being flexible was crucial in propelling Kroc toward mammoth success. In the early years, even though the number of restaurants expanded fast, company earnings were minimal due to the original deal of low franchising fees.""Through 1960, when the chain's restaurants raked up $75 million in sales, McDonald's earnings were a mere $159,000,"" wrote Gross.Shifting gears, Kroc began to focus on real estate as a potential profit center, with the idea that McDonald's could make money by leasing or buying restaurant sites.From that concept came Franchise Realty Corp., which bought or leased properties that it would then sublease to franchises at a 20%, and later 40%, markup.""Franchisees would then pay McDonald's either a minimum rate or a percentage of sales, whichever was greater,"" wrote Gross. ""As sales and prices inevitably rose over the years, the company would collect more and more rent as its costs remained virtually constant.""Quality FirstMcDonald's progress came with Kroc's commitment to quality, no matter how large the operation became, said Usha Haley, a West Virginia University professor of management. ""He reduced making a good burger to a common denominator that could be replicated everywhere,"" Haley said. ""Everything was put into an equation, including how many ounces goes into a burger.""Kroc pointed to QSCV, which stood for quality, service, cleanliness, value. ""This was the basic DNA building block of McDonald's,"" said Haley. ""He tried to make the product of a burger into a production line, but still had quality, service and cleanliness.""Barb Schmidt, who observed that Kroc approach while she ran six McDonald's restaurants in Florida, before selling them in 1996, said: ""He was so passionate about serving the customers the highest quality food in a reasonable amount of time at an affordable price. He wanted every customer to have the same experience each and every time they came to McDonald's. He always took great pride in the service, cleanliness and friendliness of his company. I believe that is what led to the extraordinary success of McDonald's — his consistent attitude of greatness.""Kroc instituted strict quality control and guidelines for franchisees. He also gave the restaurants a certain amount of autonomy, with the idea of lifting their entrepreneurial spirit. ""He was open to listening to franchisees' ideas,"" said Haley.Some of those concepts involved new products. ""Franchises came up with Filet-O-Fish, the Big Mac and Egg McMuffin,"" said Haley.Kroc liked such results rather than being hung up on resumes.""Ray never graduated from high school,"" said Facella. ""McDonald's was about meritocracy. It didn't matter if you went to college; it was about if you could make things happen. If you were very good at what you do, you could move up.""On top of all that was Kroc's humanity, said Schmidt: ""What I remember most about this amazing man was his ability to give you his full attention when he spoke with you. I felt like I was the only person in the room.""When Facella was a midlevel manager in New York City during his 34-year career at McDonald's, he met Kroc for the first time: ""He popped out of his limo and walks up to me: 'Hi Paul, how are you today?' I said, 'It is nice to meet you, Mr. Kroc,' and he looked at me and said, 'I'm Ray. Don't call me Mr. Kroc.'""From there, the two got into an old-style limousine with a flip seat. ""Naturally, I sat in the flip seat,"" recalled Facella. ""But Ray said, 'Paul, you are my guest; you sit in the comfortable seat.' There was humility about the man. He just cared about treating people right and making them feel good, which is part of his legacy. He is someone who is truly in the top five people I will ever meet in my life.""

985,LEG,"Ctrip.com International stock surged more than 10% in midday trading in the stock market today. The surge comes after Priceline Group said late Wednesday that it's expanding its partnership with Ctrip, China's largest Web travel agency, by investing $500 million, giving Priceline as much as a 10% stake in Ctrip.
"
986,LEG,"Priceline (PCLN) also said that it will get the right to appoint an ""observer"" to Ctrip.com's (CTRP) board based on the transaction.
"
987,LEG,"Priceline stock was flat Thursday.
"
988,LEG,"Analysts mostly praised the partnership.
"
989,LEG,"""This deal will definitely increase the amount of (travel content) inventory available for both companies,"" Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo told IBD. ""The consumers who use these websites want access to as much travel services and inventory as they can.""
"
990,LEG,"Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson kept a neutral rating on Ctrip stock. But in a research note Thursday, he praised the deal.
"
991,LEG,"""The expanded Ctrip and Priceline partnership appears to be a win-win,"" Olson wrote. ""We believe this deal furthers an already symbiotic relationship that allows Priceline to have exposure to the fastest-growing segment of the China market, outbound travel, and provides Ctrip with the most extensive inventory for China travelers looking to book such outbound itineraries.""
"
992,LEG,"Priceline is making a concerted, but somewhat belated, move to tap the enormous potential of China's online travel market, Maggie Rauch, an analyst with online travel tracker PhoCusWright, told IBD.
"
993,LEG,"""China remains a huge opportunity for online travel,"" Rauch said.
"
994,LEG,"That nation's online travel market grew 29% in 2013, she says, to $18.2 billion in revenue. PhoCusWright expects similar annual growth through 2016.
"
995,LEG,"Yet ""the percent of travel sold online in China is still quite low — we have it pegged at 23% for 2015,"" Rauch said. ""For a global company like Priceline (that's) looking to keep growing, they almost have to do something in this market, but it's too late to just jump in on their own.""
"
996,LEG,"For Ctrip, Rauch says, the latest deal with Priceline gives it access to travel content that it ""definitely needs."" The content includes more hotel inventory, car rental and restaurant bookings through Priceline's recent acquisition of OpenTable.
"
997,LEG,"""Ctrip has been very aggressively expanding their product line, pushing beyond the traditional, and largely domestic, flight/hotel/package business, and they will benefit from having access to these products for China's rapidly growing outbound travel market,"" Rauch said.
"
998,LEG,"Priceline will invest its $500 million in Ctrip through a convertible bond. Ctrip will allow Priceline to acquire Ctrip stock in the open market over the next 12 months. Priceline will end up with as much as 10% of Ctrip's outstanding shares, the companies said.
"
999,LEG,"Piper Jaffray's Olson estimates that the expanded partnership will give Ctrip access to more than 500,000 accommodations outside of China, while Priceline will be able to market more than 100,000 Ctrip properties in the greater China region to its customers.
"
1000,LEG,"Priceline and rival Expedia (EXPE) have both stepped up efforts in China and Asia-Pacific in the past year or so. Expedia operates in China through its eLong (LONG) affiliate.
"
1001,LEG,"Priceline signed its first cooperation pact with Ctrip in August 2012. The initial deal allowed Ctrip's hotel reservation service to reach Priceline unit Booking.com's portfolio of global hotels, helping Ctrip meet the growing needs of outbound Chinese travelers. Priceline, in turn, got connected to Ctrip's online travel platform. Until then, Priceline had been cautious about China and had decided against direct involvement in Chinese online travel.
"
1002,LEG,"Ctrip has also been stepping up with cooperation with metasearch travel website Qunar Cayman Islands (QUNR). Qunar is majority-owned by Chinese search engine Baidu (BIDU).
"
1003,LEG,"Qunar has overtaken Ctrip in some travel areas, and there have been rumors in the Chinese press that Ctrip is in talks to acquire Qunar.
"

1006,LEG,"RELATED: Priceline Hits Warp Speed In Online Travel ServicesCtrip.com International stock surged more than 10% in midday trading in the stock market today. The surge comes after Priceline Group said late Wednesday that it's expanding its partnership with Ctrip, China's largest Web travel agency, by investing $500 million, giving Priceline as much as a 10% stake in Ctrip.Priceline (PCLN) also said that it will get the right to appoint an ""observer"" to Ctrip.com's (CTRP) board based on the transaction.Priceline stock was flat Thursday.Analysts mostly praised the partnership.""This deal will definitely increase the amount of (travel content) inventory available for both companies,"" Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo told IBD. ""The consumers who use these websites want access to as much travel services and inventory as they can.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson kept a neutral rating on Ctrip stock. But in a research note Thursday, he praised the deal.""The expanded Ctrip and Priceline partnership appears to be a win-win,"" Olson wrote. ""We believe this deal furthers an already symbiotic relationship that allows Priceline to have exposure to the fastest-growing segment of the China market, outbound travel, and provides Ctrip with the most extensive inventory for China travelers looking to book such outbound itineraries.""Priceline is making a concerted, but somewhat belated, move to tap the enormous potential of China's online travel market, Maggie Rauch, an analyst with online travel tracker PhoCusWright, told IBD.""China remains a huge opportunity for online travel,"" Rauch said.That nation's online travel market grew 29% in 2013, she says, to $18.2 billion in revenue. PhoCusWright expects similar annual growth through 2016.Yet ""the percent of travel sold online in China is still quite low — we have it pegged at 23% for 2015,"" Rauch said. ""For a global company like Priceline (that's) looking to keep growing, they almost have to do something in this market, but it's too late to just jump in on their own.""For Ctrip, Rauch says, the latest deal with Priceline gives it access to travel content that it ""definitely needs."" The content includes more hotel inventory, car rental and restaurant bookings through Priceline's recent acquisition of OpenTable.""Ctrip has been very aggressively expanding their product line, pushing beyond the traditional, and largely domestic, flight/hotel/package business, and they will benefit from having access to these products for China's rapidly growing outbound travel market,"" Rauch said.Priceline will invest its $500 million in Ctrip through a convertible bond. Ctrip will allow Priceline to acquire Ctrip stock in the open market over the next 12 months. Priceline will end up with as much as 10% of Ctrip's outstanding shares, the companies said.Piper Jaffray's Olson estimates that the expanded partnership will give Ctrip access to more than 500,000 accommodations outside of China, while Priceline will be able to market more than 100,000 Ctrip properties in the greater China region to its customers.Priceline and rival Expedia (EXPE) have both stepped up efforts in China and Asia-Pacific in the past year or so. Expedia operates in China through its eLong (LONG) affiliate.Priceline signed its first cooperation pact with Ctrip in August 2012. The initial deal allowed Ctrip's hotel reservation service to reach Priceline unit Booking.com's portfolio of global hotels, helping Ctrip meet the growing needs of outbound Chinese travelers. Priceline, in turn, got connected to Ctrip's online travel platform. Until then, Priceline had been cautious about China and had decided against direct involvement in Chinese online travel.Ctrip has also been stepping up with cooperation with metasearch travel website Qunar Cayman Islands (QUNR). Qunar is majority-owned by Chinese search engine Baidu (BIDU).Qunar has overtaken Ctrip in some travel areas, and there have been rumors in the Chinese press that Ctrip is in talks to acquire Qunar.By 2030, the Boston Consulting Group estimates, 49% of all passenger traffic globally (including air, ship and other forms of travel) will involve the Asia-Pacific region. Chinese travelers will make up about 40% of all Asian outbound travelers by 2030, BCG says.Priceline is slated to report its Q2 earnings before the market open on Monday.RELATED: Priceline Hits Warp Speed In Online Travel Services

1007,LEG,"Heading into the last hectic weekend of the 2014 midterm election campaign, a couple of revealing findings stick out that are ominous for Democrats:Young 'Hope & Change' voters, who formed the core of Barack Obama's 2008 victory, have drifted away from their guy. In other words, they are growing up.Second, Latinos, another leg on the aging Obama support stool, are flaking off too.Besides his vigorous fundraising efforts, the Democrat president has spent much of his campaign effort this year working on his party's election day turnout, historically a flaccid factor in liberal midterm balloting. But that may not help much because the base he's trying to turn out has changed.Conservatives, on the other hand, have a traditional stake in turning out. This time it's especially driven by opposition to Obama policies and pushing GOP candidates to control six more seats to control the Senate, stall Obama's remaining liberal agenda and and help Harry Reid find his way to Sunny Acres.Among the youths surveyed by Harvard's Institute of Politics, a majority voted for Obama in 2012 and 64% said there's at least a 50-50 chance of their voting next Tuesday. But 43% consider the country headed in the wrong direction. They disapprove of everybody's job performance in Washington: Obama (53%), Democrats in Congress (60%) and Republicans there (72%).They disapprove of Obama's job on the economy (60%), ObamaCare (57%), the deficit (65%), foreign policy (60%) and immigration (61%).But -- and here's the key -- youths who voted in 2008 went for Obama by 34 points and 23 points in 2012. Even in 2010, a really bad year for Obama's party, youths supported Democrats 55%-43%.This time, however, that same cohort will be voting for a GOP-controlled Congress 51%-47%.As for Latinos, an increasingly important sector of the electorate, the new ABC News-Washington Post Poll shows they are just fine with Republicans taking control of both houses on Capitol Hill. Fifty percent say it doesn't matter which party controls Congress. Worse for Obama, now out on his longest campaign swing of the cycle, 30% say it would be a good thing if Republicans win control of the Senate. That's twice the size of those who say bad thing.

"
1024,LEG,"One of Alibaba's biggest hurdles here is its little-known brand. A recent survey by online retail researcher Bizrate Insights found that 63% of online buyers, skewing toward younger consumers and women, aren't familiar with Alibaba's brand or website. Of the 37% that had heard of Alibaba, only 30% of them (11% overall) said they had browsed the site.

1025,LEG,"""Alibaba has to raise its brand awareness,"" Bizrate Insights Vice President Hayley Silver told IBD.
"
1026,LEG,"With no U.S.-based e-commerce operation, Silver says consumers have to order items from Alibaba's English-language Chinese website. She says shipping from China is slow and she questions how well Chinese customer service reps would handle complaints. Also, Alibaba's site features made-in-China items, a turn-off for shoppers here who prefer American-made goods.
"
1027,LEG,"In one of its biggest moves in the U.S., Alibaba has taken a 39% stake in San Mateo, Calif.-based ShopRunner, a smaller, members-only rival of Amazon. Headed by former Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Scott Thompson, ShopRunner offers free shipping for online orders in a program that resembles Amazon Prime.
"
1028,LEG,"ShopRunner is preparing a joint service with Alibaba that provides U.S. brands with a direct way to sell to China's consumers. When it's up and running, the 300 million-plus Chinese users of Alibaba's AliPay payments service will be able to order products directly from the U.S. websites of ShopRunner partners like Neiman Marcus (NMG) and Nine West, and have the goods delivered from the U.S. to China in 10 days.
"
1029,LEG,"The joint service reportedly will launch by year-end. A ShopRunner spokesperson declined to comment. But when it does launch, the China-centric Alibaba/ShopRunner partnership likely will do little to churn up business for Alibaba with U.S. shoppers.

1031,LEG,"With the motivation and the money, some observes expect Alibaba will make a big acquisition in the U.S. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said in an Oct. 1 report that eBay's Marketplaces businesses makes it a tempting target for Alibaba. Marketplaces is second only to Amazon in e-commerce sales.
"
1032,LEG,"But Carnegie Towers' Tang says Alibaba could get U.S. traction by acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, similar to what eBay does now and something it could do without acquiring eBay.
"
1033,LEG,"Tang says Alibaba could rely on the in-house inventories of U.S. brands and makers who sell on its site. He says it could rely on the existing facilities of these sellers and shippers like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) without building a fulfillment network like Amazon.

1044,LEG,"How To Invest In A Choppy Stock MarketBankers count money. Sleepy people count sheep. Successful investors count bases — even during choppy stock markets — to understand where a good stock is in its current upward move.A stock goes public, moves sideways for a while and before you know it, it breaks out from a first-stage IPO base. It rallies 20% or more and takes another breather. Soon enough, the stock breaks out from a second-stage base. Another strong 20% rally and a breakout from a third-stage base. And so on.Breakouts from later-stage bases can work, but after a big price run for a stock, they're definitely more risky.Note that when a stock clears a first-stage base, rallies less than 20% and forms a new base, the new base is still considered first-stage.In a volatile market, a stock can form a base-on-base pattern, or a base next to a base. A base-on-base forms above the prior buy point. A base next to a base can form below the prior buy point, but it needs to hold above the low of the prior base. Both bases count as one base.When a stock breaks out, sometimes it heads significantly lower in price. While doing so, the stock also undercuts the intraday low of the most recently completed base. This move resets the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that selling is intense enough to wipe the slate clean of willing sellers, paving the way for another potential leg up.Sherwin-Williams (SHW) formed a base next to a base when major averages started to weaken in the fall of 2012. The first cup-shaped base corrected 12% and showed a bullish accumulation week in the week ended Nov. 16 (1). The second flat base corrected 8% (2). A breakout soon followed in early January. The breakout stuttered, but the stock never fell more than 4% below the 159.90 entry (3).At a time when the Nasdaq corrected about 12% off its high, Sherwin-Williams' strength was noteworthy. Keep in mind that it's common for a growth stock to correct as much 1.5 to 2.5 times as much as the broad market. Sherwin-Williams pulled back mostly in line with the market.It wasn't easy to hold the stock when it started to move sideways in June (4), but Sherwin-Williams held comfortably above the buy point.And it rewarded patience. In 2013-2014, the stock rose 71% vs. the S&P 500's 44% return.How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market

1052,LEG,"Scandal: In defending an agency riddled with corruption and criminal negligence, Veterans Administration Secretary Robert McDonald slanders Rep. Mike Coffman, a Marine vet who served two tours of duty in Iraq.The contemptuous arrogance that riddles the Obama administration and the disdain that it holds for our veterans and military was reflected in McDonald's belligerent and arrogant testimony in a budget hearing before the House Veterans' Committee on Wednesday.When Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., questioned McDonald about an over-budget VA construction project in Denver, and expressed the view that McDonald would not be successful in changing the VA's culture, McDonald took offense.The bureaucrat responded that the construction problems in Denver were more Coffman's problem than his and offered the congressman his cell phone to call veterans and find out how much conditions have improved since McDonald took over the troubled department.""I've run a large company, sir. What have you done?"" McDonald asked Coffman.Well, what Coffman has done is serve his country for 22 years in both the Army and the Marines. He is a veteran of both Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. He didn't need McDonald's cell phone to call veterans, because he is one and has seen firsthand the grievous wounds and other conditions that veterans returned home with, only to find themselves on VA waiting lists. Some die before they can be treated; others commit suicide.Coffman's time expired before he could adequately respond. But he posted later on his Facebook page that what he hadn't done was ""run a federal agency that tolerates corruption the way the VA has"" or ""been a shill for inept bureaucrats who allow American heroes to die on a medical waiting list while waiting for medical service.""Perhaps McDonald should use his cell phone to call Sally Barnes-Breen. She brought her father-in-law, Thomas Francis Breen, a 71-year-old Navy veteran, to the Phoenix VA hospital with blood in his urine on Sept. 28, 2013. He was sent home without treatment and told to wait. On Nov. 30, 2013, Breen died, becoming one of the scores of casualties of the Obama administration's indifference to the veterans who served their country.On Dec. 6, 2013, Sally Barnes-Breen got a phone call from the VA. An appointment had been made for her father-in-law — more than a month after he had died from Stage 4 bladder cancer. The appointment was with a rheumatologist to look at his prosthetic leg. Thomas Breen had served his country well, better than his country served him.On April 9, 2009, with then Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki by his side, President Obama said, ""As long as I'm commander in chief, I promise that we will work tirelessly to meet that mission and make sure that all those who wear this nation's uniform know this: When you come home to America, America will be there for you.""Despite these stirring words, something was seriously wrong; the corruption and neglect continued and proceeded to get worse.McDonald serves a commander in chief whose motorcade recently passed, without stopping, the Phoenix VA hospital where the VA scandal broke. It's the facility where veterans died on waiting lists, ignored by a president who literally gives active-duty soldiers pink slips on the battlefield while welcoming the family of alleged deserter Bowe Bergdahl at the White House.Suck it up, Mr. McDonald, and do your job to make things right. Our veterans deserve the VA's mea culpas, not belligerence toward an elected veteran.McDonald, a former Procter and Gamble CEO, certainly knows how to make soap. Perhaps he should wash his mouth out with some.

1053,LEG,"How To Invest In A Choppy Stock Market
"
1054,LEG,"Growth investors, learning from experience, tend to lose patience with a stock that breaks out and stalls. Their best trades tend to move higher right away, and the early poor performers tend to be the weeds in the garden. Before digging out the weeds, though, it's worthwhile to ask if the problem is a weak stock or a weak market.
"
1055,LEG,"In either case you're not making money, so what's the difference? A weak stock deserves a pass; find a better one that is delivering. But if it's a strong stock in a weak market, you might be looking at the beginnings of a great setup.
"
1056,LEG,"In fact, a strong stock in a weak market is the recipe for a base-on-base formation.
"
1057,LEG,"""What happens is that a powerful stock breaks out of its base and advances, but is unable to increase a normal 20% to 30% because the general market begins another leg down,"" William O'Neil wrote in How to Make Money in Stocks. ""When the bearish phase in the overall market ends, as it always does at some point, this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain.""
"
1058,LEG,"Check the stock's relative strength line. Is it trending higher or lower? Higher, and it's outperforming the market. If lower, it's underperforming. Is the market making lower lows, yet the stock is able to climb and hold higher? Countertrend strength is a trait many emerging leaders show.
"
1059,LEG,"To interpret a base-on-base, first make sure you have a solid understanding of the primary base patterns — the cup-with-handle, double-bottom and flat base. The base-on-base is just a combination of two such patterns of bullish price action.
"
1060,LEG,"The second base in the pattern should find support on top of the first base, or at least in the base's upper half. Base-on-base patterns that fall all the way back to the lows of the first base are weaker.
"
1061,LEG,"As with any base, you want to see areas of tight trading, institutional accumulation and selling dry-ups in key spots. For base counting purposes, the whole pattern counts as one stage.
"
1062,LEG,"However, if the stock undercuts the low of the first base, it is no longer a base-on-base. Instead, count it as a whole new pattern and reset the base count.
"
1063,LEG,"The overall pattern is an expression of leading stocks, which often find support on top of prior basing areas and break out to new highs soon after the market bottoms.
"
1064,LEG,"Southwestern Energy (SWN) made a huge advance in the mid-2000s. The stock broke out from a flat base in June 2004 and more than doubled before correcting with the market in December.
"

Their best trades tend to move higher right away, and the early poor performers tend to be the weeds in the garden. Before digging out the weeds, though, it's worthwhile to ask if the problem is a weak stock or a weak market.In either case you're not making money, so what's the difference? A weak stock deserves a pass; find a better one that is delivering. But if it's a strong stock in a weak market, you might be looking at the beginnings of a great setup.In fact, a strong stock in a weak market is the recipe for a base-on-base formation.""What happens is that a powerful stock breaks out of its base and advances, but is unable to increase a normal 20% to 30% because the general market begins another leg down,"" William O'Neil wrote in How to Make Money in Stocks. ""When the bearish phase in the overall market ends, as it always does at some point, this stock is apt to be one of the first to emerge at a new high en route to a huge gain.""Check the stock's relative strength line. Is it trending higher or lower? Higher, and it's outperforming the market. If lower, it's underperforming. Is the market making lower lows, yet the stock is able to climb and hold higher? Countertrend strength is a trait many emerging leaders show.To interpret a base-on-base, first make sure you have a solid understanding of the primary base patterns — the cup-with-handle, double-bottom and flat base. The base-on-base is just a combination of two such patterns of bullish price action.The second base in the pattern should find support on top of the first base, or at least in the base's upper half. Base-on-base patterns that fall all the way back to the lows of the first base are weaker.As with any base, you want to see areas of tight trading, institutional accumulation and selling dry-ups in key spots. For base counting purposes, the whole pattern counts as one stage.However, if the stock undercuts the low of the first base, it is no longer a base-on-base. Instead, count it as a whole new pattern and reset the base count.The overall pattern is an expression of leading stocks, which often find support on top of prior basing areas and break out to new highs soon after the market bottoms.Southwestern Energy (SWN) made a huge advance in the mid-2000s. The stock broke out from a flat base in June 2004 and more than doubled before correcting with the market in December.In January 2005, the S&P 500 made a low at 1163.75.

1077,LEG,"SAN FRANCISCO -- CyberArk (CYBR) CEO Udi Mokady surveyed the crowd. A man decked in a traditional Native American headdress passed the booth -- his movement highlighted by the nearby fire-truck-red semitrailer that Fortinet (FTNT) rolled in as its booth, and Palo Alto Networks' (PANW) towering blue signage.Tweeted photos show a bright orange fox touting social media security firm ZeroFOX. Open-source manager Black Duck Software handed out ""What the (Duck)"" T-shirts. And the entire event was overshadowed by a Terminator-Darth Vader mash-up mascot.""A lot of CEOs don't even walk the floor,"" Mokady told IBD at the annual cybersecurity RSA Conference in San Francisco's Moscone Center convention hall. ""But there are a lot of meetings that set the tone for the year, (there are) relationships happening behind closed doors.""If the RSA Conference sets the tone for the cybersecurity industry, 2016 will be marked by roaring noise -- mostly in marketing. But execs tend to agree the overarching themes for the year will center on technological leaps and possible collaboration.""Platform"" is a buzzword for a reason, Needham analyst Scott Zeller wrote in a research report after Palo Alto Networks last month crushed Wall Street's Q2 expectations. The broad-based platform approach works in security.But Palo Alto wasn't the only vendor lauding its platform-centric approach at the RSA Conference. An overwhelming majority of companies -- IBM (IBM), FireEye (FEYE) and Fortinet included -- touted their platforms.Consumers are confused, Fortinet threat researcher Derek Manky told IBD. That's where third-party testing comes into play. Fortinet calls it a ""security fabric,"" which integrates Fortinet's firewall with threat intelligence data from FortiGuard researchers.""We can say how good we are, but there are a lot of third-party vendors that are doing validation of security,"" he said.A recent test by NSS Labs ranked Fortinet's FortiGuard 3200D and Check Point Software Technology's (CHKP) 13800 NGFW Appliance as top products, blocking 99.6% of all exploits. The lab examined 13 leading products comprising 96% of the next-generation firewall market.Palo Alto Networks' PA-7050 scooted in with 95.9% effectiveness, trailing a Juniper Networks (JNPR) offering and two Cisco Systems (CSCO) products with a respective 98%, 96.5% and 96.3% scores.Confusion is lending itself to the advent of software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, former iSight Partners CEO John Watters told IBD. FireEye acquired iSight in January for $275 million and retained Watters and much of the iSight leadership team.Watters sees SaaS making a play for the platform market.""The big trends line is customers are moving from best-in-class niche product to best-in-class platform,"" he said. ""And they're moving from a self-serve model to an as-a-service model.""That shift benefits FireEye. New FireEye-as-a-Service billings nearly doubled in 2015 vs. 2014, CFO Michael Berry told analysts during the company's Q4 earnings conference call in February.Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Intel (INTC) Security and Symantec (SYMC) are leading a sector push to share threat intelligence data across the map. In 2014, the quartet became odd bedfellows in a security collaboration dubbed ""the Cyber Threat Alliance.""Davis Hake, Palo Alto Networks director of cybersecurity strategy, told IBD the group's goal is to reduce the noise generated by low-level, easy-to-launch attacks.""We take that data back out, and we work to democratize it with the rest of the security community,"" he said. ""It allows us to understand, across the community, attackers' game plans against all of these other entities.""Palo Alto Networks CEO Mark McLaughlin, on the company's recent earnings call, said the days of monetizing threat data are over. A company's value stems from its overall platform, he says.Watters disagrees: ""All the people that are driving sharing are people who don't have a bunch of intellectual property,"" he said. ""Everybody is filling up each other's in-boxes with all the same stuff. It's all the machine-generated event data.""ISight fits into a detection hole in FireEye's model, he explained.""We detect ... everything that leads up the time they hit enter on the keyboard,"" he said. ""As soon as they hit enter, we went blind because we didn't have attack surface monitoring.""FireEye's incident response leg, Mandiant, sees the attack itself, watching how hackers escalate privileges, jump firewalls and burrow through systems. ISight detects the attack prep and follows the fallout on the black market.That intelligence is proprietary, Watters said. Because of that, FireEye doesn't need to reboot its software every several years; the software is updated every hour. Fortinet makes a similar boast, noting its FortiGuard research updates systems every five minutes.Artificial intelligence (AI) won't look like Haley Joel Osment in the 2001 Steven Spielberg flick. Rather, machine-learning will be bolstered by data-heavy Internet of Things devices, Sol Cates, chief security officer for encryption specialist Vormetric, told IBD.The trend could boost the chip sector. Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) forged alliances with Facebook (FB) and Chinese Internet major Alibaba (BABA) during Q4 for speedy intelligence chips, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said during last month.Just as ""platform"" is a commonplace buzzword, so too are Big Data, the Internet of Things and the cloud, Cates says. But they'll also be integral to future technology -- and that's either a boon or a bust for the cybersecurity industry.AI generates two big questions for the sector, Cates said.""How do we protect the sensitive data going in? And how do we harness it for security?"" he asked. The problem is, the cybersecurity industry often trails innovation. ""We have to figure it out after the fact, and we're not yet experts on it.""IBM, which just acquired Resilient Systems, plans to push machine-learning to accelerate automated penetration testing, Marc van Zadelhoff, the company's security general manager, told IBD. Penetration testing -- purposefully probing a system for vulnerabilities -- will become more and more necessary in the security world as the BYOD (bring your own device) trend opens more endpoints.Gemalto exec David Etue argued during an RSA lecture that software updates could right the likely-to-occur wrongs as the cybersecurity sector tackles the Internet of Things market.""If we get this right, this puts us in a position for long-term success,"" he said.Fortinet's Manky says wrangling the Internet of Things and protecting Big Data will be more complicated than that. Industry experts estimate 20 billion-30 billion Internet-capable devices will come online in the next four years.""That generates a lot of noise, and there's a lot of traffic, you need to inspect all of that,"" Manky said. ""Anything and everything is a target now. ... If you think of any device that has an Internet connection, it's got memory, it has a processor and a connection, and that's all hackers need to go after (it).""

1081,LEG,"The question of whether Red Hat is still a high-growth company remains unanswered even after last month, when it posted fiscal Q2 revenue that rose 19% from the year-earlier quarter — its biggest rise in more than two years.Nevertheless, Red Hat's (RHT) Q3 revenue guidance was lighter than expected, with the company citing foreign currency exchange issues.The No. 1 maker of software and services for the open-source Linux operating system is amid a transition. Red Hat has capitalized on companies switching from the older Unix OS to Linux, but many analysts say that the migration is slowing. In the meantime, the company has expanded into middleware, software storage and virtualization.Red Hat has also jumped into cloud services, forging partnerships with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell, IBM (IBM) and others to build products tied to OpenStack.OpenStack is an open-source cloud software platform with broad industry backing. The software helps companies move operations onto the Internet cloud.The writing is on the wall for the Unix-to-Linux migration, says Michael Turits, an analyst for Raymond James & Associates.""Red Hat is one of these companies that had one big leg of industry growth from a core product like Linux, but that growth is maturing,"" Turits told IBD. ""To re-accelerate, the company will need additional growth from a combination of new products.""New Markets CrucialJ. Derrick Wood, an analyst for the Susquehanna Financial Group, agrees that Red Hat's future depends on moving into other areas.""They are not a mid-20% (quarterly revenue) grower anymore, but they are still a 15% to 20% grower,"" Wood said. ""That reflects moderation in the Unix-to-Linux ramp-up and other opportunities — whether it's OpenStack or storage or a lot of their middleware products — getting more traction.""But it's far from certain that the Unix-to-Linux migration is slowing, Red Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst told IBD.""It's really hard to know because when we do deals with larger companies — even ones that are using Unix — they are not saying this is Unix-to-Linux,"" he said. ""They are just buying more units, and some of those are Unix-to-Linux, and some are (Microsoft) Windows-to-Linux, and a lot of them are just pure net new workloads.""We rarely have a deal that is just Unix-to-Linux.""Red Hat posted $339.5 million in infrastructure subscription revenue — basically, its Linux business but also a few other revenue sources — for its Q2 ending Aug. 31, up 16% from the year-earlier quarter. But subscription revenue for its middleware and application-related emerging products rose 44%, to $57.5 million.The emerging app-related revenue would be $232 million on an annualized basis, showing that the company is far from stagnant, Whitehurst says.""I don't think there is any other open-source company even half that size in such subscription revenue,"" Whitehurst said, ""so it's a large and rapidly growing business for us.""Red Hat's move into OpenStack will be most crucial in accelerating growth, Turits says.""If you combine (OpenStack) with a broad portfolio of other things they are doing, including JBoss (middleware) applications and virtualization, then it's a very attractive portfolio,"" he said.Red Hat faces competition from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), VMware (VMW) and several privately held companies in the still-young OpenStack market.Differentiation will be the key to growth, Turits says.""They have to face the early stage of fragmentation in the industry where lots of people are offering OpenStack, and they have to figure out how they will bring that to market,"" he said.Red Hat is counting on partnerships with Cisco, Dell, Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Nokia (NOK) and others to gain market share in OpenStack.Pairing with hardware companies, particularly with No. 1 network gear maker Cisco, should give Red Hat an edge, Whitehurst says.""Cisco is a big company with a massive go-to-market organization, which we think can help us scale our offerings by rolling out through their distribution channel,"" he said.OpenStack looks like it will be a large opportunity for Red Hat, Whitehurst says, but he adds that investors shouldn't view OpenStack as a needed replacement for a perceived slowing of the Unix-to-Linux migration.""I think people get lost in this whole 'Red Hat is slowing down, OpenStack needs to work' thing,"" he said.

1094,LEG,"As Terrell Davis stood in the tunnel of his hometown San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium on Jan. 25, 1998, he had a lot to take in.The Denver Broncos' running back was moments away from leading his team on the biggest stage in all of sports: the Super Bowl.With 90 million people watching on TV in the U.S. and nearly 70,000 in the stands in America's Finest City, the stakes were sky-high.So was the adrenaline.So much so that the pounding tailback had forgotten a vital part of his routine: taking his migraine medicine with his pregame meal.The football player who played a position known for escaping disaster had set himself up for one.And it could strike at any time.Davis rushed to the locker room and downed the pills 10 minutes before kickoff, but it was too late.Down, Not OutAfter a first-half hit to the helmet from a Green Bay Packers defender, the nemesis that had bothered Davis since childhood reappeared.And there was no running away from it.With Davis' head pounding and his vision blurred, the only question was: What now?""There was no other option,"" Davis, 42, told IBD. ""I didn't think about any other choice. I figured I just had to go deal with it for the next 2-1/2 hours. If I missed that game, I knew it would be my biggest regret ever.""Davis bounced back from that hit with a vengeance — rushing for 157 yards and three touchdowns in a legendary Most Valuable Player performance to drive Denver to a 31-24 upset triumph and its first National Football League title.But life wasn't so glittery for Terrell Lamar Davis while he was growing up in Southern California.When the migraines — which started at age 7 — weren't bothering him, the kid had headaches to deal with at home. Living in San Diego's Lincoln Park neighborhood was rough enough, with its drugs and gangs.While Davis' mother, Kateree, worked long hours as a nurse, Davis' dad, Joe, added to the noxious environment.The man who loved alcohol and guns was never shy about it.Joe played disciplinarian to Terrell and his five brothers, and sometimes it got ugly.When Terrell was 9, Joe ordered all six boys to stand with their backs to the living room wall. The patriarch stood in front of them and fired a handgun into the paint just above their heads.The bullet missed Terrell by only inches, but his dad couldn't dodge the demons.While Joe was in and out of jail, Terrell's trigger became sports. Having five siblings brought out his best.""That's where you get your first competition,"" said Davis. ""Being the youngest, I always had to fight to catch up. Whether it was soccer, football, baseball, marbles ... it didn't matter. My goal was always to beat them.""Davis excelled in Pop Warner football as a youth but had a shaky start to high school.Joe died of lupus in 1987, and his death took a toll on the 14-year-old freshman. ""You never think a parent is going to leave this world that early,"" said Davis, ""so I went into a little depression. I started failing school, skipping class.""Another harrowing incident involving a firearm the next year made Terrell recoil.After a shotgun was put to his face at a late-night party, he knew things had to change.The next morning, ""I woke up thinking, 'I've gotta get my life back on track,'"" he said.He changed schools, got his grades up and got serious about his sport. The hard work paid off in the form of a football scholarship to Long Beach State University.Davis went there to play for George Allen, who had coached the Washington Redskins to a Super Bowl and would be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.From California To GeorgiaThe college ride was bumpy.In order to gain an extra year of eligibility, Davis sat out his first season, redshirting at Long Beach in 1990. Then Allen died of a heart attack that December.Davis played five games at running back for the 49ers in 1991 before the school cut football due to budget concerns.With no team to play for, Davis was thrown a bone by a Bulldog.The University of Georgia called Long Beach's coaching staff to see if any players on the defunct 49ers were worthy of playing in the mighty Southeastern Conference.A coach recommended Davis, and Georgia flew the running back out to Athens.Bulldogs offensive coordinator Wayne McDuffie met with Davis, watched his Long Beach game tapes and offered him a scholarship.With Davis now at Georgia, his future looked peachy.In his three years in the SEC, Davis never topped 1,000 yards rushing in a season and injured his hamstring twice. But the 5-foot-11, 210-pounder averaged a stout 5.2 yards per carry, enough to convince Denver he was worth a draft selection.Davis went into his first NFL training camp at the bottom of the depth chart.It was a challenge for the sixth-round pick to make the Broncos' opening day roster, but Davis was up for it.During a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers in Tokyo, he raced down the field on a third-quarter kickoff and flattened the 49ers' return man, sending him backward three yards.The Denver sideline went nuts, and Davis knew that he had arrived.With each preseason game that summer, he got more carries at running back until head coach Mike Shanahan named him a starter for the season opener — an astounding feat considering where he had come from just a few weeks earlier.Davis knew early on that he and the Broncos would last.""It was the first time in my career where I heard a coach tell me that a 3- or 4-yard run was a beautiful thing,"" Davis said of his first days in the Mile High City. ""We're conditioned growing up to always try to hit that home run ball, but the way Denver's offense was designed fit my style of running, which was downhill. It fit like a glove, and I just ran with it.""Denver GallopDavis rode hard with the Broncos.He tallied 1,117 yards rushing his rookie season and followed with 1,538 — good enough for second in the league — in 1996.Davis' vision is partly what set him apart, contends Brian Habib, who blocked for him in Denver.""TD was a very physical specimen, really smart and patient,"" said the former guard. ""He was really good at reading the way things were setting up in front of him and had an uncanny ability to cut back across the grain and gain 10-20 yards. If I'm not mistaken, a majority of his big plays came on cutback runs.""Davis was selected to the Pro Bowl three times with serious production. He won the Associated Press' MVP trophy for the 1998 regular season after leading the league with 2,008 yards rushing. He sped to 102 yards in the Broncos' 34-19 rout of Atlanta in the 1999 Super Bowl, making it two straight Denver titles. During Denver's two Super Bowl runs, T.D., as he was nicknamed, topped 100 rushing yards in all seven playoff games.Davis' career was ultimately cut short due to leg injuries, but the 2007 inductee into the Broncos Ring of Fame — and a finalist heading into the Pro Football Hall of Fame selections this weekend — carried Denver during much of his seven seasons.And he especially came through in the Super Bowl 17 years ago.""Mike (Shanahan) used him as a decoy on one of our scoring plays, but I didn't know about that until after the game,"" said Habib, now a real estate agent in the Rancho Bernardo area of San Diego. ""When Terrell was in there, we were running the ball very effectively. He kept ripping off bigger and bigger chunks of yardage and pretty much put the team on his back that day.""Davis remembers the jubilation of his first championship, comparing it to a sensation that investors can relate to.""It's like seeing a vision come to fruition,"" said Davis, now an analyst for NFL Network. ""It's euphoric — like buying a stock low and watching it jump and then cashing out — that same joy of winning, where you know you worked hard. If you're a competitor in anything, it's a beautiful feeling when that happens.""

1098,LEG,"For Mickey Mantle, dad knew best, especially when it mattered most.Mantle was born with top physical ability and a father who knew how to get the most out of him. A semipro player, Mutt Mantle didn't push his son to play baseball as much as he taught him to love it.And America loved Mickey Mantle (1931-95). He epitomized the baseball era of the 1950s, when the game was king, the New York Yankees its royal family and Mantle, with his all-American good looks, enthusiasm, blazing speed and prodigious home runs, its prince.But the future Hall of Famer, who helped the Yankees capture seven world titles — while slugging a record 18 World Series homers — almost quit before he started.Mantle hit well in his two minor league seasons, 1949 and 1950, before making New York's opening day roster in 1951 on the basis of an impressive spring training. But by July 15, manager Casey Stengel decided the 19-year-old needed more seasoning in the minors.Down, Not OutAt the club's Triple A affiliate in Kansas City, Mo., Mantle fell into an 0-for-22 batting slump. His one hit before that had been a bunt single that he was quite proud of. Manager George Selkirk wasn't, snapping after the inning, ""They sent you down here to hit.""Finally, Mantle reached his breaking point. ""Whatever I had had, I told myself, I had lost it now and my baseball career was over,"" he wrote in 1967's ""The Education of a Baseball Player."" ""I would go back home, take my job in the (lead and zinc) mines, play (semipro) ball for money in the summer. ... I knew my father would sympathize with me, for he had had his own disappointments in baseball.""Not quite. Mickey asked Mutt to come to KC. Face to face, with tears in his eyes, son told Dad to take him home. The reply was harsh: ""If that's the way you're going to take this, you don't belong in baseball anyway. If you have no more guts than that, just forget about the game completely. Come back and work in the mines, like me.""""His tone, as much as his words, went right down through me,"" the Mick recalled. ""There was not a trace of sympathy in his eye. I had been looking for a comforting pat on the back, and I had not even gotten a handshake.""That night, Mantle hit two home runs — and his trajectory was straight up. He returned to the Yankees for good in late August and starred for them over 18 seasons.""That ... was the greatest thing my father ever did for me,"" he said. ""All the encouragement he had given me when I was small, all the sacrifices he made so I could play ball when other boys were working in the mines, all the painstaking instruction he had provided — all these would have been thrown away if he had not been there that night to put the iron into my spine when it was needed most.""That mettle sustained the switch-hitting Mantle through 1964, with two of his greatest seasons coming in 1956 — the Triple Crown while leading both leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in — and 1957, when his on-base percentage soared to .512.He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974 and to Major League Baseball's All-Century Team in 1999. ""What made me a success at hitting was not what anyone taught me, but what I taught myself in hours and hours of practice,"" said Mantle, also a Gold Glove center fielder.Mantle's Yankees won 12 American League pennants. In those dozen World Series, his 40 RBIs, 42 runs and 123 total bases stand along with his homers as records.""Mickey had the will to win, and that will probably came out even more in the important ballgames, and certainly the World Series would qualify for that,"" teammate Bobby Richardson told IBD.Mantle's son Danny told IBD that his father ""was always such a competitor. The Yankees winning was very important to him.""The slugger put it another way in his 1985 book, ""The Mick"": ""I'm really a bad loser.""Take the 1960 World Series. Mantle hit .400 with three home runs and 11 RBIs, but the Yankees lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates on Bill Mazeroski's season-ending home run in the bottom of the ninth of Game 7.""I'm not embarrassed to say I cried in the clubhouse,"" Mantle wrote in 1994's ""All My Octobers."" And it lingered. ""Except for someone close to me dying, I felt as bad as I ever felt in my life.""ApplauseBobby Brown, a Mantle teammate who became the American League's president, said: ""Mickey played hard every minute he was on the field. He was a very good guy, extremely popular with all of his teammates as well as the opposing players.""Mantle's legacy also lives on through the Mantle family's charitable work. The Mickey Mantle School in New York City helps underprivileged kids with learning disabilities. The Mickey Mantle Family Fund works with the American Cancer Society. Before he died of cancer at age 63, his golf tournaments benefited the Make-A-Wish foundation. ""Dad was a very giving person,"" Danny Mantle said.The Mick was born in Spavinaw, Okla., and grew up in nearby Commerce, where his father worked in the mines. After a grueling day of work, Mutt would pitch tennis balls to the boy.Mutt had the foresight to insist Mickey learn to bat from both sides of the plate. Dad felt the game was shifting to more platoon baseball, and a good switch-hitter wouldn't be benched simply because a pitcher was a lefty or righty.By age 15, Mickey was playing in a semipro baseball league where the players could be as old as 21. This is when Yankees scout Tom Greenwade discovered the power hitter.On the day of his high school graduation in 1949, Mantle signed with the Yankees for $140 a month and a $1,150 signing bonus.Banged UpReturning to the Yankees in late August 1951 after his hot minor league stint, Mantle helped them reach the World Series.Then came disaster. In the Fall Classic against the New York Giants, Mantle wrecked his right knee trying to make a catch.He wound up in a hospital room with his father, who was dying of Hodgkin's disease, a nemesis of the Mantle family. Mutt was only 41 when he died in May 1952.Mantle's leg injury would plague him the rest of his career, but he managed to play through the pain and keep his incredible speed.In December 1951, Mantle married Merlyn Johnson. The union produced four sons. The family wrote a 1996 book called ""A Hero All His Life."" Mantle himself was candid in later interviews about how his alcoholism hurt him and his family and friends.In his prime, Mantle seemed indestructible. He said of his batting prowess: ""The number one consideration is to be comfortable"" at the plate. This meant developing his own batting stance and swing.Although he said he never modeled himself after any other player, he did take note of the Boston great Ted Williams, whom he called the best hitter he ever saw.""Ted showed me what it means to be aggressive at the plate,"" Mantle said. ""When he decided to go after a ball, he really attacked it, as if he meant to demolish it entirely. There was never anything defensive about his ways at the plate, no halfhearted swings or pokes. He exploded at a ball, trying to drive it as hard and as far as he could.""As Mantle played toward his final season of 1968, he found injuries harder to shrug off.""Dad played his whole career hurt,"" Danny Mantle said.Richardson said: ""His preparation was good. Mickey was ready to play every ballgame. I can't remember anytime when he wasn't ready to play and didn't inspire the other teammates.""

1099,LEG,"Jesse Owens was the ultimate sports underdog.Born in Jim Crow Alabama to dirt poor sharecroppers, he started running because it was the best free recreation.The family moved to Cleveland in 1922. Six years later, he began setting junior high school world records in track and field.In high school, he won all of the major track events that he entered.""He was the grandson of a slave at a time when African-Americans were banned from most U.S. professional sports,"" Russ Cohen, co-author of ""Baseball's Best Rookies,"" told IBD. ""He qualified for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin and, with Hitler watching, Owens won four gold medals and set world records, refuting Nazi propaganda about the superiority of the so-called Aryan race. It made him a worldwide hero, and he is considered one of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.""Owens (1913-80) was born James Cleveland Owens and called J.C., but when the family moved to Ohio, his Southern accent caused a teacher to hear his name as Jesse. It stuck.His junior-high track coach, Charles Riley, had Owens show up for early morning one-on-one training before school, since the boy had to work in a shoe repair shop afterward. Riley continued developing the teen's talent when Owens started high school in 1930.On The MarkIn 1933, Owens caught on nationally with stunning high school numbers: 9.4 seconds in the 100-yard dash, 20.7 seconds in the 220, and 24 feet 11-3/4 inches in the long jump.Dozens of colleges offered him scholarships, but he chose Ohio State University in Columbus to be near home, even though it had no track scholarship.He had married and had a son by this time and supported the family by working as an elevator operator, waiter, service station attendant and as a page in the legislature.While at OSU, he won eight straight individual National Collegiate Athletic Association championships. By 1935, with Owens towering at the Big Ten championships in Ann Arbor, Mich., people began buzzing about him as an Olympian in Berlin the next year.""Owens showed that he had absolutely incredible ability to focus on the task at hand when he set three world records and tied a fourth at the Big Ten in less than an hour, including a long jump of 26 feet 8-1/4 inches that would stand for 25 years,"" said Daniel James Brown, author of ""The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.""""He didn't let the first triumph distract him, nor the fact that he was in pain from an accident. He kept his head down and kept competing as hard and fast as he could, putting one foot in front of the other. That's focus.""Some Americans advocated a boycott of the Berlin Games because of Nazi attacks on Jews. But Avery Brundage — head of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), which determined who qualified for the team — wanted to believe German promises that there would be no discrimination at the extravaganza.Of the 49 Americans, only Owens qualified for more than one event. And he was ready for glory.His first chance to win gold came on Aug. 3, 1936, in the 100-meter final run — considered by many the most glamorous competition.A crowd of 110,000, mostly Germans, packed the stadium. The track was muddy, but Owens tied the world record in 10.3 seconds anyway, winning the gold medal.""Much to the fuehrer's chagrin, the crowd went ecstatic,"" wrote Guy Walters in ""Berlin Games: How Hitler Stole the Olympic Dream."" ""They shouted, 'Yess-say Oh-vens!' over and over. He had won, but a world record was denied him because of a 6 mph tailwind.""Owens recalled: ""The greatest moment of all, of course, was when we knelt and received the Wreath of Victory, and standing there facing the stands we could hear the strains of 'The Star-Spangled Banner.'""In the afternoon the next day came the finals for the long jump, best of three attempts.Owens' first two had flaws such as stepping over the starting line. To avoid repeating the error in his last effort, he began the leap a foot before the line and still set an Olympic record with 26 feet 5-1/4 inches, which would stand for 24 years.""Leni Riefenstahl's film of the Games, 'Olympia,' released in 1938, was hailed by critics as one of the cinema's greatest achievements,"" wrote Jeremy Schaap in ""Triumph: The Untold Story of Jesse Owens and Hitler's Olympics."" ""The hero is clearly Owens, showing him making his final long jump. Afterward, on his face there is a smile of deep satisfaction. He is serene and handsome. Riefenstahl's message is clear: Look closely. Here is your superman.""On Aug. 5, Owens faced difficult conditions for the 200-meter dash, again on a muddy track, but smashed the world record in 20.7 seconds. The crowd went wild.The third gold was expected to be his last. But he was substituted for the 400-meter, four-man relay on Aug. 9.The crowd itself was the largest in the history of the Olympics at 120,000 as it watched the Americans win. Owens completed his first leg in 39.8 seconds, an Olympic and world record.GlisteningOwens had captured four gold medals. He was the only American to do so in track and field in a single Olympics until Carl Lewis in 1984.Although Hitler was upset by the performance of the black athletes, especially Owens, the Nazi regime achieved its goal of putting on a good show and demonstrating German athleticism.""Germany was undeniably the victor of the Games, winning a total of 89 medals, of which 33 were gold,"" wrote Walters. ""The U.S. came second, with 56 medals, of which 24 were gold. Owens was the hero of the Olympic fortnight, but he was rarely treated as one.""He stayed with the U.S. team in Europe after the Games, putting on free exhibitions, as required by their amateur status, while the AAU raked in extra money.After he ran out of cash to even buy food, he told Brundage he wouldn't show up at another event in Sweden. Owens wanted to return home for the endorsement and showbiz offers that he had received by telegram.The AAU boss responded by expelling him from amateur athletics forever, despite appeals from other top athletes.Owens met his wife when his ship arrived in New York later in August 1936, but many hotels refused them because of their race. Finally, one said they could have a room if they used the service entrance.On To OhioBack in Cleveland, Owens found a job as a playground director working with underprivileged kids. The work would remain a passion.Owens tried to capitalize on the offers that came right after his Olympic triumphs.""Not surprisingly, the promises of easy wealth were all lies,"" wrote Schaap. ""All those telegrams ... were publicity stunts, designed to place names in newspaper columns. Eventually, Owens tried to cash in on his fame with a chain of dry-cleaning stores. They failed.""Also, Owens became the owner of a baseball team in a new all-black league, but it flopped.He ran in exhibition races against horses and worked as a gas pump attendant but had to file for bankruptcy in 1939.By the 1950s, he finally found his professional calling when he moved to Chicago to serve as a physical education guru for the state of Illinois, telling his story to inspire students. He also began traveling the world to speak as a goodwill ambassador for the Olympics and America.On the business side, he served as an executive for a sporting goods company and did PR and consulting work for other corporations, from Ford Motor (F) to the oil firm Atlantic Richfield.In 1976, President Gerald Ford presented him with the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.Four years later, Owens died of lung cancer at age 66 due to the habit of smoking cigarettes, which he had picked up at 32.""In his obituaries, he was called, unfailingly, the greatest of all Olympic stars,"" wrote Schaap. ""Even today more than a century after the revival of the Games, he remains their ultimate champion.""Owens' humanitarian ideals continue to be supported by his family through the Jesse Owens Foundation and the Olympian's website.

1116,LEG,"Text of President Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are fifteen years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.  But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service.America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another — or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.They were young and in love in America, and it doesn’t get much better than that.“If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.”As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction — and home for dinner every night.“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled.  You are the reason I ran for this office.  You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.<[>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  And more Americans finish college than ever before.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way.  We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.  But here’s the thing — those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet — tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.That’s what middle-class economics is — the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.  We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success — we want everyone to contribute to our success.So what does middle-class economics require in our time?First — middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement — and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.Here’s one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority — so this country provided universal childcare.  In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.It’s not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.  It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America — by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.Here’s another example.  Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave.  Forty-three million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  It’s the right thing to do.Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  Really.  It’s 2015.  It’s time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship.  That’s not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage — these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  That is a fact.  And that’s what all of us — Republicans and Democrats alike — were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world.  But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education.  Two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero.  Forty percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt.  Understand, you’ve got to earn it — you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran.Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.  Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago — jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  That’s why the third part of middle-class economics is about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure — modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen?  We should write those rules.  We should level the playing field.  That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair.Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.  But ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China.  Let’s give them one more reason to get it done.21st century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development.  I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine — one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.  In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.  Tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes — and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs — converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay.  Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.  In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.  Good luck, Captain — and make sure to Instagram it.Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there’s bipartisan support in this chamber.  Members of both parties have told me so.  Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.  As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.  They’ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don’t need, denying a break to middle class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that.  Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.  Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.  We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.  We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.  Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness.  This is where America needs to go.  I believe it’s where the American people want to go.  It will make our economy stronger a year from now, fifteen years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if there’s one thing this new century has taught us, it’s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.  In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.  When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military — then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.  That’s what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.  That’s exactly what we’re doing right now — and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists — from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.  We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we’ve learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years.Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we’ve trained their security forces, who’ve now taken the lead, and we’ve honored our troops’ sacrifice by supporting that country’s first democratic transition.  Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance.  Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.  We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.  This effort will take time.  It will require focus.  But we will succeed.  And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.  We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.  Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.That’s how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new.  Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.  And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.  As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of “small steps.”  These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.  And after years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.  Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we’ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.  Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies — including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.  But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails — alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.  It doesn’t make sense.  That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.  The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, we’re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.  We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism.  And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children’s information.  If we don’t act, we’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.  If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola — saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.  I couldn’t be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done — and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules — in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.  And no challenge — no challenge — poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does — 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.I’ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they’re not scientists; that we don’t have enough information to act.  Well, I’m not a scientist, either.  But you know what — I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities.  The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.That’s why, over the past six years, we’ve done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it.  That’s why we’ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.  And that’s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.  I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action.  In Beijing, we made an historic announcement — the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.  And because the world’s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we’ve got.There’s one last pillar to our leadership — and that’s the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I’ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.  It’s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.  It’s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims — the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.  That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.  We do these things not only because they’re right, but because they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice — so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.  Since I’ve been President, we’ve worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half.  Now it’s time to finish the job.  And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It’s not who we are.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties — and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.  So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven’t.  As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.  And next month, we’ll issue a report on how we’re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past.  Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.  Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.  Leading — always — with the example of our values.  That’s what makes us exceptional.  That’s what keeps us strong.  And that’s why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards — our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn’t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America — but a United States of America.  I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home — a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world’s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision.  How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.  It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws — of which there are many — but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naïve, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.I know how tempting such cynicism may be.  But I still think the cynics are wrong.I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.  I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.  I’ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London.  I’ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia.  I’ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.  I’ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home.  So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother’s keeper, and our sister’s keeper.  And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.  So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes.  I’ve served in Congress with many of you.  I know many of you well.  There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.  And many of you have told me that this isn’t what you signed up for — arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.  Imagine if we did something different.Understand — a better politics isn’t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.  A better politics is one where we appeal to each other’s basic decency instead of our basest fears.  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives.  A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America.If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments — but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.  We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs.Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it’s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.  But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed.  Surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.  Surely we can agree it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all.That’s a better politics.  That’s how we start rebuilding trust.  That’s how we move this country forward.  That’s what the American people want.  That’s what they deserve.I have no more campaigns to run.  My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I’ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol — to do what I believe is best for America.  If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you’ll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth — that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood:  your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids.I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen — man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:  that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past six years:  “It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family.  We, too, have made it through some hard times.  Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.  We’ve laid a new foundation.  A brighter future is ours to write.  Let’s begin this new chapter — together — and let’s start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. ####

1119,LEG,"With a bevy of tech leaders set to report December-quarter earnings, Wall Street's outlook is more cautious than it was three months ago.
"
1120,LEG,"Concerns about weakness in China and Europe and the strong dollar are among reasons 20 of the 64 tech companies in the S&P 500 have issued negative guidance for the quarter, meaning their outlook lags analyst consensus. Just four have positive views, while the others don't give guidance.
"
1121,LEG,"""Tech companies have been very conservative about guidance,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters. ""It's more negative than last quarter.""
"
1122,LEG,"But all six techs that have issued Q4 earnings thus far reported better-than-expected profit growth, and five also beat on revenue.
"
1123,LEG,"Tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to report, on average, earnings growth of 8.9% vs. Q4 2013. That's far above the 3.7% EPS growth expected for the S&P 500 overall. Tech revenue is expected to rise 6.4%, vs. 1.1% for the S&P 500, which is dragged down by the weakened energy sector.
"
1124,LEG,"The strongest growth of all 10 sectors in the S&P is health care, with EPS seen rising 17%, then telecom services at 13.4%, followed by technology. The weakest group is energy, with EPS expected to fall 21%.
"
1125,LEG,"The semiconductor industry is among the strongest of the 13 subgroups within the tech sector. EPS growth in this group is expected to average 33%, and revenue growth 25%, says Thomson Reuters.
"
1126,LEG,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) is the first of the big techs to report Q4 earnings, after the market close Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS minus items of 66 cents, up 29%, on sales of $14.7 billion, up 6.5%.
"
1127,LEG,"In a good sign for chips, the PC market is rebounding following more than two years of declines. Global PC shipments rose an estimated 1% to 83.7 million units in Q4 from the year-earlier period, research firm Gartner said Monday.
"
1128,LEG,"The U.S. PC market rose a strong 13% in Q4, its best holiday season in recent history, led by mobile PC devices, Gartner said.
"
1129,LEG,"Among big tech companies, IBM (IBM) and Netflix (NFLX) follow Intel, both reporting after the close Tuesday. As a broad-based tech vendor, IBM's performance is often a bellwether for information technology spending overall.
"
1130,LEG,"Gartner says global IT spending is on pace to total $3.8 trillion in 2015, a 2.4% increase from 2014. That's up from an estimated 1.9% growth in 2014, but down from its earlier projection of 3.9% growth.
"
1131,LEG,"IT Services Seen Slowing
"
1132,LEG,"The reduced outlook is largely attributed to the rising U.S. dollar as well as a modest reduction in growth expectations for devices, IT services and telecom services.
"
1133,LEG,"The rally in the dollar has been driven by U.S. economic strength and expectations for rising interest rates. It's a concern for the many tech leaders that derive a large percentage of revenue offshore, including IBM, Intel, Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL). With the U.S. dollar stronger than the euro, revenue and profit shrink when money is brought back to the U.S., and it makes U.S. exports comparatively more expensive and thus less competitive.
"
1134,LEG,"Another top tech subgroup is Internet software and services. The consensus for it is EPS growth of 19% on revenue growth of 9%.

Tech revenue is expected to rise 6.4%, vs. 1.1% for the S&P 500, which is dragged down by the weakened energy sector.The strongest growth of all 10 sectors in the S&P is health care, with EPS seen rising 17%, then telecom services at 13.4%, followed by technology. The weakest group is energy, with EPS expected to fall 21%.The semiconductor industry is among the strongest of the 13 subgroups within the tech sector. EPS growth in this group is expected to average 33%, and revenue growth 25%, says Thomson Reuters.No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) is the first of the big techs to report Q4 earnings, after the market close Thursday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS minus items of 66 cents, up 29%, on sales of $14.7 billion, up 6.5%.In a good sign for chips, the PC market is rebounding following more than two years of declines. Global PC shipments rose an estimated 1% to 83.7 million units in Q4 from the year-earlier period, research firm Gartner said Monday.The U.S. PC market rose a strong 13% in Q4, its best holiday season in recent history, led by mobile PC devices, Gartner said.Among big tech companies, IBM (IBM) and Netflix (NFLX) follow Intel, both reporting after the close Tuesday. As a broad-based tech vendor, IBM's performance is often a bellwether for information technology spending overall.Gartner says global IT spending is on pace to total $3.8 trillion in 2015, a 2.4% increase from 2014. That's up from an estimated 1.9% growth in 2014, but down from its earlier projection of 3.9% growth.IT Services Seen SlowingThe reduced outlook is largely attributed to the rising U.S. dollar as well as a modest reduction in growth expectations for devices, IT services and telecom services.The rally in the dollar has been driven by U.S. economic strength and expectations for rising interest rates. It's a concern for the many tech leaders that derive a large percentage of revenue offshore, including IBM, Intel, Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL). With the U.S. dollar stronger than the euro, revenue and profit shrink when money is brought back to the U.S., and it makes U.S. exports comparatively more expensive and thus less competitive.Another top tech subgroup is Internet software and services. The consensus for it is EPS growth of 19% on revenue growth of 9%.The underlying trends in this market remain strong as the Internet continues to take shares of user time and consumer wallets, with another leg of growth powered by mobile, wrote JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth in a report Monday.""But we also recognize that some of the early gains are behind (us) as online advertising is around 30% of total ad spend in the U.S. and Europe, and smartphone adoption has slowed,"" he wrote.Facebook (FB) is Anmuth's top pick among Internet stocks. He says the company is still in the early stages of monetizing its base of 1.4 billion global users. Facebook is slated to report earnings on Jan. 28, with Google Jan. 29, both after the close.Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report earnings Jan. 26, followed a day later by both Apple and Yahoo (YHOO).Apple's December quarter will be boosted by what, from all accounts, were strong iPhone sales, with a big indicator coming Jan. 22 before the open, when Verizon Communications (VZ) reports its Q4 results. But Apple also is generating lots of interest in wearable technology, which is expected to become a multibillion-dollar market. Apple plans to release its first smartwatch, Apple Watch, soon. ""Apple is likely to be a catalyst to accelerate the industry,"" Evercore's Mike Swierczek said in a note.

1174,LEG,"After getting a nice boost from the ongoing recovery in homebuilding demand, Eagle Materials is primed to tap into America's oil and natural gas exploration boom.
"
1175,LEG,"Eagle (EXP) provides basic building products used in residential, industrial, commercial and infrastructure construction. Its lineup includes gypsum wallboard and recycled paperboard, which sell mainly to the housing market. It also makes aggregates, concrete and cement, including specialty cement used in oil and natural gas wells.
"
1176,LEG,"Another offering that Eagle has recently added to the mix — an important one — is frac sand. It's a crush-resistant sand that drilling companies use in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to get oil or natural gas out of the ground.
"
1177,LEG,"The Dallas company has delivered a long winning streak, buoyed by the housing market recovery that has led to strong demand for products such as wallboard and cement, and price increases along the way. Earnings have climbed by at least double-digit percentages in all but one of the past 11 quarters.
"
1178,LEG,"Foray Into Fracking Sand
"
1179,LEG,"Newly added to its lineup, frac sand may spur more growth.
"
1180,LEG,"Frac sand is a so-called proppant used in the hydraulic fracturing process to help get oil and natural gas from rocky areas such as shale. In fracking, liquids are injected into the ground to make space for underlying oil or natural gas to flow through. Proppants are solids used to prop the space open during or after fracking.
"
1181,LEG,"Last year, Eagle completed a facility in Corpus Christi, Texas, to produce frac sand, and in fiscal 2015's first quarter, which ended June 30, it received the final permit needed to start operating its frac-sand mine in Utica, Ill. During the quarter, Eagle continued to process and sell purchased sand in Corpus Christi awaiting the opening of the mine in Illinois.
"
1182,LEG,"With the receipt of the final permit necessary to start up its mine, Eagle expects to be able to sell its sand through its Corpus Christi facility no later than the fiscal third quarter, primarily into Eagle Ford shale-drilling applications. The Eagle Ford shale formation is in South Texas.

But it forecasts that single-family housing starts will rise 34.8% to 875,000 in 2015. It sees a 34% gain in 2016 to 1.173 million.Melman says demand is strong for Eagle's gypsum wallboard and should stay there, though its margins could possibly get ""squeezed a little if it can't get price increases.""One gauge of the homebuilding outlook is the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.Builder confidence in the market for newly built, single-family homes rose two points to 55 on the index for August. This third consecutive monthly gain brings the index to its highest level since January.""Each of the three components of the index registered consecutive gains for the past three months, which is a positive sign that builder confidence appears to be firming following an uneven spring,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe in a statement. ""Factors contributing to this rise include sustained job growth, historically low mortgage rates and affordable home prices, which are helping to unleash pent-up demand.""

1210,LEG,"Next to cups with handles, double bottoms are among the most common and important base patterns. Lots of money has been made by astute traders who buy breakouts from these bases.Can you spot a bad double bottom from a good one that you should buy?The double bottom looks like the letter W. The stock makes two declines with a brief advance in the middle. It should have the same dimensions as other bases that are usually created in market downturns. It should be at least seven weeks long and correct no more than 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times the correction in the general market.Know that the second leg down should undercut the low of the first leg. And the middle advance's high point should be at least midway up the base.The operative phrase in this column's description of double bottoms is that the base is well-formed. So when considering buying a stock breaking out of a double bottom — or any base for that matter — look for flaws.Here are some things that can go wrong in a double bottom:•The second leg didn't undercut the first. This is necessary to create one last shakeout of weak holders.• It's too deep.• It's a triple bottom. Three trips down to the bottom or more are too many. They tend to fail with regularity.• The middle advance doesn't make it to the upper half of the pattern.• It's excessively wide and loose. This applies to other bases.Experienced chart readers know that tightly constructed patterns are best. They indicate solid institutional support for a stock. The trading desks of the big mutual fund and pension companies won't let the price drop because they are always looking to add to favored positions.Take the example of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) in 2002 and 2003. A major problem with this double bottom is that it showed too many weeks with wide spreads.The week ended Oct. 11, 2002, 1 was a bullish reversal off the bottom, normally a good sign. But the weekly range was 22% from low to high. If that was the only week that did that, it might be OK. But it wasn't.The week ended July 26, 2002, 2 showed an 18.5% price spread, and the week ended Nov. 15 was 28% 3. Affiliated never made it to a new high, instead rolling over just as a new bull market was beginning.

"
1226,LEG,"MG's two-seat roadsters captured the imagination of generations of drivers, then receded into history.In its heyday — from the late 1920s to 1980 — the MG brand attracted a passionate following, especially in America.At its peak, 80% of the MG roadsters made were sold in the U.S., with California buying more MG sports cars than Great Britain.By 1980, MG was the world's top-selling sports car.Who was the force behind the MG's creation and success? Cecil Kimber — the man who turned MG into an unforgettable brand.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, most carmakers were aiming at a broad market. Kimber created a new product for a previously nonexistent market. He created the first affordable sports car.Along the way, he redefined the meaning of success.For Kimber (1888-1945), success wasn't about piling up the most money by selling bland sedans to a large market. It was about creating a car that was like a work of art.Artistry, if it is truly artful, can't be judged. Instead, it judges the viewer's ability to see.And so it was with the MG.All About The CoolThose who deemed the car too small and too lacking in horsepower missed the point. The MG was about style and handling.The little car could take a corner fast and smoothly. The MG was fun to drive, and from the start it attracted a cultlike following.Perhaps the best way to understand MG is through its initials. The letters refer to Morris Garages and were, coincidentally, GM spelled backward.Everything that GM (GM) was and became, MG wasn't and had no interest in becoming.GM was huge. MG was small.GM aimed at a broad market. MG aimed at a niche.GM was about practicality. MG was about aesthetics.How did Kimber go about creating a new product, a new market and a car that kept the magic for decades after his death?A better question might be: How could Kimber do anything less?Kimber was a five-tool talent, wielding:• Artistry.• Engineering skills.• Organizational skills.• The ability to spot and empower talented people.• An intuitive understanding of the sports car market.When William Morris, founder of carmaker Morris Garages in Oxford, England, hired Kimber in 1921, he thought he was getting a sales manager. Morris soon recognized Kimber's wide-ranging abilities. Within a year, Morris named Kimber general manager.The company prospered, making sedans and coupes.Six years later, Morris gave Kimber a new challenge. The boss set up MG Car, separate from the parent firm, and put Kimber in charge. The goal was to create an inexpensive sports car. Kimber delivered, designing and building the MG M-type Midget. The 1929 open (no top) version was priced at 175 pounds, or $4,138 in today's money. By 1932, it was the world's best-selling sports car.The Midget wasn't just a car. In the 1930s, it became a way of life in England. Adventuresome motorists drove the Midget to work, then used it for weekend races and what the British called trialing.Trialing meant driving the rugged little car off-road, across fields and up muddy hills. To MG owners, rain and mud and rough treatment didn't matter. It was all about the joy of driving an MG.For those who knew Kimber's roots, his breaking of the established mold was no surprise.Born in London, he was the son of Henry and Fanny Kimber. The family owned a printing company, and Cecil initially worked there.Kimber's true passion, though, was motorcycles — dangerously so. In his late teens, he was hit by a car while riding his cycle, suffering a damaged right leg.The accident proved pivotal. The young man was awarded insurance money, which his dad demanded he turn over to the family business.Kimber refused to be bullied. It was his leg, his injury, his money. He wasn't going to sink it into a business that he had no heart for.Kimber went off on his own.His next jobs included assistant to the chief engineer at automaker Sheffield-Simplex, a buyer for AC Cars and draftsman at auto-parts firm E.G. Wrigley.The varied experience within the same sector helped Kimber develop his five-tool talent. A look at those skills in more detail:• Artistry. Kimber's mother was an artist, and he had a similar gift. ""A sports car should look fast, even when it is standing still,"" the son said. Car design was Kimber's chief gift, by most accounts.• Engineering. When Kimber bought that first motorcycle, the first thing he did was take it apart and put it back together.""To me, he was very innovative in using other people's technology,"" Ken Langford, the Fort Worth-based historian of the Texas MG Register, told IBD. ""He adapted stuff that people had already made, adapted them to fit his cars.""• Organization. Factories were dirty places in Kimber's time. Visitors, though, marveled at the cleanliness of his MG factory in Abingdon in southern England. The floor was spotless, and departments were painted different colors.During Kimber's reign, MG workers had pride of workmanship. The attitude was: We get to make MGs.• Spotting talent. Kimber didn't get hung up on credentials. He neither resented nor insisted on proper degrees. He recruited Hubert Charles, with a sheepskin from London University, as his chief engineer. But Kimber also named former errand boy Syd Enever chief planning engineer in 1938, and Enever eventually succeeded Charles as chief engineer.Part of the reason why MG continued to succeed, even after Kimber's 1945 death in a train accident, was that he had positioned young and enthusiastic talent.John Thornley, a fan of the MG, launched an MG Car Club in 1930, when he was about 21 years old. Kimber was impressed with the kid's passion and hired him in 1931. Thornley rose in the company and became the MG general manager associated with the sports car MGB's launch.• Market smarts. Kimber understood that racing could give a sports car credibility. So he steered the MG to the racing circuit, where his car won. In 1931, Norman Black captured the Irish Grand Prix in an MG, while second and third places were also taken by MGs.OutDespite the popularity of the MG, Kimber ran afoul of Morris, who fired him in 1941.The reason is unclear. Some say that Kimber won a war-work contract without going through company channels. Yet Morris had given Kimber free rein. A second explanation is that Morris and his wife learned that Kimber had a love affair. If this was the reason, it was a bit inconsistent. According to a BBC biography, Morris had a mistress in Australia whom he visited regularly on business trips.The MG survived Kimber's firing, thanks to his proteges, Thornley and Enever.In 1980, though, MG's lone plant, in Abingdon, closed forever.What killed the MG? Government played a big role. In Britain, the prime minister pushed a merger that led to chaos by increasing the unions involved. Then there were the American regulators, who forced expensive safety changes.• Now China's government-owned SAIC Motor holds the MG brand. SAIC makes cars under the iconic title — but not a two-seat roadster.

1233,LEG,"George Patton stuck to his guns and accepted the consequences.Called an exceptional battlefield commander by numerous historians, and by President Franklin Roosevelt ""our greatest fighting general,"" Patton had one sure-fire belief: ""In war the only sure defense is offense.""So during World War II's Sicily campaign of July 1943, when he received orders from the Allied ground commander to have his 7th Army take a defensive position supporting Bernard Montgomery's British outfit, Patton challenged it.""To have adhered to this order would have been disloyal to the American Army,"" Patton wrote in ""War As I Knew It."" ""I drafted an order for an enveloping attack, via Agrigento and Castelvetrano, on Palermo. ... and not that I should remain in a defensive attitude.""Patton got the OK and knew the risk: ""Had I failed, I would have been relieved. We took Palermo (on July 22)."" On Aug. 16 his troops entered Messina. Sicily had fallen in 38 days, giving the Allies a launching pad for the invasion of Italy.Winning And Honored""The Sicily campaign saw great moments for Patton. His army achieved a hard-fought victory and he received his second Distinguished Service Cross — one notch below Medal of Honor — for valor under fire,"" Robert Patton, the general's grandson and author of ""Hell Before Breakfast,"" told IBD.""Patton was willing to take risks not merely to achieve a particular military objective, but to inspire his men to brand themselves as victors,"" said Alan Axelrod, author of ""Patton's Drive: The Making of America's Greatest General."" ""Patton (believed) the capture of Palermo transformed his army into a unit capable of achieving one victory after another.""Barney Sneiderman wrote in ""Warriors Seven"" that Patton, as a student of military history, ""took to heart Frederick the Great's maxim, 'Audacity, always audacity!'""Patton (1885-1945) reached the rank of full general and enduring legend. His honors also included the Purple Heart, Silver Star and Legion of Merit. ""Anyone, in any walk of life, who is content with mediocrity is untrue to himself and to American tradition,"" he wrote.He knew all about that tradition while traveling with a library of 300 volumes of history and classical literature, notes Robert Patton.Carlo D'Este wrote in ""Patton: A Genius for War"" that ""Patton's great success on the battlefield (came) from a lifetime of study and preparation.""Preaching discipline and professionalism, Patton set an example. He was notorious for his dress code, believing that a spirited army must be smartly attired and soldiers must be neat in appearance, Sneiderman wrote: ""Forcing them to look smart helped instill the pride Patton knew was a prerequisite to victory. As he once explained, 'self-respect grows directly from discipline.'""Born in San Gabriel, Calif., Patton descended from a long line of military men dating to the Revolutionary, Mexican and Civil wars.Upon graduation from West Point in 1909, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 15th Cavalry Regiment.In 1910 the young officer married Beatrice Ayer, with whom he had three children. Two years later he competed in the pentathlon at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.Patton went on to became a pioneer and expert in tank warfare. The knowledge paid off during World War I, when he worked with British forces to gain victory at Cambrai, France, in 1917.Also during the war he ran the American tank school in Bourg, France, and took the men he trained into the Meuse-Argonne offensive in September 1918.Shot in the leg on the front lines, Patton, then a captain, still directed the battle, earning his first Distinguished Service Cross for heroism. That action was vintage Patton, who continually put himself in harm's way to lead and evaluate how an operation was proceeding.""Do everything you ask of those you command,"" he said. In warfare he believed ""no good decision was ever made in a swivel chair.""He wrote that if a division attack stalls, ""it is necessary to make a careful personal reconnaissance and see if it may not be necessary to change the emphasis; because four hours of fighting should produce substantial effects.""After WWI ended in 1918, Patton was a staff officer in Hawaii and Washington, D.C. He continued his education, graduating from the Command and General Staff College in 1924, then the Army War College in 1932.Later in the decade, with World War II raging in Europe, Patton was transferred to the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Benning, Ga., and named commanding general in April 1941, a biography on a Patton website says. He often delivered ""Blood and Guts"" speeches to his troops, as immortalized in the 1970 movie ""Patton.""ApplauseFor all of his accolades, Patton always gave credit to his soldiers.""There is a great deal of talk about loyalty from the bottom to the top,"" he wrote. ""Loyalty from the top down is even more necessary and much less prevalent.""He told his troops: ""Every single man in this Army plays a vital role. Don't ever think your job is unimportant. Every man has a job to do, and he must do it. Every man is a vital link in the great chain.""With America's entry into WWII after Japan's December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Patton helped hammer the Nazis in North Africa. Then came his 7th Army invasion of Sicily.The night before his outfit's July 1943 amphibious assault, Patton notified his 90,000 men: ""The enemy is ignorant of our intentions. ... We must retain this tremendous advantage by always attacking rapidly, ruthlessly, viciously.""He quickly advanced on the enemy forces and noted that the Italian and German reliance on ""defensive positions reduced their power to fight. ... Wars are not won by defensive tactics.""Step On ItRobert Patton said: ""When he later expressed as one of his maxims, 'A good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow,' his emphasis on speed and decisiveness matched both his leadership style and, as he saw it, the best tactical path to victory.""Once the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, set up a foothold in France, Patton took command of the 3rd Army. He and his forces raced across Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia on the way to victory in May 1945.""A soldier, he convincingly argued, is safest when he advances against the enemy, shooting while on the march and never pausing to take cover,"" said Axelrod. ""This is counterintuitive, but the relatively low casualty rate of the 3rd Army supports Patton's contention.""Patton got the word out: ""Commanders must remember that the issuance of an order, or the devising of a plan, is only about 5% of the responsibility of command. The other 95% is to ensure ... that the order is carried out.""His stand: ""Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.""After the 3rd Army liberated the Nazis' Buchenwald concentration camp in eastern Germany in April 1945, Patton made local civilians face the genocide by walking through the extermination sites.By the time WWII was over, his 3rd Army had liberated or conquered 81,522 square miles.He wrote: ""In planning any operation, it is vital to remember, and constantly repeat to oneself, two things: In war nothing is impossible, provided you use audacity, and do not take counsel of your fears.""""His point,"" Robert Patton said, ""is everyone, even Blood & Guts Patton, has doubts and fears: Acknowledge them, process them, overcome them. As he often said, a brave man isn't fearless; a brave man admits his fears and then transcends them.""In sum, for all of Patton's gifts and faults, he kept a personal credo that I think should inspire anyone: 'Be yourself always. People who aren't themselves are nobody.' That was the greatest life lesson he represents, because, above all, Patton was himself at all times.""

1235,LEG,"Google (GOOGL) on Wednesday rolled out new software aimed firmly at Internet-enabled devices for living rooms, cars and people's wrists, a sign the company has learned a thing or two from Apple. Here are some key takeaways from the spate of software announcements during the keynote at Google I/O.
"
1236,LEG,"1. Universal Android Design
"
1237,LEG,"Google has always struggled to make its Android mobile software's visual design consistent across all devices. Part of the problem stems from the fact that Android is open-source, meaning there are lots of cooks in the kitchen.
"
1238,LEG,"Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, has been great at universal design for mobile devices because it keeps tight control over its iOS software.
"
1239,LEG,"Google on Wednesday took a step toward creating a more Apple-like experience for Android, with a new design feature it's calling ""Material Design."" What that actually means is that Google is making an attempt to standardize Android's look and feel for smartphones, tablets, PCs, TVs, car dashboard screens and any other place it might land (and it hopes to land in lots of places).
"
1240,LEG,"Google wants developers to use a ""unified set"" of design guidelines , said Matias Duarte, director of user experience for Android.
"
1241,LEG,"""Android ubiquity was the overall message/theme"" at I/O, says Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen in a research note.
"
1242,LEG,"2. Car Software As Battleground
"
1243,LEG,"Google and Apple seem to be running on roughly the same timeline with their in-car technology. Apple announced its in-the-car CarPlay software back in March, and Google introduced its Android Auto software on Wednesday.
"

1262,LEG,"Sports stars, fashionistas to shill for wearable devicesGoogle (GOOGL) on Wednesday rolled out new software aimed firmly at Internet-enabled devices for living rooms, cars and people's wrists, a sign the company has learned a thing or two from Apple. Here are some key takeaways from the spate of software announcements during the keynote at Google I/O.1. Universal Android DesignGoogle has always struggled to make its Android mobile software's visual design consistent across all devices. Part of the problem stems from the fact that Android is open-source, meaning there are lots of cooks in the kitchen.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, has been great at universal design for mobile devices because it keeps tight control over its iOS software.Google on Wednesday took a step toward creating a more Apple-like experience for Android, with a new design feature it's calling ""Material Design."" What that actually means is that Google is making an attempt to standardize Android's look and feel for smartphones, tablets, PCs, TVs, car dashboard screens and any other place it might land (and it hopes to land in lots of places).Google wants developers to use a ""unified set"" of design guidelines , said Matias Duarte, director of user experience for Android.""Android ubiquity was the overall message/theme"" at I/O, says Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen in a research note.2. Car Software As BattlegroundGoogle and Apple seem to be running on roughly the same timeline with their in-car technology. Apple announced its in-the-car CarPlay software back in March, and Google introduced its Android Auto software on Wednesday.The software is similar. Both focus on letting users connect their smartphones to in-dash screens. Once connected, users of either software can use voice commands to play music, make phone calls, send text messages or get turn-by-turn navigation.The key for both Google and Apple is that once you buy a car with one of these systems, you might be locked in to Android or iOS mobile software for years.""Android auto could make it difficult to switch to an iPhone as long as you own your car,"" Alex Davies wroteon Wired.com.3.

1272,LEG,"Education: Schoolchildren were the biggest winners Tuesday in Vergara v. California, a ruling that affirms that the tenure protections for public school teachers come at a high cost to students. Let's hope this victory spreads.Speaking to IBD, an admissions officer at a top university in San Diego recently sighed and threw up her hands. She'd received an application from a bright high school girl in a Latino family that had never sent anyone to college. Her application radiated intellectual curiosity, initiative and enthusiasm.But even with promise like that, her application was rejected, the pained admissions officer said, because the girl's application was loaded with bad grammar, lousy spelling and disorganized writing.""The reality is, she would not have been able to keep up with the other kids,"" the admissions officer said. A good teacher or school would have made a difference.She's out there, maybe aware or maybe not, of the outrageous injustice dumped on her by the poor quality of the Los Angeles-area school she attended. By failing to prepare her, it had effectively robbed her of a chance to attend the university she had worked so hard to enter.""The evidence is out there. Indeed, it shocks the conscience,"" wrote Judge Rolf Treu in his landmark Vergara ruling this week. Treu struck down as unconstitutional five statutes in California's educational code that permit ""grossly ineffective"" teachers to keep their jobs, based on five factors that benefit teachers and their unions — at the expense, of course, of students.Teachers gain lifetime tenure after just 18 months, before their training is even done. It's almost impossible to dismiss them, no matter what their transgressions — perversion, drug dealing, child pornography, sexual assault, you name it.The regulations are so cumbersome, it's impossible to fire anyone. There's also a layoff system that ensures that seniority trumps performance, resulting in top-performing teachers being laid off over under-performing deadwood who've just been on the job longer.It's a Mafia-like protection racket for the worst of the worst. The outrage is that not only are bad teachers kept on payroll but minority children trying to get a leg up in society through education are affected disproportionately, according to the ruling.Black children are 43% less likely to graduate from high school than their white peers, while Latino kids are 68% less likely. They are also twice as likely to drop out, according to the plaintiff's group, Students Matter.Not surprisingly, California's public schools constantly occupy the bottom five in reading and math in national rankings.Statistics like these appall everyone — everyone, that is, but teachers' unions, which have in fact benefited from this predatory system.It was the teachers' unions that got the legislators to pass the protectionist laws, and it is they who insist that these protections are really in the best interests of the children. On its website, the California Teachers Association dismisses the outrages as ""asking the wrong questions"" without saying what the right ones are.Not surprisingly, they were the ruling's most ferocious opponents and vow to appeal.But guess what? They don't have the support they once had. Even U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan went on record as supporting the Vergara ruling, as did left-wing former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa.In a scathing statement, the Oakland Alliance of Black Educators claimed that the union privileges ""have had an unambiguously devastating effect upon Oakland students' educational opportunities, bred racial and class animus between school communities, and undermined the public education system's capacity to equitably serve an ethnically, linguistically and socio-economically diverse student population.""According to Students Matter, bad teachers have a ""lifelong"" terrible effect on children at a time when the U.S., now more than ever, needs to compete globally.It looks like California's children may have a fighting chance if the ruling is upheld. And with the plaintiffs planning to make similar suits in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico and Oregon, the victory may be nationwide.

1276,LEG,"JBS, the biggest meat producer, made an unsolicited $5.6 billion bid for Hillshire Brands — $6.4 billion including assumed debt — seeking to expand its sausage lineup and derail the company's acquisition of Pinnacle Foods.
"
1277,LEG,"JBS' Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) offered 45 a share. The deal is contingent on Hillshire (HSH) scrapping its $4.8 billion agreement to acquire Pinnacle (PF). Pilgrim's said it met with Hillshire in February and that it ""has long been our desire to acquire the company.""Brazil's JBS, which spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past decade to overtake Tyson Foods (TSN), is resuming its takeover campaign less than a year after its last major deal. CEO Wesley Batista told Bloomberg News last week that JBS will keep expanding via more purchases as opportunities arise.In the U.S., JBS bought Smithfield Foods' beef-packing business in 2008 and took control of chicken processor Pilgrim's in 2009.Pulling For PorkJBS' ""Holy Grail"" is ""to have exposure to all three segments of meat: poultry, beef and pork,"" said Bloomberg Industries analyst Ken Shea. ""Today's unsolicited bid, if effected, would give JBS the third leg of a stool — a big piece of the pork market.""Hillshire said in a statement that it will review the Pilgrim's offer and that it believes in the merits of the Pinnacle deal.Pilgrim's hadn't made an offer until now because it was focused on improving its operations and paying down debt, a person familiar with its thinking said.Pilgrim's and JBS believed promised cost savings for the Hillshire-Pinnacle deal were aggressive — especially considering Pinnacle's private-equity owners had already made cuts, according to the person.Shares of Hillshire, which makes Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs, rose 22% to 45.19. Pilgrim's climbed 2% to 25.52. Pinnacle fell 5% to 31.48.Ricky Sandler, CEO of Eminence Capital, said Hillshire should engage with Pilgrim's and that today's proposal is superior to the Pinnacle transaction. Hillshire should see if there are other bidders and that interest may come from Tyson, Hormel Foods (HRL) and China's WH Group, he said. Sandler last week criticized the Pinnacle deal as expensive and said that his firm, a Hillshire holder, would vote against it.Pinnacle owns brands from Vlasic pickles to Wish-Bone salad dressings to Birds Eye frozen vegetables. Blackstone (BX) bought it for $2.2 billion about seven years ago and took it public again in March 2013.Pilgrim's would get a ""pretty good deal"" with Hillshire, said Craig Sterling, analyst at EVA Dimensions in New York. Hillshire has a 6.3% profit margin vs. 4.2% for Pilgrim's, he said.

1279,LEG,"Lumber Liquidators (LL) debuted in 2007 — a tough year for IPOs.The company also took on a challenging piece of the flooring trade, going up against national retailers such Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), as well as smaller flooring providers long established in their local markets.But a gutted economy and toppled housing market weakened many local players, putting market share up for grabs. High-end consumers recovered rapidly; homeowners looked for remodeling solutions beyond the confines of the national retailers' catalogs.Lumber launched its winning run in March 2012. From its initial breakout at 22.95 through the end of that year, shares rose 130%. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 18, 2013, the stock added 127%.Investors trying to hop aboard at the start of 2013 found the early going a bit rough.Shares formed a shallow cup with handle in November through January. The handle gave a 57.34 buy point during the second week in January. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. Lumber's fundamental vital signs were in order. The stock broke out in heavy trade on Jan. 24.Easy as pie.Shares made slow progress for about a month, rising 14%, then dived in heavy volume to test support at their 10-week moving average. The pullback stopped 6% below the initial buy point, but didn't trigger the 8% loss sell rule.With a loss after six weeks, investors might have sold the stock to roll the capital into stronger performers. After all, a breakout gain that reaches 10% or more should generally not be allowed to turn into a loss.But on Feb. 26, the stock regained support in heavy trade. It remained in buying range for several sessions, offering a chance to get back on board. IBD highlighted it in boldface in both the NYSE Stocks On The Move and Timesaver Tables on Jan. 31.In the next four weeks, Lumber Liquidators climbed 25% above its initial buy point. The stock's third rebound from 10-week support was the clincher. It soared 23% in the week ended April 26, giving investors a cushion to ride out the final leg of the run.The uptrend took a hit Sept. 27 on news that federal investigators had raided the company's offices, investigating alleged import violations. The rally broke decisively Nov. 22, when a short-seller questioned links between gross margin performance and the alleged illegal imports. Such drops gave a signal to take profits.

1280,LEG,"Adam Brown overcame a field full of trouble to become a Navy SEAL.In his early 20s, he stole to support his meth and cocaine habit.After cleaning up his act, he convinced the Navy to waive his shaky record and joined the sea, air and land special operations force (SEALs).In battle, he lost vision in his right eye. His right hand got crushed, so he learned to shoot with his left.By 33, he had arthritis, a bad back, a broken leg and surgery on both ankles to offset years of pounding.But nothing could stop him from going after the bad guys while he served the country as part of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group (aka DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six) until he was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. He was 36.""His actions on his final mission were indicative of the way he lived his life,"" wrote his commander in a message to all DEVGRU operators. ""Fearless.""Brown was born in 1974 in Hot Springs, Ark. When his dad set up an electrical business, 15-year-old Adam worked for him.PerseveranceA star of the high school football team, Brown developed an intense conditioning program. As a senior, he saw a trailer for the 1990 movie ""Navy SEALS,"" starring Charlie Sheen, and was hooked.Dabbling in drugs, Brown thought he could get on the right path with a strong Christian girlfriend named Kelley Tippy, and married her in 1998. But he kept relapsing. A friend, whose father was the highest-ranking Navy recruiter in the Southeast, thought the military could straighten him out.Brown said yes and aimed for the SEALs. At 25, he became the oldest of 145 to enter the first training phase, Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S), in Coronado, Calif. After 173 days of the grueling program, he was one of only a few dozen to graduate in April 1999.""The training awakened in Adam the psycho who never quit,"" Eric Blehm, author of ""Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team Six Operator Adam Brown,"" told IBD. ""He also had Kelley and his faith, which gave him a refuge and a shield of strength.""Assigned to SEAL Team Four, Brown went through advanced tactical training while in Virginia Beach, Va. His job was to carry his platoon's M60 machine gun and ammo. With his pack, he was hefting 80 pounds. He was part of a SEAL operation of 2,500 fighters divided into nine teams capable of operating in all environments, from desert to Arctic tundra, says Cade Courtley, author of ""SEAL Survival Guide.""Adam and Kelley had their first child, Nathan, in 2000. Soon a reorganization shifted him to Team Two's Central and South American task unit, requiring six more months of training.By 2002, Petty Officer Second Class Brown was on his first deployments — south of the border on counterdrug missions or to train other nations' forces. His commander recognized him as ""always the first to volunteer for the hard jobs and the last to leave — he leads, mentors and sets the example, the definition of a team player."" He rose to petty officer first class.Also in 2002, the Browns' daughter, Savannah, was born.A training accident the next summer damaged his right eye and required him to stay in combat support, gathering intelligence when he deployed to Iraq in April 2004.Returning home, Brown adapted to his handicap by learning to shoot left-handed at sniper school in Coronado and graduated in April 2005.Soon his unit was in Afghanistan, and more trouble befell Brown.A Humvee crushed and severed most of the fingers of his right hand. After recovery, he learned to use his left to shoot a pistol, a tougher task than firing a sniper rifle.Even though he was handicapped, he shot for bigger stuff: SEAL Team Six, the premier counterterrorism unit. The yearlong training, much of it in jungles, was described by those who joined as ""making BUD/S look like a cakewalk."" Members were the 1% of SEALs who could keep their cool in any situation.""In the entire history of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, nobody had ever attempted, much less passed, the stringent qualifications with vision in only one eye,"" said Blehm. ""Peripheral vision and split-second reaction times are critical.""After the Navy turned down Brown's application multiple times, the service finally let him into training — with no special considerations.Dead AimFor six months, Brown learned how to swivel his head so he could achieve near-perfect scores shooting with his left hand and use his good eye to sweep a room.He graduated in November 2006 and was promoted to chief petty officer. The following February, Blehm writes, he was a hunter within the force, seeking prime targets in northern Afghanistan's Kunar Valley, where the enemy presence was strong.""He would push out farther than anybody and was aggressive,"" Blehm said, quoting someone who worked with Brown.That aggression battered Brown even further. Back home in June 2007, his limp led a surgeon to discover that both his ankles had been so badly damaged, it was a miracle that he could walk. The normal procedure would have been to have them fused — with the sailor shifted to a desk job — but he insisted on having cartilage and bone shards removed so he could return to combat. Same as when he broke his leg: He bore the pain stoically.From February to April 2008, Brown was back in Iraq, going on nightly raids to destroy the network of terrorists planting improvised explosive devices. IEDs had accounted for 70% of the coalition deaths, but after the SEALs' action, casualties plummeted.""This was one of the greatest victories in the war, executed almost entirely by two squadrons of DEVGRU SEALs, fewer than 100 men, killing more than 200 and capturing upward of 300,"" said Blehm. ""They saved thousands of lives.""Brown was awarded a Bronze Star with valor. His citation references his ""extraordinary guidance, zealous initiative and total dedication to duty.""StrongWesley Fox, a retired Marine colonel and the author of ""Six Essential Elements of Leadership: Marine Corps Wisdom From a Medal of Honor Recipient,"" lists 14 traits of great military leaders. Blehm says Brown's greatest strengths on the list were:• Integrity.• Dependability.• Endurance.• Loyalty.• Initiative.• Unselfishness.• Courage (moral and physical).In October 2008, Brown returned to the Kunar Valley, but not just to fight. He had a personal project: distributing 500 pairs of shoes to Afghan children.His teammates saw his compassion as an extension of his spirituality as Brown even expressed regret about those he had to kill.Brown began to experience pain in his right eye due to the dry air, and he returned home in February 2009 to have it surgically removed. He also worked on an online bachelor's degree and earned it before his planned final deployment in March 2010. He began studying to take a qualifying test to enter Harvard for an MBA after his return.On the night of March 17, Brown headed out with his team to go after a Taliban leader code-named Objective Lake James. Dropped into a remote area by helicopter, the unit got into a firefight at the enemy stronghold.Brown was shot up and carried out, dying at the base.At a memorial service a week later in Hot Springs, John Faas — a SEAL who had been with him on the final raid — said: ""Adam is the hardest man I have ever met. Over the course of his career he sustained more significant injuries than most of us combined, but he just kept on operating. He would not quit, he would not accept defeat. Not ever. Adam's devout Christian faith matched his toughness and fearlessness.""The Lake James gang stopped giving the U.S. military trouble.Brown was awarded a Silver Star posthumously.

Imagine music if Lennon had lived well past the night he was gunned down at age 40 in New York City.""John at 45 and John at 65 would have produced different types of songs,"" Bill Spurge, a New York writer in the midst of rating the best solo songs among the ex-Beatles, told IBD. ""John would have gotten edgier in his 40s. 'Double Fantasy' was like a family LP, and John would have probably started getting political again. I wonder how he would have felt about Reagan and things like 'Just Say No.' As he aged, you would have seen the softer side again, like you saw on 'Jealous Guy' and 'Love.' He would have written about aging and living every day as if it was going to be his last.""ApplauseJacqueline Edmondson, a Lennon biographer, lauded him as ""an incredibly creative and brilliant man. I don't doubt that he would have pushed boundaries in music and art. Lennon was instrumental in redefining music in the 1960s and 1970s, but he also engaged with film, art, social protest and writing. My guess is that he would have continued to explore new genres, push boundaries and experiment with different art and music forms.""Jeff Burlingame, who wrote the book ""John Lennon: Imagine,"" said, ""Obviously, Lennon's musical legacy would have been longer. It's difficult to gauge how commercially successful his musical endeavors would have been. I mean, of course they would have sold well compared with the average Joe because he was John Lennon. I'm sure John's big bucks would have come from touring these days.""Lennon amassed as much as $800 million in today's money, reports CelebrityNetWorth.com. The cash came from the Beatles, the group he led through the 1960s, and from a solo career in his last decade.How big were the Beatles? In the last week of April 1964, they had a lock on Billboard's top five:1. ""Can't Buy Me Love.""2. ""Twist and Shout.""3. ""She Loves You.""4. ""I Want to Hold Your Hand.""5. ""Please Please Me.""Seven more singles completed the Beatles' grip on the top 100 in that April '64 snapshot.Fifty years later, the band of Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr maintains a legacy that boasts over 1 billion records sold — a number that tops the rankings on various websites.Last year, the Beatles vacuumed $71 million from various revenue streams, notes Forbes. Lennon's work alone generated $12 million.It all started in Liverpool, England, where Lennon was born in 1940, played guitar and sang in a band. He recruited McCartney for bass in 1957, then welcomed Harrison for lead guitar the next year and Starr on drums in 1962.That Lennon influence led Rolling Stone magazine in 2008 to rank him No. 5 among the top singers.""There would be no Beatles without John Lennon — that goes without saying,"" said Edmondson. ""He was an incredibly creative force and quite driven. Early on in the Beatles, Lennon promised they were going to the 'toppermost of the poppermost,' and he certainly was instrumental in making that happen. Lennon's experimentation with language, form, genre and sound — combined with his fearlessness, persistence and work ethic — contributed to the Beatles' success in unique and critical ways.""Said Spurge: ""Lennon gave the band an edge that would have not existed without him. The Beatles would have been seen as more of a pop band than a rock band, for the most part. That doesn't mean Paul couldn't rock. Of course he could. But John added a toughness that was real. Also, his production from 1962 to '66 was unbelievable. That helped the band stay on top until touring ended. In that sense, he pushed Paul, and even George, to become even better.""The rhythm guitar he played was awesome on many of the songs. And he was the one that most reflected our everyday lives and inner feelings. That's something the common person can relate to. We've all cried for 'Help,' felt like 'I'm a Loser' at one time or another. We've also reflected on the nice things, like we heard on 'In My Life.' ""The Beatles sprinted to the end. Their last production, 1969's ""Abbey Road,"" would join three of their works in the top 10 of BBC radio's all-time LP survey of 2006, with ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" at No. 1.A Decade SmashFans were so taken by Lennon that they hailed him as one of the 10 greatest figures of the 1960s on a BBC TV list heavy with President Kennedy and Winston Churchill.Even in that last leg of 1969, Lennon was splitting off with his own records . He hit his stride with the ""John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band"" album the next year.Then came LPs that included ""Imagine"" in 1971, ""Mind Games"" in 1973 and ""Double Fantasy,"" released just before his death.""His stuff is the best and most interesting of all the Beatles,"" Spurge said of the solo work. ""Because it is personal. The albums 'Plastic Ono Band' and 'Imagine' alone are enough for me to put him at the top. The songs are just so meaningful. It's a matter of taste, but I prefer introspection and revelation. 'Mother' and 'Watching the Wheels,' for example, mean more to me than great songs like Harrison's 'My Sweet Lord' or McCartney's 'Band on the Run.' Of course, Lennon's volume doesn't compare to the others in the band because his life was cut short. Percentagewise, he had the most solid songs.""Edmondson noted that ""Lennon certainly had a number of major hits in the years after the Beatles, from 'Imagine' and 'Happy Xmas (War Is Over)' to 'Mind Games.' 'Double Fantasy' had a tepid response when it was first released, but it became quite popular in the weeks after John's murder — and was 1981 Album of the Year at the 24th Annual Grammys.""Into The MusicSaid Burlingame: ""My favorites, of his hits at least, mostly come off the 'Double Fantasy' album. I could listen to 'Woman' 10 times in a row and not get sick of it. But from the get-go in the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were great songs: 'Instant Karma,' 'Give Peace a Chance,' 'Cold Turkey,' 'Mother' and the anthem 'Imagine.'""Since the slaying 34 years ago, his partner on the Lennon-McCartney title team has stacked up 14 albums. Last year alone, Paul hauled in $47 million from various projects.Would Lennon have kept up?""He would have kept coming up with great songs and would have been revered as a God-like figure,"" contended Spurge. ""The critics would have praised his every move, much like they have with Dylan since his mid-50s. John's music would have still been interesting and relevant. Sometimes catchy, sometimes innovative.""I wonder if he would have embraced rap. He probably would have, considering he talked a lot about punk and dance rock. He probably would have collaborated with many artists on different projects, which has become commonplace today. And maybe even written a song or two with Paul.""McCartney saluted Lennon with ""Here Today"" in 1982, a year after George Harrison (who would die in 2001) did likewise with ""All Those Years Ago.""""John Lennon's murder on Dec. 8, 1980, outside his home at the Dakota in New York City, brought a tragic end to one of the world's most creative individuals,"" wrote Edmondson, ""but it did not end the tremendous influence his music, art and life have had on the world. His work pushed boundaries and challenged norms, and his story inspires us to do the same.""Wrote Burlingame: ""How different might music, and perhaps the world, be if a crazed fan had not prematurely ended Lennon's life? All one can do is imagine.""

1358,LEG,"Let's say you've been keeping your eye on a stock that boasts solid fundamentals and is carving a cup-shaped base.But just when it looks like the right side is nearing completion, the stock starts heading south. Should you cross it off your watch list?Not so fast. The stock could be setting up for a double-bottom formation. It tends to occur less frequently than the cup base, but can yield a solid breakout and outstanding gains too.When sifting through charts to find stocks that are setting up potential buy points, you might spot a pattern that looks like a ""W."" If so, it may warrant a closer look.The double-bottom consists of two down legs. It typically starts off like a cup base, with the stock pulling back from a high, then shaping the right side. Suddenly, it turns downward again.As it continues heading south, some shareholders may lose patience and bail out of the stock, especially if the second leg undercuts the bottom of the first leg.Sounds scary, but that's what should occur in a sound double-bottom pattern. The low of the second leg should fall slightly beneath the low of the first leg. Undercutting the first low by 5% to 10% or so is also acceptable.As the right side of the second leg takes shape, the W formation should become more visible. The buy point will be located at the top right side of the second down leg, and should equal the middle peak of the W plus a dime.As with a cup base, a handle can form on a double bottom. If that turns out to be the case, the buy point would then be 10 cents above the top of the handle.Whether a stock breaks out from a handle or the top of the right side, look for a surge in volume as it clears the entry.Solar Winds (SWI) more than doubled in price from its July 2010 low to its closing high the week ended June 17, 2011 1. The network management tools firm started a four-week slide before turning up.The stock trended higher the next four weeks, forming the middle peak 2 before pausing to start the second leg. It undercut the 20.40 low of the first leg the week ended Sept. 23, hitting 19.72 in above-average trade 3.Solar Winds rose the next three weeks before breaking out past the 25.72 buy point (middle peak plus 10 cents) the last week of October 2011. Volume ran at its biggest weekly level in nearly a year.From there, the stock went on to rally as much as 140% over the next 11 months.

1359,LEG,"Cole Porter was riding toward disaster and didn't know it.This was 1937, amid a decade that the Broadway composer filled with hit musicals such as:""The New Yorkers,"" ""Gay Divorce,"" ""Nymph Errant,"" ""Anything Goes,"" ""Jubilee,"" ""Born to Dance,"" ""Red, Hot and Blue,"" ""Rosalie,"" ""Leave It to Me"" and ""Du Barry Was a Lady.""In the midst of those showstoppers were his top tunes:""Night and Day,"" ""I Get a Kick Out of You,"" ""Begin the Beguine,"" ""Just One of Those Things,"" ""Easy to Love"" and ""You're the Top.""Porter could have been writing about himself in ""Ridin' High"":Life's great, life's grand,
"
1360,LEG,"Future all planned,
"
1361,LEG,"No more clouds in the sky.
"
1362,LEG,"How'm I ridin'? I'm ridin' high.Then on Oct. 24, 1937, Porter collided with catastrophe.In the saddle one moment, he was crushed under his horse the next. The accident on Long Island, N.Y., busted his legs, led to multiple operations and — at age 46 — left him an invalid.Yet Porter (1891-1964) pushed on. He managed to compose more hit shows — 1949 Tony Award champ ""Kiss Me, Kate"" and 1955's ""Silk Stockings"" — and guide ""Don't Fence Me In"" toward a Roy Rogers cowboy song rebirth in 1945.Perseverance""That he created this enduringly popular work — arguably the finest of his career — while in great pain amazes me,"" Chip Deffaa, the New York writer and producer of the show ""Irving Berlin's America,"" told IBD. ""He did much great work following the horrific riding accident — a remarkable testimony to the resilience of the human spirit.""Indeed, said Howard Markel, director of the University of Michigan's Center for the History of Medicine: ""He was a remarkable guy. He was one of the most talented musicians, especially taking into account that he wrote the lyrics and tunes. And after a great amount of pain and amputation, he still persevered because he loved life.""Like any great artist, he was driven to create. The best don't feel good if they're not creating. They're touched by whatever it is that makes them do it. He was one of them, almost preordained to make music.""Markel, a pediatrician, marvels that Porter endured torture for three decades, with a leg amputation in 1958. ""And consider orthopedics were not like today,"" said the doctor, who in 2004 wrote a medical analysis of the composer's condition. ""You didn't have the sophisticated prosthetics that we have today. Antibiotics were not prevalent when his first surgeries started.""So his recovery from surgery was fraught with complications. Then there were his last years when his life was miserable. Amputees in his day were called cripples, and he didn't want to be seen like that. That's why for years he used iron braces and canes and had a valet to help him move around.""Porter grew up comfortably in Peru, Ind. His grandfather's land and energy investments turned into a fortune that would be worth half a billion dollars today. And Cole's dad earned good money as a druggist. The boy dwelled on the piano, violin and musicals.For college, Porter chose Yale, where as a freshman he ""knew that he had an unfailingly seductive power to summon audiences of all kinds with his songs and his showmanship,"" wrote William McBrien in his biography.Soon Porter clicked with Yale fight songs, one barking ""Bull dog! Bull dog! Bow wow wow.""With America entering World War I in 1917, Porter joined an ambulance outfit in France. Soon he met Linda Thomas at the Paris Ritz, and they were married from 1919 until her death in 1954.Porter had produced his first Broadway musical, ""See America First,"" before the war.By 1928 he was back in New York with ""Paris"" and its hit song ""Let's Do It, Let's Fall in Love.""""The New Yorker (magazine) declared itself 'ecstatic' about Porter's songs,"" wrote McBrien, ""with the rare insistence that the songs were 'up to Mr. Porter's best and there is no better. No one else now writing words and music knows so exactly the delicate balance between sense, rhyme and tune.'""Porter was hitting it rich with his music, on the way to hauling in $300,000 — worth $4 million today — just for letting Warner Bros. use his songs for the 1946 movie ""Night and Day,"" which starred Cary Grant as Cole.That big money might've worked against him, the way Porter figured it: ""You should have heard all the Broadway producers — Take a chance on a songwriter who's prosperous? Absurd! If I had climbed up out of the gutter ... or if I'd once been evicted for nonpayment of rent ... if I'd ever been hungry, then recognition might have come a good deal sooner.""He sure was recognized by Artie Shaw, whose 1938 recording of ""Begin the Beguine"" sold 6-1/2 million copies. The jazzman was so taken by the song, he called it possibly the most popular recording ever made when considering those early days of records — then made another version in 1954.More CheersAnother peer and fan was Berlin, who wrote him in 1933: ""I am mad about 'Night and Day' and I think it is your high spot. You probably know it is being played all over, and all the orchestra leaders think it is the best tune of the year — and I agree with them.""""Night and Day"" was part of his musical ""Gay Divorce,"" which lit up Broadway before touring America and hitting London.Then there was ""What Is This Thing Called Love?"" The 1929 Porter composition landed on one list in 1945 as one of the top 40 all-time song favorites in America.In all, Porter composed about 900 songs and 27 stage shows.""His two greatest musicals are 'Anything Goes' and 'Kiss Me, Kate' — both filled with hits,"" opined Deffaa. ""When one critic called 'Kiss Me, Kate' a 'perfect musical,' Cole Porter allowed that he was inclined to agree.""The critic Walter Clemons applauded: ""The complexity of Porter's best work sets him somewhat apart from the other great songwriters of the first half of this century — Kern, Berlin, Gershwin and Rodgers. A Porter song is a luxury item, expensively made ('Being the Beguine' is 108 bars long) and extravagantly rhymed.""Clemons could have had lines like this in mind:Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember,
"
1363,LEG,"Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember,
"
1364,LEG,"When they begin the beguine.Living OnPorter's melodies and verse carried into the modern age. The former Beatle George Harrison rocked with ""True Love."" The 2011 Tony Awards on Broadway featured a tap-and-song rendition of ""Anything Goes.""Said Deffaa: ""When we're talking about the all-time great writers of classic American popular song — writers of standards and show tunes — Cole Porter is, along with Irving Berlin, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern and Rodgers & Hammerstein — in the very top tier. There's a general consensus among music critics and historians that he's part of that handful of absolute masters among songwriters.""Like Berlin and unlike most other songwriters, he wrote both music and lyrics. He was more sophisticated than Berlin, both musically and lyrically. He could be very witty, clever, surprising — and he could be bittersweet, poignant.""He could write soaring, exuberant melodies ('Rosalie,' 'Ridin' High') and be equally effective with more reflective ditties ('Miss Otis Regrets'). And he burst free of conventional song patterns when needed; 'Begin the Beguine' became a great hit, and from start to finish its structure is wholly unconventional.""Porter died at age 73 in Santa Monica, Calif., and was buried in Peru, the Indiana town that celebrates its favorite son with the Cole Porter Inn. He not only left a rich body of work that punched his ticket to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, but also left an estate that disburses $3 million a year among relatives, according to IMDB.com.""Look at it this way: The world has 7 billion people. Most of us are mere mortals,"" said Markel. ""Think whose names will live beyond the day they die. Maybe 20,000 people. Cole Porter was one we'll never forget. His songwriting was right up there with the greatest. He made an incredible contribution to American culture.""
"
1365,LEG,"For Herbert George Wells, the answer he sought was in plain sight.
"
1366,LEG,"The question was, how to make a living as a writer?
"
1367,LEG,"John Clute, author of ""Science Fiction: The Illustrated Encyclopedia,"" cites Wells (1866-1946) as ""the most important writer the genre has yet seen.""
"
1368,LEG,"Wells' first novel, ""The Time Machine,"" published in 1895, made him a best-selling author.
"
1369,LEG,"He followed that with such sci-fi staples as ""The Island of Dr. Moreau,"" ""The Invisible Man"" and ""The War of the Worlds.""
"
1370,LEG,"But in his 20s, Wells struggled to find a home for his work.
"
1371,LEG,"An insatiable reader who learned by studying great authors, he was reading the works of J.M. Barrie, the author of ""Peter Pan.""
"
1372,LEG,"In Barrie's ""When a Man's Single,"" a character named Rorrison says that beginning authors often write about subjects that readers don't care about and are rejected by editors for that reason.
"
1373,LEG,"As Wells wrote in ""Experiment in Autobiography,"" ""Why had I never thought in that way before? For years I had been seeking rare and precious topics. ... The more I was rejected, the higher my shots had flown. All the time I had been shooting over the target. All I had to do was lower my aim — and hit.""
"
1374,LEG,"That he did, writing magazine articles on topics that readers wanted — ranging from travel with ""On Staying at the Seaside"" to the future with ""The Man of the Year Million.""

Just the sheer discipline of working every day in a reliable schedule was part of it.""
"
1383,LEG,"Simon contends that his great-granddad resonated with the public because ""he had a popular and casual style, as compared to a lot of the fiction being written at the time. He wrote believable central characters.""
"
1384,LEG,"Clute cites H.G.'s ""near genius of translating ideas into concise, compulsive narrative form.""
"
1385,LEG,"H.G. Wells also clicked with social commentary. In ""The War of the Worlds,"" man's technology isn't what defeats the Martians. The killer is bacteria, which Earth handles with natural defenses.

But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic allies began to work their overthrow. ... It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would still be his were the Martians 10 times as mighty as they are.

1412,LEG,"Unless you're only investing in CDs and Treasury bills, you can count on experiencing some volatility when you have money in the stock market. While there are big winners every year, you can bet on bumpy rides along the way.When scouting for bases to buy, watch for shakeouts, which are not all bad. Shakeouts can tell you whether there's support for the stock, and they can even make for great buying opportunities.A shakeout is generally a sharp drop that scares investors into selling shares, hence the name. This could be a wild one-day swing caused by an analyst downgrade or some news from the company. Sometimes shakeouts occur without any headline news. The broader market may simply be selling off.Shakeouts can come in a number of ways. In a properly formed downward-slanting handle, you might see one day of wild action in heavy turnover. But as long as constructive price-and-volume action returns, one such swift decline isn't a deal killer.Other times, a shakeout involves a stock breaking below a prior low, which makes investors think that the next down leg has started. But if the stock stages a comeback and closes in the upper half of its range, then that's a strong sign of support. Sometimes, the comeback may take place over the next few days.Shakeouts can occur at the 50-day moving average (or the 10-week line on a weekly chart). If the stock falls to the line or breaks it, but snaps right back, that action could become a buy setup. This is especially true if the rebound takes place in strong volume.In a double-bottom pattern, the second low is all about the shakeout. That's why the second low should undercut the first.Watching your stock break down on the screen can be nerve-wracking. But sometimes, it's best to let the dust settle before taking any action. If you got shaken out, watch for an opportunity to get back in.On Jan. 30, 1990, Amgen (AMGN) broke below its Dec. 28, 1989, low of 47.25 1 in heavy trade. In the next two days, the biotech lost more ground and undercut its 200-day moving average. But on Feb. 2, the final trading day of the week, the stock rose 9% and closed back above its 200-day line in huge turnover 2. This action carved out the second low of a double-bottom base.Amgen cleared the 55.60 buy point a few weeks later. It rallied 37% by early June before testing its 10-week line.

1428,LEG,"Don't despair if your stock has broken out of a base and climbed out of range before you had a chance to hit BUY.In many cases, stocks break out of longer, deeper patterns such as double-bottom or cup-type bases, run up a ways and then go sideways for a bit. This is when flat bases usually take shape, setting the stage for the next leg up.Flat bases form over at least five weeks, starting from the first down week after a high. They usually feature a correction of 10% to no more than 15% from the highest point in the pattern. A rectangle can typically be drawn around the pattern.Such tight trading is bullish, especially if it comes during a market correction, because it signals institutional support.The buy point is 10 cents above the peak of the left side of the pattern, and the breakout should occur in volume that's at least 40% above its 50-day average.BlackBerry (BBRY) shaped a pair of flat bases in mid- and late 2003, after the stock had suffered through a devastating correction amid the dot-com bust.The first base started forming in late June that year, after a nice advance followed a breakout from a cup-type base. The buy point was at 23.58. The pattern formed over five weeks and showed a correction of 15%. As such, it was too short and shallow to be a cup with handle or double-bottom base. Both form over at least seven weeks and correct 20% to 30% or more.In the week ended June 27, the stock fell just 1% as volume jumped higher than average 1. Since the stock finished in the upper half of the weekly price range, the bullish action indicated that institutions were supporting the stock. This is called accumulation.The breakout came in the week ended Aug. 1, when the stock rocketed 19% in huge volume. After a brief pullback, BlackBerry rode up its 10-week line, doubling in just three months. Then the second flat base formed.This pattern also showed the tight trading typical of a flat base. This time, the base formed over six weeks and had a correction of 13%. It wasn't a classic flat base, as the stock briefly topped the buy point in the fourth week before reversing lower. Yet the base was still valid, as it did not make a new closing high for the week.BlackBerry pulled back to support at the 10-week line for a couple more weeks to complete the pattern. It broke out in the week ended Dec. 26, rocketing 52% in massive volume.It's important to note that flat-base patterns shorter than five weeks are not long enough to shake out uncommitted investors, making them risky.Flat bases can show some variation. Some stocks encounter frequent resistance at a price slightly below the prior high. This sometimes occurs with longer flat bases and can yield a lower buy point. Leaderboard highlights such instances.

1432,LEG,"Hefty dividends are sometimes associated with greater risk.Yet, the right kind of stock history can put the big dividend in a more stable context.For example, Leggett & Platt (LEG) has increased its payout for 41 years in a row. The current annualized yield is 4.1%.Keeping and increasing the dividend is ""a high priority,"" the company stated in its most recent 10-Q report. In 2011, the company paid out about 53% of cash flow per share.The big dividend, though, hasn't turned Leggett into a sluggish stock performer.In 2012, the stock rose 18%, topping the Nasdaq's 16% gain and the S&P 500's 13% pop. Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, Leggett & Platt has risen 142% vs. 115% for the Nasdaq and 93% for the S&P 500 — and that's not including dividends.Leggett's diversified manufacturing model involves four segments. Residential furnishings — a segment that accounts for about half of sales — covers products such as mattress springs, bed frames and carpet pads. The three other segments account for roughly a sixth of sales each.Industrial materials produces steel wire and erosion-control products. Commercial fixturing and components entails products such as shelving, in-store displays and parts for office furniture manufacturers. The specialized products segment includes automotive seat support structures and product packages for police vehicles.Earnings growth on a year-ago basis was 23% in Q2 and 45% in Q3. Revenue fell 1% in Q2 and rose 4% in Q3. The Street expects a 32% earnings pop in Q4 on a revenue gain of 2%.The company will report results Feb. 5 at the market open.Leggett & Platt's fortunes are closely tied to factors such as consumer confidence, disposable income, employment and housing turnover.The company used the recent tight economic environment to reduce fixed costs but kept spare production capacity. This means a stronger rebound in the U.S. and world economy won't require huge capital investments for Leggett.The U.S. accounts for 71% of sales.

1435,LEG,"Sen. Richard Burr gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksI’m Senator Richard Burr from North Carolina, Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and I’m honored to speak to you.Today, all across this great nation of ours, military veterans are going about their lives with the expectation that their sacrifices will be honored and their services will be reciprocated by the government and the people they ably served. (Scroll down for video of these full remarks.)A young Marine sergeant, just back from his third tour in Afghanistan is mulling his future career options after a VA transition seminar; a medically retired Army major, wounded in Iraq, is out on a jog with her husband, getting used to her new prosthetic leg; a Navy SEAL, old beyond his years, is having coffee with a homeless Vietnam vet he met outside the local VA clinic, and a discharged Air Force colonel, with thousands of combat flying hours, is checking his email for some word on his VA disability claim.Thankfully, over the past five years, Congress has authorized over $600 billion to VA in robust and sustained increases of government funding for veterans’ programs designed to be part of a more responsive federal support for veterans outreach and care.This unprecedented level of support has been especially evident in the area of veterans’ benefits, specifically disability payments. The surge in financial support has not been matched with an equivalent surge in responsiveness from the Veterans’ Administration.The now infamous backlog of claims reached a point of national embarrassment last year when a series of biting monologues from comedian Jon Stewart finally elevated the problem to the President’s desk and spurred his VA Secretary into action. It was only then we began seeing some signs of incremental progress.When it takes a comedian to garner a response from our government, we are in bad shape. While the backlog has begun to decline, we still have nearly 700,000 veterans and their families waiting for answers.Today, claims are often riddled with errors, putting the burden back on veterans to file an appeal. More than a quarter million appeals are waiting to be resolved and the time it takes VA to act on appeals is worsening. As the nation’s military stands down from its war footing, veterans should not have to wage another battle here at home, this time against government bureaucracy.We regularly hear from veterans who are experiencing unacceptable delays and waiting times for mental health counseling and other health services. These delays have real life implications for veterans, especially for those at risk of lapsing back into isolation or a downward spiral that can be difficult to stop.After Congress heard frustrating accounts from VA whistleblowers, VA is finally taking steps to improve its staffing and responsiveness for mental health concerns and its overall delivery of health care, but more remains to be done.Our younger veterans are entering civilian life during one of the slowest economic recoveries in our nation’s history.Some states have passed laws that issue licenses to veterans, or certifications, for the skill-sets they gained while in the military, provided their training met the state’s standard.Without reforms such as these that address the problem at its root, many veterans will end up retaking classes or tests they’ve already passed while in service.Government has a vital role to play in improving the employment prospects for veterans, but short-term, make-work programs run by government agencies are not the answer to our veterans’ long-term needs.Lastly, I want to take a moment to speak about the problem of homelessness among veterans. In North Carolina, we’re trying something new. We’re taking private capital and motivated individuals — veterans themselves — and connecting them with government resources at HUD, in the state, and at the local level, to rehabilitate state facilities and provide homeless veterans with not only a place to stay, but a place where they can learn -- particularly the skills that allow them to enter the workforce, or get them the help they really need.Rather than a top-down, government-centered approach, it’s citizen-centered and it’s veteran focused. I’ve introduced legislation to continue to force Washington to change, and to provide real solutions for the needs of our veterans population.Our veterans understand these are challenging times and that the government is limited in its capacity, but they also have high expectations after the promises that have been made.The American ideals of liberty and opportunity are worth fighting for and preserving for our children. We need to harness some of that same spirit and work together on their behalf.The answer to these problems will not be found in new offices and new employees in Washington, D.C.The answer lies with Congress’ responsibility to ensure that VA programs are operating in the way they were intended — and meeting the needs of the veterans, not the DC bureaucrats -- and inside the communities that our veterans live in. It’s found in the American people, among the faces that greet our returning heroes.Working together, I know we can ensure that history will say we kept our promise.Thanks for listening. God bless all the men and women who have served and continue to serve our great country and God bless this great nation. ####RELATED:11 questions Obama's happy to skipNot a smidgen of credibility in Obama's IRS claimsTime for a real executive as our nation's chief executiveFive years of Obama promises and what's really changed?

Further, management trimmed its earnings view for 2018, while raised the sales outlook.Shares of the company did not swing in after-hours trading on Apr 26 following the results. However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 9.5% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 18.2% decline.The company’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share decreased 8.1% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. The year-over-year decline was due to increased raw material expenses.On a GAAP basis, earnings per share came in at 57 cents compared with 62 cents in the prior-year quarter.Delving DeeperAlthough net sales increased about 7.1% to $1,028.8 million, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,044 million. Including inter-segment sales, total sales came in at $1,107.4 million, up 6.6% year over year.Improved sales were backed by 1% rise in volume and a 5% gain from raw material price inflation and currency. Furthermore, acquisitions contributed around 2% to sales, however, somewhat compensated with divestitures.While gross profit dropped 4% year over year to $217.4 million, gross margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) to 21.1%. Also, the company’s adjusted EBIT margin declined 170 bps to 10.4% in the first quarter. In dollar terms, adjusted EBIT was down 7.3% to $107.4 million, due to the pricing lag and commodity inflation. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteSegment DetailsResidential Products’ sales (excluding inter-segment sales) of $398.1 million increased 1.7% from last year, driven by a marginal improvement in same location sales along with contributions from buyouts. Also, contributions of 4% from raw material price inflation and currency aided results. However, volumes dropped 3% on lower demand in Geo Components and Flooring Products as well as weak pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Including inter-segment sales, total sales for the segment rose 1.7% to $402.7 million.The Industrial Products segment's sales improved 17.5% to $82 million. Total sales, including inter-segment sales, were up 12.6% to $152.4 million, mainly driven by raw material price inflation.Sales at Furniture Products increased 6.2% to $281.3 million, courtesy of benefits from higher Adjustable Bed sales and a 3% rise in same location sales. Additionally, the segment gained from a small acquisition in Work Furniture. This was somewhat negated by declines in Home Furniture and Fashion Bed. However, total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) grew 4.8% to $284.2 million.The Specialized Products segment's sales rose 14.1% to $267.4 million. Same location sales climbed 11% backed by solid Automotive volumes and favorable currency impact. Also, the Precision Hydraulic Cylinders’ (PHC) acquisition added nearly 6% to sales growth, which was offset by a 4% impact from the divestiture of CVP. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) climbed 13.5% to $268.1 million.FinancialsLeggett ended first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $494.6 million, and long-term debt of $1,239 million. Furthermore, the company generated $44.1 million in cash flow from operations in the same period.The company had net debt to net capital ratio of 38% at the end of the first quarter, within the company’s 30-40% target range. Moreover, Leggett’s debt was 2.4 times of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.In addition, management repurchased nearly 1.2 million shares for an average price of $45.09 and issued 0.5 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. Also, it declared a quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share, reflecting an increase of two cents from the year-ago period. This marks Leggett’s 47th consecutive year of dividend increase.GuidanceLeggett has been significantly gaining from inflation and currency, which have been aiding its top line. Further, management remains optimistic about growth opportunities in the Bedding business and projects market improvements as the year progresses. However, the ongoing steel costs inflation has been largely weighing on its margins, which is likely to continue hurting margins in the second quarter.Following the soft quarterly results, management updated its guidance for 2018. Sales are now projected to grow nearly 9-12% year over year to $4.3-$4.4 billion, up $100 million from the previously guided range of $4.2-$4.3. The raised top-line guidance was backed by continued steel inflation. The company’s solid sales view is backed by expectations of mid-single-digit volume growth, raw material price increases and favorable currency. Additionally, the PHC acquisition is likely to contribute 2% to sales growth.Consequently, EBIT margin is envisioned to be nearly 11.5-12% compared with 12-12.5%, guided earlier. However, on assuming that costs will stabilize, Leggett predicts margins to improve through the second half of 2018.Based on above iterations, management projects earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60-$2.80 per share, down 5 cents from $2.65-$2.85 projected earlier. The downside can be attributed to adverse impacts of continued steel cost inflation as well as the pricing lag for recovering greater costs. Notably, this guidance takes into account an effective tax rate of 22%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year is pegged at $2.75.Additionally, the company seems to be continuing with its trend of generating more cash to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For 2018, Leggett expects operating cash flows of about $450 million compared with $500 million anticipated earlier. Capital expenditures for the year are still projected at $160 million, while the company intends to spend $195 million toward dividend payouts. The company also outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50-60% of adjusted earnings. Furthermore, it expects payout for 2018 to be near the midpoint of the aforementioned range.Meanwhile, management plans to continue with its share repurchase program, having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year, after fulfilling all priority requirements. For 2018, the company also intends to repurchase nearly 2-3 million shares and issue about 1 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.Three Top-Ranked Stocks in the Consumer Discretionary SpaceGuess?, Inc.

1465,LEG,"We are again at the starting point of another earnings season, the first one for this year. Earnings outcome of companies play a key role in gauging the performance, helping investors with their investment decisions. As we stand to witness another thrilling season, let’s focus on some expectations.Initial results from the S&P 500 cohort indicate that Q1 earnings started on a strong note with a considerably higher proportion of companies, posting positive earnings surprises. Further, the earnings and revenue growth rates were also noteworthy. However, there has been a slowdown in the positive revenue surprise trend compared with the previous quarter. Nevertheless, the proportion was almost comparable with the historic levels.Moreover, we note that estimates for the current quarter (Q2) are reasonably stable since the start of the Q1 reporting cycle. While this is too early to expect movement in the estimates, we believe that the chances of estimate revision will improve as we move into the core Q1 earnings season.Per the Earnings Preview dated Apr 20, only 87 S&P 500 members have reported earnings so far, leaving us with more than 680 companies, including 178 S&P 500 members, to come up with their results. So far, we have seen total earnings improve 25% year over year, with revenue gains of 10.7%. Of these, 82.8% have topped earnings estimates while 67.8% beat revenue estimates. This brings the combined beat ratio to 62.1%.Putting together the results so far and forward expectations, total earnings for the S&P 500 are estimated to improve 18.3%, with 7.7% increase in revenues. Based on these expectations, this earnings season is likely to witness the best performance in six years.A Glimpse of Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which, 14 are estimated to witness year-over-year earnings growth. The Consumer Discretionary sector mainly houses major media stocks, leisure & recreation service providers, schools, gaming, household appliances, furniture and more. Per the report, the Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 7.2% while revenues are expected to increase 6.8% this earnings season.Currently, the Consumer Discretionary sector is ranked among the bottom 38% (10 of 16) of all the Zacks sectors. The sector has rallied 5.1% in the past year, underperforming the S&P 500 market’s gain of 12.2%.So, let’s see what awaits the two stocks from the sector that are queued up for earnings releases on Apr 26.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP have higher chances of delivering positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Key Predictions for LEG and MHKLeggett & Platt Inc. (LEG  -  Free Report), the producer and seller of furniture and other engineered goods for office and home, carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Moreover, its Earnings ESP of-6.17% makes a surprise prediction impossible. Leggett remains highly susceptible to volatility in raw material prices, particularly steel. In fact, this has been hurting the company’s top- and bottom-line performances in last few quarters. Further, margins remain under pressure, mainly due to steel costs inflation, which is likely to continue hurting margins in first-quarter 2018.Meanwhile, Leggett’s strategies to enhance business portfolio, disciplined capital allocation and progress on goals for 2019 look encouraging. Additionally, the company remains on track to achieve its top-third TSR target by 2020 through revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves. (Read: Will Steel Cost Inflation Hurt Leggett's Q1 Earnings?)Mohawk Industries, Inc. (MHK  -  Free Report), the leading global manufacturer of flooring products, is likely to beat expectations in the to-be-reported quarter. It fulfills the Zacks earnings beat criteria as it has an Earnings ESP of +0.21% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Apart from this, the company is likely to benefit from the strategy of driving growth through acquisitions, which will be evident in the to-be-reported quarter. However, increased raw material costs, as well as start-up expenses behind new products and manufacturing, continue to raise concerns.

1466,LEG,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26. The company has a mixed earnings record in the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, it delivered a negative surprise of 3.3%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the impending quarter is pegged at 61 cents, which moved south by a penny in the last seven days. Also, the estimate reflects a decline of 1.6% from the year-ago period.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this earnings announcement.Factors Likely to Influence 1Q18Leggett remains highly susceptible to volatility in raw material prices. This is because steel is considered one of the key raw materials and the steel market is cyclical in nature. In fact, this has been hurting the company’s performance since last few quarters. Evidently, the company’s top line lagged estimates in five of the last six quarters, including the previous quarter. Higher steel costs and the pricing lag, which occurs in case of commodity cost inflation, also impacted results in the previous quarter.Further, margins remained under pressure mainly due to recent steel costs inflation, which is likely to continue hurting margins in first-quarter 2018.Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.04 billion for the quarter under review, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.Although the company is likely to witness a soft quarter, management provided a bullish outlook for 2018. It expects to generate strong earnings and improve margins, mainly backed by solid sales growth. Meanwhile, Leggett’s strategies to enhance business portfolio, disciplined capital allocation and progress on goals for 2019 look encouraging. Additionally, the company remains on track to achieve its top-third TSR target by 2020 through revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves.While Leggett’s strategies look promising for the long run, its bottom line remains prone to steel price inflation that might hurt results in the upcoming quarter.Zacks ModelTo deliver an earnings beat, a stock needs to have the right combination of two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). However, that is not the case here as you will see.Leggett has an Earnings ESP of -6.17% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which makes earnings beat unlikely.

1467,LEG,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (BSET  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in BSET.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.72 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.41.Also, for the current quarter, Bassett Furniture has seen one downward estimate revision versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 39 cents a share from 43 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 11% in the past month.Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated Price and Consensus Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated Price and Consensus | Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Furniture industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report).

1469,LEG,"The U.S. furniture industry is expected to see moderate growth through 2018 supported by rising consumer sentiment and discretionary spending. Broader economic recovery along with solid wages and employment opportunities no doubt bode well. According to Furniture Today, the furniture industry is expected to grow 3% to $111.4 billion in 2018 from $108.2 billion in 2017.The strengthening millennial market is an added positive since it represents the largest consumer cohort in the furniture market. Millennials were the largest and most-active generation of homebuyers in 2017 for the fifth consecutive year, per the National Association of Realtors.However, furniture retailers operate in a landscape that is changing from a generational point of view. The millennial approach toward home-buying is different from older generations. Added to these are housing affordability concerns in a rising interest rate environment.In addition to a sluggish market, furniture companies need to continuously address a maturing omni-channel environment, as shoppers are more looking for online purchase. The growth in online sales will continue to fragment the traditional retailer market as brands such as Etsy, Things Remembered, Costco and Amazon are finding their way into the furniture market.Higher raw material expenses and the pricing lag in case of commodity cost inflation are already affecting bottom line. Further, margins remained under pressure mainly due to commodity inflation and steel cost inflation.Moreover, the threat of tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs on exports spell trouble for the industry. If tariffs are implemented, sourcing difficulty faced by home furnishing manufacturers will end up increasing costs.Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsLooking at shareholder returns over the past year, it appears that the strengthening economy and better job prospects weren’t enough for enhancing investors’ confidence in the industry’s growth prospect.The Zacks Furniture Industry, which is an eight-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 20.1%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Consumer Discretionary Sector have rallied 12% and 10.9%, respectively.                                    One-Year Price Performance            Furniture Stocks Trading CheapThanks to the underperformance of the industry over the past year, the valuation looks really cheap now. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Consumer Discretionary stocks because their earnings are effective in gauging performance.Generally, the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings. As forecasts for expected earnings move higher, demand for the stock should drive its price. If the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company’s inherent strength.This ratio essentially measures a stock’s current market value relative to its earnings performance. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 18.6, near the lowest level over the past year. When compared with the highest level of 21.2 and median level of 19.8 over that period, there is apparently plenty of upside left.The space also looks quite cheap when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 20 and the median level is 20.2.                                               Price-to-Earnings Ratio (TTM) The chart below compares the industry's valuation picture with its sector. Such a comparison ensures that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Discretionary Sector’s trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 27.3 and the median level of 25.2 for the same period are significantly above the Zacks Furniture Industry’s respective ratios.                                                Price-to-Earnings Ratio (TTM) Underperformance May Continue Due to Bleak Earnings OutlookExpectations of increasing demand buoyed by robust economic fundamentals and solid wage growth build hope for the industry and in turn positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. Although the above ratio analysis shows that there is value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a near-term rebound.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects of a solid price performance is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with last year’s reported number, but an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.While the consensus loss estimate for the Zacks Furniture industry of $2.06 per share implies a decent 25.6% year-over-year improvement, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that the loss estimate of $2.06 per share has widened from April 2018.                        Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Cloudy ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Furniture industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #224, which places it at the bottom 13% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Now, looking at the past revenue performances, the prospect of the industry also looks bleak. Bottom LineSolid economic recovery and a strong labor market with rising consumer spending should favor the performance of the furniture industry. Further, the Fed’s upbeat economic outlook presents a solid scope for the consumer-driven furniture space.Currently, there is only one stock that is cashing in on the positive economic fundamentals and is witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions with a bullish Zacks Rank.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.American Woodmark Corp.

1470,LEG,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 2.6% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is LEG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Leggett Lags Q1 Earnings & Sales, Trims 2018 EPS ViewLeggett & Platt reported lower-than-expected sales and earnings in first-quarter 2018. Also, the bottom line declined year over year. Notably, this marked the company’s fourth consecutive quarter of sales miss, while earnings lagged estimates for the second time. Further, management trimmed its earnings view for 2018 but raised the sales outlook.The company’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 57 cents per share decreased 8.1% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. The year-over-year decline was due to increased raw material expenses.On a GAAP basis, earnings per share came in at 57 cents compared with 62 cents in the prior-year quarter.Delving DeeperAlthough net sales increased about 7.1% to $1,028.8 million, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,044 million. Including inter-segment sales, total sales came in at $1,107.4 million, up 6.6% year over year.Improved sales were backed by 1% rise in volume and a 5% gain from raw material price inflation and currency. Furthermore, acquisitions contributed around 2% to sales, however, somewhat compensated with divestitures.While gross profit dropped 4% year over year to $217.4 million, gross margin contracted 250 basis points (bps) to 21.1%. Also, the company’s adjusted EBIT margin declined 170 bps to 10.4% in the first quarter. In dollar terms, adjusted EBIT was down 7.3% to $107.4 million, due to the pricing lag and commodity inflation.Segment DetailsResidential Products’ sales (excluding inter-segment sales) of $398.1 million increased 1.7% from last year, driven by a marginal improvement in same location sales along with contributions from buyouts. Also, contributions of 4% from raw material price inflation and currency aided results. However, volumes dropped 3% on lower demand in Geo Components and Flooring Products as well as weak pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Including inter-segment sales, total sales for the segment rose 1.7% to $402.7 million.The Industrial Products segment's sales improved 17.5% to $82 million. Total sales, including inter-segment sales, were up 12.6% to $152.4 million, mainly driven by raw material price inflation.Sales at Furniture Products increased 6.2% to $281.3 million, courtesy of benefits from higher Adjustable Bed sales and a 3% rise in same location sales. Additionally, the segment gained from a small acquisition in Work Furniture. This was somewhat negated by declines in Home Furniture and Fashion Bed. However, total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) grew 4.8% to $284.2 million.The Specialized Products segment's sales rose 14.1% to $267.4 million. Same location sales climbed 11% backed by solid Automotive volumes and favorable currency impact. Also, the Precision Hydraulic Cylinders’ (PHC) acquisition added nearly 6% to sales growth, which was offset by a 4% impact from the divestiture of CVP. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) climbed 13.5% to $268.1 million.FinancialsLeggett ended first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $494.6 million, and long-term debt of $1,239 million. Furthermore, the company generated $44.1 million in cash flow from operations in the same period.The company had net debt to net capital ratio of 38% at the end of the first quarter, within the company’s 30-40% target range. Moreover, Leggett’s debt was 2.4 times of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.In addition, management repurchased nearly 1.2 million shares for an average price of $45.09 and issued 0.5 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. Also, it declared a quarterly dividend of 36 cents per share, reflecting an increase of two cents from the year-ago period. This marks Leggett’s 47th consecutive year of dividend increase.GuidanceLeggett has been significantly gaining from inflation and currency, which have been aiding its top line. Further, management remains optimistic about growth opportunities in the Bedding business and projects market improvements as the year progresses. However, the ongoing steel costs inflation has been largely weighing on its margins, which is likely to continue hurting margins in the second quarter.Following the soft quarterly results, management updated its guidance for 2018. Sales are now projected to grow nearly 9-12% year over year to $4.3-$4.4 billion, up $100 million from the previously guided range of $4.2-$4.3. The raised top-line guidance was backed by continued steel inflation. The company’s solid sales view is backed by expectations of mid-single-digit volume growth, raw material price increases and favorable currency. Additionally, the PHC acquisition is likely to contribute 2% to sales growth.Consequently, EBIT margin is envisioned to be nearly 11.5-12% compared with 12-12.5%, guided earlier. However, on assuming that costs will stabilize, Leggett predicts margins to improve through the second half of 2018.Based on above iterations, management projects earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60-$2.80 per share, down 5 cents from $2.65-$2.85 projected earlier. The downside can be attributed to adverse impacts of continued steel cost inflation as well as the pricing lag for recovering greater costs. Notably, this guidance takes into account an effective tax rate of 22%.Additionally, the company seems to be continuing with its trend of generating more cash to fund dividends and capital expenditures. For 2018, Leggett expects operating cash flows of about $450 million compared with $500 million anticipated earlier. Capital expenditures for the year are still projected at $160 million, while the company intends to spend $195 million toward dividend payouts. The company also outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50-60% of adjusted earnings. Furthermore, it expects payout for 2018 to be near the midpoint of the aforementioned range.Meanwhile, management plans to continue with its share repurchase program, having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year, after fulfilling all priority requirements. For 2018, the company also intends to repurchase nearly 2-3 million shares and issue about 1 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

1471,LEG,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Leggett & Platt Inc. (LEG  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Leggett & Platt has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.9x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Leggett & Platt’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Leggett & Platthas a forward PE  ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Leggett & Plattstock in the near term too .P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Leggett & Platthas a P/S ratio of about 0.9. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 2.8x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Leggett & Plattcurrently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Leggett & Platta solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Leggett & Plattmight be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of F. This gives LEG a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen four up and one down in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has decreased by 4.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and Consensus  Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and Consensus | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineLeggett & Plattis an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (among Bottom 18% of more than 250 industries) it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

This marked the company’s third consecutive quarter of sales miss, while earnings lagged estimates for the second time in three months. Further, management outlined its earnings and sales outlook for 2018.The company’s shares declined about 1% in the after-hours session on Feb 5, mainly due to lower-than-expected top and bottom line. Moreover, Leggett has lost 5.3% in the last three months, against the industry’s gain of 8%.The company’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 59 cents per share rose nearly 11% year over year. However, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. The year-over-year increase in bottom line stemmed from higher sales.Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Clorox Company (The) QuoteOn a GAAP basis, earnings per share of 27 cents declined nearly 55% from 60 cents earned in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line was primarily impacted by the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which hurt earnings by 37 cents per share for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2017.Delving DeeperWhile net sales increased about 9% to $984.5 million, it considerably lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $999 million. Including inter-segment sales, total sales came in at $1,054.8 million, up 6.7% year over year.Additionally, sales gained from a 5% rise in volume and 4% from raw material price inflation and currency.Gross profit dropped 4% year over year to $196 million, while gross margin contracted 270 basis points (bps) to 19.9%. The company’s EBIT margin declined 90 bps to 12.2% in the fourth quarter. In dollar terms, adjusted EBIT improved 8.7% to $112 million.Segment DetailsFourth-quarter Residential Products’ net sales (excluding inter-segment sales) of $394.4 million increased 6.6% from last year, driven by 3% improvement in same location sales. Further, contributions of 3% from raw material price inflation and currency, as well as 4% from acquisitions aided results. Meanwhile, volumes reflected only marginal improvement as growth in most businesses was fully offset by 2% sales decline, due to lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Including inter-segment sales, total sales for the segment rose 6.8% to $399.5 million.Net sales of Furniture Products jumped 13.2% to $280.4 million, thanks to benefits from higher Adjustable Bed sales that led to an 8% rise in same location sales. Additionally, the segment gained from a small acquisition in Work Furniture, which added 2% to sales. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) grew 9.8% to $282.8 million.The Industrial Products segment's net sales improved 22.6% to $74.8 million. Same location sales jumped 7% driven by rise in steel prices, partly mitigated by lower volumes. Moreover, divestitures completed in 2016 hurt sales growth by 3%. Total sales, including inter-segment sales, jumped 4.2% to $136 million.The Specialized Products segment's net sales rose 4.4% to $234.9 million. Same location sales rose 10%, backed by solid Automotive volumes and favorable currency impact. Divestiture of CVP hurt sales by 6%. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) climbed 4.5% to $236.5 million.FinancialsLeggett ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $526.1 million, and long-term debt of $1,097.9 million. The company generated $182.2 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter, with full-year cash flows of $443.7 million.The company had net debt to net capital ratio of 33% at the end of 2017, the lowest in three years and comfortably within its targeted range of 30-40%. Further, Leggett’s debt was 2.1 times of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.In 2017, the company repurchased nearly 3.3 million shares for an average price of $48.66 and issued 1.7 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises.GuidanceAnticipating improved earnings and margins in 2018, driven by solid sales growth, management outlined its outlook for 2018. Sales for 2018 are expected to grow nearly 6.9% to $4.2-$4.3 billion. The company’s solid sales view is backed by expectations of mid-single-digit volume growth and raw material-related price increases. Additionally, the Precision Hydraulic Cylinders’ (PHC) acquisition is likely to contribute 2% to sales growth.Consequently, adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be nearly 12-12.5%. The company anticipates margins to be under pressure in the first quarter owing to the recent steel cost inflation. However, on assuming that costs will stabilize, the company predicts margins to improve through the rest of 2018.Based on above iterations, management projects earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.65-$2.85 per share. This guidance takes into account an effective tax rate of 22%.Additionally, continuing with its trend of generating more cash than required to fund dividends and capital expenditures, Leggett expects operating cash flows of about $500 million for 2018. Capital expenditures for the year are anticipated to be approximately $160 million, while the company intends to spend $195 million toward dividend payouts. The company outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50-60% of adjusted earnings. Furthermore, it expects payout for 2018 to be near the midpoint of the aforementioned range.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects to continue its share repurchase program, having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year, after fulfilling all priority requirements. For 2018, the company plans to repurchase nearly 2-3 million shares and issue about 1 million shares primarily for employee benefit plans.2020 Operating TargetsAdditionally, the company slightly modified and extended its long-term targets by a year, owing to a modest decline in 2017 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. Earlier, the company had announced a set of 3-year operating targets that would have resulted in the achievement of its top-third TSR goal through 2019.The company’s operating targets for 2020 now include revenues of $5 billion, EBIT margin of 13% and EPS of $3.50. The EPS target assumes effective tax rate of 22% owing to the recent U.S. tax reform.Looking for Some Trending Picks? Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the same industry include La-Z-Boy Inc.

1475,LEG,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 5. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this furniture producer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. While Leggett reported in-line earnings in the last quarter, it has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents, which represents a 15% growth from the year-ago period figure of 53 cents. However, the earnings estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $999.3 million, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteFactors at PlayLeggett is poised on strategies to enhance business portfolio, disciplined capital allocation, and progress on goals for 2019. Further, the company’s long-term strategy focused on bolstering business portfolio by increasing investment in areas that provide a competitive edge and simultaneously exiting underperforming operations, bode well. The company remains on track to achieve its top-third TSR target by 2019 through revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves. Moreover, we believe the company’s strong liquidity position will continue to drive growth.However, it remains exposed to major volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company’s key raw materials and the market for the same being cyclical in nature. Notably, the company’s gains from higher sales continue to be offset by increased raw material expenses, which is hurting stock price. Additionally, the company’s strained margins and lowered guidance remains concerns.The company anticipates sales for 2017 to grow by 5-7% to $3.95-$4 billion, reflecting the raising of the lower-end of the guidance range from the old sales guidance of 4-7% growth to $3.9-$4 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin is anticipated to be nearly 12%. Moreover, management narrowed reported EPS range to a band of $2.49-$2.54 from the previous range of $2.55-$2.65. Adjusted EPS is envisioned in the range of $2.45-$2.50, compared with the previous range of $2.40-$2.50.Battered by these factors, Leggett’s shares grew only 0.9% in the last three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 9.1%.While the company’s strategies and initiatives bode well for the long run, we believe that Leggett’s bottom-line remains prone to steel price inflation which may hurt results in the fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Leggett is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Leggett has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 61 cents. While the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.92% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk.

1476,LEG,"Leggett & Platt Inc. (LEG  -  Free Report) looks in good shape driven by its strategies to enhance business portfolio, disciplined capital allocation, and progress on goals for 2019. This has helped the company retain its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Further, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 9.7% and Value Score of B, highlight its inherent strength.Key Growth DriversLong-Term Strategic PlanLeggett remains on track with its long-term strategic plan, which was announced in November 2007. After completing the first two parts, the company is working on the third part that aims to achieve top-line growth of 4-5% annually. As part of the plan, the company remains focused on boosting business portfolio by increasing investment in areas that provide a competitive edge while simultaneously exiting underperforming operations and markets.Some of the recent steps taken to enhance business portfolio include the acquisitions of a manufacturer of aerospace tube assemblies; a distributor of geosynthetic products, and a South African innerspring manufacturer. Further, the company bought the remaining minority stake in a core automotive joint venture in China, alongside continuing with its capital investments to fuel organic growth in the bedding and automotive space. Meanwhile, the company divested four small ventures in 2016, with annual revenues of nearly $100 million. All these actions position Leggett well toward achieving its goals for 2019.Goals for 2019 Reflect GrowthIn September 2016, Leggett chalked out its goals for 2019, aimed to help the company achieve its top-third TSR target in the following three years. These targets include revenues of about $4.75 billion, EBIT margin of 13.3%, EPS of $3.25 and a dividend of $1.70 per share. The company believes revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves like buybacks and dividend payments to be the main TSR drivers.Further, the company expects these targets to be fueled by organic growth, which in turn is expected to be backed by strategic buyouts, with the absence of any non-recurring factors. Leggett is well on track with these goals and it intends to achieve volume growth through content gains, new products, enhanced market share and overall market advancement, in 2017.Disciplined Capital Allocation StrategyLeggett has always maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy and remained focused on making investments to develop business, while using excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks. Going forward, Leggett anticipates continuing with its share repurchase program, having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year, after fulfilling all priority requirements. As for dividends, the company outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50-60% of its net earnings, in 2017.Moreover, the company is rationalizing capital expenditures, including store-remerchandising efforts to improve return on investment. As a result, Leggett expects to generate substantial future cash flows. We believe that the company’s strong liquidity position will continue to drive growth.What’s Wrong with the Stock?Though the company seems poised for long-term growth, volatility in raw material prices, particularly steel, has been a threat to margins in recent quarters. This has been hurting the company’s stock performance lately. Shares of Leggett declined 1.9% in the last three months, against the industry’s growth of 5.2%.Evidently, Leggett’s bottom-line and EBIT margins were hurt by raw material price inflation in third-quarter 2017. In fact, fluctuating steel prices impacted Leggett’s performance throughout 2016.Moreover, we believe the persistence of inflationary pressure remains a threat to Leggett’s earnings in 2017. Leggett’s results are likely to be adversely impacted in case of an increase in raw material prices. Consequently, the company narrowed earnings and sales guidance for 2017.Looking for Some Trending Picks?

This officially unlocked a procedure using which the tax code can be changed using a simple majority of only Republican votes, instead of the 60 votes norm usually followed. Trump and his fellow Republicans had campaigned on bringing about much needed tax reforms and such an event gets the members of GOP even closer to delivering on their promise.In a 216 to 212 vote, the House cleared the budget blueprint, with as many as 20 Republicans voting against it.

1478,LEG,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this furniture producer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. While Leggett’s bottom line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last quarter, the company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters. Well, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents, which represents a 9% decline from the year-ago period figure of 67 cents. However, the earnings estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,010 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayLeggett remains exposed to major volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company’s key raw materials and the market for the same being cyclical in nature. Incidentally, the company’s bottom line has declined year over year for three straight quarters now, owing to raw material price inflation. In the last quarter, earnings and EBIT fell 3% and 7.4% year over year, respectively due to steel price inflation. Moreover, management recently announced a second guidance cut for 2017 in less than two months. This was mainly accountable to increased steel price inflation, alongside a rise in LIFO costs and soft demand in the furniture and bedding space.Battered by these factors, Leggett’s shares have tumbled 8% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s 6.3% drop.On the brighter side, Leggett remains on track with its 2019 goals — aimed at achieving top-third TSR target in next three years. This will be aided by revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves. Though these initiatives bode well for the long run, we believe that Leggett’s bottom line is likely to be hurt by steel price inflation in the third quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Leggett is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Leggett has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 61 cents. Moreover, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Note that we caution against sell-rated stocks going into earnings announcements.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.03% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Carter's, Inc. (CRI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

1479,LEG,"Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) has been going through a rough phase owing to volatility in raw material prices. However, its long-term strategic plan remains on track.A glimpse of Leggett’s share price movement reveals that it has fallen nearly 6% year to date, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.6%. Let’s delve deeper and find out what is troubling this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Why is the Stock Struggling?Disappointing Performances & Bleak OutlookInvestors remain cautious about Leggett’s top-line performance that has missed expectations in eight of the last nine quarters. It reported dismal top- and bottom-line results in second-quarter 2017 due to raw material price inflation, which more than offset benefits of higher sales and lower tax rate. Also, the inflationary pressure dented operating margins.Consequently, management lowered its sales outlook for 2017 and narrowed its earnings per share guidance range. Sales for the year are now anticipated to grow by 4-7% to $3.9-$4.0 billion. Earlier, the company projected sales of $3.95-$4.05 billion that reflected 5-8% year-over-year growth. Also, it narrowed earnings to a band of $2.55-$2.65 per share from the previous range of $2.55-$2.75.Given the aforementioned troubles, the company’s earnings estimates have witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48 for 2017 and $2.74 for 2018 moved down 4.6% and 2.8%, respectively.Other HeadwindsLeggett remains exposed to volatility in raw material prices as steel is one of the company’s key raw materials and the steel market is cyclical in nature. Evidently, Leggett’s bottom line and operating margins were hurt by steel price inflation in the second quarter. In fact, fluctuating steel prices impacted Leggett’s performance throughout 2016. We expect the persistence of inflationary pressure to remain a threat to Leggett’s earnings in 2017.Apart from this, the company is susceptible to fluctuating metal margins as it is a manufacturer of steel rods. Alongside, intense competition from local as well as regional players and other macroeconomic factors remain threats to Leggett.Strategic Long-Term GoalsLeggett’s long-term strategic plan remains on track and it has already completed the first two parts of it successfully. While, the first part was to divest low-performing businesses, the second part comprised an improvement in margins and returns. Currently, the company is working on the third part of the plan, which aims to achieve top-line growth of 4%–5% annually.Markedly, Leggett has significant operating leverage to accomplish the third part of the plan as it has a considerable amount of retained spare production to meet the demand of $4 billion. In fact, solid market demand coupled with market share gains has been enhancing capacity utilization over the years.Meanwhile, the company has been focusing on boosting its business portfolio by increasing investment in areas that provide a competitive edge, simultaneously exiting underperforming operations and markets.Furthermore, in September 2016, Leggett had chalked out its goals for 2019, aimed at helping the company achieve its top-third TSR target in the following three years. These targets include revenue of about $4.75 billion, operating margin of 13.3%, earnings per share of $3.25 and a dividend of $1.70 per share.Well, the company believes revenues growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves like buybacks and dividend payments to be the main TSR drivers. Going forward, the company expects these targets to be fueled by organic growth, which in turn is anticipated to be backed by strategic buyouts, with the absence of any non-recurring factors.Bottom LineThough Leggett seems in trouble now, we believe the company’s long-term growth plans bode well for the stock.Want to Know About the Gems in the Consumer Discretionary Space?Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Discretionary sector include Crocs, Inc. (CROX  -  Free Report), G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. (GIII  -  Free Report) and PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report).Crocs, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% has pulled off average positive earnings surprise of 83.9% in the last four quarters. Also, the company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.    G-III Apparel, a Zacks Rank #1 stock has delivered positive earnings surprise of 42.3% in the last quarter. Moreover, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 15%.PVH Corp. carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.6%. Also, its earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters by an average of 3.6%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

The House approved almost $8 billion on Wednesday as a part of the Hurricane Harvey relief funding. However, this did not include the debt ceiling extension or provisions for government spending.Possible Fallout of Hurricane IrmaThe likelihood of a category 5 hurricane, Irma, hitting the coast of Florida this weekend has increased, according to the National Hurricane Center.

Fischer plans to quit in mid-October, whereas his term would have officially ended in June next year and his term as a Fed governor would have termed in early 2020.Economists commented that Fischer’s departure would raise speculations about whether Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen would continue with her role. Moreover, market watchers would be closely watching Fed’s moves as lower than targeted levels of inflation make it difficult for the central banks to raise rates.  Investors also have a keen eye on European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting scheduled for Thursday.Economic DataFed released its Beige book report on Wednesday.

1481,LEG,"Leggett & Platt Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017. While earnings were in line with estimates, sales lagged marginally. Further, the bottom line dropped year over year and sales grew. Following the mixed quarter, the company narrowed earnings and sales guidance for 2017.While the results had no impact on the stock price, shares of Leggett have underperformed the industry year to date. Leggett has dipped 1.3%, while the industry grew 5%.The company’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share dropped nearly 9% year over year. However, earnings for the quarter were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the quarter, benefits from higher sales were more than offset by increased raw material expenses.Delving DeeperWhile net sales rose 6% to $1,009.7 million, it fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,010.2 million. Including inter-segment sales, total sales came in at $1,083.6 million, up 4.3% year over year.Organic sales improved 6%, driven by persistent strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, and several other businesses. Additionally, sales gained from 4% rise in unit volume and 2% gain from raw material price inflation and currency. Also, acquisitions aided sales growth by 2%, somewhat offset by divestitures.Gross profit dropped 5% year over year to $215.8 million, while gross margin contracted 260 basis points (bps) to 21.4%. The company’s EBIT margin declined 290 bps to 10.8% in the third quarter. In dollar terms, adjusted EBIT was down 16% at $109.2 million. The fall in EBIT margin can be attributed to the pricing lag that the company generally undergoes in times of commodity inflation.Segment DetailsThird-quarter Residential Products’ sales of $426.7 million increased 5.8% from last year, as a 4% contribution from buyouts was offset by a 3% fall in same location sales. Volumes remained flat as growth in most businesses was fully offset by 2% sales decline due to lower pass-through sales of adjustable beds. Additionally, raw material price inflation and currency contributed 2% to sales. Including inter-segment sales, total sales for the segment rose 5.9% to $431.2 million.Sales of Furniture Products jumped 11.5% to $284 million, thanks to benefits from higher Adjustable Bed sales. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) grew 8.2% to $287.7 million. Same location sales for the segment were up 7%.The Industrial Products segment's sales fell 0.3% to $71.2 million, mainly due to divestitures completed in 2016 and a 3% fall in same location sales. Total sales, including inter-segment sales, slumped 6.7% to $135 million.The Specialized Products segment's sales improved 3.7% to $227.8 million. Same location sales rose 9% backed by solid Automotive volumes and favorable currency impact. Divestiture of CVP hurt sales by 5%. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) climbed 3.8% to $229.7 million.FinancialsLeggett ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $342.9 million and long-term debt of $1,044.4 million. The company generated $105.4 million in cash flow from operations in the third quarter, with year-to-date cash flows of $261.5 million.The company had net debt to net capital ratio of 38% at quarter end, close to the higher end of its targeted range of 30-40%. Further, Leggett’s debt was 2.1times of its trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.In August, management announced third-quarter dividend of 36 cents per share. Additionally, the company repurchased nearly 0.9 million shares for an average price of $47.24 during the quarter under review, where it also issued 0.4 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. In first three quarters of 2017, Leggett bought back 3.3 million shares, while it issued 1.6 million shares.GuidanceFollowing the third quarter, management narrowed sales and earnings outlook for 2017. Sales for 2017 are now anticipated to grow by 5-7% to $3.95-$4 billion. This reflects the raising of the lower-end of the guidance range from the old sales guidance of 4-7% growth to $3.9-$4.0 billion. Consequently, adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be nearly 12%.Moreover, management narrowed reported EPS range to a band of $2.49-$2.54 from the previous range of $2.55-$2.65. Adjusted EPS is now envisioned in the range of $2.45-$2.50, compared with the previous range of $2.40-$2.50.For the fourth quarter, the company now anticipates sales of $0.99-$1.04 billion. Reported earnings per share are expected to be in the range of 62-67 cents, while adjusted earnings are projected in the 58-63 cents per share range.Additionally, continuing with its trend of generating more cash than required to fund dividends and capital expenditures, Leggett expects operating cash flows of about $425 million for 2017. Capital expenditures for the year are anticipated to be approximately $160 million, while the company intends to spend $185 million toward dividend payouts. The company outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50-60% of net earnings.Further, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company expects to continue with share repurchase program, having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year, after fulfilling all priority requirements.3 Trending Picks From Consumer Discretionary SpaceSome better-ranked stocks in the consumer discretionary space include Skechers U.S.A., Inc.

1482,LEG,"Steel price volatility seems to be taking a toll on Leggett & Platt Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report), as the company cut its 2017 outlook for the second time in less than two months. Clearly, this toned down investors’ sentiment as evident from the 3.5% fall in Leggett’s shares in Sep 6 after-market trading session. Well, unstable steel prices have long been a hindrance for Leggett, which has tumbled 8.1% in the past year, compared with the industry’s 2.6% dip.Concurrently, the company also announced the divestiture of Masterack business, which was the remaining part of its Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) Group. Notably, the sale is expected to benefit Leggett’s bottom line by 4 cents in 2017. So, let’s delve deeper into yesterday’s announcements and see how it impacts the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Second View Cut in Less than 2 Months — What does it Indicate?Leggett trimmed its 2017 forecasts, owing to increased steel price inflation, an expected consequential rise in LIFO costs and soft demand in the furniture and bedding space. The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share in a band of $2.40-$2.50, down from the previously guided range of $2.55-$2.65. Including the 4 cents impact from CVP’s sale, earnings are expected to be in a band of $2.44-$2.54.   While sales are still anticipated to range from $3.9-$4 billion, the company lowered its full-year EBIT margin expectations to 12%. Earlier, management projected EBIT margin to lie between 12.5% and 13%. Finally, Leggett envisions operating cash flow to be roughly $425 million, compared with the prior outlook of over $450 million.Well, this marks Leggett’s second view cut in little over a month time span. Evidently, steel price woes had compelled the company to curtail fiscal 2017 earnings and EBIT margin views, when it reported dismal second-quarter results on Jul 27.  Both the top and bottom line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the latter also plunged year over year. Incidentally, Leggett has missed sales estimates in eight of the last nine quarters, while earnings have been lower-than-expected in two out of the past three quarters. Given the dismal surprise history and back-to-back view cuts, tough times seem to be ahead for Leggett.Sale of CVP to be Accretive to 2017 EPSConcurrently, management revealed that it divested its last CVP Group business — Masterack, on Aug 4. This unit is engaged in the production of aluminum, steel and composite van racking, storage systems and shelving for commercial work trucks. The deal led to a pre-tax loss of $3 million, which was compensated by a tax gain of $8 million. Overall, this divestiture is likely to augment 2017 earnings per share by 4 cents.Well, Leggett divested its first CVP unit in 2015 and sold another small CVP unit in 2016, after which it held the remaining operations for sale.The CVP Group formed part of Leggett’s Specialized Products segment that witnessed a 1.3% rise in sales in the second quarter. Though strong Automotive volumes fueled sales, the 2016 divestiture of CVP units and unfavorable currency translations were constraints. While these obstacles could pose threats to Leggett’s top line, the renewed steel price inflation is likely to boost the same. Evidently, Leggett’s second-quarter sales were augmented by higher volumes and raw material price inflation.The Bottom LineAll said, it remains to be seen whether yesterday’s decline was just a one-time incident or is the furniture big-wig up for further downside. Until then, investors can count on some better-ranked stocks, which appear promising.3 Retail Stocks in the SpotlightLumber Liquidators Holdings Inc.

The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Leggett & Platt has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.9, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.1. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Leggett & Platt’s current PE ratio slightly below its midpoint (which is 20.4) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.8. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Leggett & Platt has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Leggett & Platt’s stock in the near term too.  P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Leggett & Platt has a P/S ratio of about 1.7. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is somewhat below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Leggett & Platt currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes LEG a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Leggett & Platt might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of D. This gives LEG a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing. The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days, compared to none higher, while the full year estimate has seen one upward and four downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 4.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has declined about 1.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and Consensus  Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and Consensus | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteThis somewhat bearish trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineLeggett & Platt is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 20% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1484,LEG,"Shares of Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) declined nearly 7.5% since it reported dismal second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27.In fact, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock was down 2.1% in the last six months against the industry’s growth of 8.6%. Currently, the industry is placed at the top 21% of the Zacks classified industries (53 out of 256). Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Discretionary sector gained 7.5% and is placed at the top 38% (6 out of 16).Let’s find out more about the stock, which exhibits a Momentum Score of “C”.Concerns/WeaknessesLeggett remains exposed to major volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company’s key raw materials and its market being cyclical in nature. Evidently, the company’s bottom line and EBIT margins were hurt by steel price inflation in the second quarter. Also, the fluctuating steel prices affected Leggett’s performance throughout 2016.Further, the company posted dismal second-quarter results with both its earnings and sales falling short of estimates. Also, the bottom line declined year over year. In fact, the earnings debacle could be attributable to raw material price inflation, which was more than offset benefits from higher sales and lower tax rate.Nevertheless, sales grew year over year with organic sales gaining from solid volumes. The volumes growth was driven by robust performance at Automotive and Adjustable Beds, which are expected to remain growth drivers in 2017.However, following the dismal quarter, management lowered its sales outlook for 2017 that resulted in tweaked earnings and EBIT views. Currently, earnings are anticipated in band of $2.55–$2.65 versus $2.55–$2.75, projected earlier.This has also weighed upon the estimates that witnesses downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.59 for 2017 and $2.81 for 2018 declined 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively. Also, estimates for the third quarter moved down to 70 cents per share from 73 cents.Apart from this, Leggett is also susceptible to fluctuating metal margins as it is a manufacturer of steel rods. Additionally, currency headwinds, economic downturns and intense competition weigh upon the company’s performance.Can the Tables Turn?Leggett remains on track with its 2019 targets, which is somewhat reflected in its constant shareholder-friendly moves. These targets aim at aiding the company to achieve its top-third TSR target in the following three years.Well, management believes revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves like buybacks and dividend payments to be the main TSR drivers. Furthermore, the company expects these targets to be fueled by organic growth backed by strategic buyouts.Bottom LineWe expect Leggett’s future targets to produce results and offset the aforesaid headwinds but this might take time.Meanwhile, you can count on better-ranked stocks that include Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (BSET  -  Free Report), Central Garden & Pet Company (CENT  -  Free Report) and Masonite International Corporation (DOOR  -  Free Report).Bassett Furniture Industries has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 10.9% in the trailing four quarters, and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1485,LEG,"Leggett & Platt Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) posted dismal second-quarter 2017 results, as both earnings and sales fell short of estimates and the bottom line also declined year over year. The earnings debacle could be attributed to raw material price inflation, which in turn also dented margins. The lower-than-expected results also compelled management to tweak its outlook for 2017.Consequently, shares of this engineered products manufacturer tumbled 6.5% on Jul 27 after-market trading session. Further, Leggett has underperformed the industry over the last one year with its shares down 1.5% against the latter’s 12% growth.The company’s quarterly adjusted earnings of 64 cents per share dropped about 3% year over year, and also came a penny short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the quarter, benefits from higher sales and lower tax rate were more than offset by increased raw material expenses. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise   Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteDelving DeeperWhile net sales rose 3.2% to $989.3 million, it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,003.8 million. Including inter-segment sales, total sales came in at $1,062.9 million, up 1% year over year.Organic sales improved 4%, thanks to a 2% rise in volumes and raw material price inflation. Volumes were largely driven by robust Automotive and Adjustable Bed sales, though it dipped sequentially owing to soft demand in certain markets and tough year-over-year comparisons. Further, divestitures (net of buyouts) had a small impact on sales. Notably, this marked Leggett’s second straight quarter of organic sales growth after seven consecutive declines that were attributed to deflation and currency headwinds.Gross profit dropped 2% year over year to $230.1 million, while gross margin contracted 110 basis points (bps) to 23.3%. The company’s adjusted EBIT margin declined 140 bps to 12.4% in the second quarter. In dollar terms, adjusted EBIT was down 7.4% at $122.3 million. The fall in EBIT margin is attributed to the pricing lag that the company generally undergoes in times of commodity inflation.Segment DetailsThe company changed its segment reporting in sync with the changes made to the organizational structure, effective Jan 1, 2017. As a result, the Home Furniture group has moved from Residential Products to Furniture Products segment (formerly Commercial Products segment). Further, the Machinery group has moved from Specialized Products to Residential Products segment.Second-quarter Residential Products’ sales of $407.8 million remained nearly flat from last year, as a 3% contribution from buyouts was offset by a 3% fall in same location sales. The drop in same location sales was accountable to a 5% dip in volumes, partly compensated by a 2% positive impact from inflation. Including inter-segment sales, total sales for the segment remained flat at $412 million.Sales of Furniture Products jumped 13.4% to $267.2 million, thanks to benefits from higher Adjustable Bed sales. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) grew 7.4% to $271.6 million.The Industrial Products segment's sales fell 5% to $75.9 million, mainly due to divestitures completed in 2016. Total sales, including inter-segment sales, slumped 7.3% to $139.2 million.The Specialized Products segment's sales improved 1.3% to $238.4 million. Same location sales rose 5% backed by solid Automotive volumes, partly offset by negative currency impact. Divestitures, net of acquisitions, negatively impacted sales by 3%. Total sales for the segment (including inter-segment sales) climbed 1.2% to $240.1 million.FinancialsLeggett ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $335.1 million and long-term debt of $1,183.5 million. Leggett generated $156.1 million in cash flow from operations during first-half 2017.The company had net debt to net capital ratio of 39% at quarter end, close to the higher end of its targeted range of 30–40%. Further, Leggett ended the quarter with its debt double of its trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA.In May, management announced second-quarter dividend of 36 cents per share. Additionally, the company repurchased nearly 0.2 million shares during the quarter under review, where it also issued 0.2 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. In first-half 2017, Leggett bought back 2.4 million shares, while it issued 1.2 million shares.GuidanceFollowing the unimpressive quarter, management lowered its sales outlook for 2017, which resulted in tweaked EPS and EBIT views.Sales for 2017 are now anticipated to grow by 4–7% to $3.9–$4.0 billion. This marks a nearly 1% reduction from the old sales guidance of $3.95–$4.05 billion that reflected a 5–8% year-over-year growth. Further, the company now expects low-to-mid-single-digit volume growth, driven by strength in Automotive, Adjustable Bed, International Spring, Work Furniture, and Geo Components businesses. This falls slightly below management’s previous expectation of mid-single-digit volume growth. The company still anticipates raw material price related increases to aid sales growth in 2017.The company now expects full year EBIT margin of approximately 12.5–13%, compared with the earlier forecast of 13%. Considering all factors, management narrowed its EPS range to a band of $2.55–$2.65 from the previous range of $2.55–$2.75.Additionally, continuing with its trend of generating more cash than required to fund dividends and capital expenditures, Leggett expects operating cash flows of over $450 million for 2017. Capital expenditures for the year are anticipated to be approximately $160 million, while the company intends to spend $185 million toward dividend payouts. The company outlined the target dividend payout ratio to be 50–60% of net earnings.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects to continue with share repurchase program, having a standing authorization to buy back up to 10 million shares every year, after fulfilling all priority requirements. The company plans to repurchase roughly 3 million shares in full-year 2017, while targeting issuing 1.5 million shares as part of employee benefit plans.3 Trending Picks From LEG’s SpaceBassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated (BSET  -  Free Report) has positive estimate revisions for the current fiscal over the last 30 days.

1486,LEG,"The earnings reporting cycle is moving ahead in full steam, with numerous companies posting their quarterly numbers this week. Per the Earnings Preview dated Jul 25, 36.1% of the S&P 500 members have reported results. While results announced so far showcases year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines, the pace of the same has decelerated sequentially. Nevertheless, the fraction of companies that have topped earnings and revenue estimates have increased from the last quarter.  Coming to numbers, we note that out of the 128 S&P 500 companies that have reported their quarterly numbers, approximately 77.3% posted positive earnings surprises, while 70.3% beat top-line expectations. Further, earnings for these companies that have reported so far have advanced 7% from the same period last year, while revenues have jumped 4.2%.Further, as per the Earnings Trends dated Jul 21, earnings for the total S&P 500 companies are projected to improve 8.6% from the year-ago period with total revenue climbing 1.2%. As of now, the overall picture looks favorable for this reporting season.A Look at the Consumer Discretionary SectorThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which five are expected to witness an earnings decline in the second quarter, with Autos being major drag. The Consumer Discretionary sector, which also houses major home furnishing stocks, is poised to suffer a 1.5% drop in earnings this quarter, while revenues are expected to rise a notable 7.8%.This sector, which is ranked among the Bottom 44% of all Zacks sectors, has been reeling under several challenges like volatile commodity prices, ever changing consumer spending patterns and adverse currency fluctuations. Nevertheless, rising consumer confidence, on the back of an improving labor market and housing segment recovery, gives out positive signals. Driven by such factors, the sector has grown 13.6% so far this year, surpassing the S&P 500 market’s jump of 10.6%.All said, let’s see what awaits the following Home – Furnishing stocks that are queued up for second-quarter 2017 earnings releases on Jul 27.Can LEG & MHK Spring a Surprise?Manufacturer of engineered products – Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  The company is unlikely to beat earnings because it has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

In 2017, management expects strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, and Geo Components businesses. This in turn is expected to boost volume and driving sales. Further, management expects sales growth to fuel earnings in 2017, which makes us hopeful of the quarter to be reported. However, Leggett remains exposed to volatility in raw material prices. Evidently, Leggett’s bottom line was hurt by steel price inflation in the first quarter and persistence of inflationary pressure remains a threat to Leggett’s earnings in 2017. (Read more: Will Volatile Steel Prices Hit Leggett's Q2 Earnings?)Moving to Mohawk Industries, Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mohawk is likely to benefit from its strategy of achieving growth via acquisitions. The company’s EPS guidance for the second quarter (including acquisitions) represents a 1.7% to 4.3% increase year over year. Moreover, Mohawk Industries is well poised to gain traction on the current positive housing scenario, as it has heavy exposure to the U.S. residential sector. Steady job and wage growth, a recovering economy, affordable interest/mortgage rates, rapidly increasing household formation hint at strong demand in 2017. However, we are apprehensive about the persistent pressure from adverse foreign currency movement, since Mohawk Industries generates a significant amount of its revenues from outside the U.S.  Also, the company expects high raw materials cost to outweigh pricing in the second quarter, which remains a concern.

1512,LEG,"Apart from this, the reopening of government offices boosted customer traffic to stores for buy-now and wear-now apparel. These positives aided retailers to generate healthy sales for the month of October with consumer spending gaining some pace. As a result, the key metric data for most retailers reflected growth for the month of October.
"
1513,LEG,"Among the retailers, clothing chain L Brands Inc. (LTD), a specialty retailer of women’s intimate and other apparel, beauty and personal care
"
1514,LEG,"products, led the pack with an 8% rise comparable-store sales and an 11.4% increase in net sales. This was followed by drugstore operator Walgreen Co. (WAG), which posted a 5.8% rise in comps and a 6.1% increase in total sales.

"
1517,LEG,"Apparel and accessories retailer, Cato Corporation (CATO) reported a 3% rise in comps with a 4% improvement in net sales. Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST), the warehouse retailer, also delivered comps growth of 3%. Meanwhile, net sales for October rose 6% to $8.15 billion from $7.66 billion in the year-ago period.The Buckle Inc. (BKE), a retailer of casual apparels, footwear and accessories for men and women, witnessed a 2.6% rise in comps when compared with Oct 2012 results.

"
1518,LEG,"Drugstore chain retailer Rite Aid Corp. (RAD  -  Free Report) reported a 2.1% growth in comparable-store sales for Oct 2013, primarily driven by improved comps results at its pharmacy stores. Total drugstore sales climbed 2.2% to $1.961 billion for the month.
"

"
1521,LEG,"The retail industry is rapidly evolving with a dramatic change in consumer buying habits. Satisfying customers and enriching buying experience require new strategies from retailers today. Modern retailing, interestingly enough, is a new game with new rules.
"
1522,LEG,"Despite the gradual rise in consumer discretionary purchases, the sluggish U.S. economy and continued weak in Europe cannot be ignored. Burdened with the lackluster scenario, retailers have largely concentrated on buyers’ needs and lured them with innovative products, attractive discounts, free shipping and the ease of shopping through smartphones and tablets. However, these strategies only helped in generating modest revenues.
"
1523,LEG,"Thus, retailers essentially need to come up with brilliant strategies, while incorporating technological advancements and utilizing their real estate portfolio to the optimum level. In short, they need to Experiment, Differentiate, Optimize and Transform. In doing so, most retailers today are adopting an “omnichannel” approach, utilizing all possible mediums to engage consumers, including brick and mortar stores, online, and mobile.
"
1524,LEG,"Banking on this new mantra, Staples Inc. (SPLS), the world’s largest retailer of office products and services and second largest online retailer, launched its first omnichannel stores, what it refers to as ""the future of retail.""
"
1525,LEG,"Simply put, through this omnichannel strategy, Staples hopes to integrate its retail network with enhanced digital capabilities. The company stated that stores will incorporate its .com and mobile assets. Alongside, the stores will feature Staples.com kiosks.
"
1526,LEG,"This new era store concept, with all its attractions could well prove to be a game changer in the long run for Staples. Providing shoppers the ease of shopping on their own terms and enriching their in-store shopping experience could be a crucial point of differentiation among other retailers.
"
1527,LEG,"In harmony with the evolving retail industry, department store operator Macy's Inc. (M) also adopted an omnichannel strategy. Despite macroeconomic challenges and cautious consumer spending, Macy’s continues to post healthy results. Management largely attributes the credit to its omnichannel strategy aimed at enhancing customers’ shopping experience.
"
1528,LEG,"Other notable retailers who are dancing to the tune of the omnichannel strategy include Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) and Chico’s FAS Inc. (CHS).Trends to Rule Going Forward
"
1529,LEG,"Some of the trends that are expected to rule the retail sector going forward include employing more technological solutions, incorporating customer feedback and targeting additional audiences with products and services.
"
1530,LEG,"With the growth of the .com era, shoppers have largely adopted new purchasing modes, using the Internet, mobile phones and tablets. Consumers today prefer to use their laptops or smartphones to compare prices of products they want to buy and place orders online, instead of visiting the company’s stores. This growing trend has guided major U.S. retail chains to downsize their physical retail operations, and in turn develop their e-Commerce and m-Commerce sites to attract customers.
"
1531,LEG,"Other traits that are expected to affect the retail industry are the growth of self-service options for processes such as checking out and finding items in stores. These offerings provide greater convenience and faster transactions, and they satisfy shoppers who prefer to visit brick-and-mortar locations for immediately purchasing predetermined items.
"
1532,LEG,"Of late, the store-within-a-store concept has been making headlines, though it's nothing new to retailers. J. C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP) is one such retailer which has been focusing on this business strategy for quite some time. The recent one to join the league is consumer electronic retailer Best Buy Company Inc. (BBY), which has been facing stiff competition from industry bellwethers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to increase its footfall, sales and profitability.
"
1533,LEG,"Best Buy is leaving no stone unturned to woo consumers and attain incremental revenue, and it was well evident from its strategic initiative of opening over 1,400 ""Samsung Experience Shops"" within its stores, announced in April. The model seems to be working for the retailer, which also has a dedicated floor area for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) products.
"
1534,LEG,"Taking the initiatives further, Best Buy recently unveiled its partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) to roll out the “Windows Store” across its 500 outlets in the U.S. with an additional 100 in Canada. The electronics retailer come out with better-than-expected results for the October quarter, but warned about trends in its margins for the all-important holiday season quarter.
"
1535,LEG,"Further, retailers across the industry are identifying the need to know their customers better, to drive growth. In today’s retail world, where consumer is the king, companies are focusing on effectively using data and analytics to better understand consumers, as well as for branding, product management, and making better pricing decisions. Focused on leveraging large amounts of consumer-related data and providing personalized solutions to customers, retailers are adopting the technologies like Cloud Computing.Challenges and Some Remedial Measures
"
1536,LEG,"The retail industry is highly competitive and encounters significant challenges. Although the U.S. economy has started witnessing a recovery, we still believe that 2013 will not fully mark the resurrection. Consumers are slowly regaining confidence and cautiously increasing their spending.
"
1537,LEG,"Moreover, consumers remain sensitive to macroeconomic factors including interest rate hikes, increase in fuel and energy costs, credit availability, unemployment levels, and high household debt levels, which may negatively impact their discretionary spending and eventually adversely affect the growth and profitability of retail companies.Macroeconomic Conditions: Retail is no different from other U.S. industries, which is highly dependent on the economy to prosper. Such heightened dependence on the economy and factors like job growth and interest rates indicate that a speedy recovery of the economy is vital for the health of the retail industry. While the unemployment rate has decreased considerably over time, consumers are now beginning to draw out their savings to spend, anticipating some economic recovery.Changes in Consumer Needs, Attitudes and Behavior: The growth of modern retail is linked to consumer needs, attitudes and behavior. Adapting to the sluggish economic environment prevalent over the last few years, consumer behavior has shifted to being more conservative. This has now become the regular behavioral pattern of consumers as they remain budget conscious, seeking greater value. In the process, buyers are swiftly switching to the less expensive brands and consolidating shopping trips.
"
1538,LEG,"Moreover, people today prefer to cook at home instead of eat out. This shift in consumer behavior is inducing retailers to adopt various strategies to stay in the competition. Retailers are offering trend-right and well-designed assortments at compelling prices, without compromising on the quality, in order to drive traffic.Staging Stores: The waning popularity of brick-and-mortar store formats has made it essential for retailers to adopt new techniques like ‘staging stores’ to woo customers. Staging basically refers to the act of making the company’s stores attractive, where people like to spend their time. The idea behind this strategy is to make shopping interesting for consumers, so that they would want to walk into the stores, rather than shop online.Zacks Industry Rank
