3,CMS,"The Trump administration is trying to make health insurance affordable again. That's the aim of a regulation issued earlier this month by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The new rule would give states greater leeway over how they comply with ObamaCare's essential health benefits, or EHB, mandate, which requires all insurance policies to cover a group of ten categories of healthcare services.Relaxing ObamaCare's rules is a far cry from the full-scale repeal Republicans promised over the last eight years and especially during the 2016 campaign.But with Congress seemingly unwilling to take up healthcare reform before this November's mid-term elections, incremental regulatory tweaks from the administration are the best that Americans desperate for affordable coverage can hope for.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe EHB mandate effectively prohibits insurers from selling low-cost, bare-bones plans. All 22 million people in the individual market — whether they shop on the exchanges or not — must choose a comprehensive policy that covers everything from maternity care to prescription drugs to substance-abuse treatment.The mandate also requires insurers to cover preventive services, such as vaccines and counseling,  at zero cost to patients.Those extra benefits aren't free; providing them costs insurers money. So they have raised premiums. A Heritage Foundation review of several state-level studies found that, on average, the EHB mandate increases premiums by 9%.  An analysis by Today eHealth Inc. posits a much larger impact — a 47% increase.As premiums have soared, thanks in part to the cost-inflating EHB mandate, more and more Americans have turned their backs on Obamacare's exchanges. Enrollment in exchange plans fell from a peak of 12.7 million in 2016  to 12.2 million in 2017 to just 11.8 million in 2018.In other words, nearly a million people could no longer afford the plans — or concluded the policies simply didn't deliver enough value to justify the expense.Several states have contemplated weakening the EHB mandate in order to reduce the cost of insurance within their borders. Idaho officials, for example, recently proposed a measure that would allow insurers to sell policies that openly ignore Obamacare's benefits requirements.The Trump administration rightly blocked Idaho from implementing its plan. Obamacare remains the law of the land. Allowing state officials to openly disregard federal statutes would set a terrible precedent.Iowa found a more nuanced work-around. Gov. Kim Reynolds just signed a law which empowers the Iowa Farm Bureau and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield to offer ""health benefit plans"" to any person who joins the Farm Bureau, a non-profit community organization open to all Hawkeye State residents. The Hawkeye State is adapting a model that originated — and worked well — in Tennessee.Iowa law does not consider these plans health insurance: ""a health benefit plan sponsored by a nonprofit agricultural organization domiciled in the state for its members shall not be deemed to be insurance and shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the commissioner of insurance.""Hence, the plans aren't subject to Obamacare's cost-inflating regulations — including the EHB mandate.  Consequently, Iowans may soon have access to more affordable healthcare options through the Farm Bureau.The Trump administration's new EHB rule could give states yet another way to ratchet down premiums. At present, federal regulations define the essential health benefits in a given state relative to a benchmark plan selected by that state. That plan serves as the standard that all other plans have to follow.Under the new CMS rule, which takes effect in 2020, states have three new options for tailoring their EHB rules. They can set their EHB requirements according to the benchmark plan that another state is using.  They can replace one or more of their EHB categories with those from another state. Or they can design their own essential health benefit categories.If one state's benchmark plan has slightly less generous — and consequently less expensive — coverage of essential health benefits, another state can ""import"" those standards as its own. Or a state can take the flexibility the federal rule provides and build custom EHB requirements that draw on the best that other states have to offer.The CMS rule falls short of scrapping the EHB mandate completely. But it's a small dose of regulatory relief that should help decrease premiums at the margins. And that's exactly what the Trump administration should be doing given Congress's reluctance to act.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

5,CMS,"Last month, the Trump administration saved ObamaCare from destruction. It was a difficult decision — and the correct one.Administration officials shot down a daring plan from Idaho Gov. C.L. ""Butch"" Otter that would have allowed Idaho insurers to ignore ObamaCare's premium-inflating regulations.Under the proposal, insurers would have been able to offer discounted coverage to healthy customers. Such discounts are currently prohibited by ObamaCare's ""community rating"" mandate, which requires insurers to charge people the same premium regardless of health status. In effect, healthy customers subsidize sick ones by paying artificially high premiums.Insurers would also have been permitted to sell inexpensive, bare-bones policies. These plans don't comply with ObamaCare's ""essential health benefits"" mandate, which requires all plans to cover ten broad categories of medical services, including substance abuse rehab and prescription drugs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Idaho plan would have drastically lowered premiums for many state residents who buy their own coverage. But it also would have set a dangerous precedent. ObamaCare is still the law of the land. States can't nullify federal law. Executive branch officials must enforce existing statutes — even when they disagree with them.It's no mystery why Idaho officials are eager to circumvent the Affordable Care Act. The law's rules and regulations have caused premiums to soar. Rates for individual plans on the state's exchange increased an average of 24% in 2017. Average premiums spiked even more dramatically this year — 38%. One insurer, Regence Blue Shield of Idaho, raised rates by 51%.To relieve consumers, Idaho's Department of Insurance announced that it would allow insurers to sell plans that don't meet ObamaCare's requirements, as long as they also offered at least one ObamaCare-compliant policy. Blue Cross of Idaho was set to start selling such noncompliant policies, dubbed Freedom Blue plans.Federal law prohibits such an arrangement. So the Department of Health and Human Services, led by newly appointed Secretary Alex Azar, had little choice but to block Idaho's effort. In a letter to Gov. Otter, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma asserted that ObamaCare ""remains the law and we have a duty to enforce and uphold the law.""At the same time, she praised the governor's ""dedication to the people of Idaho and (his) efforts to address the damage caused by (ObamaCare).""Fortunately, there are legal avenues for Idaho and other states to expand access to affordable coverage without compromising the rule of law. Consider the Trump administration's recent proposal regarding short-term health plans.ObamaCare's mandates don't apply to short-term plans, which people have traditionally used to fill gaps in coverage when they change jobs or move to another state. These plans offer limited benefits. And insurers can medically underwrite applicants. So healthy people can get a good deal. The plans typically cost hundreds of dollars less per month than ObamaCare-compliant ones.Enrollment in short-term plans surged more than 150% from 2013 to 2015; consumers flocked to the cheaper plans instead of enrolling in ACA-compliant exchange plans.To scuttle this alternative, the Obama administration issued a rule banning short-term plans that last longer than three months. But earlier this year, the Trump administration issued a proposed rule that would reverse the Obama-era regulation. Insurers would be permitted to sell short-term plans lasting up to a year. Americans could freely choose between less regulated, more affordable short-term plans and ObamaCare-compliant exchange plans.Association health plans could offer another legal alternative to ObamaCare. In January, the Department of Labor proposed a rule to expand AHPs, which enable small businesses and self-employed individuals to join together to purchase health coverage. Similar to short-term plans, AHPs are exempt from many of ObamaCare's costly mandates. The rule would effectively give small firms and individuals who previously couldn't afford health insurance a more affordable option.These are the sorts of workarounds Idaho officials should look for. By all indications, they're already doing so. After Administrator Verma shot down their original plan, Idaho officials met with Trump administration officials and Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, to find ways to dodge ObamaCare's rules while staying within the letter of the law.Gov. Otter and Idaho Insurance Department Director Dean Cameron recently encouraged CMS to allow short-term policies to be automatically renewable — a reform that would further facilitate their use as more conventional health plans.Idaho's leaders are right to make this pivot. Their plan to ignore ObamaCare's most harmful provisions would have helped consumers but undermined the rule of law. It's far better to work with the administration to find legitimate strategies for making coverage affordable.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:ObamaCare Is The Real Junk Insurance, And It's Killing People'Medicare Extra' Delivers Socialized Medicine In Slow MotionWhat 'United States of Care' Truly Cares About  Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

7,CMS,"Biotechnology company Omeros (OMER) rocketed higher by more than a quarter of its value Friday after revenue from eye-surgery drug Omidria beat its typical summertime sales weakness and topped expectations on double-digit growth vs. the year-earlier period.XBut one analyst noted that the sales trajectory for Omidria is unclear as its status at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is set to change next month.Omidria is a drug added to an irrigation solution and used during cataract surgery or intraocular lens replacement. It currently has pass-through reimbursement status, meaning it is paid separately by the CMS when used in ambulatory surgery centers or in hospital outpatient departments.Pass-through status is meant to last no more than two years. Omidria was granted that status in October 2014. It is set to expire on Dec. 31. How Omidria is reimbursed after that will be key to its future trajectory, Needham analyst Serge Belanger said in a note to clients.""If no CMS reimbursement is extended, Omidria would be reimbursed as part of a procedure bundling payment,"" he said. ""It's unclear what the impact would be on Omidria pricing (likely lower) and volume (potentially higher).""IBD'S TAKE: Omeros isn't the only stock to enjoy a major gap-up following its third-quarter earnings report. Head to IBD's Stock Spotlight for a look at how shares of a company that provides private label and branded credit cards reacted to earnings.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Omeros popped 29% to close at 18.17 in high volume after earlier lifting as much as 42.1%. Omeros led IBD's 457-company Biotech industry group, which dipped a collective fraction.For the third quarter, sales of Omidria came in at $21.7 million, up 92% year over year, and beating expectations for $17.4 million, Belanger wrote. Belanger kept his buy rating and 28 price target on Omeros.""Omeros' third-quarter financials surpassed expectations as Omidria shook off its usual summer weakness,"" he said. ""Based on early fourth-quarter sales trends, Omidria is annualizing in the $90 million-range.""Omeros also offered an update on its drug, known as OMS721, which is enrolling a late-stage trial in patients with a rare blood disease known as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. The trial will be used for potential approval in the U.S. and Europe.The firm is also looking at OMS721 in a kidney disease known as IgA nephropathy. For approval the Food and Drug Administration will require a single successful Phase 3 trial showing a reduction in proteinuria, the result of overproduction of proteins by the body.Belanger notes that this trial could start before year-end.In other financial news, Omeros reported losses of 16 cents per share, which also topped Belanger's expectations for a 34-cent per share loss. In the year-earlier period, Omeros reported a 34-cent loss per share.RELATED:Sage Therapeutics Hits Record On Potential $600 Million Depression DrugTesaro Takes Swipe At AstraZeneca's Ovarian Cancer Drug SalesWhy This Biotech Crashed Despite Topping Breast Cancer Drug Sales

11,CMS,"Health Reform: There were lots of celebrations on the left side of the aisle after the Senate GOP bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare died. The good times will be short lived, because one way or another ObamaCare is going away, and it's not at all clear that Democrats will gain additional leverage over what comes next by waiting for its collapse.It was amusing to hear Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer say, after the Senate bill failed, that Republicans should ""work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long-term stability to the markets and improves our health care system.""Lower premiums, stabilize insurance markets, improve health care? Wasn't that what ObamaCare was supposed to do in the first place?While Schumer and company were busy calling Republicans mass murderers, here's what was actually happening with ObamaCare.As economist Herbert Stein once put it, if something can't go on forever, it won't.That's the reality facing ObamaCare. And it's one Democrats have so far been able to avoid by focusing the public's ire on the fumbling GOP efforts to come up with a replacement plan.But with repeal-and-replace now off the table, all we have left is the self-destructing ObamaCare. Don't be surprised if ObamaCare's popularity suddenly nose-dives again.So the GOP's answer to Schumer should be: You had your chance to fix health care. You blew it. Twice. First when you passed ObamaCare, and second when you refused to admit that mistake and decided to cast Republicans as evil. Why should the GOP reward you with a third?Plus, as the ObamaCare exchanges continue to crumble and as more states chafe at Medicaid's costs, it will be easier for Republicans to get what they want on their own — if Republicans are smart enough to seize the opportunity, that is.RELATED:What Should The GOP Do Next On Heath Reform?

12,CMS,"Medical pricing in the United States is controlled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency with a budget equal to the production of the 16th largest economy in the world. This agency fixes prices using the recommendations of the Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC), a 31-member committee formed almost 30 years ago.The ripple effect of these price controls causes Americans to spend on health care an amount equal to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Germany, Europe's largest economy and the fourth-largest economy in the world.Nevertheless, in the 2000s, self-described patient advocates blamed free-market policies (which were never tried) for the broken health care system that prompted Congress and President Barack Obama to sign the Affordable Care Act in 2010. These same voices now say replacing ObamaCare with free-market policies would make health care and insurance even less affordable.The fact is that market forces are not to blame for America's broken health care system any more than two plus two equals five. Let's break down the math.The CMS is essentially the taxpayer-funded health insurer of almost one-third of Americans on Medicare or Medicaid. The CMS sets baseline medical prices by determining the reimbursement rates paid to health care providers who treat Medicare and Medicaid patients. Private insurers then use these rates as a baseline for setting their own reimbursement rates.The CMS' 2017 budget is $1.01 trillion, a little less than the GDP of Indonesia, the 16th largest economy in the world, according to projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). For reference, IMF projects the entire economic output of Russia will be $1.56 trillion in 2017. Russia has the 11th largest economy and the second most powerful military in the world — 15,000 tanks, a massive nuclear arsenal and 144 million people.Surely the CMS will use its trillion tax dollars — about $8,000 per U.S. household — to provide most Americans with high-quality health care in 2017, right? Not even close. The CMS will spend its budget on roughly one-third of Americans, 132 million enrollees. However, because Medicare and Medicaid prove to be only partial insurance coverage, many patients choose to purchase private supplemental insurance policies to cover the gaps in this coverage.Adding the CMS population's costs to the rest of the country's health-care-related expenditures, Americans spend $3.35 trillion dollars on health care and insurance each year. This puts total U.S. health care expenditures on par with the GDP of Germany, the largest economy in Europe. Were ""U.S. Health Care Expenditures"" a nation, it would have the 5th largest economy in the world.So, who drives all this spending? Government advocates console us that Medicaid spending parallels that of the nation's overall spending on health care. This is an understatement — and a misleading one. The fact is, CMS spending drives all other spending. Many people do not realize that Medicare reimbursement rates are the baseline against which almost all private insurers set their rates. If Medicare payment rates go up, private insurance company rates go up a proportional amount.Now, who sets Medicare rates — and by extension, health care prices for the entire country? Medicare rates are strongly influenced by a small group of people at the American Medical Association known as the Relative Value Scale Update Committee. As of 2010, the CMS had accepted 94% of the recommendations the RUC had offered the federal agency since 1991, Kaiser Health News reported.Thus, as the RUC sets reimbursement rates for Medicare, and Medicare is the price baseline for private insurers, it is fair to say a 31-member panel centrally plans medical prices for the entirety of the U.S. health care system, or the rough equivalent of the fourth largest economy in the world.But, sure, blame the free market.

15,CMS,"Amid a somewhat turbulent session for the major indexes Tuesday, many of the stocks making IBD's Utility Leaders screen showed stability.That's not all. At least four names have built sound-looking bases. Here is a brief review of their chart work.Utilities may continue to offer stable cash payouts and the prospects of capital gains so long as the Federal Reserve does not quickly raise interest rates and the prices of natural gas do not spike. The strong jobs market also benefits utilities in terms of attracting new customers and keeping current ones.Eversource Energy (ES), last covered in this column March 22, has arguably built a pair of handles on its nine-month saucer base. The first handle shows a 59.21 buy point, 10 cents above the Feb. 24 intraday high. The second handle shows an intraday peak of 60.36 and began with the reversal March 29. Add a dime to that price and you get an alternative buy point of 60.46.Notice how in both cases, Eversource did not rebound all the way back to the saucer's left-side high of 60.44.Handles that form within 5% to 15% below the left-side peak of a cup or double bottom tend to lead to successful breakouts. Remember, not all breakouts work. When the electric power utility, serving New England, cleared a 59.19 entry in an unusual-looking saucer base June 30, 2016, Eversource rallied for just two weeks, then dropped more than 16% over the next five months. Fortunately, shares did not venture far below the 10-week moving average, and a new saucer base was born.Eversource has a 3.2% annual dividend yield. It paid 47.5 cents a share March 31.Ameren (AEE) (3.2% yield) rallied past a 53.49 entry in a nearly eight month, cup-with-handle base on Feb. 21 this year. Now, shares are testing support at the rising 50-day moving average.Xcel Energy (XEL) (3.2% yield) has formed a nearly nine month, cup-with-handle base. The Minneapolis-based diversified utility has moved steadily after rising past a 44.19 entry on March 15. CMS Energy (CMS) (2.9%) has built a nine-month cup with handle, and a three-week handle offers a 45.65 entry. Again, like in Eversource and Xcel, one can see mildly lower handles within the base that are not too far off the left-side high in the cup itself.The S&P 500's annualized yield is around 1.93%.RELATED:The Income Investor: 4 Reasons Why This Dividend Play Might Soar In 2017The Income Investor: Should You Invest In These 3 Financial Plays?

16,CMS,"In 1960, when John Kennedy was elected president, America's population was 180 million and it had approximately 1.8 million federal bureaucrats (not counting uniformed military personnel and postal workers). Fifty-seven years later, with seven new Cabinet agencies, and myriad new sub-Cabinet agencies (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency), and a slew of matters on the federal policy agenda that were virtually absent in 1960 (health care insurance, primary and secondary school quality, crime, drug abuse, campaign finance, gun control, occupational safety, etc.), and with a population of 324 million, there are only about 2 million federal bureaucrats.So, since 1960, federal spending, adjusted for inflation, has quintupled and federal undertakings have multiplied like dandelions, but the federal civilian workforce has expanded only negligibly, to approximately what it was when Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952. Does this mean that ""big government"" is not really big? And that by doing much more with not many more employees it has accomplished prodigies of per-worker productivity? John J. DiIulio Jr., of the University of Pennsylvania and the Brookings Institution, says: Hardly.In his 2014 book ""Bring Back the Bureaucrats,"" he argued that because the public is, at least philosophically, against ""big government,"" government has prudently become stealthy about how it becomes ever bigger. In a new Brookings paper, he demonstrates that government expands by indirection, using three kinds of ""administrative proxies"" — state and local government, for-profit businesses, and nonprofit organizations.Since 1960, the number of state and local government employees has tripled to more than 18 million, a growth driven by federal money: Between the early 1960s and early 2010s, the inflation-adjusted value of federal grants for the states increased more than 10-fold. For example, the EPA has fewer than 20,000 employees, but 90 percent of EPA programs are completely administered by thousands of state government employees, largely funded by Washington.A quarter of the federal budget is administered by the fewer than 5,000 employees of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) — and by the states, at least half of whose administrative costs are paid by CMS. Various federal crime and homeland security bills help fund local police departments. ""By conservative estimates,"" DiIulio writes, ""there are about 3 million state and local government workers"" — about 50 percent more than the number of federal workers — ""funded via federal grants and contracts.""Then there are for-profit contractors, used, DiIulio says, ""by every federal department, bureau and agency."" For almost a decade, the Defense Department's full-time equivalent of 700,000 to 800,000 civilian workers were supplemented by the full-time equivalent of 620,000 to 770,000 for-profit contract employees. ""During the first Gulf War in 1991,"" DiIulio says, ""American soldiers outnumbered private contractors in the region by about 60-to-1; but, by 2006, there were nearly as many private contractors as soldiers in Iraq — about 100,000 contract employees, not counting subcontractor employees, versus 140,000 troops."" Today, the government spends more (about $350 billion) on defense contractors than on all official federal bureaucrats ($250 billion).Finally, ""employment in the tax-exempt or independent sector more than doubled between 1977 and 2012 to more than 11 million."" Approximately a third of the revenues to nonprofits (e.g., Planned Parenthood) flow in one way or another from government. ""If,"" DiIulio calculates, ""only one-fifth of the 11 million nonprofit sector employees owe their jobs to federal or intergovernmental grant, contract or fee funding, that's 2.2 million workers"" — slightly more than the official federal workforce.To which add the estimated 7.5 million for-profit contractors. Plus the conservative estimate of 3 million federally funded employees of state and local governments. To this total of more than 12 million, add the approximately 2 million actual federal employees. This 14 million is about 10 million more than the estimated 4 million federal employees and contractors during the Eisenhower administration.So, today's government is indeed big (3.5 times bigger than five and a half decades ago), but dispersed to disguise its size. This government is, DiIulio says, ""both debt-financed and proxy-administered."" It spends more just on Medicare benefits than on the official federal civilian workforce, and this is just a fraction of the de facto federal workforce.Many Americans are rhetorically conservative but behaviorally liberal. So, they are given government that is not limited but overleveraged — debt-financed, meaning partially paid for by future generations — and administered by proxies. The government/for-profit contractor/non-profit complex consumes 40 percent of GDP. Just don't upset anyone by calling it ""big government.""RELATED:Is The U.S. Government Insolvent?

17,CMS,"Dialysis providers Fresenius Medical Care, American Renal Associates and DaVita all fell Monday after saying they were subpoenaed in the U.S. over premium-assistance programs that support dialysis patients on private insurance plans that can be more lucrative for providers.The U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts is investigating connections to the American Kidney Fund, which manages a patient-assistance program for the private plans, German-based Fresenius (FMS) said Monday.Beverly, Mass.-based American Renal (ARA) also said its subpoena is in connection with the American Kidney Fund, while DaVita (DVA), headquartered in Denver, said it's been subpoenaed regarding ""charitable premium assistance.""Fresenius fell as much as 7.3%, the most since June 24, and its U.S.-traded shares ended the day down 6.7% to 39.70. The shares had gained 5% in the 12 months before Monday, including reinvested dividends, compared with a 17% increase in the benchmark DAX Index.American Renal's shares plunged as much as 8.5%, the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 21, and traded down 5.4% at the close to 21.80. DaVita finished the regular session down 3.7% to 63.38.Dialysis patients and providers including Fresenius and DaVita have sued to challenge new regulations that tighten rules governing patient aid for private plans, due to take effect Jan. 13.American Renal stands to lose the most profit due to the new restrictions, and Fresenius will be affected the least, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. All three companies said they're cooperating with the investigation.Between 700 and 2,000 Fresenius patients with end-stage renal disease in the U.S. currently use the plans. By subsidizing premiums, which patients would otherwise have to pay themselves, the patient aid steers people into more expensive private coverage, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services argued.Private insurance pays dialysis providers like Fresenius $100,000 to $200,000 more per patient each year than would Medicare and Medicaid, which have worked to reduce costs in recent years, according to CMS.Separately, DaVita on Monday said it signed a six-year supply agreement with Amgen (AMGN) for anemia drugs used to treat dialysis patients. The deal replaces a 2011 pact that was due to expire next year.

18,CMS,"Health Reform: Cost overruns are endemic to government health programs, and ObamaCare is turning out to be no different. Not only are its Medicaid expansion costs exploding, skyrocketing premiums are now pushing insurance subsidy costs through the roof.A new study from the Center for Health and Economy finds that because of the double-digit premium increases across the country, federal spending on ObamaCare's insurance subsidies will shoot up by nearly $10 billion next yearThat's because the amount of the subsidy is directly tied to the cost of insurance in any given market. The Obama administration treats this as a cardinal virtue of ObamaCare, because the subsidies largely shield eligible enrollees from premium rate shocks. In fact, the administration has argued that higher premiums are a good thing, because they make more people eligible for those subsidies.But team Obama conveniently overlooks the fact that the money to pay these subsidies doesn't grow on trees.The Center for Health and Economy finds that, even if enrollment for next year is relatively flat — they predict the number getting subsidies will go from 9.4 million this year to 9.7 million, which given current enrollment trends seems reasonable — ObamaCare's subsidy costs will still climb from $32.8 billion this year to $42.6 billion next year. That's an increase of 30%.In case you're wondering, the Center for Health and Economy is not an Obama-hating right-wing, fake-news outfit. It's a nonpartisan research group founded two years ago by many of the leading health care economists in the nation.President Obama has often bragged that ObamaCare ended up costing less overall than anticipated, but that was only true because half the number of people signed up for insurance than he'd expected. With premiums spiraling out of control, this supposed advantage won't last long.Spiraling subsidies come on top of news that ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion is costing far more than expected per enrollee — 49% more, to be exact. That figure comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that runs ObamaCare.CMS found that those newly eligible for Medicaid under ObamaCare had average medical costs of $6,366, instead of the $4,281 it had expected. Plus, millions more are signing up for Medicaid than predicted.These cost overruns are in keeping with every other government health program, which is why it's imperative that ObamaCare be repealed as soon as possible.The good news is that Trump and the Republican Congress have put repealing ObamaCare at the top of their to-do list.The better news is that, according to Politico, several Senate Democrats — many whom will be in tight re-election rates in 2018 — are now saying that if ObamaCare is repealed, they'll work with Republicans on a replacement plan.This gives Republicans an incredible, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to enact free market reforms that will do what ObamaCare only promised. They better not blow it.RELATED:White House Cheers Skyrocketing ObamaCare PremiumsDid ObamaCare Add 20 Million To The Insurance Rolls?

19,CMS,"Wall Street was bullish Thursday on Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved a special billing code for leukemia drug Bendeka, which it licensed last year from Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA).The decision was a surprise, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in a research report. Previously, Bendeka was lumped in with generic Treanda, also used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia and indolent B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.""Hospitals using Bendeka after the entry of Treanda powder generics in 2019 can continue to be reimbursed for Bendeka at branded pricing,"" Koffler wrote. In 2011-2015, only two out of 18 negative coding decisions by CMS were reversed, she noted.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 18-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group is down more than 25% this year. Medical stocks have been slogged amid the volatile election season. Check out IBD's Industry Themes to see which stocks are hot ... and which are not.Koffler upgraded Eagle stock to a buy rating from neutral and boosted her price target to 78 from 62. RBC analyst Randall Stanicky kept his outperform rating on Eagle stock, and upped his price target to 93 from 80.Eagle expects to book a $40 million opportunity in Q4 before another $25 million opportunity in either Q4 or Q1 following the Bendeka decision, Koffler wrote. The CMS decision will help drive Eagle toward that opportunity, Stanicky wrote in a research report.Bendeka and Treanda pulled in $207 million in sales during Teva's Q2, growing 16% vs. on a year-over-year basis. Bendeka achieved 80% of Treanda's market share during the quarter, though Eagle and Treanda are both eyeing 90%-95% market share, Koffler wrote.""We expect Teva to convert 95% of the market to Bendeka before 2019 but then decline share to 70% in 2020, and all the way down to 58% in 2026,"" Koffler wrote. Eagle no longer has ""take-back"" rights to Bendeka, but its royalty increases to 25% from 20% in January.Importantly, the patent on Treanda will likely protect Bendeka as well, Stanicky wrote. Stanicky and Koffler, alike, see Bendeka persisting through 2026 under Treanda's patent. It will likely still have another five years under remaining patents.On the stock market today, Eagle and Teva stocks split the difference. Eagle stock rose 4.4% to 71.10. Teva stock crashed 9.6% to 39.17, though much of that reflected a report that the Justice Department is probing Teva and other generic drugmakers also possible price collusion.On Wednesday, shares of the two companies rose 19% and a fraction, respectively, after the news was released.RELATED:Generic-Drug Makers Crash On Report DOJ Plans Collusion ChargesTeva Pharma Has Generic 'Tricks,' But Valuation 'A Treat'Mylan Jumps As DOJ Settlement Removes 'Lingering Concerns'Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

20,CMS,"Like the proverbial broken record, the Obama administration is — again — showing its contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law.The administration has had a proclivity for circumventing Congress when President Obama doesn't get his way. This time, taxpayers could be on the hook for a bailout of health insurance companies that have lost money through the ObamaCare exchanges.Recently, the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department  is considering tapping the Treasury Department's Judgment Fund, which is used to pay federal legal claims, to settle with health insurance companies that are suing the administration over financial losses from their participation in ObamaCare.Congress, however, has prohibited any taxpayer-funded bailout of insurers.Settling with plaintiffs out of court is a fairly common tactic for this administration. It is known as ""sue-and-settle.""A plaintiff, often a special-interest group, will sue the federal government and, behind closed doors and away from public scrutiny, the administration will settle, rather than defend itself, and take an action or agree to promulgate regulations at the heart of the lawsuit.Meant to be a transitional component of ObamaCare, the ""risk-corridors"" program redistributes money from profitable health plans to those that run in the red.While there is no statutory requirement that the risk-corridors program be revenue-neutral, as Peter Suderman explained in 2014, ""The thinking when the law was passed was that the program would be revenue neutral; some insurers would pay in, and others would be paid. The payments would even out.""But things didn't work out the way the administration and insurers planned. The risk pools are unbalanced, with too many older and less healthy consumers, those who utilize health care at higher rates, and too few young and healthy people enrolled for coverage.Also, there are fewer people enrolled in government-approved health plans available on the exchanges.The Congressional Budget Office projected that 13 million people would have coverage through the ObamaCare exchanges in 2015.In September 2015, however, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS), an agency inside the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), reported that 9.95 million people obtained coverage through the exchanges.The agency claimed that ""these numbers are consistent with HHS' effectuated enrollment target of 9.1 million for the end of 2015.""Not so much. Before the launch of the 2015 enrollment period, HHS revised downward its enrollment projections for the year by as much as 30%, bringing expected enrollment down from 13 million to between 10 million to 11 million consumers before attrition. HHS claimed a victory after moving the goal posts.More recently, major health insurers have either pulled out of the ObamaCare exchanges or significantly ratcheted down their participation. Notable names include UnitedHealth Group (the largest insurer in the United States) and Aetna, both of which have lost hundreds of millions of dollars because of ObamaCare.What's more, only seven of the 23 ObamaCare cooperatives, which were supposed to serve as Democrats' compromise on the public option, remain in operation.With insurers facing heavy and unsustainable losses from their participation in ObamaCare, Congress acted to protect taxpayers from any bailout of insurers.In the fiscal 2015 hybrid spending bill, the language was included to prohibit CMS from using taxpayer dollars from specific accounts to bailout insurers. The provision was included again in the FY 2016 funding bill.With its plan to use a Treasury Department fund (aka taxpayer dollars) to circumvent the congressional prohibition to settle out of court with insurers, the administration is violating the spirit of the law.Not only does this attempt to bail out insurers show that ObamaCare continues to experience significant problems, highlighting the need for Congress to scrap it and implement real health care reforms that emphasize patient-centered policies and to roll back regulations driving up the costs of health coverage, it also underscores the constitutional struggle between the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.Already, four senators — including Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Ben Sasse, R-Neb. -- have fired off a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, in which they noted that any payment from Treasury's Judgment Fund ""would be illegal.""Moreover, the senators explained, insurers, if successful in the lawsuit, ""would not be able to recover any additional funds, until insurance companies paid additional money into the program or Congress appropriated additional funds.""Unfortunately, the Obama administration has demonstrated time and time again that it has little regard for the constitutional separation of powers or respect for the rule of law.Article I of the Constitution, which puts the power of the purse and lawmaking authority solely in the hands of Congress, is being erased before Americans' eyes.America is at a crossroads. Either Congress reinforces its constitutional role, or America takes a turn down a road to toward the permanent imperial presidency.If Congress refuses to act or continues to play small ball with largely meaningless ""fixes"" for ObamaCare, it will be complicit in the decay of the American experiment.

21,CMS,"Humana (HUM) and Cigna (CI) sank on Wednesday after government data showed that the managed health care providers had a much smaller portion of their members enrolled in higher-quality Medicare plans.The data, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, showed that the percentage of Humana's membership on 4-star or higher plans declined to around 37%, from 78% in the prior year. For Cigna, members enrolled in 4-star or higher plans dropped to 19% from 67%, according to a Wells Fargo research note.The government uses a five-star rating system to evaluate the health-plan offerings. Plans with higher ratings get bonuses, plus bragging rights to tout to Medicare enrollees. The star ratings out today are used for the 2018 plan year.""Weakness in HUM's ratings is a surprise and could hurt HUM's competitive positioning for 2018,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a research note.Humana said that the decline did not account for the company's plans ""to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on Star bonus revenues for 2018."" The company also said the ratings were ""not anticipated to materially impact Medicare membership growth for 2017.""Humana said the decline was likely due to a recent CMS audit that resulted in a civil penalty and downgrades to some Star measures. The company said it expected the impact of the audit on its Star ratings to be limited to the 2018 bonus year.""Humana believes that its Star ratings for the 2018 bonus year do not accurately reflect the company's actual performance under the applicable Star measures,"" the company said. ""Consequently, the company intends to file for reconsideration of certain of those ratings under the appropriate administrative process.""Humana tumbled more than 5% to 168.44 on the stock market today, puncturing the bottom of a flat base begun in August. Cigna fell 2.4% to 121.96.Out of the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, the Medical-Managed Care group was the worst performer.Humana nonetheless reported strong preliminary third-quarter earnings. The company gave preliminary Q3 EPS of $3.15, above forecasts for $2.88. Humana is set to report third-quarter earnings on Nov. 4.Largely on that strong Q3 figure, the health insurer raised its full-year EPS to $9.50, above views for $9.24. In August, Human said it had expected EPS of at least $9.25.IBD'S TAKE: As many large health insurers shrink their Affordable Care Act plan offerings, the law itself could face destruction or a massive overhaul depending on the outcome of next month's election.

22,CMS,"Election 2016: When a questioner at Sunday night's presidential debate asked about ObamaCare's premium spikes, increasing deductibles and increasingly skimpy coverage, Hillary Clinton quickly ran down a list of great things she claims the law achieved.Among the alleged benefits were, she said, letting parents keep their kids on their insurance plans up to age 26 (even though most states had this requirement before ObamaCare) and banning pre-existing condition restrictions for employer coverage (which had already been banned or severely restricted for group plans sold in every state).But at the top of the list was her claim that ""20 million got insurance who didn't have it before."" This went unchallenged by every fact-checker sifting through the debate, even though it's not true.First, consider that the 20 million figure came from March 2016 report issued by the Obama administration itself, which has a huge vested interest in making ObamaCare look like a success.Under normal circumstances, this sort of glaring conflict of interest would prompt reporters to take such a boast with a grain of salt. Instead, they've accepted it as gospel truth.A look at the report itself shows how flimsy this number really is.Rather than use existing, long-term government surveys of the uninsured, Obama officials relied on an ongoing Gallup survey. And then it adjusted the survey results downward, supposedly to account for broader economic trends and the like.Where Gallup's survey found an uninsured rate of 13.1% among those 18-64, the administration's adjustments changed that to 11.5%.As a result, a good chunk of the 20 million number cited by Obama and the press comes from these mysterious data adjustments.Other government reports, meanwhile, show a far smaller decline in the number of uninsured since ObamaCare took effect in 2014.The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports that the number dropped by 8.7 million between 2013 and 2014. The Census Bureau says it declined by 12.8 million from 2013-2015. The Congressional Budget Office figures that the uninsured fell by 17 million in 2015.Most of the gains in coverage, it's worth noting, came from ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion, not from its ban on insurance underwriting or its heavy subsidies. CMS data show that in ObamaCare's first year, Medicaid expansion accounted for 88% of the gains in coverage. Enrollment has climbed by 14 million since ObamaCare took effect.Democrats might view this vast expansion of Medicaid as a success story, but what it means is that millions more people have been dumped into a health program that is plagued with doctor shortages, cost overruns, fraud and abuse. This is more of a tragedy than a success.Even if 20 million people did gain coverage since ObamaCare took effect, much of that increase wasn't due to the law, but to the fact that millions of people have gained employment over the past three years. Since January 2013, the number of private sector jobs climbed by more than 9 million, and the number of government jobs by 310,000.If half of these new workers got health benefits along with a job — which is the overall national average — these gains in employment would account for almost 5 million of the newly insured.We've complained many times in this space that ""fact-checking"" by journalists is often just a way for them to disguise opinion journalism. The fact that none of the fact-checkers reviewing Sunday's debate noticed Clinton's phony 20 million number is a case in point.RELATED:Bill Clinton Tells The Awful Truth About ObamaCareObamaCare After The Election: Clinton And Trump Prepare For SurgeryLeft Admits ObamaCare Is Broken — But Proposed 'Fix' Would Be Even Worse

23,CMS,"Mylan (MYL), taking big heat for the high price of its potentially lifesaving EpiPen injector, late Friday announced it had agreed to a $465 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice about the classification of EpiPen in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.Mylan stock shot up 10% in after-hours trading Friday on the news, though the company also lowered its earnings guidance for the year. The controversy has hurt the stock, which closed Friday at a three-year low.Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch was shredded in a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on Sept. 21 because the price of EpiPen, which treats dangerous allergic reactions, has risen sixfold since 2007, to more than $300 ($600 for a two-pack) for the self-administered product. Mylan became the latest poster child for the huge, ongoing issue of high prices for certain drugs.Soon after criticism mounted, with presidential candidate Hillary Clinton among the critics, Mylan announced it would introduce a generic version at about half the price.Bresch told the panel Mylan's profit per injector came to about $50, but a subsequent Wall Street Journal investigation found the profit was roughly double that, excluding taxes.At the hearing, the panel criticized most everything about Mylan, including the CEO's pay. Bresch's total compensation came to about $19 million last year, but at the hearing she said he compensation was somewhere ""in the middle"" among her peers.""I'm very pro-business, but I am sickened ...,"" Rep. John Duncan, R.-Tenn., said at the hearing. ""The greed is astounding, sickening.""In Friday's announcement, Mylan said the terms of the settlement do not provide for any finding of wrongdoing on the part of Mylan. The release said that ""the question in the underlying matter was whether EpiPen Auto-Injector was properly classified with the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (""CMS"") as a non-innovator drug under the applicable definition in the Medicaid Rebate statute and subject to the formula that is used to calculate rebates to Medicaid for such drugs. EpiPen Auto-Injector has been classified with CMS as a non-innovator drug since before Mylan acquired the product in 2007 based on long-standing written guidance from the federal government.""In addition, Mylan said it now expects adjusted earnings per share of $4.70 to $4.90 for the year, down from its earlier guidance of $4.85 to $5.15. The company said it lowered guidance most as a ""result of the previously announced changes in EpiPen Auto-Injector access programs and the upcoming launch of the generic to EpiPen Auto-Injector.""

24,CMS,"Friday afternoons are the Obama administration's preferred time to release information it doesn't want the public to see. Case in point: On Sept. 9, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) quietly released a memo indicating its intention to bail out the health insurance companies participating in the Affordable Care Act.Congress — and the American people — should pay attention. Such a bailout is one of the administration's top goals between now and Dec. 31. But spending billions of taxpayer dollars would only prop up a failing law that continues to harm the people it was supposed to help.The HHS memo comes after several months of intense lobbying by health insurance companies in the White House and on Capitol Hill. After supporting the law's passage in 2010 — believing the individual mandate would guarantee profits for years to come — insurers' expected windfall has never materialized. Instead, they're reeling from record losses.Health insurers lost $2.7 billion in 2014 and an estimated $3.2 billion in 2015. This year's sum will most likely be even higher. Unsurprisingly, insurers have begun to abandon the law they once supported in droves. Three of the nation's largest insurers — UnitedHealth, Aetna and Humana — have recently pulled out of most state exchanges after posting hundreds of millions in losses. Nationally, at least 40 insurers have made similar moves over the past two benefit years, a number that continues to grow.The success of President Obama's signature law depends on whether he can stop the bleeding. The surest way to convince insurers to stick with the Affordable Care Act is to subsidize their profits using taxpayer dollars.Enter the HHS memo. The memo explores a little-known Affordable Care Act provision known as ""risk corridors,"" a program designed to shuffle money from profitable insurers to unprofitable ones. The law only established risk corridors as a temporary program, lasting through the end of 2016. The Obama administration assumed the law would be stable and flourishing by now.Instead, the law is self-destructing faster and faster. Profitable insurers have been few and far between, limiting the money available via risk corridors. Additionally, Congress required that risk corridors remain budget neutral — meaning taxpayers wouldn't be on the hook. Thanks to the combination of these two factors, insurers have only received 12.6% of the funds they've requested.Now their goal is to secure additional funding however possible, and HHS seems all too willing to oblige. The memo notes that insurers' requests are ""payments due as an obligation of the United States Government for which full payment is required."" The agency is therefore ""explor(ing) other sources of funding."" The two most likely options are convincing Congress to either extend risk corridors for several more years (perhaps permanently) or allocate billions of taxpayer dollars expressly for insurer payouts.Either option would leave taxpayers in the lurch. So would the judicial bailout hinted at by the memo.In recent months, numerous insurers have filed lawsuits in federal court seeking full risk-corridor payments. According to HHS, the Obama administration is ""open to discussing resolution of those claims"" and is ""willing to begin such discussions at any time."" This strongly indicates that the administration is willing to use taxpayer dollars in the Treasury's ""Judgment Fund"" to bail out insurers — a move that is widely seen as illegal.Risk corridors aren't the only opportunity for a taxpayer bailout. Another provision, the so-called ""transitional reinsurance program,"" is the Obama administration's other route.Reinsurance, which like risk corridors was also designed to sunset after three years, levies a tax on all insurance companies. An HHS subsidiary, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), was supposed to collect a total of $20 billion over the past three years to subsidize insurers that take on high-cost individuals. Additionally, another $5 billion was to be collected and earmarked for the U.S. Treasury to help pay for the Affordable Care Act's extraordinary costs.But CMS has spent every cent on insurers — a clear violation of federal law that leaves taxpayers holding the bill for the law's other costs. Rather than remit this money after CMS' actions came to light earlier this year, the Obama administration and health insurers have instead requested that Congress reauthorize reinsurance, too. This would forgive the $5 billion theft and put the taxpayer on the hook for future bailouts in the years ahead.Combined with a reauthorization of risk corridors, taxpayers could be looking at billions of dollars a year in insurer bailouts for the foreseeable future.The White House and health insurance lobbyists are working overtime to make this happen. Congress must oppose reauthorizing either risk corridors or reinsurance — they were designed to be temporary and that's how they should remain. Lawmakers must also include language in any budget bills in December forestalling the administration's judicial and administrative attempts to funnel taxpayer money to insurers.If Congress takes this path, lawmakers will protect the American taxpayer from funding endless bailouts for the health insurance industry. Any other move will only prop up the Affordable Care Act and ensure that it continues to cost — and harm — Americans for years to come.Related:Congress Should Revoke ObamaCare's Hidden Bailouts For InsurersIs Obama Pushing Another Illegal ObamaCare Insurance Bailout?

25,CMS,"Health Care: For decades, liberal Democrats have been advocating a single-payer health care system where government pays all the bills. The public has never supported this idea, but it looks like the country is headed there anyway, slowly but surely.The latest data from the Census Bureau show that just since President Obama took office, the number of Americans getting health care through a government program -- Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, etc. -- shot up by 32 million (an increase of more than 32%).In contrast, the number of people getting coverage from private insurers has gone up 11.6 million (a gain of less than 6%).This is part of a longer trend toward socialized medicine. Between 1980 and 2014, the share of all national health spending paid by federal, state and local governments has gone from 29% to 45%, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which tracks national health spending. In less than decade, the CMS expects that number to climb to 47%.Medicare and Medicaid alone now spend more each year than all private insurance combined. In 2014, Medicare and Medicaid paid for $1.1 trillion in health costs, while private insurance paid $991 billion. People spent a relatively modest $329 billion out of pocket.To Democrats, this is a great success, particularly since the number of uninsured has dropped by nearly 16 million since 2008. But it's more appropriate to describe these trends for what they are -- the gradual takeover of the health care industry by government, a process that ObamaCare accelerated and that Hillary Clinton will turbocharge if elected.ObamaCare vastly expanded Medicaid eligibility. Under the law, states can opt to have Medicaid cover everyone up to 133% of the poverty level, with the federal government picking up all the costs of that expansion in the first few years and the vast bulk of the costs in the years following.So far 31 states have taken the bait, and Medicaid enrollment has jumped in just the past two years.Hillary Clinton wants to add more fuel to the single-payer fire by pushing more states to expand Medicaid, and by starting a so-called public option in state ObamaCare exchanges.The public option would be a government-run insurance plan that competes with private insurance, and it has long been seen by the left as a way to push the country more rapidly toward single payer, on the assumption that private plans wouldn't be able to compete against a government plan that can set prices however it wants.In addition, Clinton intends to let people 55 and older buy into Medicare.

26,CMS,"The residents of Arizona's Pinal County can now claim an unfortunate distinction: They are the first in America to have no health-insurance coverage offered via the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Absent some sudden change, roughly 400,000 people in the county will have no ObamaCare coverage come 2017.But millions more could soon be signing on to a nearly-empty ObamaCare exchange. Earlier this summer, CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt explained, ""the Marketplace is right in the middle of what I will call a 5-year 'learning and experimentation stage.' ""That ""experimentation stage"" sure seems to resemble utter collapse as an estimated 687 counties will have only one choice of health insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges next year — up from 182 this year. As many as 36% of ObamaCare exchange market rating areas may be down to one insurer, and nearly 55% with just two, according to a recent study by Avalere Health.Several entire states, including Alaska, Alabama, South Carolina and Wyoming, may only have one insurer overall. Participation on the exchanges is now lower than it was when the exchanges launched in 2014.This cuts at the heart of one of President Obama's central promises regarding the law: That it would increase competition, which would in turn improve affordability.""It's buying insurance on the private market,"" he reassured Americans five days before the 2013 ObamaCare roll out. "" … (Y)ou've got new choices.  Now you've got new competition because insurers want your business. And that means you will have cheaper prices.""But ObamaCare's top-down, coverage-by-regulation approach has had the opposite effect. Health insurers find it increasingly difficult — if not impossible — to participate in the law and stay in the black. Many have little choice but to pull out.The most recent example is Aetna, the nation's third-largest insurer. On August 15, Aetna announced it would pull out of 11 of the 15 states where it currently offers plans — including Pinal County in Arizona.UnitedHealth announced in April that it plans to flee all but a few of the 34 states where it currently operates on ObamaCare exchanges.As many as 1.5 million Americans will be affected through these two companies' exits alone. But they aren't alone. Humana has also cut back its participation, dropping from 19 states to 11 or fewer. Overall, at least 40 insurers have to abandon the ObamaCare exchange.In every case, these decisions were driven by financial realities of a failing law.Aetna reported losing $430 million since 2014 and expects to lose $300 million this year alone. UnitedHealth has announced the company has lost $1 billion since 2015. Humana has lost a similar amount.Contrary to President Obama's promise of more health care options, Americans have fewer choices than before the law went into effect. By March of this year, already 100 fewer insurers operated in the 50 states and the District of Columbia than before ObamaCare's implementation in 2013, one Heritage Foundation study found.Nor are traditional insurers the only ones finding it difficult to participate in the law. The same can be said of the government-sponsored insurers — known as ""co-ops""-- established under ObamaCare.Originally designed to offer artificially low-cost health insurance and put pressure on private insurers, many of these nonprofit, taxpayer-funded co-ops have collapsed after more than $1.7 billion in federal loans. Sixteen of the original 23 co-ops have already failed, dropping more than 850,000 customers who now have to find alternative plans. The remaining seven are still losing money. It is likely only a matter of time before they, too, crumble.But this isn't just a matter of competition. The insurers that have left the exchanges so far would have had to spike their premiums in order to stay in the market. The insurers that have stayed are having to do the same thing.The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that premiums will rise by double digits in half the cities it surveyed. In Nashville, Tenn., for instance, where UnitedHealth is pulling out, state regulators have approved a 62% premium increase for Blue Cross Blue Shield, the state's largest insurer. Now a silver plan for a healthy 40-year-old could cost $2,000 more each year.Tennesseans won't find much better rates from the other two insurers in the state: Cigna will hike premiums by 46% and Humana will hold the state's record low at a 44% increase.So far, for the seven states that have published approved rates, the average hike clocks in at 21%. Any dollar that someone pays in higher premiums is a dollar that they can no longer use to pay their bills, invest in paying down loans, or save for the future.Then again, some 400,000 Arizonans in Pinal County aren't facing higher premiums for their ObamaCare plans at all — they won't have any such plans to choose from. Millions more may join them in the weeks, months, and years to come.Chalk that up as yet another broken promise that hurts the hardworking Americans it was supposed to help.

28,CMS,"Cigna (CI) tumbled in the stock market today after becoming the latest health insurer to cite high ObamaCare medical costs. Cigna also issued weak guidance as the company is in limbo with its  troubled merger agreement with Anthem (ANTM), an analyst suggests.Cigna's second-quarter earnings per share fell 22% to $1.98, badly missing views for $2.39. Revenue rose 4% to $9.893 billion, short of expectations for $9.974 billion. The company said its Group Disability and Life Insurance segments weighed on results.The company's medical care ratio, or its expenses as a percentage of money taken in from premiums, rose to 81.7% from 80.2% a year earlier. That reflected higher-than-expected costs from patients via the ObamaCare exchanges.Anthem itself cited high ObamaCare costs in its Q2 earnings report. Centene (CNC), which has been aggressively expanding in the exchanges, reported some hefty ObamaCare losses in its recently acquired Health Net. Humana (HUM) recently announced that it would exit most ObamaCare markets, following a similar decision by UnitedHealth (UNH), due to exchange losses.Insurers' loses and exits are likely to push premiums significantly higher in 2017.Cigna stock closed down 5.2% to 128.96, gapping down below its 200-day and 50-day lines. Shares of Anthem fell 1.2%, Humana rose 0.2%, and Aetna (AET) dipped 0.5%. Centene rallied 0.8% and UnitedHealth added 0.3%.""Cigna's quarter was disappointing, and with the ANTM combination threatened by the government's attempts to block it, we expect the shares to suffer,"" Wells Fargo analyst Peter Costa said in a report. ""We wonder how much of the pressure is a result of focus on the merger, since some of the pressure seems to be related to non-core items.""Cigna's results come after the Justice Department last week sued to block Anthem's takeover of Cigna, as well as the combination of Aetna and Humana.The mergers, the government argued in a statement, ""would increase concentration and harm competition across the country, reducing from five to three the number of large, national health insurers in the nation."" Health insurers have been looking to consolidate to shore up against regulations from the Affordable Care Act.IBD'S TAKE: Like Cigna, Medicaid-focused health insurer Centene also took a hit in the stock market this week. Share prices of industry players have had a wild month due to DOJ action on mergers and struggles in the Affordable Care Act. See how the industry is performing in IBD's Stock Checkup.Cigna also said continued higher costs in its Individual Health business  -- ObamaCare exchange-compliant plans -- would cut into its full-year EPS outlook. The company slashed its 2016 earnings per share guidance to $7.75-$8.10 from an earlier forecast of $8.95-$9.35, far below the $9.29 analysts had expected.Other insurers have also struggled with their individual businesses this quarter, Costa noted.Higher costs due to Cigna's response to a recent audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also weighed on the second quarter and the company's full-year outlook. CMS in January suspended Cigna from enrolling new customers to some Medicare plans due to what the agency called ""systemic failures"" in providing services to patients.

Walgreens halted using Theranos lab testing services at its Palo Alto, Calif., location in January amid growing allegations that Theranos' claims did not hold up.“In light of the voiding of a number of test results, and as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has rejected Theranos’ plan of correction and considers sanctions, we have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers’ best interests to terminate our partnership,” said Brad Fluegel, Walgreens Senior Vice President and Chief Health Care Commercial Market Development Officer.Walgreens stock climbed 2.3% to 84.36 by the closing bell on the stock market today.Multiple regulatory and health agencies are investigating Theranos over the accuracy of its blood tests.

31,CMS,"Right when you think Washington can’t get any worse, it does.That much was evident at a recent U.S. House of Representatives committee hearing into the Obama administration’s bailout of private health insurance companies. It’s a textbook case of government officials ignoring federal law to put special interests before the interests of American taxpayers and families.Here’s the back story. The Affordable Care Act includes what’s called a “transitional reinsurance program” to subsidize health insurers that sell policies on the law’s state and federal exchanges. All U.S. health insurance companies -- including those both on and off the exchanges -- pay into the program, with the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) responsible for collecting and distributing the funds.Importantly, the law also requires that a portion of those funds “shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used” to pay insurance companies. For 2014 and 2015, the law required that $2 billion from the reinsurance program to be deposited directly into the Treasury, with another $1 billion in 2016.Simple, right? But there’s a problem.Thanks to the Affordable Care Act’s labyrinthine mandates, health insurance companies have collectively lost billions of dollars on the exchanges, leading to an increasing number of them limiting their participation in or exiting the exchanges altogether. As a result, many insurers have demanded larger subsidy payments.The situation became especially dire last November, when UnitedHealthcare -- the nation’s largest health insurer -- warned that it might pull out of the exchanges beginning in 2017. Three of the country’s other largest insurers -- Aetna, Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield -- have voiced similar concerns over the viability of selling plans on the exchanges beyond this year. And just last month, UnitedHealthcare announced that it would in fact leave the exchanges in all but a “handful” of states next year, jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of health plans.That’s a startling prospect -- and right in the middle of a presidential election year, no less. Critics of the Affordable Care Act have said from the outset that it would eventually fail under its own weight. These exchange departures are but the latest evidence of that happening.To stem a further exodus -- and responding to insurance industry demands -- in November the Obama administration promised to “explore other sources of funding” for payments to insurers. Yet rather than work with Congress, the administration flouted the law entirely -- and in this case, that means using tax dollars to bail out insurers left on the exchanges.CMS simply decided to ignore the law’s requirement to pay the Treasury $5 billion over 2014, 2015 and 2016. In fact, according to a February report from CMS, the agency has flat out refused to make any payments for 2014, and has yet to pay the Treasury a dime for 2015. Officials are instead hoarding those dollars in case larger subsidy payments are necessary to keep more insurers on the exchanges.In other words, the Obama administration is prioritizing private health insurance companies over taxpayers. Such lawlessness is exactly why people are so fed up with Washington today -- special interests get ahead, while American families get the bill.Meanwhile, Americans rightly wonder who’s looking out for them. Premiums have actually risen faster in the five years after passage of the Affordable Care Act than in the five years before, while deductibles average nearly $3,000 for the most popular exchange plans. That’s not an option for those already living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to make ends meet.The solution to these bailouts is remarkably simple: Stop doing it. The Obama administration should follow the letter of the Affordable Care Act and immediately deposit the $4 billion owed for 2014 and 2015 into the Treasury, while making plans for an additional $1 billion this year. Rarely in Washington does it get any easier than that.

32,CMS,"""Aging in place"" is the mantra of Baby Boomers hoping to live out their senior years at home, and Amedisys (AMED) is looking to play a role in realizing that.A home health care provider, Amedisys offers home nursing and rehab, life assistance and hospice services. And it’s growing organically and via acquisitions, while boosting its quality-of-care ratings. These ratings, put into place by Medicare last year, will have a dramatic impact on the health care services market in the next few years, according to Amedisys and market analysts.""We think health care is really changing; home health is a lower-cost care option,"" Brian Tanquilut, analyst with Jefferies LLC, told Investor's Business Daily. ""We’re very bullish on Amedisys; It’s the biggest in the space of the pure-play, publicly traded home health care companies.""He’s rated Amedisys a buy.""Home health care will be an ultimate winner"" of the move to aging in place, Frank Morgan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, told IBD.Bigger players can invest in the computer systems and overall size to gain efficiency and improve performance. Paul Kusserow, Amedisys’ chief executive, spoke with IBD and says home health care is a ""highly fragmented market and it will continue to consolidate.""The company has already closed two acquisitions this year -- Associated Home Care for $28 million and Infinity HomeCare for $63 million.""We have a phenomenal balance sheet,"" Kusserow said. ""We’ve been paying largely cash for our acquisitions.""He says the company is in dialogues with ""20 to 30"" companies for possible acquisitions.""They have a lot of firepower to do deals,"" said Tanquilut. ""Bigger providers have the ability to scale, to train and to invest in (information technology).""""Star ratings and Medicare reimbursement dollars are being tied to outcomes and that favors the bigger, more sophisticated players,"" David MacDonald, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey, told IBD. He rates Amedisys a buy.Two other companies specialize in home healthcare, LHC Group (LHCG) and Almost Family (AFAM). Large health care companies also have moved into the home health care space as well, including Kindred Healthcare (KND) and HealthSouth (HLS), which both acquired companies in the space.Morgan said: ""There’s a huge consolidation opportunity, as increasing regulatory and quality requirements will cause mom-and-pop companies to exit the business.""He has a market perform rating on Amedisys.Amedisys also is focused on gaining efficiencies through the adoption of a new patient care information technology system, called HomeCare Homebase. The software company of the same name is part of Hearst Corp.’s health network.""We’re all in on this"" tech project, said Kusserow, saying the whole company will be on it by the end of October.""We’re going to do it in a little over a year,"" even though the company initially predicted it would take two years, he said.""We think we’ll be able to deliver $40 million to $50 million in savings with this system -- we’ve said this to Wall Street,""  he said. Kusserow added that Amedisys has been running its business on three different software systems, which he says is ""very inefficient.""Tanquilut is convinced: ""The new (tech) system will improve quality.""The company sees more than 35,000 patients a day. Kusserow says the new cloud computing software, which stores records remotely, will allow care providers to use tablets instead of expensive laptops. And he says it enables ""better documentation, better reporting, and better, more-efficient staffing."" He says it’s also tightly coupled with billing and will improve the accounts receivable process.That’s a plus, but Amedisys already is producing some enviable numbers. Its net income for its fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31, 2015, was $13.1 million, up 41% from $9.3 million in the year-ago period. Diluted earnings rose 36% to 38 cents per share from 28 cents in 2014’s fourth quarter.Total service revenue for the fourth quarter grew roughly 13% to $338.4 million versus $300.5 million in the year-ago period. For the full year, total revenue grew 6.7% to $1.28 billion from $1.20 billion in 2014.Zack’s puts Amedisys’ first-quarter 2016 earnings at 34 cents a share and full-year 2016 earnings at $1.75 per share.Amedisys traded at around 13 back in June 2014, but closed above 30 by March 2015 and rose above 48 by August 2015. Amedisys hit a new intraday 52-week high of 49.50 on Monday.And margins for high-quality providers should improve with the government’s move to ratings and pay-for-performance.""In 2018, CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) will begin determining percentage bonuses and billing cuts for home health in nine states, based on a number of metrics,"" said Tanquilut. ""Providers in the top bucket in these states will get a bonus of plus 3% on their billing starting in 2018 -- minus 3% for those with the worst performance -- and by 2022 it goes to plus/minus 8%. So quality will matter.""Kusserow said: ""By moving to quality it creates differentiation. So we’re behind this change.""CMS is also rating providers now, and Amedisys’ initial score from the government in 2015 was 3.49 out of 5 possible stars. But Kusserow says 30% of its centers achieved 4.0-plus stars.""Our objective is by 2017 all our care centers will be at 4.0 and above,"" he said.That means making sure all of its roughly 14,000 employees are focused on providing high-quality care. Shortly after Kusserow joined Amedisys at the end of 2014, he brought over Larry Pernosky, a human resources executive from Humana (HUM), where Kusserow had been a senior executive.One of Pernosky’s missions has been to drive down turnover rates. Amedisys’ rate dropped to 29.3% in 2015 from 32.2% in 2014.""We hope to get to 25% by the end of 2016 and below 20% by the end of 2017,"" said Kusserow.Additionally, Amedisys tracks its own metric for patient care ""with engagement scores.""Even Kusserow’s pay package is partially determined by turnover rates and engagement scores.""We take this very seriously and everyone is incentivized around quality,"" he said.

34,CMS,"Drug stocks fell Wednesday as Wall Street sorted through the impact of proposed changes to Medicare Part B reimbursement designed to drive down the prices of some expensive hospital drugs.Late Tuesday, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed a pilot program testing a new reimbursement scheme for Medicare Part B, which covers drugs administered in hospitals or doctors' offices. Currently, CMS will pay back the price of the drug plus 6% for the health care provider, which critics say encourages doctors to prescribe more expensive drugs. Under the proposed rule, doctors would get just a 2.5% premium plus a flat fee of $16.80 per drug per day, which would somewhat reduce the disparity between different-priced drugs.CMS also proposed reducing or eliminating the portion that the patient has to pay for the drug, and tying the reimbursement level to the effectiveness of a drug for a given indication. Thus, if the same drug works well for one condition but only so-so for another, CMS would reimburse it at different levels for each condition.The agency also wants to create online ""decision support tools"" to help physicians determine the most effective drug to use in a given situation. Another test would let CMS enter voluntary risk-sharing agreements with drug makers linking price adjustments with patient outcomes.There will be a comment period on the CMS proposal until May 9. At that point, CMS plans to place providers into two different groups, one using the old reimbursement method and one the new one, and study the differences between the groups over the course of five years. It plans to start testing its other ideas starting January 2017.The reimbursement proposal drew the most attention from Wall Street. The covered drugs would be mostly infused or injected treatments for serious conditions, as opposed to pills that the patient can take on her or his own, and so, potentially affects some of the drug industry's biggest cash cows.""For the big biotechs, the most notable drugs that would fall under this theoretical test would be drugs that include Amgen (AMGN) (U.S. Neupogen, Neulasta ... also Kyprolis, Xgeva/Prolia, Vectibix, about 35%+ of total sales), Celgene (CELG) (U.S. Abraxane is 6% of revenue -- the other notable drugs are orals),"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan agreed about Amgen, adding that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Biogen (BIIB) also depend on drugs under the Medicare Part B umbrella.The new immunotherapy drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck (MRK), such as Opdivo, Keytruda and Yervoy, also are covered by Part B, but Yee argued that they aren't chosen for price reasons.""Consensus understands these drugs are chosen for high efficacy or where there aren't equivalent drugs that aren't also infused, not because of the 6% reimbursement,"" Yee wrote.Amgen stock hit a five-month low and ended the day down 2.6%, at 140.90. Regeneron tumbled 5.1% to 374.75. Celgene fell 1.1% and Biogen was off 2.2%. Bristol-Myers stock fell 1.1%, while Merck slipped a fraction.

""CMS and IRS have not been able to provide error rates for 2014,"" PBN reported.What century is this?After I reported on my own bizarro 1095-A nightmare last year and revisited the ObamaCare tax-time troubles last week in Conservative Review, I gathered yet more horror stories.

""Then 45 days later, we received a corrected 1095. However, it was not corrected.

37,CMS,"A stinging audit of ObamaCare released on Wednesday finds that the agency in charge of the health care program could have paid out more than $2 billion in subsidies in 2014 that it shouldn't have.The  Government Accountability Office report found that hundreds of thousands of applications contained unresolved ""inconsistencies"" -- meaning the information provided by applicants about their income, Social Security numbers, citizenship status, or whether they were in jail or not, didn't match existing government records. As a result, the GAO warned, the government is ""at risk of granting eligibility to, and making subsidy payments on behalf of, individuals who are ineligible to enroll in qualified health plans."" In addition, the audit found that the ""data hub"" created by ObamaCare to instantly verify eligibility and subsidy amounts has not worked nearly as well as advertised.In the run-up to the launch of ObamaCare, the administration created a ""data hub"" that was supposed to connect the ObamaCare exchanges to Social Security, IRS and Homeland Security and other government databases.The administration claimed that this data hub would let the government instantly check whether information provided by enrollees was accurate, so it could avoid making improper payments.But the GAO report says that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which runs ObamaCare, doesn't track whether those agencies even respond to requests for matching enrollee data, nor does it track when the agencies say the data aren't available.As a result, it says, the CMS doesn't have ""an effective process for resolving inconsistencies for individual applicants"" that could determine whether they're eligible for an ObamaCare plan and what their subsidies should be.The GAO found that 431,000 applicants from 2014 had inconsistencies in their application files involving income and citizenship status that still hadn't been resolved as of April 2015. In addition, CMS hadn't resolved problems with Social Security numbers for 35,000 applicants, and ""incarceration inconsistencies"" on 22,000 more.The total amount of subsidies paid out for these enrollees was just over $2 billion. That doesn't mean that all, or even most, of that money was necessarily paid out improperly. But what does mean is that the CMS can't guarantee whether almost 10% of the $21 billion in subsidies paid out in 2014 was legitimate or not.To top it all off, the GAO audit found that, despite its obvious vulnerabilities to fraud highlighted in this and other audits, CMS has yet to undertake a fraud risk assessment.Given the size of ObamaCare's subsidies, which will total about $1 trillion over the next decade, the lack of such controls means that the risk of ObamaCare waste and fraud is enormous.

38,CMS,"Election '16: At a rally in New Hampshire over the weekend, Donald Trump spent a good deal of time complaining about how much the government spends on drugs. Too bad his math, and his facts, were all wrong.Trump said that the government is ""the largest purchaser of drugs in the world, and yet we buy for practically the same price as if you go to the local drug store and take something off the counter.""""For some reason,"" he said, ""we're not allowed to negotiate drug prices. Can you believe it? So we buy drugs and we pay about $300 billion dollars more than we're supposed to, if we negotiated the price.""So there's $300 billion (in waste) on day one,"" he said.There's just one problem with Trump's promise: The government spends -- in total -- only a little more than $100 billion a year on prescription drugs. That's according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which tracks national health spending.In fact, the entire nation spent less than $300 billion on prescription drugs in 2013, the last year for which the CMS has data. Overall spending on prescription drugs that year was $271 billion.Trump might have been talking about saving $300 billion over a decade, but even that would be nearly impossible to achieve, for the simple reason that the drugs the government pays for are, in fact, already heavily discounted.Medicaid requires any drug company that wants to participate in that program to rebate a significant portion of the drugs' costs to the government. In 2013 alone, they paid $18.6 billion in Medicaid rebates. The VA also dictates the prices that it will pay for the drugs it provides vets who use VA health services.That leaves Medicare. It spends about $100 billion a year on drugs, after President Bush introduced the drug benefit in Medicare in 2006.It is true that, by design, the Medicare Part D program blocks the federal government from negotiating directly with drugmakers. Instead, it relies on something you'd think Trump would appreciate -- market competition -- to provide the benefit at low costs to taxpayers.Since consumers have a wide range of choices of private drug benefit plans through Part D, insurers have to compete on price and quality. So they, in turn, negotiate discounts with the drug companies.According to the Medicare trustees' report, these private plans negotiate ""substantial rebates"" that are often in the range of 20%-30%. And the Congressional Budget Office has found that the deals struck between private insurer and drug companies ""approach the lowest prices obtained in the private sector.” The CBO concluded that letting the government negotiate prices would provide negligible savings.What’s more, Part D’s reliance on market competition has kept both taxpayer costs and premiums well below projections, and the expanded access to drugs has saved Medicare money by keeping seniors healthier. Trump's plan would destroy this highly successful program.Phony numbers aside, what’s most troubling is that Trump’s proposal is word for word out the Democrats’ playbook.Bernie Sanders, like Trump, says he wants to ""require Medicare to use its bargaining power to negotiate with the prescription drug companies for better prices -- a practice that is currently banned by law.""What Sanders means, however, is price controls on drugs, since he knows that the government doesn't negotiate prices, it dictates them.We are hard pressed to think of a previous GOP presidential candidate -- much less the front-runner in what is supposed to be a conservative party -- who has openly advocated price controls on a major industry.  We live in interesting times.

39,CMS,"Health care information technology is growing fitfully -- hurt and helped by government policies. Still, HCIT software makers Cerner (CERN), Allscripts (MDRX), Athenahealth (ATHN) and Quality Systems (QSII) are expected to see their combined revenue rise more than 12% this year to $8.14 billion, and 11%, to $9 billion, next year, Wall Street analysts estimate.That's an achievement, since the biggest spenders -- hospitals -- are expected to increase their IT budgets by only 8% in 2016, up from 6%-7% in 2015, says analyst Matthew Gillmor with investment banker Robert W. Baird.That 8% increase will be shared with other companies that compete in HCIT, including IBM's (IBM) Watson Health, an analytics provider launched last year that is expected to ramp up to 2,000 employees. Another rival is Verona, Wis.-based, privately held Epic Systems, which employs some 8,500 workers and reportedly generated $1.7 billion in sales in 2014.The workforce for Kansas City, Mo.-based Cerner, the largest of the HCIT software pure plays, reached 22,000 employees last year after the company acquired Siemens Health Services for $1.3 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cerner's revenue to rise 13% in 2016, to $5.01 billion.HCIT growth faces a unique struggle, heavily influenced by policymakers in Washington, D.C., determined to expand and improve care while keeping a lid on patient costs. While federal rules have stimulated HCIT growth, they're also challenging hospitals' ability to keep up, compromising doctors and nurses' ability and time to provide care, some observers say.The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which includes the Health Information Technology (HITECH) Act, established the Electronic Health Records Incentive Programs that reward and punish hospitals and doctors’ practices for the pace of their EHR transition. Then the Affordable Care Act of 2010, better known as ObamaCare, and most recently the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which became law in April, also hasten higher HCIT standards.In between the lawmaking, rule writers continue to draft implementation language that the federal director of HCIT standards in October called an ""IT bonanza.""This is good for the software vendors as they race to refine and sell Population Health software. PopHealth records expenses, tracks patient care and outcomes, incorporates patients’ evaluations of their care, parses data from similar patient populations, encourages communication between caregivers, and collects performance metrics throughout a hospital -- all intended to improve patient care while giving regulators tools to measure compliance.Cerner calls its PopHealth platform HealtheIntent and says it's used ""to address the growing demand, payer pressures and policy mandates organizations face today.""Those policy mandates are driving some doctors, nurses and hospital IT executives up the wall -- and some are pushing back.At this month's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where Cerner was among presenters, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees HCIT, tweeted: ""In 2016, MU as it has existed – with MACRA – will now be effectively over and replaced with something better.""In other words, the rules are changing again, maybe.MU is meaningful use, a protocol that has guided health care IT spending and systems development, and which the director of HCIT standards, Steven Posnack, has been implementing with a certification process under the auspices of MACRA. (At 39,010 words, MACRA is 10% the length of ObamaCare, which most consider complex.)In November, Dr. John Halamka went public with the case for changing or eliminating MU.""I’m likely going to violate many rules with this post,"" he prefaced in a blog post. He's chief information officer of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the 631-bed teaching hospital for Harvard Medical School. Halamka wrote in a post titled ""The Path Forward for Meaningful Use"" that MU had outlived its usefulness and is doing damage.""Stage 1 created a foundation of functionality for everyone,"" Halamka wrote. ""That was good.""Stage 2 tried to change too much too fast and required an ecosystem of applications and infrastructure that did not exist. ... Stage 3 makes many of the same mistakes as Stage 2, trying to do too much too soon. ...""Clinicians cannot get through a 12-minute visit, enter the necessary Stage 3 data elements, reconcile problems/allergies/medications from multiple institutions, meet the demands of the Stage 3 clinical quality measures, make eye contact with patients and deliver safe medical care. There needs to be a new approach.”As a veteran medical-surgical registered nurse at a big California hospital told IBD: ""We’re set up to fail.""This uncertainty helps explain why HCIT spending is growing slowly as hospital administrators hesitate to invest in systems requiring, as Halamka put it, ""infrastructure that did not exist"" under a ""meaningful use"" protocol of questionable viability for a MACRA law just 9 months old, with pending regulations yet to come.Two days after Slavitt's declaration to do away with MU under MACRA, his office issued its regular newsletter, ""What's Happening in Health IT,"" highlighting news of the ""Adopted 2015 Edition Criteria for Testing and Certification Under the Health IT Certification Program"" and ""In Preparation for Testing, ONC Publishes Certification Companion Guides,"" among other HCIT must-reads.""HCIT spending is still in the process of resetting post the MU bonanza, but the overall environment remains healthy,"" said Baird analyst Gillmor in a research note issued Jan. 8.He says the electronic health records replacement ""opportunity remains elusive,"" even though many hospitals need to get moving on their EHR efforts.Chicago-based HIMSS Analytics says only 4% of U.S. hospitals had achieved the most advanced Stage 7 of EMR proficiency as of Q3 2015, with 25% in Stage 6 and the remainder at the lower levels.""Replacement activity has been slow, and we expect this will continue in 2016,"" said Gillmor. ""CERN and Epic will continue to win the lion's share of replacements.""

72,CMS,"Health Reform: ObamaCare was supposed to bend the cost curve down. But the latest national health spending data show that it's doing the opposite. Not only is spending way up, so are overhead costs.President Obama has repeatedly credited the dramatic slowdown in health spending as proof positive that ObamaCare was ""bending the cost curve"" down in health care. He conveniently ignored the fact that the slowdown started long before he took office.And now that the law has actually taken effect, spending has shot up.That's what the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows in its annual report on national health spending. For more than a decade, annual spending growth was on a steady downward trend, going from 9.6% in 2002 to just 2.9% in 2013.Then came ObamaCare. In 2014, national spending climbed 5.3%. A separate CMS report says that it will stay at this elevated level for decades.More troubling is where these spending hikes are coming from.The administration wants to blame the high prices for drugs — such as Sovaldi, which can cure hepatitis C — for the increase. It's true that drug spending shot up 12% last year. But even with that increase, spending on drugs still accounted for 9.8% of the nation's total health bill. That's a smaller share than throughout the 2000s and the same as it was in 1960.What's really driving health spending has been the huge increase in Medicaid — which climbed 18% — and other government programs. The government's share of national health spending went from 41% before Obama took office to 45% today, and climbing.The data also show that while ObamaCare was supposed to make the health care system more efficient, it's done the opposite. In fact, per-capita overhead costs climbed 11% last year.Translated into dollars, overhead spending jumped $25 billion in 2014, which is nearly as big an increase as prescription drugs (which climbed $32 billion last year). It goes without saying that unlike pharmaceuticals, paperwork doesn't save lives.Obama officials say that all this spending is justified because millions gained coverage under ObamaCare.""It is neither a surprise nor a cause for concern to see aggregate health care spending temporarily grow more quickly while coverage is transitioning to its new, higher level,"" White House economist Jason Furman wrote in a blog post.The truth is, however, that the uninsured rate in 2014 — 11.2%, according to the CMS — is precisely where it was in 1987, as the economy was booming under President Reagan. Given ObamaCare's enormous costs, the recent expansion in coverage is hardly much to brag about.What's more, almost all the gains in coverage came from Medicaid, not the ObamaCare exchanges, the CMS data show.According to CMS, the number of uninsured dropped by 8.7 million in 2014. But total private coverage climbed only 2.2 million. (Employer coverage dropped by 1.7 million, more than three times what the Congressional Budget Office forecast for that year.) Medicaid enrollment climbed 7.7 million.Plus, as we pointed out in this space yesterday, these gains haven't translated into more affordable health care. A Gallup survey found that the share who say that they or their family have put off care because of costs is unchanged from before ObamaCare went into effect, and significantly higher than it was in the late 1990s.How many failures will ObamaCare have to rack up before it can finally be repealed?

"
83,CMS,"Does any of this look like signs of ""runaway"" costs?

The CMS projects that on per-capita basis, out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs will climb an average of just 3% a year over the next decade.CMS also expects that overall spending on drugs as a share of the nation's total health care bill will remain around 10% for the next decade, close to where it's been for the past 15 years.Does any of this look like signs of ""runaway"" costs?What has happened in recent years, however, is that insurance has picked up a greater share of drug costs, as employers and the federal government expanded their drug benefit programs.In 2000, insurance paid for 72% of prescription drug costs. By 2013, that share climbed to 82%. The CMS expects it to be 87% by 2024.In other words, the rise in third-party payments has shielded consumers almost entirely from increases in drug costs. As any economist will tell you, that has the effect of making consumers largely indifferent to the cost of treatment, which in turn lets drugmakers price their product higher than they otherwise would.If Clinton is really serious about bringing drug costs down, she'd want to reverse this trend — not accelerate it.Exposing patients to more of the direct cost of their drugs would most likely be a faster and more effective way to put pressure on drug companies to hold the line on prices than would any pile of federal mandates and regulations.Follow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.

90,CMS,"Health Care: This week, Hillary Clinton has dusted off one of the Democrats' favorite health care bogeymen — Big Pharma. But there's no data to support her claims that drug spending is out of control.On Monday morning, Clinton tweeted that ""price gouging ... in the specialty drug market is outrageous"" and that she will ""lay out a plan to take it on.""Biotech stocks tumbled after that message, but this is hardly fresh turf for Clinton — or her party. In fact, she complained about the same thing in 1993 during her doomed effort to make HillaryCare the law of the land.The latest complaint focuses on the price of breakthrough drugs like Sovaldi, a cure for hepatitis C. Whatever Clinton's justification, her plan will amount to price controls on the pharmaceutical industry.Let's forget for now about the long sorry history of price controls. And the fact that drug companies use profits from ""outrageously priced"" new drugs to finance the $2.6 billion it takes to bring the next one to market. Forget, too, that the industry is on the cusp of one of the most innovative periods in medical history, with thousands of breakthrough treatments and cures in the works.Even if none of that were true, there'd still be no justification for price controls on drugs, for the simple reason that drug spending is not out of control.How do we know that? Well, prescription drugs accounted for just 9.3% of total health spending in 2013 — the last year for which official government data are available. That's the lowest it's been in 15 years.And, even more surprising, the 2013 share is lower than it was in 1960, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.Yes, it is up from 1980s. But think about it. Drugs have never been more central to how we manage and treat diseases than today. And yet they account for less than one of every 10 dollars spent on health care. What's more, the CMS projects that drug spending will stay at about 10% of U.S. health spending for the next decade.Polls do show that the public complains of drug costs. But the truth is that real out-of-pocket spending on drugs was little changed between 1990 and 2013 — it went from $41 billion to $46 billion over those years. And the share of drug costs paid out of pocket has steadily fallen.Is any of this a sign of ""out of control"" costs or rampant price gouging that would justify anything in Clinton's grab bag of federal price controls?

111,CMS,"Integrity: An undercover operation shows how ridiculously easy it is to defraud ObamaCare. Even after officials learned investigators had set up several bogus accounts in June of last year, they failed to catch any of them.The Government Accountability Office report reads like something out of the Onion — that comical fake news site. Except this isn't funny.A dozen undercover auditors tried to enroll in ObamaCare using fake Social Security numbers, phony IDs and bogus citizenship papers.The auditors should have been an easy catch, since ObamaCare had promised to build a ""data hub"" that would instantly check such information against records at the IRS, INS, Social Security and Homeland Security.Instead, 11 of the 12 got their coverage, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in improper subsidies.This tragic comedy of errors went on for 16 months. For example, when the Healthcare.gov exchange later asked the undercover ""enrollees"" to submit supporting documents, they replied with counterfeits, if they replied at all. Yet none of them lost their coverage.In one case, the investigator sent zero documents in response to that request, then called the exchange to ask about his status and was told, ""Your application status is complete.""The GAO even made its undercover operation public in June 2014 and ""shared details of our work with CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency in charge of ObamaCare) during the course of our testing.""Yet for the next 10 months, not one of these bogus enrollees was caught. In fact, the ObamaCare exchange automatically re-enrolled all 11 of them this year and in several cases boosted their subsidy payments.After the initial report came out, CMS claimed, ""The marketplace has several layers of safeguards in place to verify consumer data, including requiring consumers to submit accurate information to qualify for health coverage,"" and promised, ""We are examining this report carefully and will work with GAO to identify additional strategies to strengthen our verification processes.""That promise was a farce.CMS admits that its contractors aren't required to detect fraud and aren't equipped to do so. Plus, it turns out that some time last year, CMS ""waived certain document filings requirements.""So if applicants sent anything in, even if it wasn't what they'd been asked for, ""it would be deemed sufficient,"" and they could keep their ObamaCare plans, according to the GAO. The auditors suspect that at least a few of the fake enrollees maintained their coverage because of this lowered standard.CMS also admitted that it's trying to balance the ""efficiency"" of the enrollment process with ""program integrity."" But the GAO investigation makes it clear that the Obama administration could hardly care less about program integrity, since cleaning up ObamaCare rolls would result only in cutting down the all-important enrollment numbers.Incredibly, CMS claimed that there has been ""no indication of a meaningful level of fraud.""Well, when you're actively not looking for it, you aren't likely to find it.CMS also told the auditors that there's little reason for anyone to defraud ObamaCare, since the subsidy checks go to the insurers, not the enrollees. This claim overlooks the obvious fact that someone enrolling under false pretenses — say, an illegal alien — can get heavily subsidized health insurance.These subsidies, mind you, are supposed to cost $28 billion this year alone, and top $100 billion a year within a decade. At that scale, even if only a small share of ObamaCare enrollees aren't U.S. citizens or aren't eligible for some other reason, the taxpayer hit will be enormous.The public already hates ObamaCare. When it learns that the Obama administration has practically put the welcome mat out for fraud, the Democrats' health care overhaul is going to be even less popular.

142,CMS,"When the FDA last month approved the first biosimilar drug, the U.S. took its first step into a lucrative but potentially disruptive field of medicine.Pfizer (PFE), which is moving big into biosimilars with its $17 billion Hospira (HSP) acquisition, has estimated that global biosimilar sales could hit $17 billion to $20 billion per year by 2020. Sales are just $1 billion yearly now, mainly in the European Union.With the March 5 approval of Zarxio, Novartis' (NVS) biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) aging blockbuster Neupogen, the U.S. market cracked open.""As the FDA becomes more comfortable ... we're going to see biosimilars get through a lot more easily,"" predicted Jitendra Malik, an attorney with Alston & Bird who specializes in intellectual-property and drug-approval issues. ""The first one's always the hardest to get through, because the FDA is more cautious — it's uncharted territory.""For years, the biotech revolution not only brought life-saving new medicines, but also profit-saving protections against competitors. While traditional pharmaceuticals can be assembled by machines from different chemical ingredients, biologic drugs are formed by biological processes, like a high-tech version of fermentation. Many of these processes are trade secrets that, unlike patents, have no expiration date.Reverse EngineeringAs more companies became familiar with biotech manufacturing, however, they were able to reverse-engineer the process to create biosimilar drugs — not identical to the originals, but close enough. Novartis' Sandoz unit, historically devoted to traditional generic drugs, has been a pioneer in the field, already selling biosimilar versions of Neupogen and its sister drug Epogen in Europe.Many others are lined up at the U.S. border with their own products. Hospira and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) have launched their own versions of Neupogen in Europe. Some companies are working on biosimilar versions of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster immunology drug Humira, including Sandoz, Hospira, Pfizer (prior to acquiring Hospira), Amgen and German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim.When AbbVie announced its richly priced acquisition of Pharmacyclics (PCYC) in March, some analysts figured it was driven by the need for another blockbuster in the face of Humira competitors.Key Biologics Face RivalsOther drugs with biosimilar versions in late-stage testing include Biogen's (BIIB) cancer drug Rituxan, Roche's (RHHBY) breast-cancer treatment Herceptin, and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade. And Merck (MRK) is developing a biosimilar version of Sanofi's (SNY) popular diabetes drug Lantus.Hospira's biosimilar version of Remicade already has been approved in Europe and was expected to be OK'd in the U.S. in Q1. But in February, the FDA delayed its advisory-panel meeting on the product ""due to information requests pending with the sponsor of the application.""Analysts are closely watching the biosimilar's rollout in Europe. Remicade is approved for a variety of ailments, from psoriasis to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to rheumatoid arthritis, and will provide a test case for how willing the different specialists are to use the knockoff without independent studies.""B(iosimilar)-Remicade was approved without gastroenterology studies, which account for 50% of Remicade sales,"" wrote Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry in a December research report. ""Some gastroenterology specialists we've spoken with do not plan to use b-Remicade for IBD indications until clinical studies report out in late 2015 or 2016.""In Europe, biosimilar versions of Neupogen have taken about 30% of the market. Analysts generally expect the same for the U.S., but much depends on where the drugs are priced.Generic pharmaceuticals generally go for a fraction of the original drug's price, driving the retail value down so much that the original developers stop marketing the products (though they do keep manufacturing them). Biosimilars are more difficult and expensive to develop, so there are fewer players and less pricing competition.Novartis still hasn't launched Zarxio and is keeping mum about its price. Company spokeswoman Geena Wardaki told Investor's Business Daily in an email, ""For biosimilars in general, we typically expect discounts to be in the range of 10% to 30% below the reference biologic. However, this depends on therapeutic area, market, channel, number of competitors and reimbursement situation.""CMS Vs. FDA On BiosimilarsOn Tuesday, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that physicians prescribing Medicare Part B drugs would be reimbursed for biosimilars in the same way as for the original drugs — average selling price plus 6%. Pharmacies dispensing part D drugs can exclude the original from their lists of preferred drugs in favor of the biosimilar if they wish, so long as they provide a transitional supply of the original for patients already taking it.That implies that CMS is treating biosimilars as effectively interchangeable with the originals, further muddying an issue that's already unclear. The FDA ruled that although Zarxio can be used for all five of the uses approved for Neupogen — boosting blood cells in various kinds of cancer patients — it's not technically interchangeable. That means that if a doctor prescribes the original drug, a pharmacy can't fill it with the biosimilar.That doesn't matter so much for Zarxio, since the drug is administered via hospitals and clinics rather than retail pharmacies. Nonetheless, some drugmakers might find it worthwhile to file separately for an interchangeability approval, which will likely involve studies of patients switching between products, say experts in the matter.""That would be a deterrent to a second person coming in,"" said Malik. ""If I can show that my product is interchangeable, that doesn't necessarily mean that another applicant down the road can do the same thing just by piggybacking on me. In a lot of cases, the structure (of the original drug) is not perfectly known, and you do have to spend time convincing people that it's the same.""Yet another question is how aggressive the payers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will be in pushing biosimilars ahead of the original drugs to save costs. In a March 29 report, analyst Gerberry wrote that two unnamed ""payer specialists"" had told him that payers will probably leave a grace period of six to 12 months for doctors to get used to biosimilars, but then start to lean harder.""Specialists expect policies to grandfather stable patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (e.g., Remicade) at same reimbursement, but new patients or new switches would likely be required to go through a prior authorization requiring patients use biosimilar first,"" he wrote.Gillian Woollett, senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, says another issue is naming. When a company develops a new drug, it gets a generic (also called nonproprietary) name and a brand name, and the generic name (filgrastim, in the case of Neupogen) is used by all generic drugmakers when the patents expire.What's In A Name?Many biologics approved by the FDA, even when they have never been compared, also share nonproprietary names because this is simply the name of the active ingredient and not the name of the product. Biosimilars in most other markets share the nonproprietary name of their reference product too, but in the U.S., with the first approval, the FDA assigned makers a ""placeholder nonproprietary name,"" in this case filgrastim-sndz.""The naming thing is an important space to watch,"" Woollett told Investor's Business Daily. ""I think these are all going to be branded products, and all biosimilars, like most originator biologics, will have brand names — again, the generic-drug situation is totally different, as most generics do not have brand names.""

144,CMS,"Spending: President Obama almost sounded like a free-market health care reformer during a recent interview. Too bad he can't even imagine letting the private sector fix things.in an interview published this week on Vox.com, Ezra Klein asks Obama why health care costs so much more in the U.S. than in other countries. It was a perfect set-up for Obama to blame greedy insurance companies, drug companies and doctors.Instead, Obama gave a surprising — for liberals at least — answer: Health costs are being driven up largely because most health bills are paid by third parties.""Mostly we've got a system where everybody gets their health insurance through their employers,"" he said. ""For those of us who have an insurer, we don't track (costs). And the market then becomes really opaque and really hard to penetrate.""Obama even says, ""Moving in the direction where consumers and others can have more power in the marketplace ... makes a lot of sense.""This is almost exactly what free-market health care reformers have been saying for decades.As the nearby chart shows, private insurers and the government paid for about half the nation's health care costs in 1960. By 1980, they covered more than 75% of health costs. Today, they pick up more than 88%.This rise in third-party payment for health care — driven by government programs and decades-old tax policies — largely shields consumers from the cost of care, which fuels inflation, distorts the market, increases paperwork costs and makes pricing agonizingly opaque.But while Obama managed to hit on the right diagnosis, he utterly failed to understand its implications. In his next breath, in fact, Obama says that he's expanded this third-party system so people can ""have peace of mind.""ObamaCare limits deductibles, limits annual out-of-pocket spending, mandates first-dollar coverage for a host of health care and so on. As a result, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) expects that by 2023 private insurers or the government will pay for more than 90% of the nation's health costs.It's also clear from Obama's remarks that he doesn't understand why health spending has slowed.""I can't take credit for all four years of the lowest health-care inflation in the last 50 that we've seen since the Affordable Care Act passed,"" he told Klein, before going on say how ObamaCare deserves credit.But one of the key factors in the slowdown of health spending was a private-sector reform that, if anything, ObamaCare will undermine.Over the past decade, companies have rapidly shifted toward ""consumer directed"" health plans for employees. These are high-deductible plans that typically include a tax-free health savings account to cover out-of-pocket costs. Any money left in the account belongs to the consumer, not the insurance company.Between 2005 and today, HSA plans went from zero to roughly 20% of the employer market. And CMS credits ""the continued shift of enrollees to high-deductible health plans"" for at least part of the slowdown in costs.Unfortunately, Obama is too close-minded and too wedded to the idea that government bureaucrats always know best to learn from this.So, instead of pushing market-based reforms that put consumers in the driver's seat, ObamaCare imposes more top-down government regulations and mandates, more price controls, more subsidies.And in the end, it will deliver higher health costs.

148,CMS,"Doctors are ramping up our protests against the government's expanding role into health care, but we aren't voicing our displeasure by using pickets and bullhorns. We are instead protesting silently through our practice decisions — and based on recent trends, the number of disaffected doctors is growing by the day.Having graduated from medical school 28 years ago, I have witnessed first-hand the transformation of our country's health care system. Then, medical practice focused on the deeply personal decisions made between doctor and patient. Today, however, bureaucrats are inserting themselves ever deeper into every aspect of health care.Physicians across the country are responding to this evolution — most recently in response to the Affordable Care Act — by shielding their practices from government interference. This comes in many forms: Rejecting new Medicare and Medicaid patients, transitioning to third-party-free practices and ditching small private practices for employed positions with ever-larger hospital-owned networks.Consider the doctors refusing new Medicare and Medicaid patients. Increasingly, doctors refuse to participate in these programs because of constantly changing — and lower — reimbursement rates, burdensome regulations, reporting requirements, and other serious issues.In recent years, 52% of physicians have begun or are planning to restrict the number of Medicare patients in their practice, according to a study conducted by the Physicians Foundation. One in four have simply closed their doors to Medicaid patients altogether.According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), nearly 10,000 physicians opted out of Medicare in 2012 alone — a 160% increase over 2009. At a time when 10,000 baby boomers are turning 65 every day, this segment of our population can ill afford a shortage of physicians.Physicians are instead embracing practice models that limit government interference. This meddling can come either directly through government-paid health care — e.g., Medicare and Medicaid — or indirectly through regulations applied to private insurance policies — e.g., the ACA.For evidence, witness the emergence of so-called concierge medicine and third-party-free practices. The first charges patients periodic membership fees; the second refuses insurance coverage altogether, thus dodging the government regulations that come with it.The Physicians Foundation study of over 20,000 doctors found that 7.2% of the doctors have already converted to concierge medicine or a direct pay model. An additional 13.3 % of physicians are planning to do the same in the near future.If this holds, one in five doctors will be practicing some form of concierge or direct pay model in the future. It makes sense to make this move: By eliminating the cumbersome insurance billing process, doctors save an average 40% in overhead expenses, leading to lower fees.I fall into this latter category. Many colleagues thought I was insane when I transitioned to a third-party-free practice nine years ago. They assumed I'd go bankrupt. But my decision was based on more than financial considerations.This is the only way I can interact with my patients one-on-one without dealing with intrusive insurance coverage requirements or treatment mandates and other regulations imposed by the government. By not accepting third-party insurance, private or public, I can ensure that health care decisions are made in the right place — between doctor and patient.Other physicians have different ways of protesting. Even those who continue to accept Medicare and other third-party insurance payments are silently protesting against the increasing role of government. Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic shift away from small private practices towards employed positions at larger hospital-owned physician networks.In 2005, two-thirds of medical practices were physician-owned. Today, that number has dropped to around half, with hospitals controlling the other half. With their larger staffs, hospitals are better positioned to absorb the burgeoning costs of red tape — including over 13,000 pages in the ACA alone. Perversely, the government also pays private physicians less than hospitals for exactly the same services.The doctor-patient relationship suffers in other ways in the hospital-owned setting. On top of the regulatory burden from Washington and state governments, hospitals make additional paperwork and compliance demands. Physicians are thus dealing with multiple and compounding intrusions into the doctor-patient relationship — yet they have no choice but to accept it because they can't financially survive on their own in private practice.Through all of this, our primary concern is for the well-being of our patients. Yet Washington's ever-increasing meddling in the medical profession only limits our ability to help them. Our silent protests will only continue until Washington stops encroaching on the waiting room, the treatment room, and everything and everyone in between. Gianoli is a neuro-otologist who practices in Covington, La.

153,CMS,"Hospital emergency rooms have their hands full providing care.And from the incessant sounds of sirens echoing through many city streets, ambulance operators seem just as busy.Outsourcing these services has become common practice. Envision Healthcare Holdings (EVHC) comes to the rescue on both fronts.The Colorado-based company is a leading player in staffing hospital emergency departments through its EmCare division and providing medical transport through American Medical Response, or AMR.Both businesses have ""brand recognition,"" said Envision Chief Executive William Sanger, who has been overseeing both as CEO since 2005.Envision went public last year, for the second time — two years after a private-equity firm had taken it private again. But the firm's roots go back much further.EmCare, the larger business of the two, was founded in 1972, two decades before AMR. At first it provided emergency-department staffing and related services to hospitals in Texas. But acquisitions broadened its reach nationwide.Now more of EmCare's growth is organic rather than acquired.Doctors On CallHospitals can buy single services or bundled packages to meet their staffing needs. EmCare can provide ER physicians, trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiologists and ""hospitalists"" — doctors who give care in the hospital after an initial episode is treated.""They have really differentiated themselves with their bundled offerings. And that's led to industry leading organic growth,"" said analyst Richard Close of Avondale Partners.He says Envision's new contracts are growing 13% to 15% annually. In contrast, chief rival Team Health Holdings (TMH) is primarily growing through acquisitions, he says.On the medical transportation side, competition is fragmented. About 50% of 911 emergency requests are handled by local fire departments, the other half by private ambulance services, Sanger says.Not only is Envision's AMR the largest of its kind in the country, it has been ""benefiting from financial woes of some competitors,"" says Jason Gurda, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets.For example, one of its largest rivals, Rural/Metro, declared bankruptcy last year. More recently, a smaller rival ""went out of business overnight,"" he said.Sanger says AMR has ""several hundred 911 contracts and literally thousands of relationships with hospitals,"" the latter for transporting patients to facilities such as dialysis centers and nursing homes.""We've identified protocols to improve survival rates,"" Sanger said of its ambulance service. AMR gets high marks in cardiac survival and is looking to improve stroke survival rates.Both of Envision's core businesses are getting modest boosts from health care reform under the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.""It's translating into more patients, more revenue and more profit,"" Sanger said of expanded insurance coverage under ObamaCare.The 20% of patients who weren't able to pay for ambulance services or emergency-room visits is now closer to 18% because of ObamaCare, he says.""Generally the positive impact from the Affordable Care Act has been a shift from the uninsured into Medicaid,"" Close said.Health care reform has also put a sharper focus on integrated health care, which is a positive for Envision. Reimbursement based on outcomes or quality metrics has ""positioned Envision to be a partner to hospital systems,"" Gurda said.That's because EmCare provides a more integrated approach to health care than the fragmented care typically delivered by hospital staffs, he says.""One of the things EmCare does well is help those partners achieve quality outcomes. Part of it is being focused — making that a key operational point for employees. And it's invested quite a bit on the (information technology) side,"" Gurda said.New Hospital DealsSuch strategies have led to a growing number of contract wins with hospitals, which in turn is driving much of the company's revenue growth. Revenue year-over-year has grown in double digits for seven straight quarters.EmCare has around 750 individual contracts with hospitals or hospital systems, Sanger says. Its largest ones are with Hospital Corporation of America, or HCA Holdings (HCA), and Baylor Health Care System in Texas.EmCare generated net revenue of $690 million in the second quarter, a 21.2% gain over the prior year. AMR's revenue rose 16.7% to $385.3 million, its strongest performance in years.Total revenue in the second quarter jumped 19.6% from the earlier year to $1.08 billion. Adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up from the equivalent of 5 cents in the prior year.Based on improving financial results this year, Envision raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $1.15 to $1.20 from $1.10 to $1.15 previously. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year revenue to climb 17% over last year to nearly $4.4 billion and per-share earnings to rise 73% to $1.17.Aftercare OpportunityA third business, called Evolution Health, is in early development. It currently generates just a small amount of revenue, Sanger says.Evolution embraces a ""continuum of care"" model, he says, which seeks to manage patients' health care after they are discharged from a hospital.""We started an integrated-care model in the hospital so we're taking it to another level,"" Sanger said.Evolution has been lining up work with health plans to manage their most seriously ill customers and has already hired roughly 1,500 clinicians.Starting in January, Envision's Evolution will spearhead six pilot programs in conjunction with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, involving the ""sickest patients,"" Sanger says.He thinks Evolution will grow quickly over the next five to seven years.""It could be the size of our other two services,"" Sanger said.

International growth is focused mainly in Europe, where the company recently signed new contracts for BRACAnalysis and other products in Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Germany. Non-U.S. revenue rose 89% sequentially in Q4, the company said.The company also recently entered the autoimmune-disease market with its $270 million buyout of Crescendo Bioscience, whose Vectra DA product assesses the likelihood of progression in rheumatoid arthritis. Though executives say that the deal is dilutive in the near term, as Crescendo wasn't making money, they see longer-term benefits from the technology, given the large number of interrelated immunological diseases. Myriad CEO Peter Meldrum cited juvenile arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis as future indications.

"
205,CMS,"What it found was that 65% of small businesses that offer insurance will likely see their premiums rise thanks to ObamaCare. That translates into higher insurance costs for 11 million workers.
"
206,CMS,"The reason? These companies generally employ younger, healthier workers and so had been paying lower-than-average rates.
"

236,CMS,"The trade war between the United States and China just got worse, with President Trump unveiling a fresh round of tariffs on imports from China. While China has responded that it would impose retaliatory tariffs, it did not divulge details about its plan of action.Renewed fears of a trade war may result in a scurry toward safe-haven sectors as preferred investments. One of the most-popular, safe-haven sectors is utilities. This sector comprises companies that provide telephone, gas, water and electricity services.The Utilities Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund has gained over 8% in the past month against the S&P 500’s decline of 0.3%. Under such circumstances, investing in companies from the utility sector seems prudent.U.S. Blasts China With Additional Import TariffsOn Jul 10, the Trump administration unveiled a spate of fresh tariffs on imports from China. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer stated that Chinese commodities worth $200 billion such as fruits and vegetables, handbags, refrigerators, rain jackets and baseball gloves among others could be charged with 10% tariffs.The newly proposed tariffs would undergo a two-month review post which a decision on its future would be taken. Trump reasoned that he is wary of China’s unfair trade practice and the country’s tendency to steal intellectual property from the United States.China Promises to Hit Back at Trump’s TariffsOn Jul 11, Beijing announced that it planned to retaliate against Trump’s most recent tariffs. However, the country did not reveal any details about how it would hit back at White House’s fresh round of duties. This has resulted in approximately $250 billion worth of Chinese goods being subject to import tariffs from the United States.The country’s commerce ministry termed such an act by the United States as ""totally unacceptable"" heightening of the already existing trade dispute between the two countries. Further, the ministry pledged to safeguard the country’s ""core interests."" Finally, the Chinese ministry also vowed to impose “necessary countermeasures” on the United States if the need be.4 Best ChoicesThe trade-war between the United States and China shows no signs of ebbing any sooner. This has got more to do with Trump’s new tariffs on additional goods worth $200 billion from China. Although China has not retaliated with a tit-for-tat tariff, it is not expected to back off.Under circumstances where geopolitical conditions remain unfavorable, investing in safe-haven stocks such as utilities would be advisable.

Proper maintenance and upgrade of the vital infrastructure lowers possibility of outages and ensures uninterrupted supply of electricity to customers. Proper maintenance of electric poles and lines that pass through vegetation require regular investment for maintenance.FirstEnergy plans to invest nearly $10 billion in regulated business through 2021 to strengthen and upgrade existing infrastructure. This strategic investment will help the company to serve a six million customer base more efficiently. Recently, the company’s subsidiaries completed the inspections of transmission lines. We believe that these kinds of steps provide comfort to customers and faith on the company, which attracts more customers and ensures retention of existing ones. Modernization PlansSince 2014, the company has upgraded or replaced existing power lines and incorporated smart technology in the grid. The company has initiated a modernization drive plan — Energizing the Future. The new substation will also have smart technology installed to detect irregular conditions.FirstEnergy is using drones as advanced technology to inspect the infrastructure. Usage of drones is gradually becoming popular among the utility service providers in the United States. Xcel Energy Inc (XEL  -  Free Report), CMS Energy Corp (CMS  -  Free Report) and PPL Corporation (PPL  -  Free Report) have already started to utilize drones to maintain their infrastructure. Considering the benefits of drones, we expect to see higher usage of the same among other providers as well.Zacks Rank & Price MovementFirstEnergy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

239,CMS,"Avista Corporation (AVA  -  Free Report) has made a filing to Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) for approving its annual fixed cost adjustment (FCA) in Idaho. If lent a nod, the overall annual electric and natural gas revenues in the region will decrease by $7.2 million (2.9%) and $2.7 million (4.5%), respectively. The nod is expected to be implemented with effect from Oct 1, 2018, for electricity and Nov 1, 2018, for natural gas.The last filing by the company for annual rate adjustment with IPUC was made on Aug 1, 2017. It was done in order to increase overall electric revenues by $2.8 million (1.1%), which was effectively enforced on Oct 1, 2017. These annual filings for fixed cost adjustments are separate from those general rate case petitions, which have no material impact on the company’s earnings as well as are unrelated to the company’s proposed acquisition by Hydro One.Customer-Centric BenefitsIf the proposed filing is approved by the IPUC — the company’s residential electric customers — whose usage is on an average of 910 kilowatt hours (KWh) per month, the monthly bill will accordingly be reduced from $88.49 to $84.33, a decrease of $4.16 per month (4.7%).Also, the residential natural gas customers of the company, whose usage is on an average of 63 therms per month, will witness lower expenses on their monthly bill from $48.31 to $46.28, an improvement of $2.03 per month (4.2%).Rationale Behind the Rate DeclineRate reduction is nothing new in the Utility space. In the United States, government regulations dominate this sector. Therefore, utility providers frequently file for rate changes with the state utility commission to keep their revenue requirement competitive in tandem with the changing market conditions.The average monthly residential electricity bill in Idaho is $88 KWh per month, lower than the average monthly bill in the United States, which is approximately $107 KWh. Also, the average monthly consumption in the region is 1,010 KWh per month, greater than the average national monthly consumption of 903 KWh. So, the higher electricity consumption pattern in Idaho with modest monthly cost supports the company’s filing for rate reduction from $88.49 to $84.33 in the region with a view to strengthen the customer base as well as better serve the increased demand for electricity.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Avista have outperformed the industry it belongs to.

Of 55% of the total energy generated, nearly 21 gigawatt (GW) added in the United States during 2017, was from a renewable source. Also, 22% of the total electricity generation in the United States comes from a renewable source as of Feb 2018.In 2017, electricity generation from solar resources touched nearly 77 million megawatthours (MWH) in the United States and by 2018 end, EIA expects an additional 5,067 MW of solar power to come online. According to the forecast, solar capacity is anticipated to grow by 127 gigawatt (GW) from 2020 to 2050. Also, electricity generation will likely account for nearly 14% of the total energy output to be generated during the same period.Per Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the consistent growth over the years across some of the renewable energy sources is attributable to U.S. federal policies. Electricity generation from solar enjoys a special Federal Solar Tax Credit, scheduled to expire by 2022. This tax credit has enabled the growth of solar power generation companies as the credit allowed to power generators is transferred to end users via lower solar prices.Price MovementSince the release of the news, shares of PPL Corporation have lost 1.3% compared with its industry’s decline of 1.9%. Zacks Rank & Key PicksPPL Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are as follows:CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

244,CMS,"Southwest Gas Corporation (SWX  -  Free Report) filed an application with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to increase statewide overall general rate of $32.5 million including the benefit of reduced tax liability associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for its Nevada service areas. Through this rate increase filing, the company intends to recoup the capital investment made since the last rate filing in April 2012 in Nevada as well as for the planned capital investment going ahead.The previous rate hike came into effect from November 2012, which raised the company’s annual revenues by $7 million, lower than the filing rate hike of $26.9 million. Since the last rate filing in Nevada, the company’s total investment amounted to nearly $2,402.4 million for customer support, enhancement and replacement of gas infrastructure across all its three service territories, namely Arizona, California and Nevada.The company also received an approval for its planned proposal to expand its natural gas services to Mesquite, NV. The expansion approval calls for a capital investment of approximately $28 million, for construction of 17 miles of approach main and 20 miles of distribution pipelines.Infrastructure Replacement & Capex PlanCompanies distributing natural gas require a huge amount of capital spending to fund infrastructure needs. Over the past decade, the company’s expenditure to build, replace and upgrade its aging infrastructure has increased.The company is expected to incur a capital expenditure of nearly $2 billion over the period of 2018-2020 and estimates to recover 63% of the annual investment within a year’s time. It included a capital expenditure on replacement of 6,700 miles of vintage pipelines.Southwest’s Position in NevadaThe company is the largest distributor of natural gas in Nevada by serving the Las Vegas metropolitan area and Northern Nevada. At the end of 2017, the company had more than two million residential, commercial, industrial and other natural gas customers, of which, almost 0.75 million are based in Nevada alone. Also, the company derived 35% of the total operating margin in 2017 from Nevada.Nevada does not have significant amount of natural gas resources and hence, producing only a limited amount of the demand required in the region. Nearly, 88% of the total energy consumed in Nevada comes from outside the state.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2016, 73% of the electricity generated in Nevada came from natural gas. This demand for natural gas is greater than the usual supply in Nevada. Plus, three of five households use natural gas as the primary source of energy for home heating fuel. Therefore, this rise in requirement for natural gas in the region calls for more capital investment as well as exploration of growth opportunities for companies like Southwest Gas.Price MovementIn the last six months, the Southwest Gas stock has gained 12.8%, outperforming its industry’s rise of 6.8%. Other Stocks to ConsiderSouthwest Gas carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

246,CMS,"Pattern Energy Group Inc. (PEGI  -  Free Report) announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its 81 MW interest in 115 MW El Arrayán Wind project in Chile for $67 million in cash and the divestment is expected to close within 90 days, subject to customary closing conditions.Pattern Energy expects to reduce $1 million annual overhead cost in relation to business management in Chile.The company’s decision to discontinue its wind operation in Chile was strategic as the operational hub was located far from the company’s remaining business activities. The wind operation was located nearly 400 km north of Santiago on the Chilean coast, due to which, the company had to incur higher fleet operation cost, different legal, tax and regulatory environments. The sale proceeds will either be utilized to make further accretive investments, clearing debts, share buyback or for other corporate purposes.Future Plans of Pattern EnergyPattern Energy is currently working on Pattern 2020 initiative, which sets out targets for its growth into the next decade and beyond. Under this initiative, the company aims to double its existing capability by end of 2020.Pattern Energy has utility scale renewable operations in U.S., Chile, Japan and Canada. The company is presently focused on expanding its renewable operation in Japan through acquisitions.The company bought 206 MW of solar and wind portfolio in Japan, of which, four projects with a total of 84MW are in operation and immediately accretive to the company’s business. The remaining 122 MW of solar and wind project is under constructionExpansion in Japan is a very profitable venture for the company as in Japan, the average power contract price is $230 per megawatt hour. So the 206 MW that the company acquired in Japan is equivalent to 400-600 MW in North America. Given the profitability and scope, we expect the company to further widen its scope of operations in Japan.Importance of RenewableRenewable Energy source has been gaining momentum globally. Wind and solar power have been two of the fastest growing sources of electricity generation on the international front over the past decade. In 2017, global installed wind capacity grew by nearly 11%, thus bringing the global total to 540 GW. Projections by the International Energy Agency indicate that renewable energy will continue to grow at a faster rate than fossil fuels over the next two decades.Per U.S. Energy Information Administration report, during the 2014 to 2017 time period, renewable sources accounted for more than 50% of the total utility scale power plant added in the United States. In 2018 9 GW of new solar and wind assets will be added, which shows the rising popularity and importance of renewable sources in the United States.Price PerformanceShares of Pattern Energy have outperformed its industry in the past 30 days.

251,CMS,"The Q1 earnings season is set to cross its half way mark by the end of this week. So far, earnings and revenue growth rates and the proportion of positive earnings surprises are above historical levels.Total earnings for the 87 S&P members that have released results as of Apr 20, improved 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 82.8%, while that for the top line was 67.8%.Notably, we expect total Q1 earnings for the index members to rise 18.3% from the year-ago period on 7.7% higher revenues. At present, 14 out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks universe are expected to witness an improvement in earnings.Amid this backdrop, let’s see how the Zacks Utilities sector is poised for this earnings season. Earnings from the utility space are expected to improve 12.4% in the first quarter. (For more details check out our latest Earnings Preview)A Glance at the Utility SectorUtility business is known for stability and visibility of earnings and cash flow, with the primary growth driver being consistent demand for electricity and utility services. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) predicted that annual average U.S. residential electricity price will increase 2.6% in 2018. Thus the sector is expected to tread on a growth trajectory.Therefore, staying invested in fundamentally strong and domestic-focused utility stocks will provide investors with steady returns. Currently, the sector is undergoing a transition, wherein the primary fuel source — coal — is being replaced by natural gas and renewables.However, utility stocks are subject to stringent regulations, both at the federal and state levels. Moreover, being capital intensive in nature, higher interest rates dent the growth of these stocks. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve raised rates for the sixth time since December 2015 when the Federal Open Market Committee began increasing rates from near zero. This is likely to have a negative impact on the sector.Nevertheless, to maintain their performance level, utilities are undertaking cost-savings initiatives, modernizing transmission and distribution lines, upgrading infrastructure and focusing on renewable energy to generate electricity. Further, new electric rates and customer growth will help the sector to witness improvement in earnings in the first quarter.The quarter was also a witness to a colder-than-normal winter in most parts of the United States. Utilities are likely to benefit from this as it will drive heating expenditures for households, boosting the companies’ earnings.However, earnings projections for the sector hint at an unimpressive quarter, when compared to its Q4 performance.The sector’s earnings are likely to improve 12% on in-line year-over-year revenues. In the fourth quarter, earnings for this sector increased 13.3% on 4.2% sales growth.Utilities to Post Q1 Earnings on Apr 26American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.94% in the last quarter. However, the company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.25%.The company’s commercial sales were drab in the fourth quarter of 2017. Expecting this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Electric’s first-quarter revenue estimate of $3.74 billion shows an annual decline of 4.9%.However, lower tax rates, courtesy of the latest tax reform, is expected to boost American Electric’s quarterly bottom line.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

256,CMS,"Entergy Corporation (ETR  -  Free Report) will release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 90.95%. Also, Entergy surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 60.21%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayIn the first quarter, most of the company's service territories witnessed warmer-than-normal winters. This indicates reduced demand for electricity in these regions, which in turn, is expected to weigh on Entergy's first-quarter sales.Moreover, management expects the company’s Entergy Wholesale Commodity (EWC) segment to post lower net revenues throughout 2018. The downside can be attributed to lower energy prices, increased non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses on account of higher projected nuclear spending. We believe the upcoming results to reflect this trend, which in turn, is likely to be a drag on the company’s total revenues. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.46 billion for Entergy’s first-quarter sales reflects a year-over-year decline of 5.1%.On the bottom-line front, corporate income tax expense courtesy of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is expected to boost Entergy’s earnings growth, in the first-quarter. Considering this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entergy’s first-quarter earnings of $1.31 per share reflects annual growth of 32.3%.In November 2017, Entergy Mississippi filed its redetermination of the annual factor to be applied under the energy cost recovery rider. The calculation of the annual factor included an under-recovery of approximately $61.5 million as of September 30, 2017. In January 2018, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved the proposed energy cost factors effective for February 2018 bills. So, a part of this $62 million will positively impact the company’s first quarter results.On the flip side, higher fuel costs are expected to weigh heavily on the company’s results in the yet-to-be reported quarter. The increase in fuel costs can be attributed to rise in nuclear spending that Entergy expects to incur in relation to its nuclear strategic plan like continuing operation of the Palisades plant through 2022.Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Entergy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Entergy Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Entergy is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

257,CMS,"NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 24. Last quarter, this utility reported a negative earnings surprise of 4.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayManagement expects NextEra Energy’s performance in the first half of 2018 to be softer in comparison to second half results. The company expects its subsidiary Florida Power & Light Company’s (FPL) performance to be lower than expected, as tax savings will not immediately offset its typical reserve amortization requirements. This is going to have an adverse impact on earnings in the first quarter.In January 2018, FPL announced its plans to apply federal tax savings toward the Hurricane Irma restoration cost of $1.3 billion. Otherwise, it would have increased utility bills of 4.9 million customers in the first quarter of 2018.However, the economy of Florida remains sturdy, with its current unemployment rate below the national average. Plus, new building permits indicate customer additions and an increase in demand from the residential space.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NextEra Energy is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

260,CMS,"Industrial production continued to notch up gains in March, though the pace of increase declined to an extent. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that a sharp rebound in output from utilities and a second straight increase in mining output were primarily responsible for March’s gains.Meanwhile, capacity utilization touched a three-year high, indicating that the economy possesses sufficient underlying strength. This lower level of slack is likely to increase inflationary pressures which in turn would help to raise GDP. Given this backdrop investing in utilities stocks, which provide lucrative dividends, remains a smart option at this point.Capacity Utilization Hits 3-Yr HighThe highlight of last month’s industrial production data was a spurt in capacity utilization. This gauge of slack in the industrial segment of the economy advanced 0.3 percentage point to touch 78%. The figure exceeded the consensus estimate of 77.9 and also hit its highest level in three years. A decline in industrial sector slack will likely boost inflation, which in turn could fuel growth further.However, industrial production itself increased by only 0.5%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 0.3% but falling well behind February’s revised increase of 1%. The pace of gains dropped because manufacturing output managed only to inch up 0.1% in March after a 1.5% advance in February.Utilities Gains Powers Headline NumberPrimarily responsible for March’s manufacturing gains was a 2.7% increase in auto production. Assemblies of automotive units jumped to an annual pace of 12 million units, the highest recorded since December 2016. Excluding the auto production component, manufacturing actually declined 0.1% in March. This was in keeping with the ISM Manufacturing Index’s 1.5% decline to 59.3.Ultimately, gains in mining and utilities output lifted the headline number. Gains in support activities and oil and gas production helped boost mining output by 1%. More significantly, utilities output advanced by 3%. This strong rebound for the sector comes after a 5% decline in February, caused by a drop in demand due to unseasonably warm weather.Our ChoicesIndustrial production managed to notch up gains last month despite a drop in manufacturing output. A rebound in demand for utilities was one of the major factors powering gains for the headline number.With the economic environment remaining favorable, utilities demand is likely to remain strong in the months to come. This is why it makes sense to add stocks from this sector to your portfolios.

261,CMS,"We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers. These, however, may not be enough. Sometimes, a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter. This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on. But if you seek long-term returns, investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results.A critical analysis of a company’s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision. Here, coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role. The higher the ratio, the better it is. The focus of this article is on “Interest Coverage,” which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio = Earnings before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) divided by Interest Expense.Why Interest Coverage Ratio?Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships. Definitely, one should also track the company’s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X-Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history.Projected EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry Median: This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years. This shows that the stock has near-term earnings growth potential.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.VGM Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report), which provides electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services, has a VGM Score of B and an expected EPS growth rate 15% for 3-5 years. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CBRE Group, Inc.

(ARW  -  Free Report), which provides products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial users of electronic components and enterprise computing, has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A.

Its net earnings for the quarter totaled R$160.2 million ($49.3 million), marking an improvement over the net loss of R$271.1 million ($82.2 million) recorded in the year-ago quarter.The quarter’s earnings per share were R$0.37 versus the net loss per share of R$0.77 in the year-ago quarter. The American Depository Receipt (ADR) equivalent for fourth-quarter 2017 earnings was 11 cents, while that for the year-ago quarter’s loss was 23 cents.For 2017, the company’s net earnings grew 41.6% year over year to R$1,118.3 million ($350.6 million). On a per-share basis, earnings of R$3.78 showed an increase of 24.8% over the previous year, while its ADR equivalent was $1.18 versus 87 cents in 2016.Revenues Improve Y/YIn the fourth quarter, COPEL’s net operating revenues totaled R$3,910.7 million ($1,203.3 million), increasing 18.6% year over year.The top-line improvement was primarily driven by growth of 14.4% in electricity sales to final customers, 29.2% in electricity sales to distributors, 3.3% in sales derived from the use of main distribution and transmission grid, 10.3% in revenues from telecommunications and rise in gains from sectorial financial assets and liabilities.However, these positives were partially offset by the decline of 19.9% in construction revenues, 7.9% in sales derived from the distribution of piped gas and 34.4% in other operating revenues.For the full year, the company’s net operating revenues grew 7% year over year to R$14,024.6 million ($4,396.4 million).Electricity Sales WeakCOPEL’s electricity sales to final customers include Copel Distribuicao’s sales in the captive market and Copel Geracao e Transmissao’s sales in the free market.In the fourth quarter, COPEL’s electricity sales to final customers decreased 2% year over year to 6,124-gigawatt hours. The fall was due to the 10.9% decline in Industrial consumption segment, partially offset by growth of 3.5% in Residential, 0.3% in Commercial, 5.7% in Rural and 3% in Other segment.Expenses Increase, Margin Falls Y/YCOPEL’s operating costs and expenses in the fourth quarter totaled R$3,618.1 million ($1,113.3 million), increasing 6.5% year over year. As a percentage of net operating revenues, these expenses were at 92.5% versus 86.7% in the year-ago quarter.Increase in operating costs and expenses was due to the rise of 42.4% in costs related to electricity purchased for resale, 24.4% in charge of the main distribution and transmission grid, 32.3% in materials and supplies costs, 754.4% in costs related to materials and supplies for power electricity, 0.7% in natural gas and supplies costs, 3.4% rise in depreciation and amortization and 12.7% surge in other costs and expenses.However, the impact of higher costs and expenses was partially offset by a decline of 7.5% in personnel and management costs, 7.9% in costs related to pension and healthcare plans, 8.1% in third-party services costs, 55.6% in provision and reversals and 15.8% in construction costs.Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were R$665.8 million ($204.9 million), up 5.1% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 17% in the quarter versus 19.2% in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowExiting the fourth quarter, COPEL had cash and cash equivalents of R$1,040.1 million ($314.2 million), down from R$1,305.4 million ($413.1 million) at the prior-quarter end.

Of the total, roughly R$743.6 million will be used for the Generation and Transmission business, R$790 million will be used for the Distribution business and R$340.2 million for the Telecommunications business. The rest will be utilized for improving other businesses.Market Capitalization & Key PicksCOPEL currently has roughly $2-billion market capitalization.

Elevated trade tensions between the United States and China along with weakness in large-cap tech stocks are cited to be the reasons for the free fall. The prospect of rising interest rates and lofty valuations are expected to trigger another stock market correction in the near term.Given the turmoil, investing in defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings growth regardless of the state of the equity market.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The S&P 500 finished 2.2% lower at 2,581.88 on Apr 2, down 10.1% from its record high in Jan 26. The broader index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since the U.K.’s vote for Brexit in June 2016. The Dow Jones also closed below the aforesaid technical level, indicating further downtrend in the near future.Unlike the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq somehow managed to avoid a correction but it did lose more than 10% from its record high attained in March. This leaves all the three major indices in negative territory for the year, while the CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index slipped further into “extreme fear” territory.Global Trade WarSelling in stocks intensified after China decided to impose tariffs on about 130 U.S. goods, including a 25% charge on U.S. pork and 15% on fruits. The world’s second largest economy retaliated against Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum shipments.All these have not only weighed on U.S. meat producers as well as industrial stocks, investors panicked as a full-fledged trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment. It may also dent first-quarter corporate earnings results slated to release this month.Big Tech SelloffAdding to the downbeat tone is a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), in the meantime, slipped after Trump lashed out at the e-commerce company on its tax policy and subsequent effect on bricks-and-mortar retailers. Another tech major Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) took a beating after Apple Inc. decided to break away from the chip maker and make its own chips in its Mac computers as early as 2020.Electric car maker Tesla, Inc. (TSLA  -  Free Report) is also sinking after one of its driverless technology vehicles was involved in a fatal crash, while it recalled 123,000 Model S vehicles because of an issue related to a power steering component.Rate Hike FearsAmid all these, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve has hiked rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020.This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China. After all, rate hikes will raise borrowing costs, eventually denting corporate profits and affecting the U.S. economy.How to Prepare for the SetbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).UtilitiesCenterPoint Energy, Inc.

279,CMS,"CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 19.51%. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.60%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCMS Energy’s regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate relatively stable earnings. However, during the second quarter, the company’s service territory was affected by storms which in turn dented earnings. The third quarter was also adversely impacted by storm activities and thus the company’s bottom line is expected to remain under pressure. In line with this, the company’s third quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 62 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 12.1%.Weather conditions remain a key determinant for the company’s to-be-reported quarter. CMS Energy’s service territories have witnessed above-average temperatures during the third quarter. This will result in lower household expenditures on heating, which may adversely impact revenues.Nevertheless, the absence of discretionary activities which occurred in the second half of 2016, such as debt pre-funding and relatively high volume of donations, may benefit CMS Energy’s bottom line in the second half of 2017.Moreover, the company continues to reduce its operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, which, in turn, will facilitate capital investments. In fact, the company has been able to cut down O&M costs by more than 3% for each year of the last decade. It has cut down costs by 6.5% last year, much better than the initial expectation. We expect the company’s cost-reduction efforts to get reflected in the third quarter results as well.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows that CMS Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as we have mentioned below:Zacks ESP: CMS Energy has an Earnings ESP of -13.82%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 53 cents, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CMS Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CMS Energy Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CMS Energy Corporation Quote Zacks Rank: CMS Energy currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few players in the Utility sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.NiSource, Inc.

280,CMS,"CMS Energy Corporation’s (CMS  -  Free Report) principal subsidiary, Consumers Energy recently announced that it will invest approximately $250 million to boost small businesses in Michigan over the next two and a half years, under the Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) initiative.About PMBCThe Pure Michigan Business Connect (PMBC) developed by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation (MEDC) began as a multi-billion dollar public/private initiative in 2011. The initiative aims at connecting Michigan goods and service suppliers with corporate purchasers free of charge.Our ViewWe note that, being one of the founding members of PMBC, Consumers Energy has already spent approximately $2.9 billion with Michigan businesses under the initiative since June 2015. CMS Energy’s robust financial commitment toward the PMBC program not only reflects the solid financial flexibility it boasts but also is a testament to the company’s focus on expanding its business across Michigan.Moreover, PMBC’s commitment to generate new jobs is in line with the company’s aim of stimulating economic growth in the state. This in turn will aid small businesses to flourish.We believe CMS Energy aims at expanding customer base by boosting the small businesses. Indeed if business expansion takes place in the state, need for energy consumption will rise and CMS Energy being the largest energy provider in Michigan will surely benefit from that.As of 2015, Michigan is ranked 11th among the U.S. states in terms of energy consumption and with gradual growth in economy, the energy consumption is likely to grow. To tap this expanding market, energy providers like CMS Energy are taking varied initiatives to instil growth in the state and consequently enhance their business.Toward this, another utility provider, DTE Energy Company (DTE  -  Free Report) has recently commenced operations in its Lapeer solar park — one of the largest utility-owned solar parks, located in Michigan. On completion, the park is expected to generate sufficient clean energy to power 11,000 homes. (Read more : DTE Energy (DTE  -  Free Report) Brings Lapeer Solar Park Online in Michigan.) Price MovementCMS Energy has outperformed the industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have gained 19.4% compared with the industry’s growth of 13.3%.The company’s ongoing capital investments to strengthen infrastructure and initiatives to lower operation and maintenance expenses are driving its performance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCMS Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

281,CMS,"CMS Energy Corporation’s (CMS  -  Free Report) subsidiary, CMS Enterprises, is set to buy Delta Solar, a 24-megawatt (MW) solar power project that comprises two phases. The project will offer sufficient energy to the Lansing Board of Water & Light to power 3,300 homes through a power purchase agreement.Details of the ProjectLocated on about 190 acres in Delta Township in Eaton County next to the General Motors Co.’s (GM  -  Free Report) Lansing Delta Assembly Plant, the Delta Solar project is currently under construction by Vermont-based groSolar, a subsidiary of EDF Renewable Energy. This latest project will become operational by the summer of 2018, which in turn will help the Lansing Board of Water & Light to attain its renewable energy goals.Once its work gets completed in 2018, Delta Solar will become Michigan’s second-largest solar power plant and is expected to create about 150 construction jobs.It represents CMS Energy's capability to help meet Michigan's need for new renewable energy sources as the state continues to grow.Other Renewable Projects of CMS EnergyAt present, CMS Energy has two solar power plants in Michigan, at Western Michigan University and Grand Valley State University. Also, it owns the Flambeau Solar plant in Wisconsin.Notably, the company's renewable energy commitment consists of wind farms in the Thumb and near Lake Michigan, besides the three biomass facilities in Michigan and North Carolina.Moreover, in order to meet the requirements of the renewable energy plan, the company signed a 15-year agreement in 2015 to purchase renewable capacity, energy, and RECs from a 100-MW wind park to be constructed in Huron County, MI. The wind park is expected to be online by 2017-end.Our ViewWith the increasing demand for renewable energy resources, companies are adopting clean energy procurement as a strategic business decision to support their growth and business bottom line. In this line, CMS Energy  has also increased its focus on clean power generation, apart from infrastructural upgrade, reliability improvement and capacity maximization. With renewable assets as the ultimate energy resources for our future, surely the Delta Solar project will prove to be beneficial for the company in the long run.  Moreover, groSolar has 20 years of leading solar development, engineering and construction experience. In fact, earlier in 2017 CMS Enterprises and groSolar had worked jointly to develop the 2.5-megawatt Flambeau Solar power plant in northern Wisconsin, the largest solar project in that state. We believe the latest project in Michigan will further strengthen the partnership between these two companies and once the power plant is completed, it will increase CMS Energy’s customer base.Price MovementCMS Energy has outperformed the industry in the last 12 months. The company’s shares have gained 13.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 8.1%.The company’s ongoing capital investments to strengthen its infrastructure and initiatives to lower operation and maintenance expenses are driving its performance.Stocks to ConsiderCMS Energy carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

286,CMS,"The Q2 earnings season is fast approaching its core. As of Jul 26, 171 S&P 500 members came up with their quarterly earnings. Total earnings for these companies are up 8.8% from the same period last year on 3.4% higher revenues. 78.9% of the companies beat EPS estimates while 70.8% topped revenue estimates.It is going to be another busy week with nearly 800 companies – including 183 S&P 500 members – expected to come up with earnings results. Combining results of the reported index members (171 members till Jul 26) with the remaining 329 members of S&P 500, earnings are estimated to improve 8.7% on 4.7% higher revenues.Let us now focus on the utility sector, which is characterized by its defensive nature and domestic orientation. Earnings are expected to drop 2.7% this season.The utility sector is capital-intensive. These companies need huge capital to set up generation facilities, and transmission and distribution infrastructure. They also require considerable funds to maintain and upgrade the existing systems in order to meet emission-control standards. Utilities have been benefiting from the rock-bottom interest rate environment. However, the Federal Reserve has raised the rates twice in 2017 – in March and June. This will definitely hurt the utilities. The Fed has maintained its forecast for one more rate hike in 2017.With the rising interest rates, the stable, regular dividend payer utilities will face strong competition from bonds as these provide higher returns, which will make them a more attractive option for the investors.The U.S. coal-based utilities got a respite with President Trump’s decision to repeal the Climate Power Plan. Moreover, Trump has walked out of the Paris Climate Agreement.    Four out of the 16 sectors in the Zacks coverage universe are expected to witness an earnings decline this season.

288,CMS,"CMS Energy Corporation (CMS  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 28, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted an earnings surprise of 9.23%. Notably, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 13.62%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCMS Energy’s regulated electric power operations in Michigan generate a relatively stable and growing earnings stream. Of late, the company has been strongly engaged in reducing its operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, which, in turn, will fund capital investments.In fact, the company has been able to cut down O&M costs by more than 3% for each of the last three years. It cut down costs by an impressive 6.5% last year, much better than the initial expectation. We anticipate similar cost reductions in the company’s upcoming second-quarter results.Furthermore, improvement has been witnessed in CMS Energy’s latest initiative, the Consumers Energy Way. The strategy focuses on bettering customer experience by offering prompt services at low costs. As of the end of the first quarter, it has saved more than $0.5 billion for the company. We expect to get further updates on this project’s improvements, once the second-quarter results release.Weather continues to play an important role in the company’s to-be-reported quarter. CMS Energy’s service territories have witnessed above-average temperatures during the second quarter. This will result in lower household expenditure on heating, which might adversely impact revenues.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is 42 cents, reflecting a decline of 7.22%, on revenues of $1.36 billion, which implies a 1.13 % decrease year over year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CMS Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CMS Energy has an Earnings ESP of -4.76%.
