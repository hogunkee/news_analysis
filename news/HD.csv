4,HD,"Apple (AAPL) sold off badly Friday and touched its 200-day moving average for the first time since mid-February. Stock market bears also sent the major indexes tripping below their 50-day moving averages Friday for the first time in four to five weeks.The Nasdaq composite slid 1.3%, the S&P 500 nearly 0.9% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.8%.Yet  the major indexes still managed to march higher for a second week in a row in the wake of a key follow-through that took place April 10.Square (SQ), meanwhile, offered fresh proof that it remains a true market leader. Shares ran up more than 1.6% to 51.46, stretching a year-to-date advance to more than 48%. Square was a huge winner in 2017 as well.In addition to Square, TransUnion (TRU), Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) all showed bullish action, blasting gains of 2% to 10% or more.Schwab continues to work on a new base, while eTrade is now extended after recently retaking a 56.10 entry point in a six-week cup without handle.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond continued to soar, rising to as high as 2.94% and practically eclipsing the Feb. 21 year-to-date high. Higher interest rates help boost net interest profit margins for banks and other financial firms.Square, the San Francisco-based digital transactions and business analytics innovator, rose 1.6%, climbing as high as 52.50 in below average turnover. The large-cap tech is likely in the middle of forming a new base on base.Wall Street sees the Jack Dorsey-led tech firm growing its full-year profit by 70% to 46 cents a share this year and another 65% in 2019.Square has ramped 182% higher since it cleared a tightly wound flat base with an 18.27 buy point in April 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base-on-base pattern can be an awesome generator of price gains, but only when selling pressure in the overall market eases and the stock market is in a confirmed uptrend. The April 10 follow-through improved the stock market's outlook in raising it from ""Market in correction"" to ""Confirmed uptrend.""Square shows an excellent Composite Rating of 96 on a scale of 1 to 99 on IBD Stock Checkup.The Nasdaq composite sank nearly 0.5% at the get-go, then stretched losses to more than 1.3%, following a 2.8% rally last week. Volume was lower from Thursday's level, according to preliminary data. At 7138, the leading index still clung to a weekly gain of roughly 0.5% and is up 3.4% since Jan. 1.So the tech-centered index was still up for the week, but closed below the key 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq 100-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF fell 1.6%. It too slipped mildly beneath the 50-day moving average for the first time in nearly four weeks.Hand tools, shoes, paper, and numerous defensive industry groups paced the downside.The S&P 500 saw its weekly gain slim down to 0.5%. In the prior week, the large-cap benchmark rallied 2%.Turnover climbed roughly 14% higher vs. the same time on Thursday on the NYSE. Overall, though, trading volume has been holding below the 50-day average on the Nasdaq for at least two straight weeks. On the NYSE, trading has been muted for nearly three weeks in a row.Typically, the best follow-throughs, which give alert investors a chance to hunt for breakouts among leadership-quality stocks in terms of excellent fundamentals, relative stock price strength, and fund sponsorship, take place on Day 4 through Day 7 of a new rally attempt. But they can also occur much later than that.Home Depot (HD) was the sole stock among the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average to initially gain 1 point or more. Shares retreated just a fraction to 177.01. Volume was 10% below usual levels.Home Depot, the DIY home improvement chain, has been in correction mode since striking a new high of 207.61 on Jan. 29. That peak came right before the first of this year's intermediate market corrections. The stock hasn't fallen much, though, losing just 18% of its market value. That's well within range of a normal decline within, say, a cup with handle base or a saucer base chart pattern, which is common among Dow industrials-type issues.Home Depot has pounded out steady if not rip-roaring profit growth. Earnings per share have lifted 24%, 15%, 18%, 23%, 16%, 14%, 15% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters. The Street sees fiscal Q1 profit rising 24% to $2.07 a share.Consumer tech titan Apple gapped below its 50-day moving average. That's a sign of weakness for the iPhone and iPad giant. The stock fell more than 4% and hit an intraday low of 165.43 in intense turnover.Apple is now tickling its long-term 200-day moving average and is trading around 9% below an all-time high of 183.50.Apple has already rallied 55% since it burst out of a cup with handle at 118.12 way back on Jan. 6, 2017. So it's due for a rest, but keep watch for a base to complete itself.As noted in a new Click tech blog post, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty trimmed her price target on the consumer electronics and digital services firm to 200 from 203, citing concerns on iPhone sales. However, Huberty also reportedly advised clients to buy shares on any price weakness after Apple reports its fiscal Q2 sales (for the March-ended quarter) on May 2 after the close.A 3-point slice of the price target does not amount to much in terms of market value. At 166, the stock's market value is $841 billion. Apple has 5.07 billion shares outstanding.Google operator Alphabet (GOOGL) lost just 1.1% to 1,077.32 in weak turnover and still managed to post a stout weekly gain of nearly 4%. Watch to see if it holds above the 50-day moving average, painted in red on IBD daily charts.The megacap tech may be forming a new double bottom base. The middle peak between the stock's first and second lows is 1,178.16. If the stock can continue rebounding, it could set up a potential breakout at 1,178.26, 10 cents above the middle peak.Alphabet is expected to increase first-quarter profit 20% to $9.29 a share. That follows EPS gains of 7%, 28%, 27%, 32% and 28% in the prior five quarters.Among the 11 names currently in Leaderboard, new entrant Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) cooled off a second straight day in normal fashion. The big cap medical play remains in buy range from a 445.20 entry in a shallow cup with handle. Shares eased 1.4% to 456.27 in above-average volume.Going back to TransUnion, the credit-reporting agency and financial data expert has held a spot on the Leaderboard watch list for more than two weeks. On Friday, the stock gapped up at the open and jumped 10%. Shares got as high as 67.32, easily surpassing a 59.72 buy point in a shallow cup with handle.The base is better viewed as a flat base with an entry at 61.52, 10 cents above the left-side high. In this case, TransUnion was within proper buy range right at the open price of 64.03, 4% above the flat-base entry.The expert in consumer financial data posted a 36% jump in first-quarter earnings to 57 cents a share, spanking the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate by nearly 10% and issuing the biggest year-over-year increase in five quarters. Revenue grew 18% to $537 million, marking a third quarter in a row of accelerating top-line growth. TransUnion also announced the acquisition of U.K.-based Callcredit.Skechers (SKX) got body slammed, gapping down more than 27% and finishing the session at 30.70. That sell-off wiped out five months' worth of gains.Volume soared past 27 million shares, more than one quarter of its total float of 94 million shares. The stock's 50-day average turnover is 2.4 million shares per day.The company reported a 13% rise in Q1 earnings to 68 cents a share, sharply undercutting Wall Street's expectations. Sales rose 17%, easing from a 27% Q4 top-line increase, but moving at a faster pace than the year-ago quarter's weak 10% rise.Net margin edged 20 basis points lower to 8.6%. This decline suggests the shoe giant felt price pressures from the competition or saw its costs climb.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on leading growth stocks, buy points, sell signals and financial markets.)RELATED:Which Stocks Are Moving Sharply Right Now And Triggering Buy, Sell Signals?How Can You Find Out Which Stocks Are New In IBD's Top Screens?

11,HD,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts. Trendy apparel and handbag retailer Michael Kors (KORS) — along with Dollar General (DG) and Home Depot (HD) — is also in sight of an entry area. But none of these top stocks cleared buy points in Monday's stock market trading.Cactus (WHD) stock shot up 4.5% to 35.60 on Monday, clearing a 35.28 cup-with-handle buy point. But the maker of wellhead and pressure-control equipment tumbled late on plans for a follow-on offering. Cactus came public at 19 a share in early February.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The Dow Jones industrial average, up 1.3%, outpaced the 0.9% gains for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite.Within the Dow Jones, the big winners were Caterpillar, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, up 4.1%, 3.1% and 2.7% respectively. But Caterpillar stock is still below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. So are JPMorgan stock and Goldman stock, after both hit 2018 lows last week.Huya stock, a recent spinoff from YY (YY), shot up 18% Monday.

Oil traders are speculating that member nations of the OPEC cartel may decide to extend production cuts at its Vienna meeting slated for June 22.China's Autohome (ATHM) moved past a 107.64 buy point in fierce turnover while Analog Devices (ADI) and Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) rallied past new buy points at 96.95 and 111.51, respectively. But only Autohome showed continued strength as the latter two retreated a bit.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is acting just fine despite moving sideways for a third straight week. At 187.56, the iPhone giant stands 4.7% above its latest proper entry point of 179.04, or still within the 5% proper buy zone.That 179.04 entry is 10 cents above the middle peak within a seven-week double-bottom base.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

They included Chevron (CVX), Home Depot (HD), 3M (MMM) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Small caps did a bit better.

The big drop in China stock markets appears to reflect growing apprehension over President Trump's decision earlier this week to go ahead with tariffs on certain Chinese imports.Investors will be watching to see how Chinese President Xi Jingping and other economic leaders will handle the current dispute over the massive trade deficit between the two largest economies of the world.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slumped 1.4% to 30,056, hitting a three-week low. The Hang Seng has let an 11.9% year-to-date gain shrivel to less than 0.5%.Despite the decline in Chinese mainland equities, Autohome, a member of IBD Leaderboard since Jan. 2 this year, scored a new breakout from a rare pattern called the ascending base. In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period. The stock must make a new high before each correction; hence, it's an ""ascending base.""Autohome focuses on advertising and marketing of automobiles through its website. The company's earnings have grown 28%, 15%, 39%, 58%, 82% and 53% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Analysts see Q2 earnings rising 23% to 87 cents a share.On Jan. 2, Autohome had initially cleared a 17-week base that shows elements of a double bottom. This base gave a 67.79 standard buy point.A narrow five-day handle formed on the tail end of the base. That provided a slightly lower buy point of 65.67, a dime above the handle's high. That handle began forming on Dec. 22 last year and the resulting lower entry is very close to the 66.55 ""alternative entry point"" created by the middle interim peak wedged in between the two sell-offs within the base.Check out this recent Investor's Corner column on how a chart pattern can lead to more than one correct interpretation of the stock's current balance of supply (AKA sellers) vs. demand (buyers) and the proper time to buy.On the Leaderboard daily and weekly charts, users can see chart annotations placed in real time on specific buy points, including bases and follow-on entry points.Elsewhere, software sector leader Salesforce.com (CRM) rallied as much as 4.4% and struck a new high of 132.55 before pulling back and giving up nearly half of that impressive gain. The cloud-based business software giant remains in buy range after clearing a 128.97 breakout point in a seven-week cup without handle, a variation on the cup-with-handle base, a bullish chart pattern.IBD's Medical-Products group recently bumped the enterprise software industry group off the No. 1 rung among 197 industry groups ranked each day by Investor's Business Daily.

See the entire 33 sectors ranked in IBD's Nasdaq + NYSE stock tables by going to ""Stock Lists"" on the homepage of Investors.com, then clicking on IBD Data Tables.HDFC Bank (HDB) rallied more than 8% to as high as 105 in volume running more than double usual levels. HDFC's 50-day average turnover is a healthy 826,000 shares per day. That big advance instantly gave the Indian lender much needed progress in creating the right side of what currently looks like a cup base.Notice on a daily chart how much of the current base in HDFC has formed beneath the 50-day moving average. A no-no.Consumer spending-linked names continued to fare well. Shake Shack (SHAK), a new idea on IBD SwingTrader, surged more than 5% and at one point reached as high as 62.54 in volume that is running nearly triple its normal pace.The burger and shake chain broke out of a well-formed first-stage cup with handle at 44.50 on April 26. Volume came in just 13% above the 50-day average on that session.However, Shake Shack saw a 69% boost in volume vs. normal levels the very next session as shares rose another 4.1% to 47.26, quickly exiting the permissible 5% buy zone.On May 4, the New York-based chain roared more than 18% higher after reporting a first-quarter adjusted profit of 15 cents a share, up 50% as sales jumped 29% to $99.1 million, a quarterly record.Net margin improved 90 basis points to 5.7%.Shake Shack now gets a top-flight 93 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. That ranks it No. 1 within the Retail-Restaurants industry group. The SMR Rating, which analyzes a company's sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity, has improved to an A on a scale of A (excellent) to E (rotten).Going back to Apple, new reports have noted that some analysts express concern over whether the company's services segment will keep both the top and bottom lines increasing at a fast rate.Apple, however, still shows strong growth prospects.The Street sees earnings in the June-ending fiscal third quarter rising 31% to $2.18 a share on a 15% pickup in revenue to $52.26 billion. That would mark the fourth quarter in a row of low double-digit top-line gains. Sales jumped 5%, 7%, 12%, 13% and 16% in the prior five quarters.Apple has climbed 61% since it initially broke out of a first stage base on Jan. 6, 2017. The move past a 118.12 buy point in a cup with handle marked an emerging change in the stock's character.In other financial markets, the U.S. Treasury bonds saw a rebound in yields as investors sold. Reuters reported that two key political parties in Italy will work on forming a new government and avoid a new national election.Stocks across the world sold off on concerns that a major change in political leadership in the No. 3 eurozone economy could put Europe's main single currency system at risk.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose to 2.85% after swooning to as low as 2.75% on Tuesday.According to the CME Group, fed funds futures now see only a 25% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise the short-term cost of money four times this year. In March, the U.S. central bank hiked the Fed funds rate by a quarter point to a range of 1.5%-1.75%.Bond traders expect the Fed to bump the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points again in June and in September.

42,HD,"The stock market was sharply lower Tuesday afternoon after Monday's stalling session for the S&P 500. Negative sentiment was fueled by a sales miss at Dow component Home Depot (HD) as well as a big jump in the 10-year yield. It was up 9 basis points to 3.09%, the highest level since 2011.The 10-year yield strengthened after the release of April retail sales data. Overall, sales rose 0.3%, in line with expectations. But Wall Street focused on an upward revision to March sales, which led some to believe the Federal Reserve might to be more aggressive with rate hikes between now and the end of the year.The Nasdaq composite lost 1%, weighed down by weakness in Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA). The Dow Jones fell 0.9%, hurt by weakness in Intel (INTC). The S&P 500 gave back 0.8%.

43,HD,"The Dow Jones industrial average stood head and shoulders above other key indexes at midday on Thursday, even after a mild pullback in early-afternoon trade.At 1:15 p.m. ET, the Dow gained 0.7% after rising more than 1% thanks to early two-point gains from at least 10 of the Dow's 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and McDonald's (MCD).Home Depot and McDonald's are in base-building phase, and a well-built base could give investors a chance to buy at a key moment of market strength.Low weekly jobless claims helped sustain confidence in the U.S. economy, and comments by White House economic advisor Peter Navarro, broadcast on CNBC, apparently helped relieve anxiety over the potential for a major trade war.Bullishness among market pundits polled each week by Investors Intelligence, meanwhile, jumped this week to 54.9%, but optimism is not excessive. In mid-January, ahead of the early-February market sell-off, the bulls ratio reached as high as 66.7%.The Nasdaq composite erased an early-morning loss of 0.3% to turn more than 0.2% higher before slumping to the breakeven point. Overall, the intraday swing is light, though. The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1%. Discount and variety retail, hospital, mining equipment, ethical drug and truck transport firms paced the upside. Volume is running slightly lower vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.The Dow transports is now up just 0.4% after being up as much as 0.7%.Despite the indexes' gains, breadth was slightly dour. Falling stocks beat gainers by more than 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and by fewer than 200 issues on the Nasdaq.Home Depot is trying to bottom out after falling more than 15% below a 207.60 all-time high. The do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me home improvement products chain had rallied 28% following a September breakout from a solid flat base with a 160.96 buy point.Home Depot sports a decent 87 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, boosted by a strong 92 EPS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99.McDonald's, which has dropped 18% from its all-time peak of 178.70, rallied nearly 2% and is trying to regain its critical 200-day moving average. The fast-food chain's 50-day line has been sloping lower for more than five weeks, a negative sign.When high-quality stocks rally 20% to 25% from a proper buy point, it's an excellent idea in terms of portfolio management rules to take at least partial profits. IBD research has found that many leading stocks will top out and begin a serious correction after rising 20% to 40% past a breakout point.Software remains an important growth theme in the stock market today. While Palo Alto Networks (PANW), a big stock market winner in 2015-16 and former Leaderboard stock, has shown renewed strength, its group peer VeriSign (VRSN) is also acting well.The former is aiming for a 14th gain in 15 sessions; at 189.30, the large-cap network security leader has risen nearly 21% from a base breakout at 156.95. The latter rose nearly 2% to 125.35 in volume running double its usual levels and has climbed nearly 6% past a 118.38 entry in an 11-week flat base.Four highly dynamic and fast-growing companies in the business software space maintain a position currently within Leaderboard.The Dow transports rallied 0.3% as Covenant Transport (CVTI) launched a breakout, gapping up at the open and rising nearly 18% to 32 in huge turnover. That move catapulted the trucking services firm past a 30.71 proper buy point in a five-month base.The 5% buy zone extends up to 32.24. Buying more than 5% past a proper buy point can hand a new investor the added risk of being shuffled out of the stock with a fast loss of 7%-8% during a normal pullback to or even slightly below the breakout price.The golden rule of investing is to cut losses short, even if a stock has a history of outperforming. You don't want to get caught with a stock that has finally topped after a huge price run.IBD's research on big stock market winners over the past century has found that when a true market leader breaks out, it rarely falls 7% to 8% below the correct buy point. But after a 10% or 15% move up or more, it's not uncommon for the stock to dip back and test holders' resolve. So if an investorThe base built by Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Covenant doesn't have the look of a well-formed cup-with-handle or a double-bottom, but the months long base was built on top of an even longer, deeper consolidation. The chart has elements of base on base patterns, which can be very bullish.The company has notched earnings gains of 56% and 52% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters as revenue rose 9% and 6%.

But their recent breakouts all came in lackluster volume, suggesting a lack of conviction by mutual funds and other institutional buyers. Splunk's breakout came on volume that was 11% above normal, but investors should look for at least a 40%-50% increase.When market elephants load up on a stock, they may do so over an extended period, propelling the share price.

Nordstrom delivered surprise earnings growth and lifted the bottom end of EPS guidance, but quarterly sales matched views and comps fell short.The home-improvement retailer beat first-quarter earnings estimates, but revenue and same-store sales came up short, as a cold spring season kept people from buying gardening and other outdoor supplies. Home Depot first held to its full-year financial outlook, citing ""a favorable housing and macroeconomic backdrop.""

Credit Suisse analysts also expected a rebound for Home Depot in the second quarter, but said ""we expect that the near-term direction of the stock to be dictated by weather in the coming weeks.""Retail sales data for April showed that the consumer soft patch to start the year has given way to strength, likely helped by delayed tax refunds.

In addition to lowering the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, the tax overhaul also made it cheaper to bring profits made overseas back to the U.S.Morgan Stanley said in November that Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), General Electric (GE), Pfizer (PFE) and IBM (IBM) have the most ""accumulated foreign earnings.""Meanwhile, dividends were already looking strong.

No company has cut its dividend, marking the first Q1 with no decreases since at least 2003.Among all the companies that S&P Dow Jones Indices tracks, 948 companies made positive dividend moves in Q1, and 167 made negative ones, representing a collective net payout increase of $18.8 billion, a record high.""Dividends are typically event driven,"" Silverblatt told IBD last month. ""... And we don't have that many negative events here.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

52,HD,"Two top stocks with very different characteristics and companies are preparing to report results early Thursday. Abiomed (ABMD) reports its fiscal fourth quarter results. Floor & Decor (FND) turns in first-quarter numbers.One trait the two top stocks do share: both are listed on IBD's Stock Spotlight stock screen. Another important factor: analysts expect both to generate EPS growth greater than 60%, while sales growth is forecast to be above 30%.For Abiomed, its 60% EPS growth target would mark a sharp downshift after two quarters of triple-digit earnings gains. Its track record with topping estimates is uneven. In its fiscal first and second quarters, it beat analyst targets by 95% and 42%, respectively. In the third quarter, earnings were shy of expectations by 43%.The Danvers, Mass.-based company has a market capitalization of $13.6 billion, while generating revenue of $445 million in fiscal 2017. The consensus estimate is for a 31% revenue increase this year to $584 million, with earnings rising 85%.Abiomed produces small pumps that are inserted using a catheter through an artery in the leg and into the heart. Sold under the Impella name, they supplement and increase the pumping power of the heart. It markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In October, Abiomed announced its first Impella recipient in Japan. But the company reported that sales outside the U.S. accounted for less than 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn terms of stock action, shares Tuesday were up 63% since the start of the year. In addition, the stock was in a buy range above a 304.38 buy point in a flat base. The base is very late stage. That means the current breakout comes with a high risk of failure. The good news: The stock only needs to pullback about 11% in order to undercut the current base pattern and reset its base count.Among top stocks, Floor & Decor is considered a smaller midcap, with a market capitalization of $5.3 billion. It generated revenue of $1.39 billion in 2017. The company distributes wood and tile flooring through a network of 83 warehouse-type locations scattered over 21 states. Competitor Lumber Liquidator's (LL) stores are relatively small, and tucked into mini-mall-type locations. By contrast, Floor & Decor stores average around 73,000 square feet. Home Depot (HD) stores, for comparison's sake, average about 105,000 square feet.Analyst consensus places the Smyrna, Ga., company's first quarter EPS growth at 64%, with a 30% advance in revenue. The first quarter is seasonally a strong period for the company, and the consensus estimate is below last year's first-quarter gain of 75%.The revenue forecast is just below Floor & Decor's average sales gain of 30% over the past three quarters. The company has topped analyst expectations over the past four quarters by margins of anywhere from 5% to 30%. For the year, analysts see EPS rising 39% on a 25% sales gain.Floor & Decor is a young stock, public only since April 2017. Unlike Abiomed's tight-trading shares, the IPO swings wide and loose on a regular basis. It was up only 11% for the year Tuesday, but trading 163% above its year-ago IPO price.Shares are currently extended, 7% above a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup base. It's four weeks into a 14% deep consolidation.RELATED:Permian Basin Oil Stocks: These 2 Face High Expectations This WeekThe Market Trend: Keep Tabs On Market Indicators and StatusMajor Stock Indexes Reverse Lower, Techs Hit As Attention Shifts To FedTesla, Mastercard, Square, Fed Lead Investing Action Plan Nvidia, Apple: How To Avoid Getting Chopped Up In A Choppy Market Stocks Near Lows In Afternoon Trade; This Top Chip Stock Bucks Dow's Sell-Off

54,HD,"It's easy to say it's always best to be honest. But sometimes it takes guts to be a straight shooter with someone and to show you're vulnerable.Here's how to gather that fortitude to effectively lead your group.Tell the truth. Start with the basics. Honesty really is the best policy, even if it's easier to tell a white lie than to confront someone with the bad news that they're not performing well enough.""If you're not honest, sooner or later it will catch up with you and then it interferes with building trust,"" said Linda Finkle, founder and CEO of Washington, D.C.-based business coaching and consulting firm Incedo Group.Admit mistakes.Famed investor Warren Buffett wins trust because he's open about his missteps, says Constance Dierickx, Atlanta-based advisor to boards and senior executives and author of ""High-Stakes Leadership."" Each year, Buffett summarizes where he and his firm went wrong with their investments. Dierickx at times calls back clients a day or two after giving them advice and tells them after thinking about it further she has a different recommendation.""People will know you're honest and they can trust you,"" Dierickx told IBD.Help others. Finkle once had to let someone go for performance reasons. Years later the woman thanked Finkle, saying it showed her where she needed to improve.""If our goal as a leader is to be in service to people, then it's important to tell the truth, whether it's something the person wants to hear or not,"" Finkle said.Seek support.When you're breaking bad news to people, you have to muster the guts to tell them. But don't feel as if you have to go it alone. Dierickx says she'll often advise clients to go public about a problem even if their lawyers tell them to do the opposite. They're usually better off being open about it. Home Depot (HD) CEO Frank Blake was upfront in 2014 when a data breach exposed more than 50 million payment cards. He admitted the problem, said customers wouldn't be harmed, devoted resources to the matter and published a letter of apology.""Companies have to protect their image, but it has to be subordinate to being honest,"" Dierickx said.Develop fortitude. Dierickx says you can build up your ability to steel yourself and deliver bad news. She views it as a combination of vision and mission to show your belief in what you're doing. Toss in persistence, and the combination will get you to face the toughest conversations. Your character is the great multiplier.""If you don't have character, the other stuff doesn't make any difference,"" Dierickx said.Get advice. Some people don't know how to have brutally honest conversations. Ask others how to handle it.""It doesn't make you less of a leader because you need to ask for help,"" Finkle said. ""Even Olympic athletes have coaches.""Be open. If you're uncomfortable with the discussion, tell the person you're talking to that you might not be the best at this. Then work your way through it. It'll get easier.""Talk about it in a way that's not self-deprecating, but is aimed at, 'How can I get better?' "" Finkle said.Keep improving. Others will trust you if you don't appear to be a know-it-all. Show people you're always learning. Dierickx once worked at a company that had a ""belly flop"" award. People talked in a meeting about something that went off the rails and what they learned from it.""I have more credibility if I show that I'm learning,"" Dierickx said.Stay true to yourself. The key to breaking bad news is to be genuine, Finkle says. If the company has to lay off a batch of people, admit it's painful rather than putting up a false front.""People respond to genuine humanness,"" Finkle said. ""If you're not yourself, people respond to that more negatively than anything.""

Chipotle soared 24% in big volume and took a big step in building a new base that serves as a bottoming base. The burrito and taco chain is now just 15% below a 52-week high of 499.Domino's gapped up and rose 7% to 250.61 in nearly double average turnover on better than expected results.Four names within IBD's restaurant industry group show a Composite Rating of 90 or higher, including Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) and Darden Restaurants (DRI), operator of the Olive Garden, Longhorn and Capital Grille chains.Chipotle, which recently hired a new CEO, notched a 33% pickup in adjusted Q1 earnings to $2.13 a share as sales were 7% higher.Domino's stretched its rally past a large double bottom base, with a 211.85 buy point, to nearly 19% after the global pizza chain notched a 59% rise in Q1 earnings to $2 a share. After-tax margin bulged 130 basis points higher to 11.3%.Sales jumped 26% to $785.4 million, the strongest year-over-year gain in more than five years. Domino's had grown sales 16%, 15%, 14% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) slipped more than 1% to 70.24 but the decline is creating little damage to the integrated oil and gas giant's recent work on a new cup pattern. The global oil and gas firm reported a 40% gain in Q1 profit to $1.27 a share on a 24% increase in revenue to $89.24 billion.Marathon Oil (MRO), Cheniere Energy (LNG) and EOG Resources (EOG) are also forming new bases.

The stock is building a new base, which could set up a fresh breakout to new highs and significant price gains for investors seeking to perfect their market timing.Institutions are rushing back into the megacap internet content play after the Menlo Park, Calif., firm posted strong earnings (up 63% to $1.69 a share) and revenue (up 49% to $11.97 billion) growth after the close on Wednesday.The social media network's after-tax margin leaped 360 basis points to 41.7%, likely the highest for any first quarter since the company went public in May 2012.Those who wish to buy Facebook shares at the right time may want to first see if it can hold the bullish price gap created Thursday. Facebook's intraday low of 170.80 is above the previous session's high of 161.06, thus producing the bullish price gap.On March 19 and 20, Facebook shares dropped hard, taking out the Feb. 9 near-term low of 167.18. A few weeks later, the stock got as low as 149.02. This big undercut of the first low means that a double bottom base could be in the works. If that's the case, the emerging buy point would be 10 cents above the middle peak in between the first and second low, or 186.20.Alphabet (GOOGL) was initially up the least among the five FAANG stocks, just 0.4% at the start, but are now outperforming the Nasdaq, up 2.4%.

69,HD,"Home Depot (HD) beat fourth-quarter forecasts Tuesday, and management predicted recent tax cuts will fuel continued growth in the housing sector even as mortgage rates climb.X  The home improvement retailer's adjusted earnings per share advanced 17% to $1.69 as sales climbed 7.5% to $23.88 billion. Wall Street had expected EPS of $1.62 on revenue of $23.67 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales were up 7.5% overall, with U.S. comps up 7.2%. Analysts saw a 6.5% gain overall and a 6.2% U.S. bump, according to Consensus Metrix.Home Depot's management was confident the housing sector will not be adversely affected going forward by interest rate rises or the reduction in the home interest rate deduction cap, which they said only impacts around 5% of homes. New York and California will be impacted more, however.""Eighty percent of US households have more money due to tax reform and the increase to the standard deduction,"" CFO Carol Tome said on a conference call. ""Corporations are taking cash and investing in people. Those two things offset any negatives.""She also said the firm believes interest rates would have to advance to 7% to adversely affect growth, while they currently sit at 4.2% for a 30-year mortgage. High-end estimates see this increasing to 4.6%. Tome also said the affordability index is still ""very good"" at 155%.Home Depot expects to earn $9.31 this fiscal year with sales growth of 6.5% and comps up 5%. The firm also raised its quarterly dividend by 16% to $1.03 a share, while projecting a share buyback scheme of $4 billion, though this may change as the year progresses. The firm has typically exceeded initial buyback projections by a wide margin in the past.Shares of the Dow Jones industrial average component dipped 0.1% to 186.71 after hitting 191.44 intraday on the stock market today. Home Depot had been making steady gains since coming out of a flat base last September. However it crashed through its 50-day moving average on Feb. 2 and has been struggling to regain momentum.Rival Lowe's (LOW) fell 0.7%. Lowe's, which will report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28, has been finding support at its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Home Depot executives were also pleased with performance in the Pro segment, which serves contractors, painters and electricians, and predicted continued growth as homeowners take on bigger projects due to the feel-good factor over rising house prices. Pro growth actually outperformed the DIY segment.The cold winter is expected to lead to strong spring sales as customers look to replenish their gardens, while extra sales due to the 2017 hurricanes are expected to add revenue for the first half of the year.Management said Home Depot's effective tax rate is now approximately 26%, and that it expects to invest $2.5 billion into the business to support strategic initiatives. Over the next three years it expects to nearly double its investment into the business.Tome said the company will be using its extra cash to pull forward investments, which will be  focused on personnel in the short term. She added that systems-based investments take more time to plan and implement. In addition, Home Depot will be opening three new stores in 2018.Management, however, did not address earlier reports that said Home Depot was considering acquiring XPO Logistics (XPO), a logistics services company, due in part to concern that Amazon (AMZN) will push further into home improvement supplies.Analysts were bullish on Home Depot after its results. Oppenheimer's Brian Nagel expects the stock to outperform the S&P 500 over the next 12 to 18 months.""We look favorably upon prospects for Home Depot and its shares. The company is managing its operations well. CEO Craig Menear and his team remain committed to stringent cost controls and cash discipline,"" he said in a research note. ""We view HD as well positioned to capitalize upon improving demand trends in the home improvement sector and over time to surprise investors with solid and persistent comp and EPS upside.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli expects Home Depot to outpace its forecasts and sees its accelerated investments helping the company to gain market share.And CFRA analyst Victor Ahluwalia raised the stock's status to buy from hold following the results, raising the price target by $38 to $209.""We see HD benefiting from additional home price appreciation and greater consumer demand in 2018, amid gains from tax reform,"" Ahluwalia said in a research note.While investors need to watch housing metrics closely, he believes the home improvement industry should remain strong.Recent data have indicated demand is being helped by millennials finally shifting to homeownership and away from rentals, while confidence among builders remains high. Housing starts also surged in January with permits hitting the highest level since 2007.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Walmart Holiday Earnings Miss, Sales Top Amid Fight With AmazonHome Depot Follows BofA, Mastercard In Announcing Share BuybacksHomebuilder Stocks To Watch And Housing Market NewsBullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

74,HD,"The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite all fell last week and are selling off sharply Monday. That has hit a number of top stocks. But the stock market action also has helped a number of notable stocks form handles and new buy points. Tesla (TSLA) stock formed a handle Monday with a new, lower entry. Home Depot (HD) stock and Arista Networks (ANET) stock just forged handles last week, but Arista tumbled Monday. FMC (FMC) stock has had a handle for weeks.XA handle occurs in the upper half of a consolidation. The stock price should be flat to downward sloping, ideally on light and declining volume. It should be a minimum of five days but can be for several weeks.Simply put, a handle helps shake out weak holders just before a stock is ready to break out. That way, when a stock surges higher in strong volume, everyone who owns a position is happy. Mutual funds and other big institutions seeking to add shares must bid up the price to do so.Shares faced resistance around 360 several times in a consolidation going back to last September. Tesla stock broke through decisively on Monday, hitting a nine-month high of 373.73. But then it tumbled to 333.63 by Friday, down 4% that day and nearly 7% for the week. If Tesla stock stays in its current pattern through Monday, it'll have a proper handle and a 373.83 buy point.Tesla stock fell 0.2% to 333.01 on Monday, faring far better than the S&P 500 and especially the Nasdaq.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is off its March lows but hasn't made much progress since the end of October. Tesla's RS line is well below its June 23 peak.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTesla stock's recent run came as Elon Musk said it was ""very likely"" that Model 3 production would finally hit 5,000 a week by the end of June, a critical step as Tesla runs low on cash. He also expected the electric vehicle maker to turn a profit in Q3.The company will release Q2 production and delivery figures in the first week of July. It's unclear if it'll provide any specifics about end-of-June output. Still, if Tesla breaks out soon, it's akin to a stock moving into buy range just before earnings, with the potential for big price gains or losses So potential investors may want to consider an earnings option strategy.The Dow Jones home improvement giant has now formed a handle in its cup base, giving it a 201.70 buy point. Home Depot stock fell 1.45% to 197.41 on Friday. The RS line is just below a new high even though Home Depot stock still has a ways to go before hitting the Jan. 26 peak of 207.60.Home Depot dipped 0.5% to 196.38 Monday.As of Friday, the networking firm had formed a 287.10 handle in a consolidation going back to mid-February. But on Monday, Arista stock fell 4.7% to 259.87, below its 50-day line. Worse, midpoint of the handle is now below the midpoint of the base. That means it's no longer a proper handle, invalidating the 287.10 entry. The buy point, for now, goes back to 311.77, just above the top of the base.Arista went on a powerful run in 2017, with tight consolidations along the way. In 2018, its consolidations have been somewhat messy, which is less promising. That may reflect the overall choppy market, but that in itself has made breakouts more prone to failure and shakeouts.The chemicals maker has been basing for nearly six months, with its handle forming since late May. FMC stock has a 93.05 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares found support in the handle at the 50-day. FMC stock rose 2.7% to 88.94 on Friday, rebounding from the 50-day line and reclaiming the 200-day line.FMC sank 0.6% to 88.40 Monday.One big negative is FMC's RS line. It's been slumping since October and is well below where it was in early January at the left side of the consolidation.Investors should generally look for stocks that are truly leading the market. At the very least, investors should look for a powerful FMC breakout that pushes the RS line above the high of its handle.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These Five 99 Composite Rating Stocks Are In, Near Buy ZonesIf You Want To Buy More Apple Or Nvidia Shares, Read ThisThe Big Picture: Is The Selling In Leading Growth Stocks An Ominous Sign?How To Trade Stocks: Spot Traits Of Proper Handles In Good BasesThree Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals; China Plays Keep Tumbling

But the yogawear apparel leader remains more than 4% above a buy point near 84.The stock has advanced more than 38% since it cleared a bottoming base pattern at 64.91 in November.That bottoming base also served as a first-stage pattern. First- and second-stage bases tend to carry higher probabilities of success following a breakout from those bases.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseJust two of the Dow industrials' 30 components, industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), sank 1 point or more as investors fretted over China's expansion of retaliatory tariffs to cover more agricultural and manufactured goods.Caterpillar, off 1% to 143.64, is still holding above the 200-day moving average but is now around 17% below an all-time high of 173.24. Watch to see if the construction and mining gear titan can bottom out and begin to form the right side of a potential new base.A properly formed base sets up a market-leading stock in a position to possibly break out to new highs and stage a solid run. But today, IBD's current outlook for U.S. equities remains ""Market in correction,"" so breakouts are understandably few in number.Floor & Decor (FND) is one of the rare big movers today, rising more than 5% to 55.06 in heavy volume.The flooring products retailer, which imitates Home Depot's large warehouse-style model, is now extended more than 5% past a 51.58 buy point in an eight-week cup-style base. It's best to buy a stock no more than 5% past the proper buy point; buying too high in price can subject an investor to a quick loss if the stock makes a temporary pullback to or even mildly below the breakout entry.Floor & Decor, now a mid-cap stock with a market value of $5.3 billion, went public in April 2017 at 21 a share. It has a float of 84 million shares and currently ranks No. 22 within the IBD 50. The company has grown earnings per share 9%, 75%, 47%, 31% and 58% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Sales jumped 25%, 31%, 29%, 27% and 40% over the same time frame.Going back to Tesla, the San Francisco-based firm still trades well below its 52-week peak of 389.61. Plus, the electric vehicle pioneer trades sharply below its 50- and 200-day moving averages. So the stock is nowhere close to a new IBD-style buy point.However, those who bought at the initial April 2013 breakout near 40 still hold a fantastic long-term gain.At this point, it makes sense to wait and watch for the possibility of heavy institutional buying to return. Trading near 280, Tesla is still an institutional favorite. The stock reached a total 1,000 mutual fund and hedge fund holders for the first time during the second quarter of 2016.That sponsorship has grown a bit more to 1,027 funds as of the first quarter of this year. In Q3 of 2017, that number reached 1,095 funds owning a total 54.4 million shares. Earlier this week, Tesla reported confidence in its goal to reach a significantly higher production rate of its Model 3 sedan within the next three months and said it has no plans to raise more capital via debt or equity offerings this year.The company said it built 2,020 Model 3 sedans in the final seven days of March and expects to see that run rate climb rapidly through the second quarter of this year.Tesla is racing to meet the mountain of 500,000 preorders made for the affordable all-electric four-door vehicle. The base price of the Model 3 is $35,000, but many new buyers are likely to add options.Elsewhere, homebuilding-related stocks advanced sharply following a blistering quarterly report from giant Lennar (LEN). The stock rose more than 8% to 61.97 and leapt back above the 50-day moving average for the first time in more than eight weeks.The Miami-based builder posted a sharp increase in earnings for the February-ended fiscal first quarter on a 28% jump in sales to $2.98 billion.LGI Homes (LGIH), a member of the IBD 50, ramped up more than 6% to 70.15 in below average trade. The stock continues to work on the right side of a cup-style pattern. The small cap rose 161% in 2017.Analysts see Q1 earnings rising 37% to 71 cents a share. LGI, which focuses on entry-level homes, grew its profits by 39% to $4.73 a share in 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary on growth stocks, new breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:Also In Stock Market Today: How Should You Handle Boeing Now? How Are The Best Growth Stocks Doing?

81,HD,"The best sector mutual funds last year thrived in several areas, and the number of funds winning IBD Mutual Funds 2018 Awards jumped to 32 from the previous year's 13.This year the best sector mutual funds represented technology, defense and aerospace, media and telecom, health care and retail. Each of the top-performing sector funds not only surpassed the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years, but was also the top fund in its sector ranked by 10-year performance.According to Morningstar, a sector mutual fund invests solely in a general industry — such as technology — or in a more specific industry, like an internet company. But there can be a great deal of overlap among the sectors. For example, Amazon.com featured heavily in three of the five featured sector funds — technology, retail and media — while other FANG stocks held prominent roles as well.The components and weighting within the fund dictate its performance compared with the S&P 500.Technology stocks were among the year's best performers, as institutions flocked to the leading names — like the FANG stocks — in the sector.T. Rowe Global Technology (PRGTX) was the top fund within the U.S. technology sector, coming in with a 47.04% return in 2017, more than doubling the S&P 500's 21.83% return and also trouncing the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 28.2% return. The fund targets potential winners within specific technological themes, like cloud computing.Holdings that drove 2017's outperformance include Big Cap 20 member Salesforce.com (CRM) and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — a position which has since been sold. The fund also saw big gains from Chinese stock leaders Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs of Dec. 31, the fund had nearly 35% of its assets in its top five holdings, which are exhibiting strong fundamental and technical action.New top holdings include dynamic electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Shares of Tesla moved up 46% in 2017, but have been mostly stagnant since September 2017. Since then, the stock has been trading sideways in a range from 290 to about 360.Meanwhile, Apple-supplier Broadcom fell victim to slowing iPhone sales, as the stock fell 21% from its highs in early February. The stock is consolidating at its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.The defense industry saw strong gains in 2017, as President Trump boosted military spending.  Blue chip stock and defense leader Boeing (BA) paced the advancers with a gain of nearly 90%.Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace (FSDAX) jumped 34.21% in 2017. Its top holdings include Dow Jones Industrials name Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).While Boeing and Northrop — up 32% in 2017 — are extended from recent buy points, General Dynamics hasn't had the same torrid advanced and is near a 229.64 flat-base entry.Social media has become a major segment of the media & telecom sector and no company has a larger social media impact than Facebook (FB).T. Rowe Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) rose 32.99% in 2017. According to Morningstar, the fund is a bit different from the other sector funds in the communications category. While the fund has several communication tower names like American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), it also looks for high-growth companies that are disrupting the industry, like Amazon.The two tower companies had gains of 35% and 28%, respectively, in 2017. As such, the fund's performance was driven by its top three holdings: Amazon.com, Alibaba and Facebook.In a sector not typically known for large advances, health care fund Delaware Healthcare (DLHIX) put in a strong performance in 2017 with a 32.32% rise.The $512 million fund's performance was driven by its position in Germany-based MorphoSys — which advanced nearly 60% — and is involved in the development and research of antibodies. The foreign biotech is also the fund's biggest position as of the end of January at over 7%.Its top U.S.-based position is ethical drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY), but that didn't spark the fund's 2017 performance, as the stock only rose about 15% last year.Retailers continue to struggle with the Amazon Effect, creating winners and losers within the sector. The obvious retail winner in 2017 was e-commerce giant Amazon.In 2017, Fidelity Select Retail (FSRPX) delivered a 25.82% return due to its long-term investment in the industry leader Amazon.A whopping 40% of the $2.3 billion fund's portfolio is tied to e-commerce giant Amazon (23%) and Home Depot (HD) (17%). Both stocks were paramount to the fund's return in 2017 and will again in 2018 if their positions remain that big.The Fidelity Select Retail fund has owned Amazon since August 2005 — according to Morningstar — while Home Depot was first purchased in August 2008. Last year, Amazon ran up 56%, accounting for a large portion of the fund's annual gains. The stock is trading near its highs and nearly 30% above its most recent buy point — a flat base's 1,213.51 entry.In the meantime, the home improvement retailer had a solid 41% advance in 2017. The retailer was driven higher by solid consumer spending and a strong housing cycle. Shares are consolidating below their 50-day line.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Read The Full IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards 2018 ReportHere's The List Of The Best Mutual Funds Award Winners By CategoryBest Mutual Funds: News, Performance Reports And Investing IdeasHow To Invest Like Fidelity Stock Gurus Will Danoff And John RothWhich Stocks Are The Best Mutual Funds Buying — And Selling?FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

82,HD,"The Dow Jones industrial average and, briefly, the S&P 500 index undercut their 50-day moving averages, while the Nasdaq composite pulled back from a record high. Fears that President Donald Trump will impose sweeping tariffs on Chinese tech and telecom products worried investors and slammed Boeing stock. Trump also blocked Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm (QCOM), though chip stocks still outperformed. United Airlines raised forecasts and faced yet another public relations fiasco. Adobe Systems (ADBE) rallied on earnings and guidance. General Electric (GE) dove on dividend fears.Stocks ran into turbulence amid concerns that President Trump will soon levy stiff tariffs on Chinese goods over their trade and investment practices. Trump also nixed a possible Broadcom (AVGO) takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM). Boeing (BA), which sells a lot of planes to China, tumbled through its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average, which reclaimed its 50-day line on Monday, fell back below that level, led by Boeing. The S&P 500 index undercut its 50-day line on Thursday, but moved back above that area on Friday. The Nasdaq composite hit a record high Tuesday intraday, but reversed to close lower that day and in the next two sessions.Broadcom (AVGO) withdrew its $117 billion bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) after President Trump signed an executive order blocking the deal on national security grounds. Broadcom is shifting its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, but the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States cited concerns about its ties to China, including firms like Huawei. The interagency body also was worried that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm was acquired by the notoriously low-R&D Broadcom. Analysts say Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms. A day after abandoning its pursuit of Qualcomm, Broadcom reported fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets, but gave in-line revenue guidance for the current quarter amid a sharp decline in wireless chip sales.The digital media and marketing software firm earned an adjusted $1.55 a share, up 65% year over year, on sales of $2.08 billion, up 24%, in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2. Analysts expected $1.44 and $2.05 billion. Adobe Systems guided higher for the current quarter. Shares rose Friday, hitting a new high.The core consumer price index rose 1.8% in February vs. a year earlier, the same as in January and slightly below expectations. Retail sales missed estimates yet again, declining 0.1% last month, also easing inflation fears. Housing starts fell sharply in February. Industrial production rose more than expected in February while regional manufacturing reports showed continued strength in March.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLumentum Holdings (LITE) will buy Oclaro (OCLR) for $1.8 billion in cash and stock, raising speculation of consolidation among fiber-optic component makers. Lumentum stock has outperformed its optical peers in 2018, owing to its push into a new market as a supplier of 3D sensors to Apple. That stock run-up gave it ammunition to purchase Oclaro. While much speculation centers on Finisar (FNSR) as a possible buyer, its stock has lagged. Analysts view Acacia Communications (ACIA), Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), and NeoPhotonics (NPTN) as possible targets.United Airlines (UAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) hiked their first-quarter unit revenue forecasts, against a backdrop of solid travel demand. At an airline conference, United defended its decision to keep adding flights, while American Airlines (AAL) said Wall-Street sell-offs to signs of more expansions, competition and in turn fare discounting were an ""overreaction."" Meanwhile, the DOT and FAA were looking into an incident aboard a United flight in which a dog died after a flight attendant ordered it placed in an overhead bin. Two senators also introduced a bill to prohibit storing animals in overhead bins.Coupa Software (COUP) topped fourth-quarter profit estimates as revenue jumped 41% to $53.8 million. The  cloud-based software management platform sees a fiscal 2019 loss that's slightly less than the consensus. Coupa forecast revenue of $227 million to $230 million vs. estimates of $227 million.General Electric (GE) secured a $12.5 billion deal to provide next-gen Leap engines for India's fast-growing discount airline SpiceJet. Meanwhile, India grounded 11 Airbus (EADSY) jets using geared turbofan engines from Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies (UTX). Those engines have had a series of problems and delays. Later in the week, JPMorgan warned GE's 48-cent annual dividend is ""still high risk,"" after it was halved in November. The firm cut its price target on GE stock to 11.China Lodging Group (HTHT) tumbled after the hotel operator badly missed on earnings while revenue just fell short. Meanwhile, online travel agency Ctrip.com (CTRP) also took a dive after reporting Wednesday, despite EPS falling less than expected and revenue rising 34% to $980 million.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) beat earnings estimates, as did its full-year earnings-per-share outlook. While revenue and same-store sales missed, the retailer expects ""stronger product innovation from select key partners"" and ""less margin pressure than previously expected."" The results come as sports retailers face heavy competition and discounts. Dick's last month said it would stop selling assault-style rifles completely and ban gun sales to customers under 21 following a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Hibbett Sports (HIBB) edged past earnings estimates with sales in line. But EPS guidance was light.On the new-issue front, investors were disappointed with results from online styling service Stitch Fix (SFIX), which reported an adjusted 7 cents EPS and $295.9 million. China-based online lender Qudian (QD) reported $229.2 million in revenue and diluted EPS of 26 cents. ADT posted a surprise adjusted loss of 6 cents a share on 6% sales growth to $1.11 billion. On a GAAP basis, the home security company earned 99 cents a share.Meanwhile, network security firm Zscaler (ZS) shot up in its debut after the tech IPO priced above its expected range.Alibaba (BABA) rose 3.4% on Thursday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S.-listed Chinese e-commerce giant plans to list in mainland China, perhaps as soon as this summer. Beijing wants more big Chinese firms to dual-list or move their listings homes.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) agreed to buy Pleasanton, Calif.-based Evident.io for $300 million in cash, extending its cloud computing security offerings into vulnerability management and compliance reporting. FireEye (FEYE) jumped on speculation that it could be a takeover target.Dollar General (DG) investors had a few dollars more in their pockets after the stock spiked Thursday on bullish guidance for 2018. The firm met expectations with EPS of $1.48, while same-store sales growth was above some estimates.Industrial supplies distributor HD Supply (HDS) punched through its 50-day line after reporting a Q4 beat and giving bullish guidance Tuesday. Earnings rose to 49 cents a share while revenue was $1.18 billion.Williams-Sonoma (WSM) beat fourth-quarter expectations on what the upscale home furnishings retailer was ""substantial acceleration in e-commerce and retail revenue growth."" The company also hiked its dividend and expanded its buyback program.Toys 'R' Us will liquidate all its U.S. stores amid stiff competition and high debt payments from a private-equity buyout. Thousands of jobs will be lost, while Hasbro (HAS) and Mattel (MAT) dove on fears of lower sales.Tiffany (TIF) reported better-than-expected holiday fourth-quarter earnings, but global same-store sales growth came in light for the upscale jeweler. Shares fell Friday. Signet Jewelers (SIG), which owns the mall-based Kay and Jared chains, tumbled 21% for the week on weak guidance.Ahead of the 2019 launch of its stand-alone streaming platform, Disney (DIS) reshuffled its businesses to add a direct-to-consumer and international segment, to be headed by Kevin Mayer, most recently its chief strategy officer. The media conglomerate also merged its consumer products and theme parks units.

85,HD,"The Nasdaq brushed off a mid-morning dip and stretched into new session highs in early-afternoon trading with a 0.5% advance while the Dow industrials continued to struggled on Wall Street on Monday. Tech, leisure and internet companies advanced sharply. Small caps also outperformed.X At 1 p.m. ET, the tech-centered composite gained 0.5% and hit new all-time highs, but the Dow Jones industrial average slipped from small gains into a nearly 0.4% drop.The Nasdaq 100 rose nearly 0.7%, a strong hint that big cap techs were attracting institutional dollars. Business software, cloud computing, and video game hardware giant Microsoft (MSFT), a Dow Jones industrials stock, rose 0.5% to 96.99. The stock is up 13.3% since Jan. 1 and has rallied 70% following a late July 2016 breakout from a saucer-like base with a 56.87 buy point.The S&P 500 was virtually breakeven. The S&P SmallCap 600 erased mild early losses and gained 0.4%.Volume is now edging slightly higher vs. the same time Friday on the Nasdaq, indicating that institutional demand is not receding, even after the composite index surged 4.2% last week.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, ship transport, automaker, telecom, building-related products, data storage and oilfield services firms also rallied with gains of 1% or more. But shoe, auto parts, truck, construction machinery, movie, aerospace and wireless telecom service stocks fell 1% or more.Just three of the 30 components within the Dow industrial average climbed 1 point or more, including IBM (IBM) (still deep within a base) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (trying to clear a 273.89 entry in a new flat base). Fellow Dow Jones 30 member Intel (INTC) struggled, losing 0.84, or 1.6%, to 51.35. Volume was running 12% above average.Intel last week hopped out of a flawed cup base that formed in less than six weeks. Yet the chipmaking titan is having a positive 2018 so far, up more than 10%. The Santa Clara, Calif., tech bellwether has enjoyed healthy double-digit profit increases in five of the six past quarters, up 21%, 4%, 22%, 22%, 26% and 37% vs. year-ago levels.The Street expects Intel to grow first-quarter profit by 8% to 71 cents a share.Four components in the price-weighted Dow also sank 1 point or more, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX).Leading companies, in terms of fundamentals, relative price strength and quality fund sponsorship, include Alibaba (BABA) (basing), Broadcom (AVGO) (also in a base), Booking Holdings (BKNG) (up 7% from a breakout point at 2,068.09 and thus extended) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) (slightly out of the 5% proper buy zone after clearing a flat base at 170.40).Ligand was showcased in IBD's Stock Spotlight column on March 6, two days before the stock broke out of its five-week flat base, one of the most important chart patterns that can help growth investors time their buys for maximum gains and minimum risk during a confirmed stock market uptrend.On Friday, the IBD Big Picture column noted that the rise by the Nasdaq composite to all-time highs ended the ""Uptrend under pressure"" phase that began on March 1.All four companies have a record of smashing the performance of the S&P 500 and other benchmarks. Only Broadcom, still in a quest to acquire fellow wireless chip technology giant Qualcomm (QCOM), is lagging the S&P 500 in year-to-date performance. Broadcom, however, gapped up more than 3% to 262.58 in fast turnover and is now up more than 1% year to date.Broadcom, the product of a mega-merger with Singapore's Avago Technologies, is up 554% since clearing a nearly 18-month base-on-base pattern with a 39.84 buy point in the week ended Sept. 20, 2013. The company has superior earnings growth, with profit rising 29%, 38%, 51%, 46%, 42% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.Revenue picked up 119%, 125%, 134%, 18%, 18%, and 17% in the same time frame. The merger between Broadcom and Avago accounted largely for the triple-digit top-line gains in prior quarters.Analysts see earnings in the January-ended fiscal first quarter rising 39% to $5.03 a share on a 28% jump in sales to $5.32 billion.As noted in IBD's Earnings Calendar, Broadcom is slated to report Q1 results on Thursday.Like the one formed recently by Ligand, a good flat base must form over a minimum five weeks and correct no greater than 10% to 15% from head to toe. Such action indicates tight price action and a general unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares.Ligand has scored a ninth straight advance, rising more than 2% to 179.92 in volume running more than 100% above usual levels. Before the stock broke out, its relative strength line jumped into new high ground, a bullish sign.The relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD charts and in MarketSmith, compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500.On Feb. 21, the specialist in developing treatments for numerous difficult and chronic diseases posted a 77% leap in fourth-quarter profit to $1.31 a share as revenue rose 32% to $50.5 million.As noted in this IBD New America piece, Ligand earns royalties based on the therapies and technology platforms it sells to larger pharmaceutical and biotech firms. In February, management noted it currently has 165 platforms in development together with more than 95 business partners.Ligand joined IBD Leaderboard last week.Shares are up more than 30% since Jan. 1, while at 2786 the S&P 500 is up 4.2%. The Nasdaq composite is up nearly 10%.Alibaba, one of China's leading e-commerce firms, had a huge 2017 as shares rolled 96% higher that year, vs. a 19.4% lift by the S&P 500.The stock sprinted higher in January, then caved in step with the market. However, notice how the stock refused to sink below its long-term 200-day moving average (visible as the black line on a MarketSmith chart). After a strong run-up, it's not uncommon for leading stocks to not only sharply undercut the 50-day moving average but also test buying support at the 200-day line as well.The 200-day moving average traces a stock's average price close over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' of price action. You want to see the 200-day line rising. Plus, a leading stock will lead its 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.Alibaba has fallen a mild 18% in its current base, which so far has the makings of a cup base.The latest pullback is not a proper handle. Why? The midpoint test shows that the handle didn't form up high enough within the cup itself.The midpoint of the cup (the base's intraday high plus intraday low, divided by 2) is 187.54, while the midpoint of the handle is 185.30.In a good cup with handle, the midpoint of the handle is usually higher than the base's midpoint. A good cup with handle must also form within a minimum seven weeks.Alibaba has scored EPS gains of 39%, 30%, 37%, 60%, 63% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Such results help boost the stock's Earnings Per Share Rating to a 97 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, and the megacap member of IBD's Retail-Internet industry group shows an equally robust 98 Composite Rating.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see first-quarter earnings rising 49% to 94 cents a share.One concern is that fourth-quarter aftertax margin fell by 970 basis points to 32.5% vs. the year-ago period. That broke a two-quarter string of rising net margins.The Dow transportation average, a 17.3% gainer in 2017, fell nearly 0.6% before rebounding some and is now off 0.2%. At 10,712, it's up almost 1% since Jan. 1.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures fell 1.7% to $60.92 a barrel while gold, silver and copper futures backtracked 0.3% to 0.6%.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged lower to 2.88%, still up from 2.41% at the start of the year.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on growth stocks, breakouts, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside IBD's Stock Spotlight: Can This Hot China Consumer Spending Play Break Out Again?Who Are The Global Stock Leaders On Wall Street?Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm Buzz Has A Lot To Do With AppleThese 5 Top China Nets Have New Bases, Buy PointsHow To Score Big Profits With A Small Account?

98,HD,"Regulation: The internet has 60 days left before it is destroyed by the lack of federal ""net neutrality"" rules. That's the claim, anyway. The truth is, the internet is on the cusp of a vast improvement.The 60-day clock started when the FCC's officially published its net neutrality repeal on Thursday. The repeal takes effect in two months, which means that, since its start in mid-2015, ""net neutrality"" will have been in effect less than three years — probably the shortest-lived federal regulation in history.Nevertheless, its demise is being treated as a devastating blow to everyone who relies on the internet. Fortune declared that net neutrality supporters now have ""60 days to save the web as we know it.""But other developments during the week show why the hue and cry about ""net neutrality"" is so utterly misplaced.The same day the FCC issued its repeal, SpaceX launched test satellites for Starlink, a global broadband network envisioned by SpaceX founder Elon Musk.The day before that, Dish Network (DISH) told the SEC in its 10K filing that it plans to commit $1 billion to build out an ultra-high-speed 5G wireless network over the next three years.The day before that, AT&T (T) announced plans to roll out its 5G network in Dallas, Waco, Texas, and Atlanta this year. By the end of the year, it plans to have 5G in a dozen markets. Verizon also plans to start rolling out its 5G network this year.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersFor those who don't know, 5G wireless is about 50 times faster than the average home broadband network today. And because it's wireless, providers won't have to dig trenches and lay cable to sign up customers.That means there will be more competition for internet access than there is today, and at speeds that make today's broadband look like dial-up.With more competition for customers, ISPs won't ""block, slow down, or charge more for certain content as they see fit"" as net neutrality zealots claim. More likely, they will be in a frantic race to provide the fastest, most comprehensive, and most reliable service around.That is, after all, how the internet worked before net neutrality. Between 2011 and 2014, average internet speeds tripled.What net neutrality advocates won't tell you is that the only companies actually guilty of blocking, slowing down, or charging more for certain content are big net neutrality advocates like Netflix (NFLX) — which charges more if you want streaming HD — and Google (GOOGL) — which charges $10 a month for the better YouTube Red — and social media companies — which have been repeatedly shown to hamstring conservative content.So yes, the internet won't be the same after Obama's net neutrality rules disappear. It will be far better.You might also like …Will Net-Neutrality Zealots Apologize When The Internet Fails To Crash And Burn?Net Neutrality Advocates Are Modern-Day Snake Oil SalesmenNet Neutrality Hypocrisy Runs Amok

The Nasdaq suffered the biggest blow during afternoon trading but edged higher within minutes left in the session.The premier index of growth companies also still looks poised for a strong weekly advance, up at least 5%, following drops of 3.5% and 5.1% in the prior two weeks.X On Wednesday, the Nasdaq composite sparked the confirmation of a potential new market uptrend by rising 1.9% in higher volume vs. the prior session. The solid rally came on Day 4 of a new rally attempt after the leading U.S. equities index got trampled by sellers and fell 11.7% from its all-time perch of 7505.On Friday, the Nasdaq slipped about 0.1% after rising as much as 0.6%.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both edged nearly 0.4% higher with roughly an hour to go before the close.Small caps, which lagged their big-cap brethren in 2017, outperformed on Friday. The Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.6%.At 1544, the popular small-cap index is now back in the black in 2018, up almost 0.6% year to date.At least six of the 30 components within the Dow industrials rose 1 point or more, including consumer spending and medical names Walt Disney (DIS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Home Depot (HD).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) slumped 5% to 17.65, dashing hopes of a possible rebound back above the 50-day moving average this week. But a strong weekly advance suggests that GBTC is beginning to form a new deep base. A rally back above the 50-day line would be bullish, but it would not be a proper buy point yet.The reason: GBTC had fallen more than 70% from its December peak. A correction that deep often indicates that the potential for new sell-offs is high. When a highflying stock or ETF rebounds in price, it's vulnerable to the overhead supply of potential sellers who bought on the way down and are looking to cut their losses.Elsewhere, steel companies, homebuilders, long-term medical care, medical services and pollution control firms paced the upside with gains of 1.5% or more.Nucor (NUE) has trampolined higher since testing the 60 level on Feb. 5. The return back above the 50-day moving average is also bullish. The U.S. steelmaker rallied more than 5% on Friday to 68.67 in volume running more than 40% above the 50-day average.Note on an IBD daily chart how it's easy to see when turnover is higher than normal. Just compare the volume bar for any trading session with the line that goes across the volume bars. That line is the 50-day moving average, which shows the average amount of shares traded per day in the past 50 sessions.A stock that rises back above the 50-day moving average, or the 10-week line on a weekly chart, in above-normal turnover is flashing bullish action. Why? It indicates that mutual funds, hedge funds, pension plans, corporate treasury divisions, insurers and the like are accumulating shares.Nucor has experienced stiff upside resistance at the 70 level. The stock has traded between 51 and 68 over the past 14 months. A potential new base could form.Charlotte, N.C.-based Nucor grew fourth-quarter earnings 91% vs. a year ago to 65 cents a share on a 29% jump in revenue to $5.09 billion.U.S. Steel (X) retook a 40.06 buy point in a cup with handle that began in February 2017. The handle formed over five trading sessions from Jan. 16 to 22, and a handle must be at least five trading days long.RELATED:This Is When The Stock Market Outlook ChangedWhich Way Is The Stock Market Headed Now?

The fund's average annual returns of 13.4%, 18.1% and 14.3% over the past three, five and 10 years, respectively, also beat the S&P 500's 10.6%, 14.2% and 9.2% gains for the same periods.IBD'S TAKE: The stock market has been very volatile lately.

That left the oil giant 8% lower for the week and nearly 13% below its Jan. 29 high.The S&P 500 advanced 1.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite bounced 2.1% higher, aided by Apple and by FANG stock tech leaders Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX), which rose 3.8% and 4.5%, respectively.

110,HD,"Two homebuilding ETFs find themselves at a crucial juncture, as the once-formidable industry starts showing wear.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are testing their 50-day moving averages. It is the first time the ETFs have pulled back to those levels since they broke out to new highs in September.Both funds own housing-related stocks such as Home Depot (HD) and building materials maker Owens Corning (OC). But iShares Home Construction is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of its holdings in that industry. That helps explain why the ETF's shares have struggled a bit more around the 50-day line than SPDR Homebuilders, which is only 32% invested in builders.If they can bounce from the 50-day averages, the ETFs have a chance to resume their impressive advances. But a drop below the key line could send them further lower. Both ETFs traded tightly in January, but neither was able to move past potential entries. Instead, shares slid.The first signs of trouble appeared Jan. 25, when Lennar (LEN) said the Justice Department had subpoenaed its mortgage unit due to ""quality control processes"" and the underwriting of loans it sold to the Federal Housing Administration.On the same day, December new-home sales came in 9.3% lower at an annual rate of 625,000, below views for 680,000. Also, NVR (NVR) missed sales and profit expectations. Shares plunged below the 50-day moving average, a break of support that had not occurred since the stock's run began in January 2017, a sell signal.Subsequent earnings reports haven't gone so well.On Tuesday, PulteGroup (PHM) narrowly topped fourth-quarter results, but shares continued to stumble. The company fears margins will be squeezed further due to increasing labor and material costs. D.R. Horton beat earnings estimates Wednesday and nudged higher its pretax operating margin forecast. But shares have met resistance at the 50-day line.On Thursday, Meritage Homes (MTH) and MDC Holdings (MDC) were volatile and M/I Homes (MHO) was little changed after those builders reported earnings.IBD's homebuilding industry group nearly doubled in 2017, its best performance in any year, and rose 23.1% in the final quarter of 2017. An improving economy and demand from millennials have nurtured the sector's growth.Housing stocks tumbled in early November after the GOP tax reform plan reduced deductions for mortgages and property taxes. Yet, the sector recovered, which offers some hope that the ETFs can recover again. At least some analysts believe the industry is going through a normal correction.However, the weakness in both ETFs caused them to drop out of this month's ETF Leaders screen.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

Starbucks is lavishing $250 million in pay raises and stock grants on 150,000 workers, also crediting the tax cuts. At Disney, 125,000 workers are getting a $1,000 bonus, and the company is investing another $50 million in employee education programs.These companies join more than 240 others — many of them household names like Apple  (AAPL), Wal-Mart  (WMT), AT&T  (T), Auto Nation  (AN), Boeing  (BA), Comcast  (CMCSA), Southwest Airlines  (LUV) and Verizon  (VZ) — that have already done so, putting more money in the pockets of at least 3 million workers.This string of tax-cut-related good news is just beginning. In February, millions of workers will suddenly see their paychecks get bigger, as the law's new, lower withholding schedules take effect. And this is to say nothing of the indirect effects of the tax cuts — more investment, faster economic growth, more jobs.Even before all this, the GOP's tax bill was growing increasingly popular, according to the New York Times, which found that support jumped from 37% to 46% in one month, with disapproval dropping from 58% to 49%.Complete Coverage Of The GOP's Tax Cut PlanWhat's more, the share of people who think they will get a tax cut climbed from 33% in December to 41% in January.This must come as a shock to Democrats — not a single one of whom voted for the tax cuts — who thought the public would continue to see the tax cuts the way they did.Nancy Pelosi called the GOP tax plan a ""brazen con job"" and ""tax scam"" that would ""bleed the American people dry.""Chuck Schumer said the bill was unpopular with the public because ""they know what this bill is all about. They know they are getting crumbs, if that, while the wealthy are getting big pieces of cake – that's why it's so unpopular.""It's true that the tax bill was unpopular when President Trump signed it into law — not because people knew what was in it, but because Democrats and their media lapdogs successfully hid the details and deceived the public.That's made abundantly clear in the latest Harvard-Harris poll, which found that just 47% supported the tax bill when they were asked about it at the start of the survey.But then the pollsters described 15 key provisions that are actually in the plan, and found substantial majority support for all but three. Eighty-four percent back the lower income tax brackets, for example, 82% doubling the child tax credit, 77% the cut in the tax rate for ""pass-through"" companies. Even the limits on mortgage and state tax deductions get majority support.The poll then asked a follow up question: ""Given this information about what is in the new tax code, do you favor or oppose it?"" — fully 57% said they supported it.In other words, once people learned about the details of the GOP tax reforms, support jumped 10 percentage points.Even Democrats surveyed by Harvard-Harris found themselves changing their minds — with support going from 18% at the outset to 34% after learning about the details.If this trend continues, Democratic lawmakers will have a lot of explaining to do when they face voters in nine months.RELATED:Great Again: Disabled Rejoin Workforce In Droves As Economy Gains SteamHigh Tariffs And Weak Dollar Are No Way To Make America Great AgainThe Trump Economy, One Year In: A Success By All MeasuresClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

120,HD,"Apple (AAPL) and Bank Of America (BAC) top the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, but these large investors also placed big bets on stocks in the medical, semiconductor, building, chemical and machinery sectors.X Fund managers tend to take a longer-term approach, so their investments over the last three months in stocks like managed care provider Aetna (AET), chip equipment stock Applied Materials (AMAT), homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and industrial machinery maker Illinois Tool Works (ITW) show they expect continued growth this year in the key industries and sectors that often drive GDP and the overall economy.And despite fears that Amazon (AMZN) is primed to rule the retail world, these leading mutual funds also established new positions or added to their existing ones in Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).Apple saw the most new buyers and the most money invested, with 65 funds picking up an estimated nearly $1.8 billion of the iPhone maker's shares.Apple has been carving out a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. The stock closed Tuesday's session 1% below the 176.34 buy point.BofA was the only other stock on the list to get more than a $1 billion investment, as 57 funds sunk $1.04 billion into the banking giant.The Charlotte, N.C.-based company's share price has nearly doubled since Donald Trump's election in 2016, and the stock is now 19% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared last September.Many names on the list, including Best Buy, Texas Instruments (TXN) and FedEx (FDX), have already broken out and are now extended beyond their buy ranges, but Apple is not the only stock on the list in or near a potential buy zone.Graco (GGG), which provides equipment to measure, control and dispense fluid and powder materials in the manufacturing processing and construction industries, cleared a 44.80 buy point on Dec. 15 and is now trading at the upper end of the buy zone.Defense contractor Heico (HEI) also broke out in good volume on Dec. 15, but then pulled back to its 93.10 buy point, where it found support. The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

121,HD,"Boeing (BA) announced late Monday a $18 billion repurchase program and a 20% dividend hike to $1.71, joining other big companies like Bank of America (BAC), Home Depot (HD) and Mastercard (MA) returning more capital to shareholders.X The new buyback replaces an existing $14 billion program, under which Boeing had repurchased $9.2 billion in shares. The share repurchases are expected over the next 24-30 months. The new dividend will be payable March 2.""To support our balanced cash deployment strategy, our team remains focused on improving operating performance as we deliver on our substantial order backlog and work to capture a larger share of the growing aerospace market,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement.Boeing investors have already enjoyed a massive windfall this year, as the aerospace giant's stock has led all Dow Jones industrial average components with an 82% jump, far better than No. 2 performer Caterpillar (CAT) with its 55% gain.In addition to expectations that GOP tax-cut plans will boost payouts and buybacks, hopes for bigger shareholder returns had already been running high at Boeing as improving operations have grown the outlook for cash flows.In its third-quarter report in October, management boosted Boeing's overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion, led by improved performance.Shares rallied 1.1% late, after closing down 1% at 283.16 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.Boeing is the latest company to deliver fatter returns to investors.Last week, Bank of America announced it would be buying back an additional $5 billion worth of shares on top of its earlier plan to buy back $12 billion in shares and Mastercard said it would buy back up to up to $4 billion in class A shares.Home Depot approved its own $15 billion share buyback last week, and Honeywell (HON) set a new $8 billion repurchase program.RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

122,HD,"In the wake of a solid month for the broad market and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, some fund managers are tilting toward value-oriented stocks.X Having lagged growth stocks, value stock valuations are increasingly attractive, says Tom Galvin, lead manager of $4.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth (ELGAX). Yet their prospects are bright as the U.S. and key foreign economies continue to grow, Galvin added.In November, the broad market got a lift from such Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).With the S&P 500 climbing 3.07% last month, the broad stock market made it 13 straight month of gains, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds rode along, advancing 2.62% on average, their 15th monthly gain in the past 16 months and third positive month in a row. That lifted their year-to-date gain to 17.40%.Both the S&P 500 and Dow hit all-time highs to that point on Nov. 30.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesWhy Fidelity Gave This Mutual Fund Manager More Money To InvestWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?The November gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, generally better-than-expected corporate profits, benign inflation and heightened prospects for U.S. tax reform with a lowering of the corporate tax rate, said Galvin, whose fund finished among the top 16% in large-cap growth fund performance last month.Wall Street's approval of reforms that lighten corporate regulatory burdens also boosted the stock market last month, said John Rogers, chairman, CEO and chief investment officer of Ariel Investments and lead manager of flagship $2.2 billion Ariel Fund (ARGFX).But market leadership is poised to shift to value-oriented categories of stocks and mutual funds in the coming months, away from growth-oriented ones, added Rogers, whose fund's 7.01% return last month topped 98% of its midcap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.That tilt toward value already seemed underway in November. With a 3.27% gain on average, midcap value funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories. Small- to midsize companies tend to derive a larger portion of their revenue and earnings from the U.S., so they're likely to benefit more than large-cap companies from tax reform. ""There was a rotation into smaller stocks and value stocks as the prospect for successful passage of tax reform grew,"" Galvin said.That tax-reform tilt was also why U.S. diversified stock funds outpaced world stock funds, which averaged just a 1.03% gain last month. Japanese funds, averaging a 2.95% advance, led foreign stock funds.Industrials funds averaged a 3.10% gain in November, leading all major sector categories. They were driven by the rotation into value-oriented stocks.U.S. taxable bond funds were slightly above break even on average in November. U.S. Treasury funds led other categories, averaging a 0.08% gain. World income funds averaged a 0.54% gain. Muni bond funds lost ground overall last month.While GDP growth, corporate profits, tax reform and regulatory reform should benefit all corporations, longtime outperformance by growth stocks has left value stocks more attractively valued, Rogers said.The Russell 2500 Value index was trading at 18 times next year's earnings as of the first week of December. In contrast, the Russell 2500 Growth index was trading at a lofty 32 times. ""It's one of the biggest gaps I've seen in my career between value and growth,"" Rogers said. ""And there will be an inevitable reversion to the mean when things go too far.""In addition, the Federal Reserve's widely expected tax hikes should boost margins for banks, which generally are categorized as value stocks, Rogers said.Already, his firm's researchers are getting bullish input from industrial companies. ""A lot are describing recoveries and business momentum building,"" Rogers said.Further, Amazon's (AMZN) widespread competitive influence is helping to keep retail prices low, which is preventing inflationary pressure from growing, he said.In at least the near term, one area in which he expects to see many investment opportunities is among industrials, what he calls light cyclicals and manufacturers. In that group, he holds Kennametal (KMT). ""It's a favorite,"" he said. ""They make cutting tools and cutting blades that are used for everything from coal mines to rebuilding highways and infrastructure. They should be a prime beneficiary whenever we get an infrastructure (spending) bill through Congress.""Going forward, financial services should also outperform, ""especially money managers and private equity funds that are public,"" he said, adding, ""They're cheap because they're not in popular indexes.""Among those, he cites KKR (KKR). ""They are a large private equity firm run by Henry Kravis,"" he said. ""They're cheap and private equity is one of the best performing asset classes.""Rogers also owns Lazard (LAZ). ""They're an investment banking franchise,"" he said. ""They have money management and mutual fund subsidiaries that focus on emerging markets and international investing.""He also likes the beleaguered media space. Many investors are afraid that cable companies are suffering subscriber attrition, which creates downward pressure on fees to content providers. Rogers nevertheless like MSG Networks (MSGN). The New York City-area sports network broadcasts games for nine sports teams including the professional basketball Knicks. ""The fear has been overdone,"" Rogers said. ""Live sports, whether seen on smartphones, computers or TV, one way or another that content will be viewed and monetized.""Health care is his fourth-largest sector. He prefers systems and instruments maker Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO) and clinical testing services provider Laboratory Corp. of America (LH). ""We're not involved in the riskier, more complicated parts of health care,"" he said.Growth-oriented fund managers still see opportunities on their side of the market ledger.""In the consumer space, where we're overweighted, Costco (COST) continues to demonstrate very strong traffic gains and sales growth,"" Galvin said. ""Roughly one-third of their customers are small-to-medium size businesses, which could benefit from tax reform.""Galvin also likes apparel maker Nike (NKE) and coffee-shop chain Starbucks (SBUX). After lagging in 2017, both ""could be potential winners in 2018,"" Galvin said. ""Each has issues, but each could benefit from accelerating GDP growth, helped by fiscal stimulus, stronger consumer confidence fueled by lower consumer tax rates and better jobs growth.""In health care, the CVS Health (CVS) takeover of Aetna (AET) could signal that ""more consolidation is forthcoming,"" Galvin said. Also, a looser regulatory environment and tax reform that motivates companies to repatriate profits held outside the U.S. could increase the attractiveness of more health care companies.And new opportunities could emerge in the tech sector if tax reform and corporate profit escalation encourage more companies to spend on technology. ""For example, Salesforce.com (CRM): it was the fastest company to get to $10 billion in revenues, and it's likely to be the fastest to double revenues within five years as they continue to go broader and deeper in (finding customers among) Fortune 1000 companies at home and abroad,"" Galvin said. ""Salesforce is already by far the market leader in cloud dominance.""The firm's cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships.And take $1.5 billion Champlain Small Company Fund (CIPSX) — an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner in the growth, small-cap and diversified equities categories. The growth-oriented fund owned Innospec (IOSP) as of July 31, a specialty chemicals firm that has a 92 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Earnings per share rose 8%, 13% and 28% the past three quarters.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. Innospec's SMR Rating means it's in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.RELATED:Looking For Winning Stocks?

127,HD,"Major indexes edged higher at midday Monday, the start of a holiday-shortened week that currently see the market in a confirmed uptrend.Apple (AAPL) backtracked in light volume, and another light-volume drop could put shares back in buy range. Last month, Apple cleared a brand-new cup with handle, moving past a 160.97 entry. The 5% chase zone extends up to 169.02.XOther key megacap and big-cap techs to keep watching with less than two months to go in 2017 include Applied Materials (AMAT), Lam Research (LRCX), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA). All five of these names rank in the latest IBD Big Cap 20.All five of these names are currently extended from a proper buy point. However, given their excellent fundamentals, superior position within their respective markets, and outstanding relative price strength, they certainly deserve a spot on a long-term watch list. New follow-on entry points or new bases will eventually emerge.At 1 pm ET, the Nasdaq composite rose less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 rose close to 0.2%. Most Chinese ADRs flexed strength, following a third straight advance for the Hang Seng equities benchmark in Hong Kong. Volume is running sharply lower vs. the same time on Friday, which saw turnover boosted by expiring monthly and weekly stock and index options.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied nearly 0.4%, buoyed by 1-point gains or more by at least five of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD), 3M (MMM), Caterpillar (CAT) and IBM (IBM).Investors received additional confirmation that the U.S. economy is rising. The leading indicators index showed a 1.2% gain in October, blasting the Econoday consensus view of up 0.6% and a big improvement from a 0.2% drop in September.Home Depot barreled more than 1.5% higher to 170.49, good for a new all-time high. The stock marked a follow-on entry point as it bounced off the rising 10-week moving average near 165 last week in hefty volume.Those who bought shares when the stock cleared earlier buy points may add a small amount of shares to the winning position. Adding shares to your best stocks is a great way to compound your overall return, but it should only be done when the market is in a solid uptrend, as noted in the Market Pulse table of IBD's The Big Picture.The Street sees the home improvement chain's earnings rising 12% to $1.62 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January. That would extend Home Depot's streak of double-digit profit growth to 16 quarters in a row.No wonder Home Depot's EPS Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is a very respectable 92 on scale of 1 (atrocious earnings) to 99 (exceptional profit growth, both near and long term).Back to Apple, the stock provides multiple reasons why the outlook for a continued fundamentals turnaround remains very strong.Earnings per share jumped 24% to $2.07 in the September-ended fiscal fourth quarter, and Apple crushed the consensus view by nearly 11%. But perhaps more importantly, the iPhone marketer is poised to continue growing profit at double-digit pace into the next fiscal year.The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings (for the quarter ending in December, a big-time shopping month) rising 12% to $3.77 a share; that would also be a quarterly best.A second reason to have confidence in Apple's turnaround? Revenue growth is accelerating. In the latest quarter, revenue jumped 12% to $52.58 billion, the biggest year-over-year gain in nearly three years. Analysts on consensus see sales picking up 10%, 30%, 25% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the next four quarters.Three, Apple's ratings in IBD Stock Checkup continue to stay solid and show dramatic improvement vs. the start of the year. While the Composite Rating dipped just a bit to 89, it's still up strong from a lowly 51 on Jan. 1. The RS Rating continues to reflect leadership among big caps at 83.Four, the daily and weekly chart action for Apple has not shed any sell signals, other than to take profits at 20% to 25% for those who wish to raise some cash and look for perhaps a better growth name. Apple has jumped nearly 50% since clearing a first-stage bottoming base pattern at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. Meanwhile, the B- Accumulation/Distribution Rating, on a scale of A to E, indicates mutual funds, banks, hedge funds and insurers are overall net accumulators of Apple shares.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

130,HD,"It's been a fantastic year for homebuilders, ranked among the top industries since May. That's made winners of a couple of ETFs, although one is well ahead of the other.X SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) are both in IBD's ETF Leaders screen. Yet, neither is a pure-play homebuilding ETF, and the two funds are structured quite differently.That helps explain why iShares U.S. Home Construction has sharply outperformed, up about 57% this year compared with about 31% for SPDR S&P Homebuilders.SPDR Homebuilders (which holds 35 stocks) is only 33% invested in builders, while iShares Home Construction (with nearly 50 holdings) is more builder-heavy, with nearly two-thirds of the portfolio in those companies.Both also have a good share of building products companies: 33% for SPDR Homebuilders and 15% for iShares Home Construction. The rest of the portfolios consist of home furnishing, home improvement (Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW)), appliance and other companies related to the housing industry.The heavier reliance on homebuilders has indeed helped iShares U.S. Home Construction put up better returns in 2017.For example, D.R. Horton (DHI), which makes single-family homes in 26 states, has surged more than 35% from a breakout to new highs on Sept. 12. D.R. Horton is the largest holding in the iShares fund, with a 13.2% weighting. By comparison, the same stock occupies 4.4% in SPDR Homebuilders, which equal-weights its holdings.Because of that structure, winning homebuilding stocks have about the same weighting as fund laggards such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and Johnson Controls (JCI).Both funds own the other major homebuilders that have rallied this year, such as Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), PulteGroup (PHM), Toll Bros. (TOL) and CalAtlantic (CAA).Chartwise, both ETFs formed three-weeks-tight patterns in the first half of December and are trading close to possible buy points. For iShares Home Construction, the entry is at 44.09 and for SPDR Homebuilders 44.59. The primary risk is in the lengthy advance both ETFs have enjoyed this year.The new tax bill cuts the amount of mortgage interest homeowners can deduct on their taxes, a measure that particularly hit luxury-home builder Toll Bros. But with the U.S. economy trending higher, many analysts maintain a positive outlook.""The National Association of Home Builders' index was released and it indicated that developers are near giddy,"" economist Joel L. Naroff wrote in a note Tuesday. ""The index is now above every reading we saw during the housing bubble.""The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

149,HD,"You love to trade, and you've set a goal to make a million dollars. You also wonder whether exchange traded funds can help you achieve that ambitious goal.X Can ETFs in fact generate wealth in the same way that the best CAN SLIM-quality stocks can?In some ways, the question is difficult to answer. ETFs simply don't have as long a trading history as stocks. And even if some funds are concentrated in their holdings, one might think they cannot make as large a move as a highflying tech or the future Home Depot (HD).Yet some ETFs are built with leverage, so they are designed to move at a similar tempo to high-growth equities. And when the market is favoring certain industry sectors, the right set of ETFs can be employed to take advantage of short, medium and long-term moves.A look at some of the hot-performing ETFs lately should convince you that it's worth the time and effort to focus your research on ETFs as serious moneymaking vehicles.Consider the SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB), a liquid exchange-traded fund that currently trades on average 1.6 million shares a day. With a 27% year-to-date gain through Wednesday, the sector-type ETF is easily beating the S&P 500's 17.4% advance.When was a good time to buy XHB? The late-February breakout past 36.05 in a six-month cup with handle, a bullish chart pattern for stocks and ETFs that break out to new highs, was a prime spot.In the cup portion, the ETF falls no more than 33% to 35% below its peak, bottoms out, then rises again. Ideally the rebound will show numerous instances of heavy turnover.The handle formed over three weeks after XHB reversed from a 35.95 intraday peak on Jan. 26. The handle showed a gentle drop from high to low, sloped lower along its lows, and formed in the upper half of the cup. All good.While volume was just so-so in late February, it picked up quickly on Feb. 27 when XHB rallied 1.5% to 36.38, as well as  on March 1 during a 2.3% lift to 36.85. In both cases, shares were still in the proper buy zone.Once XHB advanced past 37.85, or 5% above the 36.05 correct entry, it became extended and too far high in price to buy.A more recent buy opportunity arrived at the end of September, when XHB rolled past a 39.32 buy point in an 11-week flat base.How could an ETF trader make the most of these two short-term moves?Several skills need to be mastered. First, you need to become comfortable analyzing charts and looking for clues of big demand. Second, check the strength of the sector. IBD's stock research tables can help, since they rank 33 separate industry sectors based on multiple periods of relative performance. The top five sectors are generally going to be leading the market.In the IBD Weekly for the week of Sept. 25, Building ranked No. 4 among 33 sectors.Let's say you have half a million dollars and want to turn it into a million. You cannot afford to be too concentrated in one ETF, but you also want to have a sizable position so that you can cash in a big gain when you are right.So consider this strategy: In each ETF you trade, build a $62,500 position, which would represent one-eighth of your portfolio. A 20% gain on the position would score a profit of $12,500, boosting your portfolio account by 2.5 percentage points. Accumulate 40 such winning trades over time, and you've netted a half million in profits, minus your trading losses and commissions.When it comes to buying the ETFs that represent traditional growth sectors such as retail, medicine or technology, you likely will do better when IBD's current outlook points to a confirmed uptrend. Here, following the IBD ETF Strategy will be immensely helpful. Most stocks — and thus ETFs — will follow the general direction of the market. IBD Leaderboard features daily commentary on this strategy as well as an annotated chart of the Nasdaq composite, showing precise signals on when to go 100% long, cut exposure to 50%, and go completely in cash.Don't forget that some leveraged ETFs can produce unintended results if you hold them too long. Due to the mathematical nature of these funds, the long-term performance won't necessarily match the index it tracks — especially those that are designed to act inverse to the equity index.Last but never least, always keep your losses small in every trade. It's human to make mistakes, and even the best traders in the world know they will make lots of errors. But the most successful traders, in ETFs or otherwise, will have an iron discipline in doing their best to let their big winners grow while never letting their losses exceed a set threshold — say, 7%-8% in a normal uptrend and 3%-4% in sideways or choppy markets.(A version of this column was originally published on Sept. 30, 2016.

But revenue climbed 14% to $33.47 billion, marking the first top-line increase in four quarters.J&J catapulted past a 137.18 flat-base buy point after reporting double-digit earnings and sales growth for Q3 last week. The 5% buy zone goes up to 144.04.At 1pm ET, the Nasdaq cut its loss to 0.1%; the PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, was also down around 0.1%.The S&P 500 was flat as gains in retail, building and wood products, medical, and select computer-related shares offset sharp losses in the toy, internet content, airline, media, homebuilder, and oil and gas machinery industry groups. Volume is running a tad higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Friday.Breadth is negative on both exchanges. Losing stocks exceeded winners by a more than 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Halliburton (HAL) weighed on the oil sector, falling as much as 2.2% before shaving some losses and bouncing off its 50-day moving average. The company reported third-quarter earnings of 42 cents a share vs. a penny in the year-ago quarter on an adjusted basis. Revenue jumped 42% to $5.44 billion, marking a second quarter of accelerating growth. Revenue rose 2% in Q1 and 29% in Q2.Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller said in a news release that its North American business ""is hitting on all cylinders"" while the international side has ""proved resilient.""WTI crude oil prices, currently near $51.85 a barrel, have rebounded 22% since bottoming near $42.53 in late June.Notice on a daily chart how the oil and gas field services giant is forming a new base, but the base still has a lot of work left. The base began in late January when Halliburton topped at 58.78, then dived below the 50-day moving average on Feb. 16.IBD's TAKE: The 50-day moving average is drawn in red in both IBD daily charts and on MarketSmith, IBD's premium charting and stock screening service. A leading stock tends to rise ahead of its 50-day line, and the moving average itself is rising. Read this column in Investor's Corner to learn more about how the 50-day line is a great tool for determining the right time to sell a good stock.Also in the energy sector, Argentine oil and gas explorer YPF (YPF) cleared a 23.32 buy point in a long cup-with-handle pattern. The 5% buy zone extends to 24.49.The company is aggressively pursuing fracking and horizontal drilling opportunities. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings of 62 cents a share this year and $1.44 a share in 2018, a 132% leap.The latest base passes the midpoint test; that is, the midpoint of the handle is higher than the midpoint of the base. Yet shares are still building the right side of the cup. The cup's left-side high is 26.48.At 24, YPF is still nearly 10% off that cup's left-side high.Volume is running at triple normal levels. The average daily volume is currently 929,000 shares over the prior 50 trading sessions. YPF's integrated oil industry group is a market laggard, still dwelling in the bottom half of IBD's 197 industry groups. But group mate Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) has been hitting 52-week highs lately.Returning to Apple, the stock resisted the Nasdaq's slide, edging nearly 0.8% higher to 157.47 in light trade. While the stock is back near an Aug. 2 breakout point at 156.75 from a flat base, the iPhone giant is forming a new base with a 165.04 buy point.The stock's weekly chart shows Apple remains a leader and is still carving out a long-term uptrend.Apple, which reports fiscal Q4 results on Nov. 2, has gained 39% after breaking out of a bottoming base on Jan. 6-9. That base was a cup with handle, featuring a 118.12 entry.The Street is expecting long-term acceleration in Apple's fundamentals, a key factor for the stock's market-beating rise so far this year.Earnings are seen rising 8% for all of fiscal 2017 (ended in September) to $9.01 a share, then grow 23% to $11.09 a share in FY 2019 as sales pick up 6% to $227.5 billion and 17% to $265.6 billion.The iPhone giant is expected to begin selling its ultraluxury iPhone X later this week, but analysts have been noting component shortages and production bottlenecks are likely going to make it very difficult for consumers to purchase the $999 smartphone soon.Apple is reportedly meeting with officials at outsourcing manufacturer Foxconn to discuss the issue.First Solar (FSLR) rose more than 2.6% to 48.98. Volume is running mildly above average. The solar power systems supplier to utilities broke out of a deep bottoming base last summer and tried to break out past a 50.31 buy point in September. Since then, the Tempe, Ariz., midcap stock has encountered stiff resistance near 50 for weeks.Earnings are expected to plunge 56% to $2.21 a share this year, then fall an additional 42% to $1.28 in 2018. Revenue is seen rising 4% this year, but then falling 24% in 2018.First Solar's RS Rating is a respectable 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in timesaving IBD tool Stock Checkup.In the IBD 50, longtime member TAL Education (TAL) slid more than 2% in fast turnover, but shares remain above the 50-day moving average. The stock has gained more than 150% since clearing resistance near 14 on a split-adjusted basis.TAL, a specialist in cram schools for Chinese students, broke out at 22.44 in July.RELATED:Halliburton Beats As North America Revenue Nearly DoublesThe Bottoming Base Pattern, And How It Makes Money For TradersFinding Hot Growth Stocks: A Peek Inside IBD 50How To Find Great Stocks: Start Your Journey Here

159,HD,"Large and megacap stocks mostly continued to hold firm amid another whirlwind day of quarterly results. Tesla (TSLA) led the downside among companies reporting as the innovative electric vehicle maker likely posted its biggest quarterly net loss on a per-share basis since it came public in June 2010.XTesla gapped down at the open and slid more than 7% to 297.85. Volume is running nearly four times the usual pace; the big cap trades on average 5.42 million shares each day.Meanwhile, all eyes are on Apple (AAPL) as it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after the close.The stock is behaving well since clearing a new buy point in a decent cup with handle. The classic chart pattern shows a 160.87 buy point. Apple's cup with handle formed next to a flat base created from May to July. The buy point from that base was 156.75, and Apple, currently at 168.43, has lifted 7% above that correct entry. It is less than 5% from the 160.87 entry.The Dow Jones industrial average rallied 0.4%, despite a nearly 2% sell-off in Home Depot (HD). The stock is getting buying support, however, at the 50-day moving average. Home improvement chains fell on reports that President Trump and the GOP are mulling the idea of reducing the mortgage interest deduction from taxes.Eight of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rose 1 point or more, including industrial plays 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) as well as consumer spending bellwethers such as McDonald's (MCD).At 3:45pm ET, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 edged slightly up. The Russell 2000 rose nearly 0.3%.Going back to Tesla, the stock posted a critical sell signal when it fell 7% below a recent breakout past a 370.10 entry in a cup with handle of its own. That base began forming when Tesla peaked at 386.99 on June 23.While that base had a normal-sized decline of 22% from head to toe, one problem with the base was that it revealed numerous sharp declines, including gap downs, in heavy or increasing volume. That's a no-no; you'd prefer a stock to show quiet, smooth price action on a day to day and week to week basis.Those who bought at Tesla's breakout in the spring of 2013 near 50 still hold a very large profit cushion and can afford to hold patiently. The stock is 23% off its 52-week peak of 389.61, and that is not severe.However, two more reasons for newer shareholders to sell include the following:One, the stock is now on the verge of forming a deeper, longer base. It's going to take a while before Tesla will set up again. Keeping shares means that you lose the opportunity to invest in a stock that currently shows more horsepower.Two, Tesla failed to deliver on its promise to rapidly ramp up production and deliveries of its Model 3, its most affordable e-vehicle yet. Now, the company must deliberately slow down production in its highly successful Model S to meet already huge demand for the Model 3. Continued failure to manage institutional investors' expectations and beat them may result in heavier selling among fund managers.Tesla's third-quarter revenue rose 30% to $2.98 billion, which is a quarterly record. However, that gain also represents a deceleration in the top-line growth rate. Sales grew 27%, 22%, 33%, 145%, 88%, 135% and 120% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Elsewhere, Sony (SNE) jacked up more than 3% to 44.91 in heavy turnover, extending its breakout out of a three-month flat base with a 41.75 entry. The base also has elements of a double bottom. From that perspective, the buy point was 40.59, 10 cents above the middle peak within the shallow base.Despite the breakaway gap on Tuesday, one could try to buy as close as possible to that session's opening price of 43.21 because that price was within the proper buy range, up to 5% past the 41.75 flat-base entry.Sony, one of Japan's most famous manufacturers and innovator in the video game space, reported a huge increase in adjusted Q3 profit (90 cents a share vs. 4 cents a year ago) as revenue climbed 10% to $18.3 billion, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least four years.Sony has helped Japan's Nikkei 225 enjoy strong gains in 2017. The Japanese equities benchmark finished 0.5% to 22,539 overnight, extending its year-to-date gain to 17.9%.At 2579, the S&P 500 is up 15.2% since Jan. 1.Returning to Apple, watch to see if the company can not only post another quarter of respectable double-digit earnings growth but also give hints as to whether business can accelerate during the holiday quarter and beyond.Earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.Apple, featured in Stock Market Today columns frequently as it formed a bottoming base in the last quarter of 2016, has risen more than 43% since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.In other financial markets, traders bought U.S. government bonds, pushing yields a touch lower following news that the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in a decade. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond is at 2.35%. President Trump, meanwhile, formally announced he's picked Jerome Powell to replace Janet Yellen as the head of the Federal Reserve.RELATED:Finding Superb Market Outperformers: Inside IBD 50Still The Golden Rule Of SellingWhat Does A Great Cup With Handle Look Like, And Why Does It Make Money For Traders?How To Invest: Use A Stock Checklist, Boost Your Portfolio ReturnHow To Find Excellent Stocks With Investors.com: Start Here

167,HD,"Wall Street saw some rotation out of outperforming technology stocks and some money going into other sectors, particularly finance and banking. Transportation and select retail stocks also gained ground.XThe Dow Jones industrial average paced the upside among major indexes, up around 0.4% as nine of the 30 Dow Jones industrial components rallied 1 point or more. American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs (GS), Home Depot (HD) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) led the Dow's upside amid a gentle uptick in long-term interest rates.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond moved up to 2.38%, a two-week high.The broad-based advance offset a 4.51-point drop by fellow Dow 30 stock Apple (AAPL).The iPhone, iPad and digital services giant is still up from a breakout at 160.97 in a cup-with-handle base. The stock is now back in buy range, but it's preferable to see if Apple can dust itself off after Wednesday's steep fall and rally before considering a new buy.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 was off less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.4% but remains close to its all-time high of 6914.Among the leading industry groups, department store chain, auto parts retailing, airline transport, hospital, home furnishings and medical services stocks all rallied hard, up 2% or more. (See the day-to-day performance of all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD by going to Data Tables in ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com.)The Bitcoin-tracking Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) ETF suffered a negative reversal, rising to as high as 1,823.99 before sliding nearly 4% to 1,414. Volume is running nearly quadruple the normal pace.Despite the drop, Bitcoin Investment Trust is still sharply extended from last week's breakout past a 985.10 buy point in an unusually deep cup with handle.Meanwhile, a bunch of names in the IBD 50, which through Tuesday's close was up more than 39% since Jan. 1 vs. a 17.3% lift for the S&P 500, sold off hard. Many of  the 50 top-rated companies saw losses of 5% or more, including YY Inc. (YY), IPG Photonics (IPGP) and Ichor (ICHR). Yet among these three, only IPG Photonics has issued an IBD-style sell signal.IPG lost as much as 8.7% to a session low of 220.47 before shaving some of those losses. Watch to see how the industrial laser maker closes; the biggest single-session point loss in heavy turnover since the breakout is one key defense-type sell signal.However, as seen in a daily chart, the midcap still holds a decent air pocket above the rising 50-day moving average. So holders with large gains can of course lock in some profits, but they can also see if the stock generates a new high-quality base, which could potentially set up a new breakout.While IPG is showing the type of action that may signal a change in character and good reason to lighten one's exposure, it's still unclear whether the general rally in tech stocks is done or simply taking a well-needed pause.The chip sector certainly got pounded on Wednesday. The Philadelphia semiconductor index at one point fell more than 4%. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX), both part of the IBD Big Cap 20, got pummeled as well.As seen in their daily charts, both of these large-cap leaders in semiconductor equipment have now undercut their respective 50-day moving averages. That alone is not a sell signal, however, as great stocks can recover and eventually move back above the key medium-term support line.In these situations, it's good to examine the weekly action and watch how a leading stock ends on Friday. If stocks such as Applied and Lam can bounce off their weekly lows and finish high in the range, it's a telltale clue that institutional appetite for growth stocks is still healthy.The 50-day moving average for Lam is currently near 197.85; the 50-day line is painted in red on an IBD daily chart. The 10-week moving average, found only on a weekly chart, is also painted in red.Another reason to keep holding tech stocks: Earnings are strong and revenue is likely to keep increasing in the current quarter. Plus, some observers are noting stable economic growth in the EU despite controversy over Brexit and problems for Germany to create a new coalition government. In the U.S., GDP growth is accelerating.A third reason: IBD's current outlook for the market, for now, remains ""Confirmed uptrend.""

179,HD,"The Dow Jones industrial average edged nearly 0.2% higher in afternoon trading Monday, thanks in part to strength in 3M (MMM), Home Depot (HD) and insurance giant Travelers (TRV), all of which rose 1 point or more. The other major indexes showed tiny pullbacks after nifty advances during Thanksgiving Week.X Meanwhile, the IPO market continued to bolster investors' returns as streaming video hardware pioneer Roku (ROKU) surged more than 10% to 44.71. The small-cap member of IBD's Consumer Products-Electronics industry group is up 49% since charging out of a first-stage IPO base at 29.90 on Nov. 10.Roku has lost money in all but one of the past 11 quarters, but sales have been brisk, rising 17%, 28%, 19% and 40% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees the Los Gatos, Calif., firm losing 10 cents a share in Q4 vs. a 3-cent profit in the year-ago quarter.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500, up nearly 1% during last week's four-day session, was virtually flat as gains by consumer electronics retail, homebuilder, solar, internet content and select food stocks offset declines in the oil and gas, cement, metal ores, generic drug, outpatient and home care, and long-term medical care industries.The small-cap S&P 600 lost 0.4%; it was down nearly 0.6% in the early going. The Nasdaq composite was virtually flat after lifting more than 1% last week.Volume is running higher on both main exchanges following Friday's half-day session.On the NYSE, Square (SQ) slid more than 11% to 43.44 in massive turnover. At 2 p.m. ET, more than 49 million shares had already changed hands, vs. its 50-day average turnover of 11.5 million and running at more than six times the usual pace. The midcap tech has a market value of $16 billion and a float of 255 million shares.The 5.42-point drop in heavy volume is Square's largest in a single session since the stock initially broke out in late February. That stands as a mid- and near-term sell signal. (On the IBD daily chart, the red line running across the volume bars is the 50-day moving average.)As noted in a Big Picture column last week, Square has been a truly outstanding performer in 2017. Briefly noted on IBD Leaderboard, the point-of-sale, data analytics and financial services firm for small and midsize businesses has climbed as much as 75% since breaking out of a nearly seven-week flat base with a 28.07 entry in September.However, the rally gained a near-vertical slope in recent weeks, and a 42% jump over just 10 sessions (from the Nov. 9 intraday low of 34.83) was one sign of climax-run-type action.Notice how on Friday, despite the market being open just 3-1/2 hours, Square saw heavy turnover but failed to make further headway. Such stalling action indicated that some institutional investors were selling into strength.Shareholders who prefer to make short- or midterm trades may decide to sell, especially if Square closes below its short-term 10-day moving average. (The IBD Leaderboard charts show the 10-day line in green.)Others with more conviction may decide to be patient and see if a new base will form. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is still trying to catch up, currently near 34.72. A drop to the 50-day line's current level from a 49.55 high would be equal to roughly a 30% correction, and that's not out of line for a new base to form after such a powerful advance.On Feb. 23, Square bolted out of a first-stage flat-base pattern with a 15.59 buy point in massive volume after the hardware and software tech play posted Q4 earnings of 5 cents a share, its best quarterly result ever, and a 21% jump in revenue to $452 million.The Street sees earnings rising 40% to 7 cents in the fourth quarter this year. Square currently gets a top-notch 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup and a 99 for Relative Price Strength on a scale of 1 to 99; but keep in mind that the Composite, EPS, RS, SMR and Accumulation/Distribution ratings are best used to determine which stocks to buy, and not when to sell.Elsewhere, Dow Jones industrial components Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also showed healthy action, with the former rallying nearly 0.5% to 83.78 and keeping a healthy upward price gap that it produced four weeks ago. The software, cloud-computing and Xbox giant is up 47% since hauling out of a saucerlike base sitting next to a longer base over a few weeks in late July.Microsoft also produced tight trading after the breakout, yielding follow-on buy points at the 10-week moving average and ultrashallow flat bases.Cisco rallied more than 1% and gained further ground after a recent breakout from a saucer with handle at 34.20. The data networking and telecom gear giant recently gave a bullish sales forecast for the current fiscal year that ends in July 2018. Wall Street currently expects FY 2018 sales to rise just 1% to $48.5 billion, but that would mark a slight turnaround after a 3% drop in FY 2017.CFO Kelly Kramer noted in a Nov. 14 news release that the company returned $3.1 billion through share buybacks and cash dividends. On an annualized basis, that would be equivalent to 6.8% of the company's $182 billion market value.Elsewhere in other markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 1.4% to $58.21 a barrel on the Nymex. Last week, oil fell short of retaking the $60 level, last seen in late May of 2015.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged up to 2.33%, unchanged since the start of October. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter point during its final FOMC meeting of the year, scheduled on Dec. 12-13.IBD's TAKE: Even with new IPOs, there's a right way and wrong way to buy such stocks.

180,HD,"Shares of Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and homebuilders such as Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI) and luxury operator Toll Bros. (TOL) fell intraday on news that the House Republican tax plan would cap the mortgage interest deduction at $500,000, down from $1 million. But the stocks closed well off session lows.The reduced mortgage deduction cap would only apply to new mortgages.Lennar fell 3.3%, undercutting a recent buy point, while D.R. Horton ended down just 0.2% on the stock market today. Lennar and D.R. Horton sell a lot of cheaper homes targeting first-time buyers. KB Home (KBH) lost 3.05%. Toll Bros., which targets low-end luxury homes, tumbled 6.05%. D.R. Horton, KB Home and Toll are extended from buy points.Home Depot fell 1.6% after testing a recent buy point and its 50-day moving average intraday. Rival home improvement chain Lowe's sank 4.1%, tumbling through its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.While property taxes would be deductible, state and local income taxes would not. Along with a larger standard deduction, that would reduce incentives for some taxpayers to itemize deductions, including mortgage interest.Expect the housing industry, including home builders and realtors, to fight the tax bill in whole or in part.RELATED:House GOP Tax Bill Takes Aim At Big Tech And Big PharmaHouse Tax-Reform Bill Leaves 401(k) Contribution Caps In PlaceThis Is Why The GOP Tax Plan Will Lead To Higher Property TaxesThe GOP's Secret, Risky Strategy For Corporate Tax Cuts

181,HD,"Major stock indexes were mixed and mostly unchanged in afternoon trading Thursday as Wall Street weighed earnings from Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA) and Tesla (TSLA), as well as details from a new House GOP tax plan.XThe Dow Jones industrial average edged higher by 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell by the same amount. Small caps firmed up, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking higher than Wednesday's levels, more so on the Nasdaq.In the stock market today, shares of Tesla (TSLA) crashed 7% on an earnings miss, plus news that the company is cutting Model X and Model S production to clear up Model 3 bottlenecks.Facebook (FB), meanwhile, gave back 2% to 178.59, but it's still holding above a 175.59 buy point. Facebook's 50-day moving average of around 172 is a key support level to watch.Shares of Leaderboard name Alibaba (BABA) reversed lower despite another strong quarter. Shares were down 0.2% to 185.85. It's still holding above a 177.10 buy point of a rare ascending base.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba currently ranks No. 12 in the IBD 50, a great source of stocks to put on your watchlist and find true market leaders. As seen in a graph on page B4 of the print edition of IBD Weekly, the price-weighted IBD 50 shows a total return of 750% from April 11, 2003, to Dec. 31, 2016, equal to an average annual gain of 16.9%. The S&P 500 has risen 242% over the same period.In economic news, weekly jobless claims fell unexpectedly to 229,000 ahead of Friday's jobs report, where nonfarm payrolls are seen rising 325,000, but the consensus estimate range is pretty wide at 200,000 to 371,000. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%.Meanwhile, details of the House GOP tax bill were released Thursday. Home-improvement retailers like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) sold off on news that a popular mortgage interest deduction would be cut in half. Wall Street took that to mean that homeowners might have less money in their pocket to make home improvements. Shares of Home Depot paid a visit to the 50-day moving average, falling nearly 2%. Lowe's crashed 4%.At 3 p.m. ET, President Trump is widely expected to name Jerome Powell, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, as the new Fed chief.After the close, watch for earnings from Apple (AAPL). Shares added 0.4% to 167.58 ahead of the results.

182,HD,"Retailers officially kicked off the holiday season on Friday with doorbuster sales using discounted consumer electronics as an incentive for shoppers to join the crowds at stores after Thanksgiving.X Tech products being touted in Black Friday sales included 4K ultra-high-definition televisions, smart speakers, video game consoles, and Apple (AAPL) devices, such as iPhones and iPads.""Given recent innovations such as the iPhone X, Apple Watch Series 3 with cellular and Apple TV 4K, combined with a strong Mac, iPad, AirPods and Beats lineup, Apple is our top pick for the holidays,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a note to clients Friday.In its one-day Black Friday shopping event, Apple was offering Apple gift cards worth up to $100 with the purchase of iPad tablets, up to $50 with older-model iPhones and up to $25 with older-model Apple Watches. It also offered Apple gift cards worth up to $150 with the purchase of select Mac computers.Apple wasn't discounting its latest devices, namely the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X smartphones and Apple Watch Series 3 smartwatches with cellular capability. But several retailers offered deals on those devices.Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) on Friday offered a $300 Wal-Mart gift card with the purchase of iPhone 8 and iPhone X handsets with wireless contracts from AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). Target (TGT) was offering $250 gift cards for iPhone 8 purchases with qualifying service plans.Kohl's (KSS) was offering $90 store credit with the purchase of the Apple Watch Series 3.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

183,HD,"Regulations: When FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced plans to repeal the Obama administration's heavy-handed ""net neutrality"" regulations, critics acted as if the world were coming to an end. Actual consumers, however, aren't likely to notice any difference, because the ""problem"" those rules were supposed to solve has always been wildly exaggerated.X Net neutrality sounds at first blush like a noble goal. Internet service providers shouldn't, the argument goes, be allowed to favor some traffic over others, either by throttling speeds, charging more or taking any other action that discriminates against bits of data crossing their network.But to enforce the rules, the Obama administration had to treat ISPs as if they were monopoly phone providers, which let the government not only impose net neutrality requirements, but gave it sweeping authority to regulate everything the ISPs did.Never mind that, unlike Ma Bell of the 1930s, the internet is highly competitive, with cable, fiber, fixed wireless, satellite and mobile carriers all offering broadband services. Or that the decade before the Obama rules went into effect provided no justification for the rules.Between 2005 and 2015, average broadband speeds increased by more than 1,150%, FCC data show. Over those same years, average broadband prices remained flat, after adjusting for inflation.Meanwhile, household broadband penetration went from 30% to almost 80%, according to the Pew Research Center. And this figure doesn't include households that rely on mobile for their high-speed internet access, a share that has also exploded in recent years.Where is the consumer harm in any of this?Yet multiple headlines warned that going back to the world before 2015 would amount to ""destroying the internet as we know it."" CNET, for example, warned ominously that ""net neutrality repeal means your internet may never be the same.""But the warnings always are about what ISPs ""might do,"" not what they've actually done, or would have any business justification for doing. In other cases the consumer harm is debatable.One fear cited, for example, is that ISPs would start charging tiered prices for different services, rather than a flat rate for all of them. Even if they did, so what?For years, these same consumer advocates were blasting cable companies for not offering a-la-cart cable programming, forcing consumers to buy access to channels they didn't want.What's more, big content providers pushing to keep net neutrality rules use tiered pricing. Netflix, for example, charges almost twice as much for a plan that includes Ultra HD videos as it does for its basic non-HD service.And tiered pricing is arguably more fair to consumers than bulk pricing. Why should someone who doesn't use the internet to stream videos have to pay the same price as someone who streams ultra-HD programming 24/7?While net neutrality advocates can't provide specifics on how consumers benefit from the rules, we know for certain what the net neutrality regime would produce if left in place — stifling government regulations.The first big regulation to come out of the FCC had nothing to do with net neutrality, but was a costly privacy rule imposed on cable companies. And the first ""blatant"" net neutrality violation cited by advocates was against T-Mobile (TMUS) for offering … wait for it … unlimited streaming video.Why? Because T-Mobile offered a cheaper rate to customers willing to watch videos on their phones in 480p, instead of higher quality HD that hogs far more bandwidth.The horror!The net neut crowd also claims that the regulations haven't impinged on the industry's investment in their networks. There's disagreement about this. One side suggests that investment dropped 5% after the rules went into effect, the other says it's had no impact.This debate is  pointless at the moment, since the rules haven't been in effect long enough. But even advocates admit that the rules could be a problem.TechCrunch, a snarky tech trends website, tried to debunk all the ""myths"" about net neutrality regulations. But the author says it ""is certainly possible"" that the regulatory costs pose a burden for small ISPs. And all he could muster was to say he was ""skeptical"" about industry complaints that no-blocking and no-throttling rules would prevent useful services from being rolled out.Given the FCC's history, the only thing to be skeptical about is reassurances that its rules and mandates wouldn't ultimately hamper innovation and hurt consumers. As we have pointed out in detail in this space, that has been the main outcome of the FCC's 80 years of regulating the telecommunication industry. It stalled the growth of TV, tied the cable industry in regulatory knots for years, blocked phone companies from providing video services, and delayed the introduction of cellphones by at least a decade.The idea that letting the FCC put its regulatory boot on ISPs would somehow spur growth and innovation is pure fantasy.FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai said it best when he called net neutrality ""a solution that won't work to a problem that doesn't exist.""Consumers should be glad that someone with that much common sense is calling the shots there.RELATED:A Tale Of Two Decisions: Trump Administration Got Antitrust Wrong, But Net Neutrality Right After Choking Telecom Innovation For 80 Years, FCC Plans To Take On The Internet Net Neutrality's Days Are Numbered, And That's A Good Thing Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

184,HD,"Stocks hit record highs during the holiday-shortened week. Black Friday kicked off holiday shopping, while several retailers reported earnings, including Lowe's (LOW) and Dollar Tree (DLTR), along with tech giants Salesforce.com (CRM), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). The Justice Department moved to block the AT&T (T)-Time Warner (TWX) merger, while the FCC signaled it'll pare back net neutrality rules. Marvell Technology (MRVL) agreed to buy Cavium (CAVM) for $6 billion.X The Nasdaq rose 1.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow climbed 0.9%, all setting all-time highs. Higher oil prices lifted energy stocks while Apple (AAPL) had solid gains and the Marvell-Cavium deal kept chips rallying. Earnings were mixed, with Salesforce, HP, HPE falling on results or guidance.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereThe Justice Department said the megamerger would harm consumers because the combined media-and-telecom giant might extract higher prices for Time Warner (TWX) content from other video distributors, or try to withhold content from emerging rivals. The DOJ has asked AT&T (T) to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval. AT&T rejected the DOJ's claims and proposed conditions, suggesting President Trump's animus toward Time Warner-owned CNN was a key factor. The DOJ's move could chill other big mergers, analysts say. AT&T and Time Warner rose about 1%.Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) fell 7% Wednesday on weak guidance and CEO Meg Whitman's decision to step down on Feb. 1 amid ongoing restructuring. Antonio Neri, who was named president in June, will replace Whitman. October quarter earnings and revenue topped lowered expectations. But for the January quarter, HPE forecast adjusted EPS of 22 cents at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 28 cents. HPE has sold off its software and enterprise services businesses to focus on servers, networking and data storage hardware but faces stiff competition from Cisco (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT).The PC and printer maker's fiscal Q4 revenue rose 11% to $13.9 billion. But earnings only met views for a 22% gain and  HP Inc. (HPQ) gave in line guidance, raising concerns about the company's growth outlook. HP shares fell 5% Wednesday.Marvell Technology (MRVL) announced a deal to buy fellow chipmaker Cavium (CAVM) for more than $6 billion to create an ""infrastructure solutions powerhouse"" in communications and data centers. Marvell agreed to pay $40 and 2.1757 Marvell common shares for each Cavium share, or $91.78 as of Friday's close. Both stocks rose sharply after gaining earlier in the month on reports that a deal was close.Salesforce.com (CRM) reported Q3 earnings surged 62% to 39 cents a share, with revenue rising 25% to $2.68 billion, both topping. But for the January quarter, Salesforce.com forecast adjusted earnings of 32-33 cents a share vs. estimates of 34 cents a share. Salesforce.com named Bret Taylor, a former chief technology officer at Facebook (FB), as president and chief product officer. Salesforce.com acquired startup Quip, where Taylor was CEO, last year. Salesforce.com named Alex Dayon chief strategy officer. Salesforce shares fell 1.8% Wednesday but just edged lower for the week, right at record highs.The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission moved closer to dismantling the Obama administration's net neutrality rules. The FCC aims to increase broadband investment by cable TV companies and other internet service providers. The FCC will vote Dec. 14 on Chairman Ajit Pai's proposal to scrap public-utility-type Title 2 regulations that were foisted on ISPs. ISPs may be able to charge content providers or business partners fees for ""prioritized"" services. Some regulatory authority on consumer protection could shift to the Federal Trade Commission. Pai says new ""transparency"" rules will protect consumers.RELATED:Why FCC Net-Neutrality Reversal Could Later Be Reversed AgainPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Q1 earnings rose 34% while revenue swelled 27% to $505.5 million, both topping the consensus. The cybersecurity firm guided December-quarter estimates slightly higher. Shares jumped 5.55%. Palo Alto's solid quarter followed soft sales and disappointing guidance from other computer software security providers.On Monday, Roche (RHHBY) unveiled upbeat data from trials in immuno-oncology and hemophilia A — sending its shares up 8.6%. But Dow stock Merck (MRK) fell to an 18-month low after Roche's combination of Tecentriq, cancer drug Avastin and chemotherapy helped reduce the risk of disease worsening or death in patients with advanced lung cancer. Merck's Keytruda-and-chemo combo was approved in May. Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) lost nearly 10% as Roche said its Hemlibra significantly reduced bleeds in a Phase 3 study of hemophilia A.Malls were crowded on the traditional holiday kickoff even as online and mobile shopping continues to grow rapidly and retailers of all kinds touted deals well before Black Friday. Amazon (AMZN) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are expected to do well, but it will be a critical holiday season for Macy's (M) and other department stores.Dollar Tree (DLTR) Q3 EPS jumped 25% to $1.01 with sales up 6.4% to $5.32 billion, both beating Street estimates. The deep discounter sees Q4 EPS of $1.80-$1.89 vs. consensus views for $1.80, on sales of $6.32 billion-$6.43 billion vs. consensus views for $6.36 billion. Shares leapt 4%, hitting new highs. Off-price apparel chain Burlington Stores (BURL) Q3 EPS soared 40% to 70 cents, beating views but sales only rose 6.6% to $1.438 billion, just short. Same-store sales climbed 3.1%. Shares fell 3% for the week after hitting record highs Monday.Urban Outfitters (URBN) earnings unexpectedly rose in the latest quarter. The young-adult clothier's reported earnings of 41 cents, up 3% vs. a year ago, on sales of $893 million, up 4%. Analysts were expecting EPS to slide 18% to 33 cents. Guess (GES) topped earnings views but revenue fell short. DSW (DSW) reported a 12% EPS drop that missed views, with the shoe retailer also giving weak guidance. Urban Outfitters hit an 11-month high while Guess and DSW tumbled below recent buy points.Shares of recent IPO Qudian (QD), Yirendai (YRD) and other China-based providers of online credit plunged on reports that China authorities had ordered a suspension of online small-loan approvals. The rapid expansion of consumer loans, especially on online microloan platforms, has raised concerns among financial regulators.Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) third-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales beat estimates, helped by higher home-repair demand in the wake of the summer's string of hurricanes. But shares fell, with some analysts saying Wall Street may have wanted more acceleration following a weak second quarter, and expressing concerns about thinner margins and its outlook for the year. Earlier this month, larger rival Home Depot (HD) beat views and raised its full-year forecast.The QuickBooks and TurboTax maker's earnings leapt 83% as revenue grew 14% to $886 million in the October fiscal first quarter, easily beating views. For the current quarter, Intuit (INTU) guided to adjusted earnings per share of 33 cents on sales of $1.17 billion, modestly above analyst models. Shares fell 3.8% on Tuesday following earnings after hitting a record Monday. Intuit lost 1.7% for the week.Durable goods orders, which tend to be volatile, fell in October after a big gain in September. Core capital goods orders dipped, but the business investment proxy jumped vs. a year earlier. October existing-home sales rose 2% to an annual rate of 5.48 million, slightly above views, as hurricane impacts fade. Janet Yellen confirmed she'll step down from the Federal Reserve's board when her term as the central bank's chief ends early next year.

188,HD,"Major indexes cooled again in afternoon trading Wednesday, but the week-to-date decline remains mild. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, suffered its first gap down in price in more than four weeks, putting shares nearly back into the proper buy zone.XApple, up more than 46% year to date despite losing ground for a fifth straight session, had recently bolted out of a new, very shallow cup with handle at 160.97. The 5% buy zone goes up to 169.02.At Wednesday's intraday low, the iPhone, iMac and digital services marketer was at 168.38, 4.6% above the proper entry. But it's best to avoid buying while the stock is still trending down.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite fell nearly 0.6%, losing some of its strong bounce off early-morning lows. The Nasdaq had been down nearly 1% following a sell-off in East Asian equity markets. U.S. Treasury bonds rallied, sending the benchmark 10-year note's yield down around 5 basis points to 2.33%.Week to date, the Nasdaq is down nearly 0.6%, adding to last week's 0.2% dip. But the tech-rich index is still up 3.3% since the beginning of the fourth quarter.The Nasdaq 100, which tracks the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on the all-electronic exchange, is up 4.7% since Oct. 1.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also lost a little more than 0.5%. Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and Home Depot (HD) led the downside for the 30-stock Dow Jones industrials, each falling 2 points or more.Truck transport, major discount chain retailing, chipmaker, cement, heavy construction, airfreight and chemical stocks paced the market's downside.The Dow transports slipped nearly 0.6% as a rally in airlines helped cushion the fall.The Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index, meaning that point moves, up or down, in triple-digit-priced stocks have more influence over the benchmark than, say, General Electric (GE). GE is up 1.5%, but the 26-cent gain has less impact.Back to Apple, which also has a big influence over the Dow. The megacap tech may be falling in response to reports of some users of the new iPhone X experiencing eye pain due to the newly enhanced OLED screen. Or investors may be reacting to news that retail sales in China, a key Apple market, rose 10% in October, missing a consensus estimate of 10.5% as reported by Bloomberg.Whatever the true reason may be, Apple continues to act like a big-cap leader should.In addition to continuing a string of higher highs and higher lows, Apple is still trading on the north side of both its 50- and 200-day moving averages. Plus, both of those averages continue to rise.Apple's Relative Price Strength Rating (see it, track it at IBD Stock Checkup or on an IBD daily chart) is now a solid 86, meaning that over the past 12 months, it's outperformed 86% of all companies in IBD's database.Apple also leads the Telecom-Consumer Products group with a 93 Composite Rating in IBD Stock Checkup. (Read this recent Stock Market Today column for five reasons why a long-term shareholder in Apple should continue to sit on shares.)Meanwhile, Inogen (INGN) may represent one of a new batch of emerging stock market leaders. The respiratory care products expert is hardly budging after gapping out of a seven-week flat base at 105.45 last week. The breakaway gap followed a strong third-quarter report (adjusted earnings up 32% to 33 cents a share, revenue up 27% to $69 million).Goleta, Calif.-based Inogen, a small cap at $2.5 billion in market value, is also up more than 70% past a 69.45 entry in a superb eight-week flat base. Inogen cleared that base in late February.Four more stocks that are showing strength after breaking out are Applied Materials (AMAT), which reports quarterly results Thursday; Sector Leader MKS Instruments (MKSI), which cleared a new cup with handle at 86.70 in September; Nvidia (NVDA), which on Tuesday returned to Sector Leaders, IBD's most stringent quantitative growth stock screen; and variety retailer Five Below (FIVE), which cleared a four-month cup without a handle at 54.23 in late September.Applied is part of IBD Big Cap 20, currently ranked No. 3 on that list.RELATED:Apple's iPhone X Screen Is Giving Some Users HeadachesStock Market Today: 5 Reasons To Keep Holding AppleThe Latest In Investor's Corner: Are You Using This Feature To Capture Breakouts?Stocks Near A Buy Zone

189,HD,"The major market indexes held modest gains Monday ahead of a federal tax reform vote later this week, as General Electric (GE) weighed on blue chips.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) was up 0.2%, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) were up 0.1% each. Foreign stocks lagged with iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA) fell 0.5%.General Electric weighed on the Dow with an 8% drop after the diversified giant offered weak profit guidance and slashed its dividend by half. But Procter & Gamble (PG), McDonald's (MCD) and Home Depot (HD) added about 1% each.Banks, utilities and metals miners led the upside among sector funds in the stock market today. SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) rose more than 1% apiece as they traded near their 50-day moving average lines.SPDR Utilities (XLU) added 1%, clearing a 56 flat-base buy point. Shares advanced 2% from a mid-August breakout from a flat base to the start of the most recent pattern.SPDR Consumer Staples (XLP), which holds P&G and Wal-Mart, gained 0.5%. It retook its 50-day line on Friday and is 4% below its 52-week high as it works on the right side of a five-month flat base.Energy, retail and biotech underperformed.If you like dividends, here are several funds to check out, including one that owns big yielders like AT&T (T) and IBM (IBM).The top two dividend exchange traded fund performers this year are focused outside the U.S. WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend (DFE) led with a 28.9% year-to-date gain through Nov. 8, followed by WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend's (DFJ) 28.1% return. Both funds have outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin.The rest of the list is predominantly composed of U.S. ETFs. Two other foreign plays made the 13-fund cut: SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) and SPDR S&P International Dividend (DWX), with respective YTD returns of 18.1% and 15.8%.The No. 3 spot was claimed by WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW), which was up 21% through Nov. 8. IShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO) was fifth with a 17.7% gain.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.Most of these dividend funds are extended from a buy point. But SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), the last name on the list, is pulling back toward its 50-day moving average. If it finds support there and stages a solid rebound off the line, that would set up a potential buy area.Shares advanced 3% from a late September breakout to its Oct. 24 intraday high. Or, taken from its last touch of the 50-day line in early September, SDY rose more than 5%.While the fund's 9.8% YTD gain lags the S&P 500 index, its three-year average annual return of 10.2% is in line with the broader index's 10.8%. SDY offers a higher annualized yield of 2.4% vs. the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout.Consumer staples accounted for SDY's biggest sector weighting as of Nov. 8 at nearly 16% of assets. Industrials made up 15%, financials 14%, and utilities and consumer discretionary, 11% each. Top holdings included Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT), AT&T and IBM. Those three stocks yield annualized dividends of 6%, 5.9% and 4%, respectively.The 12-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, has amassed $16 billion in assets. Its expense ratio is 0.35%. The index is designed to measure the performance of companies in the S&P 1500 that have consistently increased dividends every year for at least 20 years.Thursday's pick, ProShares Ultra Russell 2000 (UWM), is still testing support at its 50-day line.RELATED:These 3 Sectors Buck Sell-Off; High-Octane Play Near Buy Point?

191,HD,"The major averages turned in a narrowly mixed finish Tuesday after weak company earnings and strong economic news left stocks battling to a stalemate.X The Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1% despite the day's powerful performance by Apple (AAPL). The S&P 500 slipped a fraction into the red, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended the session clinging to a faint gain.Preliminary data showed overall volume was quiet, lower on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq relative to Monday's action.Stocks received some positive strokes from economic news, with better-than-expected July retail sales growth and a surge in New York region manufacturing. Growth in business inventories outpaced estimates for June, and the National Association of Homebuilders' Home Price Index rebounded to 28 in August, a three-month high.That may have helped Apple pull off its 1.1% gain, while among FANG names, Facebook (FB) rose 0.15%. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) lost 0.1% as Netflix (NFLX) dropped 1.5%, approaching its buy point.The Dow saw some big moves in both directions, as Apple, American Express (AXP) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) climbed 1.5% and 0.8%, respectively%.Home Depot (HD) commanded the Dow's downside, falling nearly 3% after earnings and revenue comfortably topped second-quarter estimates, but an increase in comparable sales guidance suggested slowing in the latter half of the year. The loss sent shares below their 10-week moving average in heavy trade, triggering a sell signal.Among the few winners to rise on earnings results, China-based Holisys Automation Technology (HOLI) churned out a 5.4% gain, despite a weak fiscal fourth-quarter report late Monday. The gain moved shares further up the right side of an 11-month cup base.The overwhelming majority of companies reporting quarterly results suffered losses, with Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) down 23%, Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) off 20% and Coach (COH) posting a 15% decline. Photronics (PLAB) took the headline hit among tech names, down 20%.On the Nasdaq 100, retailers posted the session's two heaviest losses: Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) dropped 5%, while Ulta Beauty (ULTA) scratched off 4%.Leading the Nasdaq 100, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) rattled off a third straight gain, up 2%, to move into extended territory on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.IBD 50 stocks saw both good and bad on Tuesday.At the top of the list, Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) kicked out a 3% gain, leaving it just below a 107.45 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. Also on the list, RealPage (RP), National Beverage (FIZZ) and Alibaba Group (BABA) rose more than 2% apiece.At the bottom of the IBD 50, China's YY (YY) dived 9% on a stock offering plan. And Nova Measuring Instruments (NVMI) shed more than 3%, slipping back below its 10-week line of support.RELATED:Why This Networking Firm's Shares Jumped To A Two-Month HighWill Cisco Explain Why Telco Pacts Aren't Providing Relief?Cisco, Target To Report; 2 Others In Or Near Buy Zones: Investing Action PlanArista Networks Smashes Estimates; Stock Soars After Hours

192,HD,"Home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD) on Tuesday reported second-quarter results that beat views but analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.XEstimates: Earnings per share of $2.21, up 12%, on revenue of $27.81 billion, a 5% increase, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales are seen up 4.9% overall and 5.4% in the U.S., according to Consensus Metrix.Results: EPS of $2.25 on revenue of $28.11 billion.

193,HD,"Outlook: Full-year EPS of $7.29, up from a prior view of $7.15, on revenue growth of 5.3%, up from a prior view of 4.6%. Analysts see EPS of $7.24 on revenue growth of 5.1%. Full-year comp sales are seen up 5.5% vs. its previous estimate of 4.6%.""The firm's current outlook implies the same-store sales growth will slow over the remainder of 2017 to a mid-single-digit pace (around 5%), which we still view as impressive, given the rather lengthy housing cycle upswing and the maturity of this particular business model,"" according to a research note from Morningstar. ""However, in the longer term and over cycles, we forecast Home Depot same-store sales averaging around 3%, leading to operating margins that rise to more than 16% over our forecast, from 14.2% in 2016.""Stock: Shares fell 2.8% to 149.96 in afternoon trading in the stock market today, despite the strong results. The stock has been making its way through a flat base with a 160.96 buy point. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports next week, retreated 3.4% to 75.11.The declines also came despite other upbeat data from the housing sector. The National Association of Home Builders' housing market index climbed to 68 in August from 64 in July, topping forecasts for 65.Home Depot and Lowe's sank on July 20, after Sears (SHLD) announced that it would sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN), a move that some investors saw as a threat to the home improvement retailers, which sell appliances themselves.CFRA analyst Efraim Levy said the companies' focus on the contractors and other customers who make up Home Depot's ""Pro"" business would help keep it Amazon-resistant.RELATED:Amazon Teams Up With Sears, And A New Retail Group TumblesLowe's Guides Low Amid Weak Q1 Results, Housing Data

194,HD,"RH (RH), otherwise known as Restoration Hardware, clobbered earnings forecasts and lifted full-year guidance late Wednesday, as management touted a new model for retailing and upside from its inventory and distribution restructuring.XEstimates: A 24% profit rise to 47 cents a share on 13% sales gains to $613 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.

In addition, RH is exploring the use of its own trucks and drivers for ""last-mile"" delivery, reducing return rates, damages, and deliveries per order.Friedman also hinted at a new way of retailing that could be immune to disruption from Amazon (AMZN) and the e-commerce onslaught.""We believe our ability to seamlessly integrate our multiple businesses with a dynamic food and beverage experience is a revolutionary new retail model that cannot be replicated online, one that activates all of the senses and drives significant customer traffic, as witnessed by the line of diners wrapped around the block on weekends at our Chicago Gallery at the Historic 3Arts Club,"" he said.Stock: RH shot up 39% late. Shares closed down 0.6% at 49.42 on the stock market today and have been on a week-long win streak, rebounding off the 200-day line, after tumbling below their 50-day moving average at the start of August.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Fellow upper-tier home decor peer Williams-Sonoma (WSM) beat quarterly estimates and guided Q3 high last month as e-commerce revenue growth outpaced retail growth. Shares finished 0.6% higher Wednesday, and have climbed more than 10% since its strong Q2 report. It rallied 1.5% after hours.The revenue potential of home furnishings has caught the eye of a number of retailers, like Lululemon (LULU), which didn't traditionally sell decor. The yogawear maker recently launched an Ivivva home furnishing line on PBteen, which appears aimed at female teens and tweens.Target (TGT) is adding to its home decor offerings with a new private-label line, Project 62, launching this fall.RELATED:JinkoSolar, HD Supply, RH, Beige Book Due: Investing Action PlanRH Clears Key Benchmark, Hitting 90-Plus RS RatingRetail & E-Commerce Stocks And Industry News

195,HD,"Can the stock market continue to rise?That's one of the biggest questions investors have in mind. While the U.S. stock market is at record highs and scored double-digit gains this year, international markets overall have outperformed.XSage Advisory Services, an Austin, Texas-based registered investment advisor that oversees more than $12 billion in assets, sees the potential for further upside.""Equities posted a strong year thus far across virtually all major region, style and size segments,"" Komson Silapachai, vice president of research and portfolio strategy at Sage, told IBD."" Through the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a favorable environment for equities due to an improved global economic picture and gradual policy normalization among global central banks.""But he cautions that a pause is always possible. Here are Silapachai's three best ETF investment ideas, in his own words:Recent elements suggest more caution tactically, as valuations have continued to climb and positive catalysts such as the French election are now behind us. Additionally, progress on the fiscal/tax-cut front in the U.S. has not materialized in earnest. These factors, combined with very low volatility and typically unfavorable summer seasonals, may increase the odds of a consolidation, but we ultimately believe it would be short-lived.On a global basis, corporate earnings have recovered after an ""earnings recession"" in 2015-16. Additionally, the major global developed and emerging-market economies are growing in a synchronous fashion, but not overheating to the extent that would compel central banks to tighten aggressively.Given our macro view, we continue to favor global equity exposure with emphasis on two themes that should endure through the end of the year: international outperformance and increased investor focus on sustainability.International developed and emerging-market equities have outperformed U.S. equities through the first seven months of the year. If this feels unusual — it is. U.S. equities have outperformed their international counterparts for four consecutive years, and in seven of the last nine years. We think that international markets should continue to outperform due to the positive global growth backdrop, positive inflows into international equities after years of outflows, and central-bank policy divergence.We prefer local-market equity exposure through iShares Hedged MSCI EAFE (HEFA) as a way to express exposure to international developed markets as we believe the U.S. dollar has room to bounce after declining for much of 2017.Within emerging markets, we like Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) as an efficient way to gain broad exposure to EM equities.Within U.S. equities, we like iShares MSCI USA ESG Select (SUSA) as an exposure to broad U.S. equities as well as to a broader theme among investors today: sustainable investment. Sustainable corporate practices are increasingly more important to investors, have grown significantly over the past five years, and are being more widely accepted as a way to manage corporate-specific downside risk due to environmental, social, or governance issues.RELATED:Strategist Offers 3 Best 'Creative And Cautious' Investment Ideas

198,HD,"A strong performance by shares of Apple (AAPL) helped lift the Nasdaq composite to a gain of around 0.5% in afternoon trading.XShares of the tech bellwether and iPhone maker were up 3% to 173.30 after the company reported its fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings and sales growth late Thursday. It's too late to buy Apple now, though, because the stock is extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point.Gains in the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were more muted, at around 0.1% to 0.2% each. The Russell 2000 was mostly flat. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Thursday's levels.Merck (MRK), Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart (WMT) were strong gainers in the Dow, along with Apple, with gains of around 1%.Four names ranked inside the top 10 of the latest IBD 50 reported earnings.

Stamps.com (STMP) was the sore spot, slumping 20% to 175.40 despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and a 24% jump in sales to $115.1 million.Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) was up 1% in afternoon trading.Wall Street's focus early was also on the October jobs report. The headline jobs number missed expectations, but all in all, it was a decent report with some hurricane-related noise. Nonfarm payrolls rose 261,000 in October, below the consensus estimate of 325,000. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 4.1%, while August and September job growth was revised higher by a total of 90,000.

200,HD,"The major indexes closed mixed Thursday, a session in which Washington was at the center of Wall Street's attention.The Nasdaq edged down a fraction. The S&P 500 was up a fraction. The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.4% increase. Dow component Intel (INTC) hit a new high as it extended an explosive advance since it broke out of a base on Oct. 2. Market volume rose from Wednesday's levels, according to early numbers.XPresident Trump nominated Fed Governor Jerome Powell to succeed Janet Yellen as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Powell's nomination had been rumored, and the stock market had no reaction when Trump confirmed the move Thursday afternoon. Powell is not expected to deviate much from Yellen's policy map.Also in Washington, D.C., Republican leaders unveiled a tax reform package that includes new tax brackets. One provision limits the deduction for mortgage interest to $500,000, which sent homebuilding stocks down sharply.The  industry group, which had been No. 1 out of 197, fell more than 2% and was one of the day's weakest. Building products and other construction-related stocks also were widely lower along with home improvement chains Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW).Earlier at the White House, Trump and Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan announced the semiconductor company will move its headquarters back to the U.S. Broadcom shares were little changed as the stock tries to climb back to its 259.46 buy point, where shares broke out Monday.Health care, auto retailers and some technology industry groups led Thursday's market.Financials performed well, and several real estate investment trusts broke out of bases.Equinix (EQIX) gapped past the 472.81 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume.

But  Apple (AAPL) reversed higher.XPowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) slid 0.5% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gave up 0.1%, while SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) turned 0.1% higher in the stock market today.Facebook stumbled more than 2% despite reporting positive Q3 results late Wednesday. Apple reversed to a 0.5% gain ahead of its earnings report due out after the close. Both stocks remain in a buy zone from their recent respective breakouts. Amazon (AMZN) pulled back 0.7% but is in buy range from a 1083.10 entry it blasted past last week following its earnings.Among sector plays, homebuilders, telecom and energy led the downside. SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XBH) and iShares U.S. Home Construction (ITB) gave up 2% and 1.5%, respectively.But gold miners, retail and real estate plays advanced.

It's trading just below a 92.65 buy point of a flat base. The fund rose 9% from a late-January flat-base breakout to the start of the current pattern. It also offered several opportunities to get in at bounces off the 50-day line along the way.Like the broader market, the $11.6 billion fund is trading near all-time highs. XLY, which tracks the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index, will mark its 19th anniversary in December.

The top five accounted for nearly 42% of assets.Amazon, by far the biggest weighting in the 84-stock portfolio at 17%, gapped up and soared 13% Friday. That sent shares cruising past a 1083.10 buy point. The impetus? The online retail giant reported consensus-beating Q3 earnings and sales after the close Thursday, which led to a flurry of analysts boosting their price targets.

202,HD,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the day ahead.XAfter last week's department-store slump, more retailers are gearing up to report. And even though Home Depot (HD), TJX (TJX), Coach (COH), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) compete in separate categories — home improvement, off-price clothing, handbags, millennial apparel, athletic goods — there's little doubt that online behemoth Amazon and the broader shifting retail landscape are, to some degree, impacting them all.Analysts see the home-improvement retailer's Q2 per-share profit rising 12% to $2.21 on 5% revenue growth to $27.8 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Look for possible talk on the earnings call about Sears Holding's (SHLD) recent decision to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN). Home-improvement retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's (LOW), which are big appliance sellers, sold off initially on that news. The sector generally has been  seen as having more of a buffer from the power of the e-commerce giant — but Amazon's foray into groceries, fashion and a host of other areas are enough to give retailers the jitters every time it makes a move.Shares dipped 0.4% to 154.26 in Monday's stock market trading. Home Depot, a Dow industrials component, is in a flat base with a 160.96 buy point.The T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent is expected to report flat year-over-year EPS of 84 cents and 6% revenue gains to $8.32 billion.Off-price stores are another group that have, in the past, been labeled ""Amazon-proof"" as department stores struggle to adapt to a digital-first shopping environment. But growth has slowed for TJX and other off-price chains. Look for signs of continued resilience or potential chipping in its report. Off-price peer Ross Stores (ROST) reports later in the week.Shares fell 2.1% to 69.58. The stock is still trying to recover from a sharp sell-off that started in May.Purse and accessories maker Coach is seen growing profit by 9% to 49 cents a share while sales are expected to dip 0.7% to $1.15 billion.Handbag brands are in the midst of expanding their fashion houses, with Coach completing its $2.4 billion acquisition of Kate Spade last month, and competitor Michael Kors (KORS) announcing in late July that it's gobbling up luxury shoe brand Jimmy Choo.Coach, Kors and others have had to tangle with discounting at department stores as they try to maintain an image of accessible luxury.Cultivating demand with millennial and Gen Z consumers also appears to be a priority for Coach: Pop star Selena Gomez is the latest face of the brand.Shares rose 0.7% to 47.90, near three-year highs.Speaking of young people, Urban Outfitters is projected to report a 44% profit decline to 37 cents a share on a 3% sales dip to $864 million.Specialty teen-apparel retailers have been particularly hard-hit in recent years, as younger consumers gravitate toward experiences and clothing sales remain soft. In early June, Urban Outfitters said that its same-store sales for the second quarter, which it is set to report on Tuesday, were then already ""high-single-digit negative.""Cowen has long forecast that Amazon will unseat Macy's (M) as the nation's largest apparel retailer this year.Urban Outfitters shares fell 0.2% to 17.73, still near recent eight-year lows.Consensus is for 23% EPS growth on nearly 11% sales gains to $2.18 billion.The athleticwear and sporting-goods retailer — which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular brands — was just one company whose stock took a hit in late June on news that Nike would be selling some of its footwear on Amazon.Dick's shares rose 2.7% to 34.91, but are near their worst levels since early 2012.Hibbett Sporting Goods (HIBB) and Foot Locker (FL) report later this week.Here's one company reporting Tuesday that's not like the others listed here. Wall Street expects China-based automotive online platform BitAuto (BITA) to post 22 cents EPS on $278.25 million in revenue, according to Yahoo Finance estimates.While still off its 2014 peak, the stock hit a two-year high on Monday, up 6.4% to 39.28.Rival Autohome (ATHM) reported strong results last week.RELATED:Giants Of China's Internet, U.S. Retail Lead Investing Action Plan J.C.

205,HD,"Charity: Disasters like the one unfolding in Houston show the worst in Mother Nature, but also show the best of a free society. Even before any government agency could act, volunteers, private businesses and charities from around the country were organizing relief efforts.There has been plenty of attention given to how well the government — particularly the federal government — is responding to the unfolding disaster in Houston. President Trump's tweet praising FEMA's response, for example, was instant news. But while there's no doubt that marshaling government resources in a time of crisis is vital, all this attention on government activities overlooks the far more important and inspiring voluntary efforts across the country.Over the weekend, dozens of people from Louisiana showed up in Houston as part of what's become known as the Cajun Navy. This is an all-volunteer group formed during Hurricane Katrina that has grown in size since.XThe Cajun Navy was part of what's been described as an ""armada of private boats"" that came to Houston to help rescue thousands of people stranded in their homes by Harvey's relentless deluge.Nobody ordered it, or organized it, or coordinated it, or directed it. Nobody's getting paid. But their efforts are a big reason why the death rate from Harvey has been so low.It's just one of many stories emerging from Houston that show how, in times of crisis, Americans come together, on their own, to help each other, save lives, and solve problems. A few examples:There are less obvious ways private companies help. Waffle House, for example, has become an indicator of how bad a weather disaster is, because the restaurant chain is so determined to keep operating in the worst conditions.Rory Carroll, writing for the UK-based Guardian newspaper about the outpouring of voluntary help in response to Harvey, put it this way: ""Here was the America of the ideal: one nation, indivisible. A republic of citizens looking out for each other. No politics or polarization. No fake news or social media bubbles. A crisis all could see, and a response all wanted to be part of.""Amen to that. The nation's moral character isn't measured by the number of federal programs, or how big their budgets are, or how many bureaucrats are involved. It is measured in the willingness of its citizens to rally, organize and respond to a crisis all on their own, freely donating their time and resources, experience and know-how to help strangers in need. Too, often, these private efforts get lost in the relentless focus on what government is or isn't doing.For all the terrible news to come out of Houston, the response from individuals, communities and businesses around the country is a beautiful thing to behold.Of course, not everyone has been inclined to see the good emerging from the Harvey tragedy.Chauncey Devega of the left-wing Salon, for example, could not contain his Trump bashing even for a moment, writing in a truly awful column about how ""many Americans face a massive natural disaster — but the disaster of this failed presidency is even worse.""Salon should send Devega to Houston so he can see what America is really about.RELATED:Hurricane Harvey's Nationalized Insurance Nightmare

Shares are still well-extended from their 50-day line, where they found support on Aug. 11.Meanwhile, retail competitor JD.com (JD) and Chinese internet giant Baidu (BIDU) declined 2.8% and 2.4%, respectively. JD has given up its 50-day line in recent week as it builds a new base, while Baidu is still holding tight around its highs — about 14% above a 193.84 cup-shaped base entry.Among other leading stocks, Tesla (TSLA) dropped 1.5% as it continues to add a handle to its cup-base formation. The electric automaker's buy point would be 370.10, but the stock is struggling at its 50-day line.Among companies reporting earnings, Best Buy (BBY) moved up 0.4% ahead of its Q2 earnings before the market open Tuesday. The consumer electronics retailer is trading solidly in the 5% buy range from a 59.79 double-bottom buy point.

Shares of Nintendo traded almost 2% higher.On the biotech front, Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced it would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE) for $11.9 billion, or $180 a share. Shares of Gilead rose 1.7%, while Kite surged 29%.

The Nasdaq also lost 0.1% after briefly retaking its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 continues to contend with resistance just below that line.Economic news Thursday leads off with the start of the international Economic Symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyo., and with the Labor Department reporting jobless claims rose slightly, but held at the low level of 234,000 in the week ended Aug. 19. That was an uptick from the prior week's 232,000 claims, but below economist projections for an increase to 237,000.July existing home sales fell 1.3% to an annual rate of 5.44 million, the Commerce Department said. That was below views for 5.565 million.Apple (AAPL) turned down to fall 0.2%. A CFRA research report late Wednesday argued that estimates for iPhone average sale prices were too low. The stock remains in a buy range above a 156.52 buy point.FANG stocks also gave up early gains. Netflix (NFLX) was flat.

208,HD,"New-home sales unexpectedly fell in August while supply surged as hurricanes take their toll on normal sales activity in Texas and much of the South. But shares of most homebuilders rallied Tuesday morning, with D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) all close to buy points.Sales of single-family new-home sales fell 3.4% to an annual rate of 560,000, after July was revised up slightly to a 580,000 pace, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected a rise to 583,000. The supply of homes at the current sales pace rose to 6.1 months, the highest since July 2014. Some 284,000 new homes were on the block, the most since May 2009, at the tail end of the last recession. Sales fell 4.7% in the South.The storms and the aftermath will likely affect sales and construction for several months.D.R. Horton rose 1% to 37.44 in the stock market today, after reaching 37.61 intraday and briefly topping a 37.54 buy point. D.R. Horton cleared that entry earlier this month but pulled back, finding support just above its 50-day moving average. D.R. Horton lowered guidance on Monday due to the recent hurricanes.Toll Bros. advanced 1 cent to 40.22. Shares of the entry-luxury builder are closing in on a 41.17 buy point.LGI Homes advanced 1.1% to 46.07. As of Tuesday's close, LGI Homes has a proper handle with the minimum five days. That gives the stock a lower entry of 46.99.Meanwhile, Home Depot (HD), which has gotten a lift from prehurricane preparations and post-hurricane repair, edged up 0.1% to 161.26.

Its potential buy point is 34.20.FANG stock Netflix (NFLX) looked to extend its recovery further early Wednesday, moving nearly 4% higher after UBS boosted its price target from 190 to 225. In two consecutive weeks, the stock has tested its 50-day moving average line as it traces a handle onto its cup base. Each time, the stock has rebounded higher, indicating institutional support at that level. Shares about 2% away from a 190.05 buy point.Electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) drove over 2% higher in the stock market today, recapturing its 50-day line. On Tuesday, Tesla reported its Q3 Model 3 production results. Initially, shares declined 3% intraday before turning that loss into a 1.9% gain — a bullish upside reversal. A previous breakout above a 370.10 cup-with-handle entry failed, so a new base will need to form.Among companies reporting earnings, PepsiCo (PEP) trimmed heavy early losses to just a 0.3% fall after reporting mixed fiscal-Q3 results. Despite missing sales estimates, bottom-line results came in above the Street's targets. The snack giant reported that it lost market share in its soda brands — Pepsi and Mountain Dew — as the company shifted its attention to pushing healthier drinks, like sparkling lemonade.Meanwhile, Acuity Brands (AYI) declined nearly 4% after missing fiscal-Q4 top-line estimates early Wednesday.

Yet the stock is just 1% off its all-time high of 164.94. It  holds a modest 3.4% gain following the Aug. 2 breakout past a new flat base with a 156.75 buy point.Investors certainly showed a defensive streak following reports that North Korea successfully tested what some believe to be a powerful hydrogen bomb during the three-day Labor Day weekend. North Korean is reportedly planning another missile test following one last week that passed over Hokkaido in northern Japan.West Texas intermediate crude oil futures settled at $48.66 a barrel, up 2.9%. Crude has rebounded more than 5% in the aftermath of a devastating flood in Houston and surrounding areas, home to many U.S. energy exploration companies and oil refining operations. Meanwhile, a severe slide in the yield of the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond to 2.08% hurt money-center banks.It's generally believed that flat or falling bond yields hurt the trading and fixed-income revenue of major Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) (down 2.5%, back below its 50-day moving average) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (off 3.6%, falling further below its 200-day moving average).Both JPMorgan and Goldman are members of the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, which led the market's decline with a 1.1% drop. The S&P 500 sank less than 0.8% as strength in oil exploration, gold mining, variety and discount retail, and medical systems stocks helped buffer the slide. The SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF rallied 1.1% in fast turnover to 127.46.The bullion-tracking ETF is now up 16.3% year to date, vs. a 9.7% lift for the S&P 500.The Nasdaq composite was down as much as 1.6% before shaving some of those losses to end off by 0.9%. On the positive side, the tech-rich index traded on the north side of its 50-day moving average throughout the session.Despite the broad sell-off, investors should not ignore this bullish development in recent weeks: The Nasdaq's advance-decline line, which graphs the number of stocks advancing in price vs. those in decline, has moved sharply up since Aug. 22. In general, a healthy stock market uptrend shows a rising A-D line, not a falling one.However, on Tuesday declining stocks certainly outnumbered winners on the Nasdaq by a more than 2-1 ratio.The Russell 2000 fell 1%.Building products firms continue to thrive. On the NYSE, Home Depot (HD) showed some oomph, gapping up 1.4% to 152.93. The Dow Jones industrials component is now back above its 50-day line and volume jumped almost 50% above normal levels.Back to Apple: The stock has shown several up days in heavy volume since its Aug. 2 breakout and only two down sessions in heavy turnover (Aug. 10 and Tuesday). But in the first case, Apple didn't fall further and rebounded strongly enough to hit a new high just three sessions later.Two more reasons why Apple is showing bullish action since its latest breakout? One, the stock's relative strength line continues to rise nicely and reach new high ground. And two, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B on a scale of A to E indicates net institutional buying over the past 13 weeks.As reported in IBD's Click tech blog, a recent survey on iPhone users conducted by investment bank Piper Jaffray found a smaller ratio of current iPhone users who expressed interest in upgrading to the upcoming new iPhone vs. a year ago before the latest iPhone 7 hit the shelves.However, Wall Street is still modeling a continued rebound in Apple's companywide fundamentals. Earnings in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter are seen rising 13% to $1.88 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of low double-digit growth. Revenue is expected to climb 9% to $51.09 billion, which would extend an accelerating trend in the top line to four straight quarters.Sales in the year-ago September quarter dropped 9%, but then picked up 3%, 5% and 7% in the next three periods.The IBD Stock Checkup for Apple still shows bullish rankings, including a 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. At the start of the year, before Apple's initial breakout from a bottoming base pattern, the Composite was a lowly 51, but the stock was in turnaround mode. The RS Rating was also weak at 59. Yet Apple's ratings have all improved since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from a new first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.The RS Rating is now a fine 90, which means Apple is now outperforming 90% of all public companies over the past 12 months. The RS Rating is weighted toward price action over the past three months.Apple has now gained nearly 40% from that proper entry point.IBD's TAKE: When Apple broke out of its second base this year on Aug. 2, IBD immediately gave three reasons why the stock has the potential to rally another 20% in price.

212,HD,"U.S. stock indexes reverted to their pattern of one step forward, one step back, as the indexes dipped and airline stocks continued their descent.XThe Nasdaq fell 0.1% midday Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2% each. The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 0.1%. Volume rose on the NYSE but fell on the Nasdaq in the stock market today.Airline stocks took the biggest hits. Low-fare airline Spirit Airlines (SAVE) dropped 2.5%. American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) each fell 2%.  Alaska Air (ALK) and Delta Air (DAL) retreated 1.5% a piece.Some market watchers pointed to last week's terrorist attacks in Spain to explain the trouble in airlines stocks. But IBD's airline industry group has been sliding since mid-July. The outlook on unit revenue for the airlines has been weakening.Quality can sometimes protect an investor when a sector or group is struggling. Ireland-based Ryanair (RYAAY) and Panama-based Copa Holdings (CPA) are the only two airlines with IBD Composite Ratings of 88 or better. Both are outperforming their industry group. While the airline group has dived 18% since mid-July, Copa lost 9% and Ryanair gained 1%.The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. Ryanair's rating is 95, which means it is in the top 5% of all the stocks in IBD's database. Copa carries an 88 rating.On the upside Wednesday, bank stocks were holding up fairly well. The PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) exchange traded fund inched up 0.3% midday Wednesday after gaining 1.2% in the previous session.Blue chips were mostly down, with losers holding the edge on winners by a 5-4 ratio in the Dow Jones industrial average. Home Depot (HD) suffered the hardest hit, down 1.4%. IBM (IBM) enjoyed the best gain, rising 1.1%, but shares are still 22% off their high.RELATED:5 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying: Should You Also Buy?This Cloud-Based Software Stock Is Near A Buy Zone

West Texas intermediate crude futures surged nearly 1% to $48.28 a barrel.Homebuilders, consumer discretionary and health care led the downside.The stock market's recent pullback is creating opportunities for investors to buy several equity growth funds at potentially optimal levels.Schwab U.S. Large Cap Growth (SCHG) on Tuesday bounced off its 50-day moving average after looking for support at the line during the past week and a half. Shares rose 4% from a prior rebound off the 50-day in July and are 1% off a recent record high.The $4.3 billion fund, which turns eight years old in December, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index.

IUSG's top 10 holdings accounted for 28% of assets. Turnover is higher than SCHG's, at 43%, according to Morningstar.IUSG has returned 14.5% this year through Aug. 21. It's also slightly outperformed the S&P 500 on a three- and five-year basis, as well as over the past decade and 15 years.In January, BlackRock cut the expense ratio to 0.05% from 0.07%. IUSG marked its 17th anniversary last month.Among Tuesday's ETF picks, iShares MSCI ACWI (ACWI) staged a rebound off its 50-day line and is still in buy range. IShares MSCI Singapore Capped (EWS) didn't touch the 50-day before heading north again, but a bounce off the 10-week line also offers a buy opportunity.RELATED:Stocks Bounce Back; Apple Tops Global Equity Play Near Buy4 Sectors Lead As Stocks Turn Mixed; Apple, Microsoft In Reach?Is Now The Time To Buy Gold?

215,HD,"Verizon Communications (VZ) is tweaking its unlimited data plans, offering a slightly lower-priced deal that slows down video streaming as well as a higher-priced version that preserves higher quality video.XShares of the Dow component jumped in July after Verizon reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber additions during the second quarter. Shares were up 0.4% to close at 48.35 on the stock market today.AT&T (T) and Verizon reintroduced unlimited data plans early in 2017 to combat market-share gains by T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S). Verizon's unlimited plans, though, have been priced higher. Verizon's marketing for years has been built around having a high-quality wireless network.Mike McCormack, analyst at Jefferies, says Verizon will slow video streaming for some subscribers ""to preserve the quality of the network.""""Verizon's unlimited push earlier this year undoubtedly placed a heavy burden on the network,"" McCormack added in a report. ""Today's move allows Verizon to address potential congestion via lower resolution video and a price increase to preserve HD-quality streaming. It may also be an indication that the company's small cell (network) strategy is taking longer to implement, or is not providing the needed capacity to keep up with demand.""Verizon's new ""Go Unlimited"" plan will cost $75 monthly for a single line, down $5, with video streaming slowed to DVD quality. Four lines will cost $160 per month, in-line with T-Mobile's pricing. T-Mobile also reduces video speeds to DVD quality.The ""Beyond Unlimited"" plan starts at $85 for one line. Video streaming will not be slowed unless a subscriber exceeds 22 gigabytes in a month.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon rallied on second-quarter earnings but the stock is down nearly 10% in 2017. T-Mobile is still the top-ranked stock in the Telecom-Services Wireless group amid speculation it could try to merge with Sprint. Learn more about T-Mobile and other wireless companies at IBD Stock Checkup.Verizon added 358,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the second quarter, up from 86,000 in the year-earlier period and topping estimates of 70,000.T-Mobile added 786,000 postpaid phone subscribers while AT&T said it lost 89,000, narrowing its loss from 180,000 in the year-earlier-period. Sprint added 88,000 postpaid phone subscribers, below analysts' estimate of 116,000. Postpaid subscribers billed monthly spend the most on wireless services.RELATED:IPhone 8 May Ditch Fingerprint Sensor, Use Facial RecognitionNetflix Flirts With Key Support Level On Competition Worries

But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point.

Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well.

220,HD,"Investors on Monday flocked to Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and others, betting that the winds and flooding from Tropical Storm Harvey will translate into higher sales as homeowners and businesses try to repair or replace homes, stripped roofs and waterlogged floors.XThe storm, which has been downgraded from hurricane status, made landfall in Texas on Friday, and left many of Houston's roads, highways and parking lots underwater this weekend. Much more rain is forecast.At least five people have died in the storm, and FEMA has said 450,000 people could register for disaster assistance and expected 30,000 people to end up in temporary shelters.Fannie Mae said that more than 36,000 single-family homes whose mortgages it backs were sitting in the immediate area hit by the storm, according to Reuters.Rainfall in some regions hit by the storm could reach 50 inches by the end of the week, according to a Weather.com forecast, as the storm heads back over the Gulf of Mexico, gathers more moisture and is expected to make landfall again. Last week, the storm was estimated to bring 36-40 inches of rain.IBD'S TAKE: Visit this page for more news on homebuilder stocks to watch and housing market and real estate news. Home Depot rose 1.3% on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average.

221,HD,"The battle for digital dominance in the smart home continues to intensify as Amazon (AMZN) reportedly is developing more new products that pose another threat to Alphabet (GOOGL), in one of the hottest categories of consumer electronics.XAmazon is developing a pair of smart glasses and a new camera security system, both of which tap into its Alexa virtual assistant and expand its growing presence in the smart home, according to the Financial Times Wednesday.The Amazon devices in development and related products now available are a threat to Alphabet and its line of virtual assistants, centered on Google Home, along with Apple (AAPL) and its HomePod device.The focal point of the Amazon devices in development is Alexa, the voice of the Amazon Echo artificially intelligent virtual digital assistant. Through Alexa's speakers and microphone, users can play music, create shopping lists, get information on weather, traffic and sports, in addition to using the device for ordering products on Amazon and controlling household devices such as lighting.Amazon's pair of smart glasses would allow Alexa to be summoned anytime and anywhere, the Financial Times report said, citing people familiar with the plans. A bone-conduction audio system would allow the wearer to hear Alexa without the need for headphones.The internet-connected camera security system Amazon also reportedly is developing would allow people to view the video feed on the Amazon Echo Show, a recently introduced device with a video screen.And on Tuesday, Amazon introduced a new tablet, the Fire HD 10, that also connects with Alexa. In June, Amazon announced its new Dash Wand, an Alexa-enabled device that can be used for scanning grocery bar codes and other household essentials to create a shopping list, among other features.Altogether, through Alexa, Amazon is embedding itself deeper into the smart home and in the process collecting batches of user data that can be used for generating more e-commerce and helping it to combat Alphabet in the digital assistant market.Apple joined the market in June with the HomePod digital assistant. Last month, Amazon and Microsoft announced a partnership that threatens the rise of Alphabet and Apple in one of the hottest categories in consumer products.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft are strengthening their connection to customers with mobile and in-home devices infused with advanced speech recognition and artificial intelligence. The devices could evolve into the next major disruption in computing and put the smart home on a fast track.Amazon shares inched up 0.4% to close at 973.21 on the stock market today.Amazon leads the market for digital assistants in the home by a large margin, followed by Google Home, then Apple. Alphabet also has Google Assistant, a smartphone app that functions like Google Home, while Apple has Siri. And while it's believed that Google Home and Google Assistant are superior to Alexa in terms of having better artificial intelligence, Amazon still has the upper hand, says Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor.""The two weaknesses of Amazon in the digital assistant space are that it is inferior to Google and that Google Assistant is present by default on every Android smartphone that ships,"" Windsor wrote in a blog post.

222,HD,"Stocks opened higher Monday as markets registered only mild initial financial effects of the ongoing flooding that has shut down much of the Texas coast.XThe Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each opened 0.2% higher. The Nasdaq composite also climbed 0.2%.Hurricane Harvey swept in as a category 4 storm late Friday to cause wind damage along the south Texas coast, followed by historical levels of rain-induced flooding of cities north to Houston — the U.S. energy capital and fourth-largest city. The storm was downgraded to tropical storm status, relieving the threat of wind damage, but is projected to continue to deluge the already saturated Houston area with record levels of rainfall.Oil prices dropped almost 1% and gasoline futures surged nearly 4% as refinery operators inspected for possible damage after shutdowns ahead of the storm. About 10 refineries representing an estimated 2.2 million barrels a day of capacity shut down in response to the storm, including flagship facilities owned by Exxon Mobil (XOM) , Valero Energo (VLO)  and Phillips 66 (PSX), according to S&P Platts.All three stocks traded higher at the open.

225,HD,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations. But, as IBD reported, analysts see a potential slowdown in its stronger full-year outlook.After pulling back Thursday and Friday, shares were up 10% for the year.RELATED:Reynolds American Bolsters JPMorgan Large Cap Growth FundHow To Make Your Boss Add $76K To Your 401(k)

227,HD,"Stock wrestled to narrow gains Wednesday, as economic news, earnings reports and a Federal Reserve release figured into the final result.X The Nasdaq led, closing up 0.2% despite Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) ending in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 each pulled off gains of 0.1%. Small caps logged another weak session, with the Russell 2000 closing with a slender decline.Preliminary data showed volume higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, vs. trade Tuesday.The release of notes from the Fed's July meeting appeared to have little impact on trade.

Copper miner Freeport McMoRan (FCX) jetted up 5%, while steelmaker Ryerson Holding (RYI) soared 8%. Southern Copper (SCCO) jumped 4%, retaking a 39.60 cup-base buy point.Homebuilder stocks were positive, despite weaker-than-forecast housing starts and building permits data for July.   KB Home (KBH), Pulte Group (PHM) and Beazer Homes (BZH) each gained 2%.  It was the fourth straight gain for KB Home, as it climbs toward a 24.47 buy point in a flat base.China-based stocks turned in a healthy day of trade, with Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) powering up 6% after second-quarter results easily outpaced expectations. The stock entered Wednesday's session extended after a five-week rally on the heels of a rebound from 10-week support in July.China's Autohome (ATHM) topped the IBD 50 list with a 4% gain. IBD 50 peer Sina (SINA)rose 2%, clearing a 97.89 buy point in a flat base.Agilent (A) knocked out a 4% gain, retaking in very strong trade a flat base buy point of 61.25.

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average showed better action, rising 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.XAmong the Dow industrials, Home Depot (HD) looked to recover from Wednesday's near-3% earnings-related sell-off.

Internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) handily beat earnings and sales estimates early Wednesday, sending its ADR shares up almost 6%.Meanwhile, retail behemoth Alibaba (BABA) advanced a near-1%, as investors prepare for the company's earnings release Thursday morning.

Rival JD.com (JD) reported its Q2 results early Monday that topped forecasts, but shares still fell over 3%.FANG member Amazon.com (AMZN) fell 0.8% after President Trump tweeted that the company is doing ""great damage"" to other retailers. The stock has been trading under its 50-day line since July 31 — its longest stretch since a cup-with-handle breakout in mid-February.In the meantime, retailers received some positive news early Wednesday when Target (TGT) reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and sales.

229,HD,"The Nasdaq rebounded off early-session lows to edge slightly higher in late-afternoon trading Thursday, paced by gains in software, medical device and biotech stocks. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued its fresh basing process, setting up a potential new breakout.X At 150.89, Apple shares were off fractionally and essentially keeping almost all of their 5.8% gain during a nine-day winning streak. The stock is also just 3% below an all-time high of 156.65. The correction within the current consolidation resembles either a shallow cup base or a flat base.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were virtually flat, despite a 4% sell-off in Dow Jones 30 component Home Depot (HD) as four other of the 30 components rose 1 point or more, including Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Home Depot sank below its 50-day moving average, near 154, in heavy trading on June 23, triggering an important sell signal for recent buyers.Small caps had a slight edge over large-cap equities, with the Russell 2000 gaining more than 0.2% following a 1% rebound on Wednesday to all-time highs.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, hospital, diversified medical, biotech and computer hardware all rallied 1.3% or more. Shares of auto parts chains, department stores, clothing makers and diversified utilities also led the upside.Another piece of positive technical news on the market: On both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, winning issues led losing issues by a margin of 200 to 250 stocks. As noted in the latest Big Picture column, new highs continue top 200 on a combined basis in both main exchanges, symbolizing heavy institutional demand for equities. This statistic also points to the potential for more breakouts.Back to Apple, the iPhone and iPad maker is not giving up much ground, likely due to belief among institutional investors that the company will continue to deliver a sound turnaround on the top and bottom lines. This improvement, combined with the stock's tight action following an impressive run from a Jan. 6-9 breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point, are two reasons why further gains by Apple may help drive U.S. equities higher.The Street sees earnings in the just-ended fiscal third quarter rising 11% to $1.57 a share, then repeating that 11% gain in Q4 to $1.85 a share. Earnings had grown 2% and 11% in the prior two quarters, ending a three-quarter profit slump.Sales estimates are following a similar path, with Q3 revenue seen rising 6% to $44.92 billion and Q4 revenue up 7% to $49.94 billion.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple scores an 80 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. That's not great, but decent enough for a stock that is staging a turnaround. In the same Telecom-Consumer Products industry group, Apple is one of just three companies that show a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, meaning they have done better than 80% of all companies in IBD's database in terms of 12-month price performance. However, the other two stocks, Voxx International (VOXX) and China Techfaith Wireless (CNTF), trade under 10 a share.On Jan. 6, Apple started its move past a 118.12 buy point in an excellent 12-week cup-with-handle base. That base was part of an initial-stage bottoming base pattern, a bullish development. From the base's high of 118.69 to the low of 104.08, Apple corrected merely 12.3%. The best cup bases tend to show mild declines in the range of 12% to upwards of 33%-35%.Notice, too, how the stock found buying support at the 200-day moving average as it built the bottom of its base. In an IBD chart or MarketSmith chart, the 200-day moving average is drawn in black and tracks the average closing price of a stock over the past 200 days. It signifies the long-term price tend of a stock.When a stock breaks out, ideally it should be trading above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages.One concern on Apple is the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is currently negative at D on a scale of A to E. It's preferable to see this proprietary rating at C+ or higher when a stock breaks out.While Apple has yet to break out of its current new base, watch to see if this rating improves. Big price gains in heavy volume over the past 13 weeks tend to trigger a higher Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as well as down days in heavy volume that grow more than 13 weeks old.Recent clues of accumulation by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, insurers, banks and the like came on June 19 (the stock gained 2.9% in volume bulging 16% above average) and June 23 (up 0.5%, volume 25% above its 50-day average).RELATED:Which Way Will Equities Go From Here?

Same-store sales to grow 4.3%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: EPS of $1.57 on revenue of $19.5 billion.

Home Depot fell 0.9% to 148.59.Last week, rival Home Depot delivered strong results and guidance, but shares gapped down amid concerns about slowing growth.Morningstar analysts noted that Home Depot's more bullish full-year same-store sales view implies growth will slow over the remainder of 2017 to a mid-single-digit pace.But the analysts added that such growth is still impressive given the ""lengthy housing cycle upswing and the maturity of this particular business model.""Home Depot and Lowe's sank on July 20, after Sears (SHLD) announced that it would sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon (AMZN), a move that some investors saw as a threat to the home improvement retailers, which sell appliances themselves.Adding to the pressure on Lowe's and Home Depot shares was weak data on sales of new homes last month. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that sales cooled to an annualized pace of 571,000 units from 630,000 in June, falling short of forecasts for 610,000.RELATED:Toll Bros.

245,HD,"The market fell Monday, but the major U.S. indexes had sharply pared their losses by the close.Today's ETF picks moved in opposite directions, yet both could offer fresh opportunities to buy shares soon. Keep in mind the market uptrend is under pressure, which means all purchases are riskier.SPDR S&P Homebuilders (XHB) added 0.6% to extend its win streak to four and mark its highest close since August 2015. Shares cleared a 38.51 buy point of a flat base Tuesday, which formed adjacent to a prior flat base, and is still in buy range.

250,HD,"Stocks rattled off quick early gains Monday, as global markets rallied and initial reports out of Florida suggested damage from a quickly weakening Hurricane Irma may stop short of worst-case scenarios.XThe Nasdaq Composite led, sweeping up 1% as Apple (AAPL) rumbled ahead 1.2% and Netflix (NFLX) led the FANG stocks with a 1.9% gain.The Dow Jones industrial average veered 0.8% higher and the S&P 500 jumped 0.7%.The National Hurricane Center estimated Irma's maximum sustained winds at 70 miles per hour at 8 a.m. ET Monday, weakening to Tropical Storm status as it climbed into Florida's panhandle.

251,HD,"Apple (AAPL) initially fell more than 1% Monday but trimmed its losses to around 0.6% at 156.70 as the major indexes continued to avoid an eclipse of their strong year-to-date gains.XBy late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were nearly break-even, while the Nasdaq composite limited its loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 was also off 0.2% and is trying to stay near its flattening 50-day moving average.Volume was running sharply lower on both main exchanges; Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly equity and index options.Apple on Aug. 2 cleared a 156.75 flat-base entry and only has gained roughly 3.7%. As seen on a daily chart, the stock has shown zigzagging action, briefly slipping below the proper entry three times already. However, no sell signal has triggered for now.At 156.68, shares are just 3% below the all-time peak of 162.51, while small-cap indexes have dipped more. The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.1%, has fallen 6% below its all-time peak of 878.At 5779, the Nasdaq 100 is up 18.8% since Jan. 1, far outstripping the S&P 500's 8.4% lift.Losing stocks are edging out winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-to-3 margin. But on the NYSE, advancers are leading decliners by a slim margin of fewer than 100 issues.As e-commerce activity does not show signs of letting up anytime soon, at least five top operators in the retailing space have fallen much more than the major equity benchmarks. All but one have triggered new sell signals.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to fade, sinking nearly 4% to 235.49. The cosmetics and hair care products chain has broken through support at the 200-day moving average near 270 and failed to lift back above the long-term support line. Notice, too, how the stock's 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day line. That's bearish.Wall Street expects July-ended fiscal Q3 earnings rising 24% to $1.78 a share. That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

A few top stocks broke out but several more fell out of buy zones. A wave of retailers had mixed earnings.E-commerce giant Alibaba may be archrivals with online gaming and messaging giant Tencent, but both delivered booming growth for the June quarter. Alibaba blew past bullish EPS forecasts, while sales swelled 56% to $7.4 billion. Tencent revenue shot up 59% as operating profit leapt 70%. Alibaba shares rose 10.4% for the week while Tencent gained 4.8%, both hitting new highs.

Industrial production rose less than expected in July, with manufacturing output actually down. The Philly Fed manufacturing index edged lower to its lowest reading since November, but it was above forecasts and still pointing to strong factory growth.Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported fiscal Q4 profit in-line with views as revenue slipped for the seventh straight quarter but topped expectations. Bear analysts focused on continued weakness in its core computer networking business as Cisco shifts to software and services via acquisitions. Analysts say Cisco's market share losses to Arista Networks (ANET) in network switching were again a factor in fiscal Q4.  For the current quarter, Cisco forecast profit and sales in line.

257,HD,"Chinese internet and top-rated medical plays showed strength amid a dull showing by major indexes in late-afternoon trading Monday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite gained more upside in the final half hour of trading, rising 0.5%, and Apple (AAPL) looked poised to post a sixth straight session on the north side of the 50-day moving average.X The action by Apple is critical, not only to the stock but the greater market, given Apple's heft. The iPhone and iPad giant has a market cap of $790 billion. And the recent action represents an opportunity to buy shares near 149 as the stock stages its second follow-on entry point after breaking out of a bottoming-base pattern Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.The first follow-on entry came in late March as Apple surpassed a 3-weeks-tight pattern at 141.12, justifying the addition of a small number of shares to an already profitable core position in the stock.The 118.12 entry comes from adding 10 cents to the handle's high in a cup-with-handle base that formed from Oct. 11 through Jan. 5 of this year. After the Jan. 6-9 breakout, Apple has gained as much as 32.5%, triggering a key IBD rule to sell at least a partial position of shares when the gain hits 20% to 25%.Apple, featured in IBD's Stock Market Today column last week as it retook the 50-day line, gained 1.4% to 152.32, helping the Nasdaq composite edge more than 0.4% higher. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3% and tacked on a new all-time high.The S&P 500 is up fractionally and is trying to avoid a third straight decline, giving up a trifling 0.1% over that time frame. The Dow Jones industrials slipped less than 0.2%, hurt by losses of 1 point or more in at least four of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD) (falling further below the 50-day moving average, a sell signal for recent new holders), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) (down 1.7% to 133.01, but holding above the 50-day line and up 3.5% from a 128.47 cup-with-handle buy point) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (building a new potential saucer pattern, still up significantly from an October breakout past 172.52).The Russell 2000 eked out a small gain, up nearly 0.2%. Volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq and sharply slower on the NYSE vs. the same time in the prior session.Chinese consumer and e-commerce plays continued to surge, even as the Hong Kong and mainland China equity markets were closed for a holiday.Baidu (BIDU)'s breakout past a 193.84 buy point is gaining more momentum as the stock rallied nearly 3% to 198.72. Volume is running more than 40% higher than normal. Read more about the Chinese search engine's chart action and other market leaders in IBD's New Highs feature.The permissible buy zone for Baidu goes up to 203.53, 5% past the 193.84 handle entry.Baozun (BZUN) has emerged as a runaway small-cap winner. On Monday, shares gapped up more than 5%, to 34.10, in fast turnover and are now up more than 92% since clearing a long cup-with-handle base at 17.68 on May 5.Notice on a daily chart how the stock saw volume zoom 143% above its 50-day average on the May 5 breakout day. At the time, volume traded on average 678,000 shares each day.Baozun's expertise lies in helping multinational brands such as Nike (NKE) succeed in their marketing campaigns in China. In 2016, earnings jumped 154% to 33 cents a share on a 23% jump in sales to $504 million.IBD's TAKE: Baozun was featured earlier this year in The New America. The New America index, as seen in the Market Indexes table on page B6 of the latest IBD Weekly print edition, is up 26% since Jan. 1, pummeling the major indexes. See what other companies have qualified for this proprietary IBD screen for hot growth companies.Celgene (CELG), Abiomed (ABMD) and Bioverativ (BIVV) are also acting well. Abiomed, a heart pump innovator, is close to breaking out of a narrow flat-base pattern at 147.55. Eight stocks in the IBD 50 are tied to the medical sector.Abiomed, up nearly 2% to 147, is expected to grow full-year earnings per share by 48% to $1.84 in FY 2018 (ending in March next year) and 41% in FY 2019.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures rose 1.2% to $46.33 a barrel as the U.S. dollar has shown weakness in recent weeks. The dollar is currently worth 111.13 yen but appeared to be testing buying support near 110, a level last seen in mid-June. The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond dipped 2 basis points to 2.25%, down from 2.45% at the beginning of the year.RELATED:New High Analysis: This Biotech Play Is Extended, But Will A New Buy Point Emerge?The Bottoming Base, Part I: How It Helps Savvy Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 2009

260,HD,"Stocks stuck very close to home on Thursday as mixed economic data and earnings reports frayed any attempts to build momentum.Better-than-expected weekly jobless claims and June consumer confidence numbers were positive, but a sharp drop in manufacturing growth reported by the Philadelphia Fed before the open helped stoke investor concerns. Investor response to earnings reports cut sharply in both directions, although mostly in soft trade, throughout the session.The result gave the Nasdaq a technical win: another new high and its 10th straight gain. But the increase was less than 0.1%, and in weak trade — no mean feat with Check Point Software (CHKP), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Qualcomm (QCOM) all turning in broad losses, and Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ending with minor losses on the day.Drugmakers Mylan (MYL) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) led the Nasdaq 100.

The stock has fallen below its 59.10 buy point, but the breakout at that entry remains in play.Home Depot (HD) fell 4%, ratcheting up the drag on the Dow. The catalyst appeared to be an agreement by Sears Holdings (SHLD) to sell its respected Kenmore-brand home appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN). The news sent Sears shares to a nearly 11% gain. Amazon sketched out a 0.2% advance.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) led the IBD 50, up more than 3% in above-average trade. That was sufficient to take out a new high, although shares were already extended after an early July rebound from the 10-week moving average.

But Whirlpool (WHR) and major sellers of appliances Home Depot, Lowe's (LOW) and Best Buy (BBY) were hit. Home improvement chains Home Depot and Lowe's had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least Amazon-resistant. Best Buy, which has bounced back in recent years from Amazon's initial onslaught, was hurt earlier this month on news that Amazon is creating a Geek Squad rival.Amazon appears to be getting more government attention as its size and scope grow, with an FTC probe and antitrust rumblings.Software giant Microsoft earned 98 cents excluding items for the June fiscal fourth quarter, up 42% year over year and well above views for 71 cents.

Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs. Visa earnings also topped, with strong cross-border travel – helped by the stronger dollar – and global payment volumes driving results, according to Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan. The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year.

Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3.

271,HD,"The stock market wasn't moving much in afternoon trading as Wall Street weighed more earnings reports and news of better-than-expected retail sales in July. Ironically, some of the hardest hit stocks Tuesday hailed from the retail sector.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were mixed and mostly unchanged with about one hour left to go in the session, with volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq tracking close to Monday's levels in the stock market today.Bonds were under pressure, sending the 10-year Treasury yield 4 basis points higher to 2.26% after retail sales rose 0.6% in July, double the consensus estimate of 0.3%. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.5%, also above the consensus estimate of 0.3%. The U.S. dollar rallied strongly against other currencies but was off session highs.Another round of earnings reports didn't stir much excitement.Home Depot (HD) reported another solid quarter with strong earnings and bullish guidance, but the home improvement retailer crashed through its 50-day moving average, falling nearly 3%. Same-store sales rose 6.3% overall and 6.6% in the U.S., well above estimates. Same-store sales exclude sales at newly opened stores.Meanwhile, the numbers weren't so hot at Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) as Wall focused on a 0.1% rise in same-store sales, well below estimates of 2%-3% growth. Guidance was weak as the company said it planned to increase promotional and marketing efforts to protect market share.

The small cap Russell 2000 trimmed 0.4%. Volume was up on both major exchanges, but low volume Friday made for an easy comparison.Over the weekend, North Korea tested what experts reportedly believe to be a hydrogen bomb. Trump's reaction was twofold. He announced that the U.S. would sell sophisticated military equipment to Japan and South Korea, and he threatened to halt trade with any country doing business with North Korea.

The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were near the flat line. Volume on the NYSE was tracking about 10% higher than Wednesday's levels. Nasdaq volume was on pace to be slightly lower in the stock market today.In the biotech space, Regeneron (REGN) jumped more than 3% to 524.25. The stock first broke out in early May, but another interpretation is that the stock is working on a big cup-with-handle base with a 543.65 buy point. So another breakout is in play. Separately, recent Biogen (BIIB) spinoff and Leaderboard name Bioverativ (BIVV) gained 2% to 62.24. It's approaching an alternate entry of 63.33.Nike (NKE) outperformed in the Dow, rising nearly 2%, helped by a Morgan Stanley upgrade to overweight from equal weight. Shares of Nike surged 11% on June 30 on news that it's going to start selling on Amazon.com (AMZN).Elsewhere, Sears Holdings (SHLD) gapped up over its 200-day moving average and the 10 price level but was near session lows on news it'll start selling Alexa-enabled appliances on Amazon. Shares were up 14% to 9.90. The Sears news wasn't good for shares of Dow component Home Depot (HD) or Best Buy (BBY), two large sellers of appliances. Both names lost around 4% in heavy volume.In earnings news, Check  Point Software (CHKP) gapped below the 50-day moving average, falling 7%, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings but issued a weak outlook.

274,HD,"Stocks continue to catch their breath on Monday after posting big gains last week, but Apple (AAPL) made a statement in the stock market today — that the institutional crowd is not yet ready to cash in their large year-to-date gains.X While the Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher and the Nasdaq composite was fractionally lower with less than half an hour to go, Apple rose more than 0.3% to 149.55, climbing back above the 50-day moving average for the first time since a two-day, 5.3% slide on June 9-12. Shares on Monday got as high as 150.90.The seventh up day in a row for the iPhone and iPad maker suggests that Apple is not only trying to keep its uptrend intact but also may try to form a genuine new base.Apple (72 EPS Rating, 84 RS in Stock Checkup) initially cleared a 118.12 proper entry in a cup-with-handle pattern on Jan. 6-9 and rallied more than 32% before cooling off. The company is into its third quarter of rebounding from a three-quarter slump in both the top and bottom lines.IBD's TAKE: A savvy investor can get an edge in finding new entry points in turnaround stocks and strong companies at the end of a severe market correction by looking for the bottoming base pattern. Check out the one that Apple formed in the spring of 2009 before going on its big stretch run of gains.An aggressive shareholder could opt to buy shares of Apple if it can continue to rally back above the 50- or 10-week moving average with authority, preferably in rising volume. (The 50-day average turnover of Apple is 28.1 million shares.) A more clear-cut entry would be if the stock breaks out to new highs.The S&P 500 was virtually flat, as gains in steel, metal ores, retail, gold and generic drug firms offset declines in the automaker, airfreight, specialty retail, logistics, railroad and movie fields of the market. The Russell 2000 outperformed, up 0.3%.Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, notes that low inflation, a U.S. monetary policy that ""should remain equity-market friendly,"" and a global monetary policy that is beginning to normalize all pose as positive factors for equities in the second half of 2017.""We think these trends can continue, but also believe investment selectivity is growing more important,"" Doll wrote in a weekly investment commentary.Indeed, the IBD Mutual Fund index, which tracks some of the best active fund managers on Wall Street, is up 15.8% since Jan. 1, pounding the S&P 500's 9.8% gain so far. See the index and its components by going to the latest IBD Big Picture and clicking on the General Market Indicators page via a link at the bottom of the daily article.Apple is slated to report fiscal Q3 results on Aug. 1 after the close. The Street sees sales rising 6% to $44.92 billion, which would mark the biggest year-over-year increase in seven quarters. Earnings are expected to lift 11% to $1.57 a share.Apple is part of IBD's Telecom sector. As seen in IBD Weekly, Electronics, Chips, Leisure and Building dominate the 33 sector rankings within IBD's stock research tables for mid- to long-term performance. A strong sector helps a high-quality stock succeed in its breakouts.D.R. Horton (DHI) (breakout from a long saucer with handle at 34.64), Home Depot (HD) (saucer-with-handle breakout at 137.42), Nvidia (NVDA) and IPG Photonics (IPGP) are just some of the stocks from these four sectors that are showing unusual strength lately.Nvidia, the top chip-technology player in the video gaming markets, is No. 5 in the IBD 50 and has made big strides in the fields of deep learning, artificial intelligence, data center and self-driving cars. The big-cap tech is now extended after surging off its 10-week moving average near 140 three weeks ago. The stock is also up 35% after bolting out of a 13-week base in heavy turnover in the week ended May 12.Among top-performing new issues, Ichor (ICHR) worked on a fourth straight up day, rising nearly 3% to 22.27. While volume is running sharply below average, the semiconductor equipment firm hoisted itself back above the key 50-day moving average. A new base may be forming, with the correction in the base currently at 35% from head to toe.That 35% correction is typically the maximum amount of decline you'd like to see in a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base, two of the seven principal chart patterns that the biggest stock market winners produce before breaking out to new highs and unleashing strong price runs.Ichor broke the $100 million-revenue barrier on a quarterly basis during the third quarter of 2016, when sales jumped 40% to $105.7 million. Since then, revenue leapt 104% and 103% in the next two quarters while earnings made triple- to quadruple-digit increases.The Street sees Q2 profit exploding 329% higher to 60 cents a share, boosted in part by a 7% decline in the year-ago quarter.RELATED:How Much Will Q2 Earnings Rise For The Top Growth Firms?How To Learn Top Buy And Sell Rules For Growth InvestingThe Latest Names In Stock SpotlightSelling Stocks Like A Pro: What Is A True Cut Of The 50-Day Moving Average?

275,HD,"The consumer price index was unchanged in June, while core prices, stripping out food and energy, edged up just 0.1%, the Labor Department reported on Friday.The core CPI data came in below expectations of a 0.2% rise, which likely will further reduce odds of another Federal Reserve rate hike in coming months.Compared to a year ago, overall consumer price inflation is up 1.6%, the smallest gain since October. Cor CPI inflation was 1.7%, same as in May. The Federal Reserve has set a 2% inflation target. Its favorite price gauge, the core PCE deflator, shows even milder inflation.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales slipped 0.2% in June, while sales excluding autos also declined 0.2% from May.Wall Street expected a 0.1% gain in overall retail sales and a 0.2% rise ex-autos.Upon release of the retail sales and inflation data, futures were little changed on the stock market today, though Nasdaq futures moved higher. However, the 10-year Treasury yield and U.S. dollar continued to head lower.But industrial production rose 0.4%, just above expectations, with May revised up to a slim gain, the Federal Reserve reported. Manufacturing output rose 0.2%.Investors are paying especially close attention to inflation readings after hawkish signals from the Fed and, even more so, from the European Central Bank tripped up markets in late June, sending technology stocks including Amazon (AMZN) into a brief tailspin. Amazon is now back above its 50-day moving average and regained the 1000 mark on Wednesday as Fed chief Janet Yellen signaled that rate hikes could pause if inflation readings continue to come in on the soft side.Sales at nonstore retailers led by Amazon and building materials suppliers such as Home Depot (HD) have been among the strongest categories, while sales at department stores such as Macy's (M) continue to bleed.Amazon and other other nonstore retailer sales rose a so-so 0.4% on the month, with the annual gain slipping into single digits at 9.2%. Amazon just held its third annual Prime Day on July 11, reporting a 60% increase in sales.Building material and garden store sales increased 0.5% from May and 5.1% from a year ago.Overall general merchandise stores led by Wal-Mart (WMT) saw a 0.4% rise in sales from May. The department store category, a subsector of general merchandise, saw sales slip 0.7%.Wal-Mart shares were on the rise early Friday after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs, but the stock remains just below its 50-day moving average, which it has yet to retake after sinking on Amazon's announced acquisition of Whole Foods Market (WFM).RELATED:Fed Chief Yellen Won't Fight The Doves Yet; Stocks Fly

At the boom of the index,  Home Depot (HD) dipped 0.7% — apparently feeling some drain from retail peer Lowe's (LOW).

280,HD,"Electronic Arts (EA) and Microsoft (MSFT) captured early buzz heading into the E3 video game convention, which starts Tuesday, with weekend announcements about new products.XElectronic Arts wowed gamers with footage from its upcoming ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" game at a company event Saturday in Hollywood. It also revealed details of a version of its ""FIFA 18"" soccer game for Nintendo's (NTDOY) Switch game console. Plus, it previewed two new video game properties: two-player co-op adventure game ""A Way Out,"" due out in early 2018, and science-fiction action game ""Anthem,"" set for release in fall 2018.Microsoft detailed its next living-room game console called Xbox One X, previously code-named Project Scorpio, at a media event on Sunday. It said the console will be available on Nov. 7 for $499, a price many analysts found rather steep.Microsoft described Xbox One X as the world's most powerful game console, capable of running video in 4K ultra-high-definition quality. It will co-exist with the original Xbox One console and the smaller Xbox One S model.Microsoft also announced 42 upcoming Xbox One games, including 22 with console exclusivity.The EA and Microsoft events were ""incrementally positive"" for EA, Mizuho Securities analyst San Phan said in a report Monday. He reiterated his buy rating and price target of 115 on EA stock.EA stock was down 1.4% to close at 108.90 on the stock market today. EA shares hit an all-time high of 116.04 in intraday trading on Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on the E3 conference, check out IBD's E3 news page. E3, short for Electronic Entertainment Expo, runs Tuesday through Thursday in downtown Los Angeles.EA's ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" game is poised to outsell its predecessor thanks to improved game play and a larger installed base of current-generation consoles, Phan said. The new Star Wars game has three times the content of the 2015 game with more characters and settings from across the Star Wars universe, he said. It also features a single-player campaign mode that the original lacked.""Based on what was shown and our hands-on play time, we believe EA has improved the game in nearly every aspect, including multiplayer, which now includes soldier classes and appears more robust,"" Phan said. ""We also really like EA's decision to make downloadable content free for 'Battlefront 2' as it keeps the player community together vs. fragmenting it (benefiting engagement). The game will still feature in-game microtransactions where loot boxes can be purchased in addition to being earned.""EA's ""Anthem"" looks ""astounding,"" Phan said. The new game should give Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) similar franchise, ""Destiny,"" a run for its money, he said.Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said ""Anthem"" looks ""impressive"" and ""Star Wars Battlefront 2"" looks ""solid.""He reiterated his overweight rating on EA and price target of 115 in a report Monday.Wall Street analysts were taken aback by the pricing of Microsoft's Xbox One X console, saying the high price tag could limit its appeal.""The launch price is a bit steep in our opinion,"" Phan said in a report. ""The Xbox One X bests the technical specifications for the (Sony (SNE)) PlayStation 4 Pro with native 4K gaming and an Ultra HD Blu-ray drive, but at $499, it'll cost $100 more than the PlayStation 4 Pro, which we expect will have stronger exclusive titles over the next year.""Baird's Sebastian agreed.""It remains unclear whether Xbox One X's superior horsepower will be noticeable enough to offset the $100 price premium to PS4 Pro or the two-times premium to the Xbox One S ($249),"" Sebastian said. ""It could appeal to hardcore gamers looking for more PC-level immersion in a 'lean back' console environment, particularly as developers better leverage the console specs over time.""Microsoft stock was down 0.8% to close at 69.78 Monday after finding support at its 50-day line intraday.

281,HD,"Stocks posted a flat finish ahead of the extended Memorial Day weekend on Friday, after a boisterous week that drove all three major indexes to their highest weekly closes on record.The Dow Jones industrial average ended flat just above 21,080. The S&P 500 gained less than 0.1%, signing out above 2415. The Nasdaq rose almost 0.1%, showing 6210 at the closing bell.Although the overall session was quiet, with volume tracking well below Thursday's levels, fiber optic telecom plays rallied.The trigger appeared to be Infinera (INFN), which jetted up 9% after an upgraded to outperform from market perform from Wells Fargo. Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) surged 5% in above-average trade, taking a new high. Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Oclaro (OCLR) rose more than 3% each.Walt Disney (DIS) easily scored Friday's top advance among Dow components, rising 1% and leaving the stock with its first weekly gain in four weeks. Disney shares found support at their 40-week line last week, and posted a tight close this week. Both are signs of institutional support.Home Depot (HD) took the Dow's low score for the day with a 1% loss. The stock has been trading tight and flat since late April, unable to pierce resistance near 160.U.K.-based drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) batted out the S&P 500's best move, up more than 5% in solid trade.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was also a big S&P 500 winner, ending the week ahead 3% after two days of make-up gains following a 3.5% sell-off Wednesday. That sell-off triggered a sell signal, but undercut a flat base buy point by only 4% — avoiding a rule to sell after a loss of 7% to 8%. Shares retook the buy point on Thursday, and ended extended beyond buy range after Friday's 3% gap-up gain that followed Ulta's stronger-than-forecst Q1 report, delivered late Thursday.IBD 50 stock Floor & Decor Holdings (FND) spiked 11%, obliterating a 39.59 buy point in an eight-day IPO base. Wells Fargo initiated coverage with an outperform rating and a 40 price target, and Standard & Poor's upgraded the stock's credit rating to a B-. Shares ended the session 102% above the stock's April 27 IPO price.Veeva Systems (VEEV), also an IBD 50 stock, rumbled 8% higher as Bank of America upgraded the stock to buy after a strong first-quarter report delivered late Thursday.

282,HD,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday. The operator of Sears and Kmart stores' results were not as bad as analysts had expected. But the adjusted per-share loss was wider than a year earlier while sales fell rapidly, as the venerable retailer fights to survive in the face of Amazon (AMZN) and fierce competition among brick-and-mortar chains.Estimates: A per-share loss of $3.05, widening from a year-ago loss of $1.86 per share. Revenue was seen diving 25% to $4.054 billion. (Net income, before excluding a slew items, was a $244 million, the first positive reading in two years and above Sears' forecast, swinging from a loss of $471 million a year earlier.)Results: Adjusted per-share loss of $2.15. Revenue sank 20% to $4.30 billion. Same-store sales tumbled 11.9%.Stock: Shares jumped 13.5% to 8.48 on the stock market today, after hitting 9.90 intraday. J.C. Penney (JCP) rallied 0.2% and Kohl's (KSS) 2.5%.Sears' stock-market downward spiral deepened last week after CEO Eddie Lampert began calling out some of the struggling retailer's vendors in public, accusing one supplier of trying to ""embarrass us in the media to force us to let them out of their contract."" In March, the company said ""substantial doubt"" hung over its ability to keep operating.Lampert's dispute with the supplier, One World, which provided tools for Sears' Craftsman brand, followed more depressing results from Macy's (M) earlier this month, leading to a wide retail sell-off. J.C. Penney's dismal results dragged shares to an all-time low. IBD'S TAKE: The dire financials out of the retail sector has led to speculation over whether it has any hope left at all. Analysts aren't ready to call retail dead, but they do believe the industry has too many stores. The narrative for mid-tier retailers like Sears is that they've suffered over the years due to a retreat from shoppers to e-commerce sites like Amazon and discounters like TJX (TJX).But even TJX's results this month missed expectations, although its push into home goods and optimism against a bleak industry backdrop appeared to assuage investors.Home-improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) on Wednesday sank on weak earnings, guidance and April housing data. However, Home Depot (HD) fared better. The stronger housing market during the quarter had meant more business from DIY homeowners and contractors.RELATED:Abercrombie Spikes On Buzz Of American Eagle, Cerberus BidHere's One More Thing Amazon May Be Killing

Wal-Mart had dived below its 50-day moving average on June 16, an indication that a new base may form.As seen on a long-term weekly chart, Wal-Mart has been struggling to break out ever since a rally out of a long saucer base near 80 in November 2014 produced a roughly 14% gain before the stock turned tail and went into a deep slumber. In late 2015, the global discount store chain corrected as much 38%, hitting a low of 56.30.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, the seven worst performers were all retail-related; department stores dropped 3.8%, apparel and shoes fell 2.9%, specialty down 2.7%, home furnishings off 2.6% and discount and variety sinking 2.2%.On the Nasdaq, losers are edging out winners by a nearly 4-3 margin, while on the NYSE, advancing issues are leading decliners nearly 4-to-3.Apple, noted frequently in IBD's Stock Market Today column due to its huge heft in the Nasdaq composite, Dow and S&P 500, has not fallen more than 9.3% since hitting a recent peak of 156.65. That high marked a 32.5% advance after Apple broke out of a cup with handle at 118.12.That cup with handle is part of long, deep bottoming base pattern, which is bullish.With quarterly results set to hit the market the next month, watch to see how Apple trades ahead of its June-quarter results, which look to continue the iPhone and iPad maker's turnaround. Earnings are seen rising 11% to $1.57 a share, matching the 11% gain seen in Q2 (ended in March).Apple's revenue grew 3% in fiscal Q1 ended in December, then rose 5% in Q2 (March), marking a small acceleration in growth. The Street sees June-ended Q3 revenue growing almost 6% to $44.88 billion; the highest estimate among 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is at $45.75 billion, up 8%.The current new base has the dimensions of a flat base, which does not show a decline of more than 10% to 15% from its high. A longer basing period may yield a saucer-type pattern.As reported in IBD's Technology section, the upcoming iPhone 8, which also marks the 10th anniversary of the iconic smartphone, carries a very steep price tag if bought separately. Also, Apple reportedly plans to use OLED screen technology for all new iPhones starting in 2018.Elsewhere, leadership-quality Chinese internets and other consumer spending-related firms are showing decent action after the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rallied more than 0.6% and is trying to jump back above its 50-day moving average.Sina (SINA) added nearly 0.7% to 87.23 in quiet trade. The stock is up 55% since Jan. 1 and has a market cap of $6.2 billion, putting it squarely in mid-cap range It's found support at the rising 50-day line, a sign that its uptrend is still intact.NetEase (NTES) rallied more than 1.6% to 299.41. The online game giant has recently given back modest gains of less than 9% after breaking out from a cup with handle at 301.92.Sina is ranked No. 9 in the IBD 50. The digital media network and owner of a large stake in messaging and multimedia social network Weibo (WB) sports a maximum 99 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Chinese cram school operator New Oriental Education (EDU), No. 29 in the list of premier growth stocks, rose more than 3% to 74.99 in below-average turnover and is hopping off its rising 50-day line, a sign of sturdy institutional support.Chinese video-based social networking platform Momo (MOMO) jumped nearly 4% to 40.79, registering a fourth up day in a row and climbing back above its 50-day line. The high-growth mid-cap (EPS up 633% in Q1, revenue up 421% to $265.2 million) is forming a new base and is just 11% off its 45.95 peak.RELATED:Inside IBD 50: How Many Leaders Are Basing Lately?Top Large-Cap Growth Companies: Inside IBD Big Cap 20What Is The Cup With Handle, And How Does It Make Money For Investors?

Home Depot rival Lowe's (LOW) also got hammered, dropping nearly 3% in big volume.Among other Dow components, Caterpillar (CAT) had one of the most interesting moves as shares found support at the 50-day moving average. It's the second pullback since a breakout on April 25.

The small-cap Russell 2000 was up 0.8% at the close. Indexes closed near session highs as buying picked up in the final half-hour.Volume fell, according to the first readings after the closing bell.

Volume was slightly below average, but a good burst in trading for the week made the breakout convincing. The relative strength line is at a new high, which is another plus for the breakout.

Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy from hold. The stock is coming back from a deep decline that started a year and a half ago.Retail industry groups crowded the bottom of Friday's performance table.

291,HD,"TJX (TJX), the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, disappointed investors with a first-quarter revenue and profit guidance miss early Tuesday, but shares started creeping back up during the call as management announced plans to introduce a new home-decor concept, Homesense, to American shoppers and expressed bullishness in the face of broader retail combustion.""Home is a driver for TJX,"" said CEO Ernie Herrman in response to an analyst query, adding that the company's home businesses have been ""a little stronger than apparel."" He also alluded to home goods being less susceptible to the impact of poor weather, which weighed on comparable sales during the quarter.""We think nobody can replicate the fashion and the quality level we have at our home businesses,"" he said on the call. ""We think strategically this is not a short-term vision.""Herrman was fairly mum about the details, but said that there would be an ""extremely visible difference"" between Homesense and its American sister, HomeGoods, that would propel customers to shop at both stores.While Homesense shares the same name as TJX's home-goods stores in Canada and Europe, spokespeople told Investor's Business Daily that the U.S. Homesense would be different.In Canada, the self-described ""home fashions off-price"" store can be found as stand-alone locations or as superstores, in which a HomeSense is teamed up with a Winners or Marshalls store, according to the HomeSense site. There are currently 106 stores across 10 Canadian provinces.The U.S. concept is slated to debut toward the end of the summer, said Herrman.While TJX's Marshalls and T.J. Maxx locations in the U.S. logged flat comparable sales, HomeGoods comps grew 3% during the April-ended quarter, better than FactSet views for 2.4% growth.Aware of the broader troubles of the retail sector, management brushed off the threat of e-commerce and Amazon (AMZN). People are still shopping for clothes at TJX-owned stores, was the message.Herrman said Q2 is ""off to a solid start,"" with inventory in a good position, and later added that the company is ""still gaining apparel market share in the U.S.""Shares of TJX tumbled 4.1% to 73.76 on the stock market today after falling to a six-month low of 73.17 earlier. On May 10, TJX tried to break out of a consolidation resistance area. But shares have sold off since then in the wake of grim news from other retailers. Off-price rival Ross Stores (ROST), which reports earnings on Thursday, was down 1.4%.In Q1, TJX's profit rose 8% to 82 cents on 3% revenue growth to $7.78 billion, vs. consensus for 79 cents a share and $7.88 billion in sales. Same-store sales rose 1%, below some estimates.Management sees Q2 EPS of 81-83 cents vs. 84 cents a year earlier. Analysts had expected 92 cents. TJX sees full-year profit of $3.71-$3.78, up 5%-7%, also below views. The company said currency effects and wage increases weighed on its guidance.Off-pricers like TJX and Ross enjoyed a reputation for being untouchable by Amazon, thanks to the in-store treasure-hunt nature of bargain-rack shopping. But Tuesday's weak sales and guidance raised concerns that status may be under threat as the rest of retail suffers a face-melting sell-off.Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS), J.C. Penney (JCP), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS) plunged last week amid grim results and a growing fear that department stores don't know how to stop the bleeding. Macy's and Dillard's have hit their lowest levels in more than five years, while J.C. Penney is at record lows.And Sears Holdings' (SHLD) CEO has resorted to blasting vendors in a blog post, in a bid to un-smear the long-ailing retailer's name in the press. That's sent Sears shares tumbling 12.3% on Monday.RELATED:Home Depot Is One Retailer That Isn't Falling Apart: Earnings StrongMacy's Doesn't Know How To Fix Its Stores, Hopes Something Will WorkHere's One More Thing Amazon May Be KillingWhat To Expect From Target, Wal-Mart In The Wake Of Mall Meltdown

After falling 6% last week, shares are down 14% more so far this week.Home Depot (HD) was a bright spot in retail as shares added 0.6% to 158.26, although they erased much of the early gains. U.S. same-store sales growth rose 6% in the quarter, well above the consensus estimate of 4.3%. Home Depot is another example of a stock that's extended in price.

294,HD,"The Dow Jones industrial average recovered some of Thursday's decline, and a nearly 11% rocketlike gain by Nike (NKE) had a lot to do with it. However, solid gains by other consumer-oriented names in the 30-stock blue chip index (think Apple (AAPL), Home Depot (HD), American Express (AXP)) also helped the Dow act as the leading index Friday.XThe Dow Jones industrial average lost some of its decent gains in the last half hour of trading, closing up 0.3%. That nipped a gain of nearly 0.2% by the S&P 500. The Nasdaq composite surrendered modest gains to lose almost 0.1%.Volume shrank sharply on both main exchanges as trading desks left early for next week's July 4th holiday.The Dow 30 snapped a five-week win streak, but lost just 0.2% for the week. In addition, among IBD's 197 industry groups, dozens actually roared sharply higher for the week. They included the oil field services (up 6.3% for the week), auto retail (up 5.6%), discount and variety retail (+4.4%), apparel and shoe retail (+4.2%) and hospitals (+3.5%).Notable winners for the week in the retailing and consumer goods side include Coach (COH) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI).At 6140, the Nasdaq has now dropped in three of the past four weeks. Yet it is still holding firm along its rising 10-week moving average, as seen on a weekly chart. The pullback since the Nasdaq's all-time high of 6341 three weeks ago has so far been limited to 4%.The small-cap S&P 600 rose 0.3%. At 859, the important equities gauge is on track for a second straight modest weekly gain.While Nike, reporting solid quarterly results late Thursday, is now arguably challenging a 59.10 buy point in a first-stage base, Apple has already advanced past its own bottoming base via a breakout on Jan. 6-9 at 118.12. Today, shares are rising enough to allow long-term holders to sit patiently and see if the iPhone and iPad giant will summon enough strength to rebound back above its 50-day moving average.At 144.02, Apple is just a 4% advance away from reclaiming the 50-day line, and this is key. Leading stocks have a habit of leading their rising 50-day moving average.Another indication that long-term shareholders can wait and see how Apple reports its next quarterly results, likely in late July: Notice how on June 9 and June 12, turnover soared to 64 million and 72 million shares, respectively. Yet, each of those stats pales in comparison with the 112 million shares that changed hands on Feb. 1 after Apple reported positive EPS growth for the fiscal first quarter ended in December last year.When you have a big decline in the heaviest volume ever since the stock's initial breakout, that's truly a chief red flag to lock in some gains, reassess the status of the stock's industry or sector, and to study the action of the main indexes.Apple is poised for a reasonable weekly decline, down 1%, after having already propelled more than 32% past the 118.12 correct buy point from a perfect cup with handle formed from Oct. 11 last year to Jan. 5. Notice on a daily chart how the handle featured a mild, downward slope, indicating a final shakeout of impatient investors, before the breakout took place.Apple sports a solid 83 Relative Price Strength Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, up sharply from the beginning of the year.On Tuesday, after sellers pounded U.S. stocks (the Nasdaq dropped 1.6% in higher volume vs. the prior session, notching a fifth distribution day), IBD's Market Pulse table inside The Big Picture column noted a change in the outlook to ""Uptrend under pressure"" from ""Confirmed uptrend.""The former means that it's harder to make money on the long side. It does not necessarily mean, though, that it's easier to make money going short in equities.Home Depot, meanwhile, is trying to regain its 50-day moving average after a sharp four-day slide that began on June 20. Shares are up 1% to 153.70, and are holding nicely above a Jan. 23 breakout past a 137.42 saucer-with-handle buy point.In the April-ended first quarter, Home Depot's earnings grew 16% to $1.67 a share, extending a magnificent streak of double-digit bottom-line increases to 13 quarters.The Street sees Q2 profit rising 12% to $2.21 a share; the current quarter ends in July.In other financial markets, crude oil jumped 2.5% to $46.07 a share amid a rout in the U.S. dollar this week. So U.S. oil exploration and field services rallied more than 1% in the stock market today, but so did homebuilders, construction machinery, jewelry, wood products, heavy construction and discount and variety retailing firms.Government bonds continued to drop hard, and the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield soared to 2.30%, the highest since mid-May.RELATED:Where Is The Market Headed?

But as noted in the Big Picture column, the current outlook returned to ""Uptrend resumes"" on Monday after the S&P 500 hit all-time new highs.Among IBD's 197 industry groups the big winners have been solar, biotech, generic drug, educational software, data storage and desktop software, with weekly gains of 6% or more.In contrast, amid the fast slide in crude oil futures (currently at $42.97, but this week making a bear-market-level correction from its 52-week high around $54.45), oil drilling, field services and oil machinery as well as apparel retail and Western bank stocks have paced the downside for the week, all down 3% or more since last Friday.In the Dow industrials, commodities-driven names continue to drag on the blue-chip index in recent weeks, while banks have failed to regain their positive momentum. Three of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average are down 1 point or more, including Home Depot (HD) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Home Depot fell more than 2% to 151.78 in heavy trading. The mega-cap DIY home-improvement retailer pierced its rising 50-day moving average for the second time in less than a month. Brick-and-mortar chains are falling in sympathy with Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), which plummeted more than 12% to 29.47 in whale-like turnover after reporting dismal fiscal first-quarter results (EPS down 34%, revenue flat at $2.74 billion). The stock issued a key sell signal in late December when it gapped down hard and took out both its 50- and 200-day moving averages and failed to recover.Bed Bath is now down more than 27% year to date.Vertex, however, is up more than 79% since Jan. 1. One reason is that the stock has shown the classic elements of a bottoming-base pattern. These patterns are especially bullish because they represent the opportunity to get into a potential new leader as it breaks out of an early stage base.In the bottoming base, a former leader goes on a deep dive, usually falling 40% to 50% from its high, often more. The bottoming base, like the one Apple (AAPL) formed in 2015 to 2016, will drag over a long time, frustrating those disgruntled holders who eventually ditch their shares.In Vertex's case, the stock dived more than 50% from 143.45 to a low of 71.46. But as seen in good first-stage bases, Vertex plowed back above its 10-week and 40-week moving averages at the start of this year. Watch for upside resistance near 140, which in turn could help generate a follow-on entry.Through the success of its investments in new molecules and biotechnology, Vertex has completely turned its profit picture around. It lost money in 2013, 2014 and 2015, then earned 85 cents a share last year. The Street sees profit vaulting 95% this year to $1.66 a share and another 88% to $3.12 the next.Vertex grew its revenue 65% to $1.7 billion in 2016. Analysts expect revenue to climb 30% this year to $2.21 billion.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Vertex now sports a terrific 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, reflecting the recent strong increases in earnings and sales and the stock's rising relative price strength. Plus, Vertex's biomedical/biotech group now ranks an excellent 19th out of 197 industry groups in terms of six-month relative price performance.RELATED:How Can You Spot Major Stock Market Tops?

"
300,HD,"Newly public Floor & Decor (FND) has found success against competitors both online and off despite the squeeze that Amazon.com (AMZN) is putting on a vast array of retailers from apparel to personal electronics.To be successful against the rise in e-commerce, retailers need to offer an in-store experience that can't be found online, along with unique product offerings, analysts say. Georgia-based Floor & Decor appears to be making headway doing that with 73 stores in 17 states that sell flooring and decorative accessories. In-store consultants also offer design advice to customers.""Hard-surface floor is more immune to the (e-commerce) threat, given shipping costs are much higher and service important. The look and feel is important. The advice of an industry professional is important,"" Zachary Fadem, senior analyst at Wells Fargo said in an interview with Investor's Business Daily.That doesn't mean Floor & Decor, which went public in April, doesn't have a huge presence online. During the company's first-quarter conference call in May, Chief Executive Tom Taylor said 71% of customers visited the company's website during the purchase process.But when it comes to making final decisions, shoppers still like to visit Floor & Decor's warehouse-like stores that average 72,000 square feet, where they can see new product offerings and get design ideas from professionals in the store's design studio.The large-scale store dedicated to flooring and its scope of offerings helps differentiate the company from its brick-and-mortar competitors.Floor & Decor has ""proved to be pretty resilient with high overlap with big-box housing companies,"" Fadem said. However, it would be a risk for Floor & Decor if the larger players decided to offer more flooring supplies in their stores, he added.All of the stores are within five miles of a Home Depot (HD) and 91% of the outlets are within five miles of a Lowe's (LOW), but the company still has put up double-digit same-store sales growth for the last five years.Floor & Decor is part of IBD's retail/wholesale building products group, which includes Lumber Liquidators (LL), Home Depot and Lowe's. The group is ranked 122 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.""I like to say we're democratizing the hard-surface-flooring category,"" CEO Taylor said on the quarterly call. ""Our unique supply chain that we have built and improved over the last 17 years effectively removes layers of middlemen, which increases our speed to market while driving down our product cost.""Most of Floor & Decor's stores are concentrated the Southeast, with just 5% to 6% of the company's stores in the Northeast. Fadem believes that the Northeast is a big expansion opportunity for the firm, as the region has the highest-growing market of existing-home sales. California is also ripe for expansion.The company opened three new stores in Texas, California and Illinois during the first quarter and expects to open a total of 14 this fiscal year, and enter its 18th state, Alabama.IBD'S TAKE: Winning companies usually make their biggest price jumps within the first few months or years of their IPOs. Currently, Floor & Decor is building an IPO base.""Our new-store growth strategy is to grow units by approximately 20% per year over the next several years in new and existing markets, with the potential for 400 stores across the U.S. within the next 15 years,"" Taylor said during the analyst call.New product lines like countertops and glass shower doors could also be a major growth opportunity for Floor & Decor, Fadem said.Sixty percent of Floor & Decor's customers are ""professional,"" meaning customers who buy the product to install in other people's homes, which tend to be stickier than do-it-yourself customers who only do one-time projects.""We love the pro customer, they do far more projects than the average do-it-yourself customer and they help raise the awareness of our brand,"" Taylor said.Floor & Decor currently has a small commercial business where they sell to apartment buildings, restaurants and hotels. Fadem says the space is ripe as a longer-term growth opportunity.The floor industry is tied to the health of the housing market and historically low mortgage rates and low unemployment have helped fuel the housing recovering as more millennials look to buy. But there have been some weakness in recent housing reports. Floor & Decor also is benefiting from low housing stocks as demand rises.""A recession is certainly a risk,"" Fadem said. ""Any sort of reversal in the housing spending environment would be a risk.""Recent IPOs like Snap (SNAP) have been on a hot streak recently only to fizzle. But Fadem said Floor & Decor's fundamentals were responsible for its successful April 27 initial public offering. It priced at 21 per share and jumped 50% during the trading day to close at 32, raising $185 million in its debut.Wells Fargo has a market perform rating on the stock with a 40 price target.On Wednesday, Wedbush initiated coverage on the company with a neutral rating and 45 price target.Wedbush analyst Seth Basham wrote in a note to clients that the company's margin potential was ""underappreciated"" as Floor & Decor has ""already done most of the 'heavy lifting' of investing in infrastructure to support rapid growth to a much larger company.""Floor & Decor shares were up 2.4% to 41.48 in midday trading on the stock market today.RELATED: IPO Stock News And Analysis: Find Today's Top New IssuesHome Depot Finds Support In Buy Zone As Amazon Rattles Retailers

302,HD,"General Electric (GE) on Wednesday announced more business and executive changes, spurring talk of a potential ""brain drain"" similar to what was seen at the industrial conglomerate after its last CEO switch 16 years ago.GE will roll its legacy power and energy connections businesses into one unit called GE Power. The current head of the power business, Steve Bolze, is leaving. He has been with GE for 24 years and led the takeover of Alstom's power and grid unit — the biggest industrial acquisition in GE's history.Russell Stokes, a 20-year GE veteran and the current head of the electrical connections unit, replaces him starting July 3.Bolze's departure has echoes of the exodus of senior managers after Jeff Immelt was named CEO in 2000, said analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets, noting that Bolze is believed to have been on the list of potential candidates to succeed Immelt.The 2000 transition resulted in the ""immediate bitter"" departure of the losing CEO contenders, such as Bob Nardelli, then-CEO of GE Power Systems, and Jim McNerney, then-head of GE Aircraft Engines, Dray said in a statement. (Nardelli went on to helm Home Depot (HD) and then Chrysler, while McNerney took over at 3M (MMM) and later Boeing (BA).)""That said, it is possible that the brain drain this time will be limited,"" Dray continued. ""We note that the other leading candidate for the role, CFO Jeff Bornstein, was appointed vice chair of GE on Monday, supposedly in lieu of the CEO position.""Shares of GE, a Dow Jones industrial average component, edged up 0.8% to 28.69 on the stock market today, closing just below its 50-day line. GE stock surged on Monday, when Immelt's retirement was announced, its largest gain of the year so far. But the stock is mired 13% below its July 2016 high.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) fell 3 cents to 120.03, just in range from a 114.54 buy point. Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 134.24, just below a 135.10 buy point.U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) rose 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: GE shares are having a strong June so far after three down months, but this is why GE is not a buy yet.Despite Immelt's upcoming retirement, incoming CEO John Flannery is expected to build on the strategy of infusing core units like aviation, power systems, transportation and energy with technology, which began under Immelt and has been generally praised.Still, GE's transformation into a digital-industrial company during Immelt's leadership has done little for the stock, which sits at around 28 — roughly where it was more than two years ago.GE stock has posted an annual average 5.2% gain in the past two years through Tuesday, roughly half that of the S&P 500 over the same period.RELATED:Stocks Flatten Ahead Of Fed, But Dow Etches New HighGE Signals New CEO Will Continue Software Push Started By Immelt

Penney (JCP) and Kohl's (KSS), big-box store pioneer Home Depot (HD) has managed to better withstand the onslaught than the department stores.The Atlanta-based retailer saw a welcome improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating based on Tuesday's action, rising from 68 to 72.This exclusive rating from Investor's Business Daily identifies market leadership with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score.

304,HD,"The Federal Reserve surprised markets with its relatively hawkish outlook Wednesday after raising interest rates for the second time in 2017. Most Fed policymakers still expect another rate hike in 2017, and three more next year. The central bank also said it will start to normalize its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet by year-end, with the details suggesting a slightly faster run-off that some had expectedBefore the Fed announcement, market pricing implied no more rate hikes for another year, and stocks did not react well to Fed hawkishness.The Fed's decision followed the latest in a series of surprisingly tame inflation reports. The Labor Department reported earlier in the day that core consumer price inflation, stripping out volatile food and energy prices, fell to a two-year low 1.7%.After the Fed's policy statement, the weak-Nasdaq, strong-Dow trade resumed as Fed Chair Janet Yellen elaborated on the U.S. central bank's views.The Nasdaq fell 0.7% in late afternoon trade, while the S&P 500 fell 0.25%. But the Dow industrials turned up 0.2%, helped by rebounding banks.Expectations of a slower rate-hike trajectory hit Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and other bank stocks ahead of the Fed announcement. But JPMorgan and Bank of America erased nearly all their losses by the close, with several banks turning positive.Housing-related stocks were among the lead performers on the stock market today ahead of the news, thanks to the benign rate outlook. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DRI) rose to a buy zone and hit an 11-year high, but pulled back somewhat as the markets soured.  Home Depot (HD), another Dow component, climbed 1.8%, rebounding from its 50-day line. Whirlpool (WHR) gained 1.4%.Fed policy expectations may continue to be volatile. On Tuesday, market participants were expecting the next rate hike by December. Before the announcement, they saw the Fed on hold until  next June. The 10-year Treasury hit the lowest level since the week of the November election and the 2-year yield saw its sharpest single-day drop since Brexit, but yields rebounded somewhat after the Fed statement.Even as the Fed has been on a tightening path, financial conditions have been easing, with the 10-year Treasury yield sinking about 50 basis points since mid-December.While economists still expect inflation to firm in the months ahead, their confidence in that outcome is waning after broad weakness in airline, apparel, auto and medical care costs.The Fed noted that inflation has been cooling, but Yellen said in her press conference that ebbing inflation appeared to be related to one-time changes, citing wireless data and prescription drug prices.""On a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2%,"" the Fed said in its statement. The Fed lowered its inflation forecast for 2017 but expects inflation to hit its 2% target over the medium term.Separately, the Fed detailed how it plans to reduce its balance sheet gradually. It'll let some expiring assets roll off the balance sheet, starting with $10 billion a month, or $6 billion from Treasuries and $4 billion from mortgage-backed securities.Jefferies economists characterized the telegraphed balance-sheet reductions as ""fairly aggressive"" compared to expectations.The caps will rise every three months by $6 billion for Treasuries and $4 billion for MBS until they reach $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively.Officials didn't reveal the exact timing of when the process will begin this year, as well as specifically how large the portfolio might be when finished.The CME Group FedWatch tool showed that markets now don't expect the next rate hike until March 2018. At that point, the Fed will likely have a new leader, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen's term ending in February.With job growth running ""well in excess"" of the trend growth in the labor force, Yellen said it's prudent to remove accommodation to avoid having to tighten too quickly later.RELATED:These Stunning Economic Reports Could Give Fed PauseBank Stocks Testing Key Levels Amid Fed, Weak DataThis Hot Sector Is Putting Stocks In Buy Range: Investing Action PlanHome Depot Finds Support In Buy Zone As Amazon Rattles Retailers

305,HD,"Investors dumped stocks in late-afternoon trading Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates, as widely expected. The Dow industrials were holding up the best among the key benchmarks, losing less than 0.1% at around 2:45 p.m. ET, after marking a new all-time high of 21,354 earlier in the day.But the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was off 0.3%, disguising decent gains from grain, non-alcoholic beverage, homebuilding, automaker, packaged food, meat and tobacco stocks.Weak U.S. economic data on retail sales and consumer prices sent long U.S. government bonds soaring, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note falling to as low as 2.10%. That low takes the yield on the 10-year bond back to levels right after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.While the fed funds rate is like to go up a quarter point to a target range of 1%-1.25%, banking stocks are falling amid poor data on U.S. retail sales (down 0.3% in May, vs. the Econoday consensus view for a 0.1% rise). However, damage is relatively limited among the top financial plays so far.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dropped as much as 1.5% before shaving losses to around 0.7% at 86.66, but volume at 2:30 p.m. ET was running well below usual levels.Among the groups leading the upside, IBD's Building-Residential/Commercial industry group is a market leader, ranked No. 6 among 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance.The group has at least eight companies boasting a Composite Rating of 95 or higher, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup. They include NVR (NVR), Taylor Morrison (TMHC), MDC Holdings (MDC), Pulte Group (PHM), MI Homes (MHO) and Toll Bros. (TOL).NVR added 0.4% to 2,443 in dull volume. The luxury homebuilder in the East Coast ran past a 1,845.47 saucer-type base entry after reporting an 18% rise in fourth-quarter earnings per share on Jan. 25. For now, shares are extended. Taylor Morrison, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., is extended from a first-stage big cup with handle at 18.46. Shares are up more than 3% for the week at 24.49.Industry peer D.R. Horton (DHI) is not in this elite group, yet its 92 Composite Rating is still respectable. The Fort Worth, Texas, maker of single-family homes rose 2% to 34.63, poking briefly above a 34.64 entry in a long cup with handle.Horton has done a solid job of posting steady and solid gains on both the top and bottom lines.Earnings have nearly quadrupled over the past four years, from 67 cents a share in fiscal 2012 (ended in September that year) to $2.36 a share in FY 2016. Sales have jumped from $4.35 billion to $12.16 billion over the same time frame.However, the Street is expecting slower growth in the future, and that may have something to do with the stock's recent failed attempts to make much of a gain after a solid breakout. The stock, as seen in a daily chart, tried to clear a 34.15 handle buy point on April 17-18, but notice how volume was less than stellar. The stock sold off hard the next several sessions, but Horton has done a good job of not falling too far below its critical 50-day moving average.IBD's TAKE: Home Depot is not the only consumer spending stock that is excelling this year. Go to IBD Big Cap 20 to find at least six names that are benefiting from strong demand in the medical, leisure and building-related industries.Pulte bucked the decline with a 0.6% rise to 24.28 and volume was heavy. The stock briefly advanced past a 24.53 buy point in a new seven-week flat base. The 12% decline within the base falls within normal range for a flat base, one of the most bullish patterns that great stocks form en route to excellent breakouts and fantastic price gains.Despite some questionable action by the builders on Wednesday, the prospect of a continued slow rise in the cost of money should be a tail wind for these builders and related stocks, since low interest rates encourage home buying. Home Depot (HD) gained more than 1% to 156.42 in fast turnover, triggering a new follow-on entry point as it finds nice buying support at the 50-day moving average. It's the second test of the 50-day line since the DIY building products retailer cleared a 137.42 cup-with-handle buy point in January.The Dow 30 component and mega-cap retailer has a decent but not great Composite Rating of 82 on a scale of 1 to 99. But that masks reasonable EPS growth targets of 12% and 13% in the next two full fiscal years.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) surrendered minor early gains and fell nearly 1% to 145.21, but the tech leader is still trading just 2% below its rising 50-day moving average. As noted in prior Stock Market Today columns earlier this week, the iPhone maker is in the midst of a general turnaround in both earnings and revenue growth. The stock had broken out of a proper cup-with-handle base on Jan. 6-9, moving smoothly past a 118.12 entry, 10 cents above the handle's high. Apple has since rallied more than 30%.Five Below (FIVE) sank as much as 6% to a session low of 48, undercutting its 50-day moving average for the first time since March. The stock is trying to rebound off that low but is still down 5%. Volume is running more than double normal levels. A future rebound and close near or above the 50-day line, currently around 49.59, would mark a bullish shakeout.RELATED:In Stock Market Today: Is Apple Flashing A New Buy Signal?Top Growth Stocks Today: Check The Latest IBD 50Strong Large-Cap Names: What's In The Current IBD Big Cap 20?

307,HD,"Toll Bros. (TOL) on Tuesday reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings early Tuesday, citing strong demand in ""affordable"" luxury homes. But shares of Toll Bros. and several other builders reversed to close lower, in part due to plunging new-home sales data.April U.S. new-home sales fell 11.4% to annual rate of 569,000 units, the Commerce Department reported at 10 a.m. ET, far less than the 602,000 expected. March sales were revised up substantially to a 10-year highs. Commerce figures last week showed a dip in housing starts and building permits for the month.Toll Bros.' results come as many homebuilder stocks remain in bases or buy zones, and as Wall Street looks for more insights into the state of the housing market.Estimates: Earnings per share of 63 cents, a 23.5% jump, on sales up 13.6% to $1.27 billion.Results: EPS up 43% to 72 cents with revenue up 22.2% to $1.36 billion.Toll delivered 1,638 units, up 22% in dollars and 26% in units, compared to FY 2016's second quarter. The average price of homes delivered was $832,400, compared to $855,500 one year ago as Toll makes more homes that are slightly less expensive.Net signed contracts rose to $2.02 billion and 2,511 units, up 23% in dollars and 26% in units.Outlook: Toll narrowed its fiscal-year delivery guidance to 6,950 and 7,450 homes vs. its old range of 6,700 to 7,500 units. The new midpoint is 7,200 homes, up from 7,100.""We believe we are benefiting from the appeal and national recognition of the Toll Brothers brand and a lack of large scale competition in the affordable end of the luxury new home market,"" said CEO Douglas Yearley in a statement.Stock: Shares hit 39.37 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today, but closed down 0.7% at 37.78. The stock is extended after breaking out of a flat base in February.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) hit 53.32 soon after the open, briefly topping a 53.10 entry of a double-bottom base, but closed down 1.6% to 51.63. D.R. Horton (DHI) fell 1.6% to 33.37 after initially climbing to 34.39, near a 34.64 buy point from a saucer-with-handle base. Beazer Homes (BZH) is working on a cup base with a 15.90 buy point, but reversed from a 2% gain to a 2.5% slide at 14.28. Pulte Group (PHM) sank 1.55% to 22.93.Toll's earnings arrive as more millennials start to consider buying homes in a higher-priced housing market. The real estate company Redfin, in a December forecast, predicted that the housing market would keep growing this year, ""but at a slower pace due to affordability pressures.""""Sales would be stronger if there were more starter homes on the market to meet demand from millennial homebuyers,"" Redfin said. ""The lack of starter homes will keep sales growth weak next year.""But rising prices have helped home-improvement retailers like Home Depot (HD) and rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Lowe's dipped to 84.05 on Monday, just below an 84.10 buy point. Lowe's edged up to 84.19 early but reversed for modest losses.Management for Home Depot, whose first-quarter results last week beat analyst forecasts, said on its earnings call that ""housing continues to be a growing asset class, and our sales thus far in May have been very good.""

308,HD,"X The stock market traded mixed in afternoon trade — ranging from minor gains on the Nasdasq to light losses on the S&P 500 — heading into the final hour of the session. The tech-heavy composite moved up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average inched lower. Volume was tracking slightly higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Monday. Among the other Dow industrials, IBM (IBM) paced the advancers with a 1.2% rise, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) followed up with gains of 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively.On the downside, medical components UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Pfizer (PFE) pulled the Dow into the red, declining 2% and 1.9%, respectively.Among the S&P 500, two chip stocks were among the leaders on the day. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged over 10%, while chip equipment stock Qorvo (QRVO) followed up on Monday's 5.5% advance with a 3.4% rise. Qorvo surged past a 72.52 flat-base entry, but remains within proper buy range.The S&P 500's laggards were once again retail stocks as they drastically underperformed the general market. Apparel companies Under Armour (UAA) and Hanesbrands (HBI) pierced their 50-day lines, falling 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, while Ralph Lauren (RL) and VF Corp (VFC) dropped over 2% each.Leading retailer Burlington Stores (BURL) gapped below its 50-day line early Tuesday, down 3.3%. Gains from a 92.77 cup-base entry had been as much as 13% just five days ago, but a four-day losing streak has brought the stock's gains to just 3%.China-based stocks drastically outperformed in the stock market today. Internet portal Sina (SINA) and so-called 'Twitter of China' Weibo (WB) reported early Tuesday, causing them to shoot 18.5% and 25% higher, respectively. Both companies topped analyst estimates. Sina surged out of a long consolidation that featured a 85.34 buy point. Weibo is now up 35% from its 57.57 cup-with-handle entry.Chinese e-commerce giants JD.com (JD) and Alibaba (BABA) moved up 0.9% and 2.1%, respectively. Chinese internet giant Tencent (TCEHY) will report its Q1 results before the open Wednesday. Action within the IBD 50 was predominantly positive heading into the final hour of trading, led by technology names. China components Momo (MOMO), New Oriental Education (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) led the way with gains of 9%, 7.1%, and 5.9%, respectively.Life sciences software provider Veeva Systems (VEEV) jumped 4% and is now up almost 30% from a 45.95 cup-with-handle buy point.On the downside, Stamps.com (STMP) fell 2.4%.

309,HD,"X Even TJX (TJX), one of the rare shining gems of the retail sector, is getting munched Tuesday after falling short of revenue, same-store sales and guidance estimates.Investors likely hoped the off-price heavyweight — parent to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods — and home-improvement chain Home Depot (HD) would offer bright spots for the retail-weary who had had enough of the dismal results coming out of Macy's (M) and its department store brethren last week.Off-price and home improvement, after all, are often highlighted as retail segments that show some resistance to Amazon's (AMZN) viral spread.Home Depot shares rose to a record high intraday after earnings and sales topped views.But, TJX shares, down 4% to 73.81 in the stock market today, are getting shoved around in the same manner as retail peers Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Staples (SPLS).Athletic apparel and equipment retailer Dick's plunged 13.7% to 41.03, hitting its lowest level since June 2016. First-quarter earnings met expectations at 54 cents a share, up 8%, but revenue missed forecasts by a hair (sales rose 10% to $1.83 billion), and same-store sales growth of 2.4% disappointed.Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser remains an advocate for the retail chain, which carries Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY) and other popular athletic brands.He says Dick's ""has an issue with the 1Q17 calendar, not with Amazon,"" citing calendar shifts, and posits that full-year guidance is ""reasonable, as the noise subsides.""What ails the retail sector is multifold: an overabundance of brick-and-mortar stores, a sluggish apparel space, the continual shift to online shopping and, of course, Amazon.Office-supply giant Staples reported a same-store sales decline of 3% in Q1, as per-share profit met views for 17 cents and revenue sank a more-than-anticipated 19% to $4.15 billion. Analysts were expecting $4.5 billion.Office supplies is another area that Amazon has encroached upon in its rise to the top.Staples shares fell 3.5% to 8.99, tumbling back below their 50-day moving average but closing just above their 200-day line after sinking to 8.81 intraday.Urban Outfitters (URBN) reported weaker-than-expected earnings, revenue and comps after the market close. Earnings per share tumbled to 13 cents a share while revenue was $761 million. Analysts had projected a 36% profit decline to 16 cents a share on less than 1% revenue growth to $768.1 million.Urban Outfitters' same-store sales fell 3.1% more than expected.Shares of the young-adult apparel chain fell initially in late trading, but then reversed higher for a 1% gain. Urban Outfitters shares fell 2.3% to 20.46, hitting a 16-month low intraday.The stock has hardly glimpsed light above their 50-day moving average this calendar year, as teen and youth stores struggle to attract an audience. Aeropostale and Wet Seal have filed for bankruptcy, and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) once the hit of the early aughts, confirmed last week that it is in early-stage talks to be bought out. Teen retailer Rue21, backed by private equity, filed for bankruptcy earlier on Tuesday.RELATED:TJX Sales Miss, Guidance Weak As Retail Sector Breaks DownHere's One More Thing Amazon May Be KillingWhat To Expect From Target, Wal-Mart In The Wake Of Mall MeltdownMacy's Shocker, Other Results Trigger Broad Retail RoutSears Stock Tanks As CEO Accuses Suppliers Of Exploiting It

310,HD,"X Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Tuesday. Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX), two Amazon.com (AMZN)-resistant retail giants, are on tap with earnings Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, Cisco Systems (CSCO) is nearing a buy point ahead of its quarterly results as analysts and investors see it as a cybersecurity play amid the WannaCry global ransomware attack.Futures for the Dow industrials rose about 0.1% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were fractionally above fair value. S&P 500 futures edged lower.On Monday, the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index both rose 0.5% to record highs, with cybersecurity and energy stocks leading the way. The Dow industrials gained 0.4%.In Asia trading Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.25%, hitting a 17-month high. China's Shanghai composite advanced 0.75%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.1%. In European trade intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE rose 0.6%, hitting an all-time high. Germany's Dax lost 0.1% while France's Cac-40 sank 0.3%Home Depot, a Dow component, reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday morning, sending shares toward a record high. Home Depot has been rallying more or less for the past three months, trading at record highs, with no potential buy point in sight for now.Improving housing and job markets are fueling demand for the home improvement giant. Building supplies is an area where Amazon has not made huge inroads for now.TJX, an off-price apparel and home goods retailer, also is set to report before the opening bell early Tuesday. TJX and other off-price chains were seen as relatively safe from Amazon because they offer branded goods at deep discounts with a treasure hunt aspect.TJX stock broke out past resistance in a consolidation on May 10. But shares have sold off sharply since then in the wake of brutal reports from Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN) and J.C. Penney (JCP), followed by Sears Holdings' (SHLD) public feud with a key supplier.Cisco Systems, another Dow stock, doesn't report until Wednesday night. But shares rallied 2.3% to 34.23 on Monday in heavy volume, just below a 34.63 buy point. Morgan Stanley upgraded the networking giant on Monday, citing its faster-growing software and security businesses. Computer security stocks have soared in the wake of the global cyberattack.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is uprooting more and more businesses, from its bookstore origins to cloud computing. Here's one more thing Amazon may be killing with its remorseless expansion.Cisco's security business is just 6% of its total revenue, but that's enough to make it a significant rival to some pure-play companies. Still, Cisco revenue has been declining as the lumbering giant transitions.Meanwhile, Ford (F) plans to cut 10% of its global workforce, which is about 200,000 people, the Wall Street Journal reported late Monday, citing sources.Meanwhile, Chinese internets Weibo (WB) and majority owner Sina (SINA) both topped first-quarter estimates early Tuesday. Weibo, a short-messaging social media operator, has already broken out to a new high, while Sina is near a buy point. Stratasys (SSYS) also is on tap as 3D printer stocks have skyrocketed since 3D Systems (DDD) reported recently.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why Are Growth Stocks Outperforming?Cisco Near Buy Point As Analyst Touts New Efforts Before EarningsAmazon: Dot-Com Survivor Turned River Monster Has Fueled 64,000% GainStratasys Earnings Up Next As 3D Printer Stocks Take Flight

312,HD,"X Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were slightly higher Monday morning heading into a new week. Stocks plunged last Wednesday amid a slew of negative news reports on President Trump, but the Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed the week with only modest losses.Ford Motor (F) will oust CEO Mark Fields on Monday, according to widespread reports. Ford's shares have tumbled 40% over Fields' 3-year tenure.Earnings season continues to wind down, but there are still a number of quality companies reporting this week. Lowe's (LOW), Best Buy (BBY), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and not only have earnings on tap, their stocks are in or near buy range. All three retailers either have resistance to the power of Amazon (AMZN), or have learned to cope.Futures for the Dow industrials, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 were fractionally higher vs. fair value.U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.7%, extending last week's run, closing above $50 a barrel on Friday.

Wall Street expects a 22% earnings per share rise to $1.06, with revenue up 11% to $16.96 billion. Larger rival Home Depot (HD) reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings last week.Lowe's shares cleared an 84.10 buy point from a short flat base just above a longer cup-with-handle consolidation. Lowe's held in buy range until retreating with the overall market on Wednesday, closing at 83.75. But shares rebounded, closing at 84.59 on Friday, back above the entry area.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The consumer electronics retailer, which seemed doomed as Amazon's showroom just a few years ago, has showed steady gains in profit and share price over the past several years.Best Buy reports quarterly earnings early Thursday, with analysts expecting the first decline in 13 quarters. Wall Street sees a 9% EPS fall to 40 cents. Revenue also is slated to drop 2% to $8.27 billion, though Best Buy has continued to struggle with top-line growth.Best Buy shares cleared a 49.45 cup-with-handle buy point on April 21. Shares briefly became extended but generally have stayed in the 5% chase zone. The stock closed at 51.33 on Friday.Ulta Beauty operates beauty stores offering a wide range of low- to higher-end cosmetics as well as salons. Ulta has managed to thrive as many other mall chains disintegrate. Beauty is a booming consumer market and Amazon hasn't made a massive effort in the beauty field.Ulta Beauty reports after Thursday's market close. Revenue likely rose 19% to $1.27 billion in its latest quarter with EPS up 24% to $1.80.On May 2, Ulta cleared a 289.37 buy point from a flat base formed just above a prior flat base. Shares are still in buy range at 294.02 as of Friday's close.Here's a bonus company to consider: Splunk (SPLK) is no retailer, but a data analytics firm.Wall Street expects Splunk late Thursday to report its loss doubled vs. a year earlier to 4 cents a share in the latest quarter. Revenue should climb 26% to $233.8 million.Splunk moved past a 66.56 buy point in early May. But the stock fell sharply on Wednesday and Thursday, undercutting that entry point. Splunk closed in the upper half of its range on Thursday and then rose modestly Friday to 65.92.Peer Tableau Software (DATA) blasted out of a consolidation on May 4 following its latest earnings reports.

313,HD,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed vs. fair value early Thursday after a tepid reaction to President Trump's tax plan on Wednesday.The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite turned slim intraday gains into whisper-thin losses. But that followed strong gains over the prior five sessions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin talked up tax cuts last Thursday, with Trump announcing the next day that a ""massive tax cut"" plan would be released this week. Then stocks jumped on positive reaction to the French election.Over the last five sessions, 32 of IBD's 197 industry groups have risen 5% or more.

315,HD,"Large-cap and megacap names dominated their small-cap peers as the stock market thrived on a broad rebound in afternoon trading Tuesday. Amid a 1.7% rebound in WTI crude oil futures, oil exploration firms helped lead the upside, and a 1-point gain by Dow 30 component Chevron (CVX) is helping the Dow Jones industrial average keep its head above the important 50-day moving average.WTI futures, helped by news about further trouble at Libya's oil-shipping ports, are currently near $48.45 a barrel, still down nearly 11% off their Feb. 23 peak of $54.45.At 2:45 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average accelerated gains to nearly 0.9%, practically equaling the gain by the S&P 100 index, which tracks the largest 100 companies in U.S. equity markets by market cap.The S&P 500 was also up around 0.9% amid reports that Republican leaders have vowed they will not quit at passing reforms to the Affordable Care Act, perhaps the biggest legacy from the President Obama administration. The Nasdaq composite slightly trailed with a nearly 0.7% lift. The Russell 2000 is catching up, rising more than 0.7%.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility index, a key measure of fear among index options traders, dropped nearly 6% to 11.65. On Monday, the VIX hit as high as 15.11, marking the highest level since Nov. 14.Among those giant companies, at least five names are showing excellent action after breaking out over the past five months. They deserve a close look. Home Depot (HD), a member of the Dow industrial average, sports the highest EPS Rating within the 30 components at 97. The stock, which earns a 95 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup, broke out past a 137.42 saucer-with-handle entry.Home Depot may benefit from the reported rebound in demand for single-family homes among the large millennial generation, in addition to ongoing strength in the do-it-yourself home-improvement market.Home Depot is No. 14 in the IBD Big Cap 20 in the latest IBD Weekly.Please see the top of page A2 in the current IBD Weekly print edition. The ""Vital Signs"" economic shapshot of three housing industry-related graphs showed that the supply of existing homes for sale in February dropped 6.4% vs. a year ago. ""Tight supply is limiting choices and boosting prices. That's good news for new-home sales, which jumped last month to their second-best reading of the current recovery,"" IBD noted in the commentary adjacent to the charts. Visa (V) is second best in the Dow with a 96 EPS Rating, meaning that its long- and short-term earnings growth is superior to 96% of all publicly traded companies. The megacap firm is acting well following its Jan. 24 breakout past a shallow cup-with-handle-like base at 82.59.Wall Street expects Visa to post a 16% jump in fiscal second-quarter profit to 79 cents a share on an 18% bump up in revenue to $4.29 billion. For FY 2017, ending in September, analysts currently forecast EPS up 17% to $3.32 a share and revenue up 18% to $17.73 billion.Boeing (BA), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also deserve close watch as all three have decent dividend yields that are higher than the 1.95% yield for the S&P 500 itself. Plus, all three stocks have shown nice advances following their own breakouts.Cisco sports the highest annualized yield among the three at 3.4%, followed by Boeing at 3.2% and JPMorgan at 2.3%.Solid earnings prospects are likely one key driver of these three stocks' current moves up.The Street sees earnings in FY 2017 rising 29% to $9.31 a share for Boeing, 4% to $6.57 for JPMorgan (followed by a 15% jump in FY 2018), and 1% to $2.38 for Cisco, which would mark the eighth straight year of increasing profits.Gold miners fell sharply and were the biggest decliners among 197 industry groups and subgroups covered by IBD. Greenwood Village, Colo.-based heavyweight Newmont Mining (NEM) slid more than 3% to 32.91 and continues to struggle since falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages on Feb. 22 and 27, respectively.The Accumulation/Distribution Rating of Newmont is positive at a B-, but that's more than offset by a poor Relative Price Strength Rating of 39 on a scale of 1 to 99. In general, focus on those companies with excellent growth in sales, profits and an RS Rating of 80 or higher. Snap (SNAP) sank nearly 4% to 22.95, which is a natural pullback following strong gains in the prior six sessions.A key technical line of support and resistance for Snap may in fact be the 10-day moving average, which responds more quickly than the traditional 50-day line. For now, Snap showed bullish action when the stock burst back above the 10-day line on March 22 in the sixth highest volume in a single session since its March 2 debut.If Snap holds its recent gains, expect the 10-day line to keep rising and catch up with the stock itself. The 50-day moving average won't show up on a Snap daily chart until late May.You can see the 10-day moving average in green in all Leaderboard charts. In Leaderboard, markets writers and editors note when a sharp decline below the 10-day line following a strong breakout and gains of 10% to 15% or more can provide a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The highly popular social media firm will clearly need plenty of time and a strong rebound in order to fashion the possibility of a good breakout.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Should Snap Stay On Your Watch List?Stock Market Today II: Is It Time To Add These 7 Chip Industry Leaders To Your Portfolio?Stock Market Today III: Why You Could Hold These 7 Dow-30 Stocks Longer For NowHow To Invest: First, Know The General Market Direction Via The Big PictureWhat To Buy: These Stocks Are Near The Proper Buy Zone

316,HD,"Traditional retailers, whose obituaries have been started and scrapped for years, are on the critical list again, with stores shuttering and e-commerce giants like Amazon.com (AMZN) in ascendance.Executives say put the death notices away, at least for one category. Malls aren't going extinct — they're changing, sometimes by healthy natural selection. While store closures are painful, often they represent a Darwinian moment, allowing a shopping center to refresh its mix by adding a grocery market or an Apple store.Investors aren't buying it. Literally. Mall REIT stocks have dropped 18% in the past year, compared with a 4% gain in the broader REIT group, as stores close at a record pace. At the same time, a view is building among industry analysts that skepticism has gone too far.Down 7% this year, Bloomberg's BBREIT Regional Mall Index trades for 5.1 times book value, down from its 2016 high of 6.7 and roughly in line with its decade average.New York University's REIT Symposium on April 6 featured presentations from chief executive officers at 27 REITs spanning numerous industries. But the conversation kept bouncing back to retail. Here's what the executives had to say:Retail properties come in many varieties, and shouldn't be lumped together. Malls aren't the same as strip centers, and, more importantly, high-quality malls — or ""A"" malls — are different from ""B"" and ""C"" malls. The consensus is that the high-quality malls will outperform.""If you own the best real estate, you will thrive,"" said Sandeep Mathrani, CEO of mall operator GGP (GGP). Retailers no longer care whether they're operating out of a strip center or a mall, he said. Quality is what matters. And of the 7.5 billion square feet of retail real estate in the U.S., only 1.2 billion is currently occupied by stores that are considered high quality, Mathrani said.When it comes to malls, ""high quality"" has been synonymous with luxury apparel brands. But the definition is changing as e-commerce puts a premium on creativity. A trip to the mall is no longer just about buying a designer handbag. Now it often involves going to a grocery store, doctor's office or upscale restaurant — all businesses that face less risk from e-commerce than traditional tenants. Some REITs are tacking on office space or apartments to diversify. One mall in Dubai even boasts an aquarium and an Olympic sized ice rink, and another features a ski slope.Mathrani said today's ideal mall includes one department store, a supermarket, an Apple store, a Tesla store, and businesses that started out online, such as Warby Parker. Clothing stores, which used to take up about 70% of the average shopping center, now represent closer to 50%, he said. Meanwhile, food is roughly 15%, up from around 6%.""Food is the new fashion, and fitness is the new food,"" said Acadia Realty Trust (AKR) CEO Kenneth Bernstein.Shoppers also aren't willing to travel as far as they once were for a day at the mall, so location and convenience are important. ""Old-fashioned retail shopping centers will continue to exist as long as they're in the right location,"" Mathrani said.Store closures such as those at Sears Holdings (SHLD) and J.C. Penney (JCP) have driven a lot of the recent negativity around retail, but some REITs have said good riddance. The exit of one retailer can present an opportunity to boost rents and lease space to a higher-quality store.Mathrani said that GGP had anticipated the fall of some stores, and has been able to fill 80% of the space that was left empty when retailers went bankrupt. Stores like Bonobos, Lululemon (LULU) and Warby Parker have filled the gaps.Technological innovation can also open doors, according to Conor Flynn, CEO of shopping center REIT Kimco Realty (KIM). He said driverless cars and ride-sharing could allow his company to transform parking lots into apartments and hotels.Some REIT executives said the U.S. has too much retail space. Flynn said a lot of shopping centers were built to keep up with household formation, but many of those households were never built. So as e-commerce continues to take more market share, parts of the country may need to do some demolition. In the future, the city you live in may have four malls instead of eight. The key, Flynn said, is having a good business both in stores and online.""Home Depot (HD) is a perfect example of being very efficient at both the physical bricks-and-mortar as well as the e-commerce business,"" he said. ""There is an omnichannel wave now that is widely accepted by most consumers.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Investors Who See Plenty Of Life In Dying MallsSeeking E-Commerce Shoots Among Retail's Brick-And-Mortar DeclineWho's Driving The Housing Recovery Now?

318,HD,"The market's back in a confirmed uptrend, which raises the potential for more successful breakouts by stocks and ETFs alike.Today we'll highlight two dividend plays that may soon be ripe for the picking. First up is iShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO), which tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index. The $1.7 billion fund is just below a 31.19 buy point of a 12-week flat base.It advanced 5% from its prior flat-base breakout in early February to the start of the current pattern. And in November, DGRO gained 4% after clearing a previous flat base.Not surprisingly, the fund's top holdings are all blue chip components from the Dow Jones industrial average. Representing the latter group is Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012. The iPhone maker currently pays an annualized 1.6% yield; its shares have rallied north of 30% this year.Microsoft (MSFT), which began offering a payout in 2003, yields 2.2%. Shares were up 13% this year through Tuesday's close. Other top holdings include S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (companies that have raised their annual payout for 25 consecutive years) such as Coca-Cola (KO), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). Apple and Coca-Cola were among billionaire investor Warren Buffett's top holdings in Q1. DGRO's annualized return is 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average payout of 1.9%. It launched June 10, 2014.Schwab Dividend Equity (SCHD), which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, has also been building a flat base for about 12 weeks. The ideal buy point is 45.48, or 10 cents above the left-side high. The $5.5 billion ETF shows similar action to DGRO, with small gains after breakouts in November and February.SCHD's top three holdings as of May 26 were Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Home Depot (HD), according to Morningstar Inc. The fund has a five-year average return of 14.2%, close to the S&P 500's 15.3%. The ETF's annualized dividend is 2.9%.Of the two ETFs spotlighted early Tuesday, iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) edged closer to a 28.72 buy point, while iShares Russell Mid-Cap (IWR) dipped slightly but remained near a 190.98 entry.RELATED:Which 2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Own Nvidia As Top Holding?Like Big Dividends?

320,HD,"X The stock market took a breather Friday ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend. All three three major indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Dow Jones industrial average — were trading around their break-even points through morning trade. Volume was tracking slightly higher on the Nasdaq but lower on the NYSE vs. the same time Thursday.Among the Dow industrials, Walt Disney (DIS) paced the advancers with a 0.8% gain, while Microsoft (MSFT) moved up 0.5% to notch a new high. Shares of Disney are building a base after triggering a sell signal in early May as shares plunged through their 50-day line on heavy volume.Home Depot (HD) carried the honor of being the biggest laggard among the blue chips, falling 0.6%. IBM (IBM) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) fell 0.5% each.Two retail stocks were among the top performers on the S&P 500 due to positive earnings releases. Ulta Beauty (ULTA) moved up 3.5% as the company exceeded Q1 estimates on better-than-expected same-store sales gains. Shares are extended from a 289.37 flat-base entry. Costco (COST) surged almost 2% after beating fiscal Q3 targets late Thursday.On the downside, profit-taking was evident in Best Buy (BBY) following Thursday's 21% price jump. The retailer fell more than 2%. Energy stocks were some of the other laggards, with Anadarko Petroleum (APC) and Transocean (RIG) falling about 1% each.Among other leading stocks, electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) traded 1.8% higher in the stock market today. Over the last three trading days, Tesla has moved up almost 6%, finding support at its 10-week line. Netflix (NFLX) fell 0.4% after reaching record highs yesterday.Burlington Stores (BURL) gave back much of Thursday's gains, falling 3.2% despite Goldman Sachs boosting its price target on the stock from 106 to 111.Software provider Veeva Systems soared 6.5% after crushing Q1 top- and bottom-line estimates late Thursday. Shares are over 40% above a 45.95 cup-with-handle entry.Action in the IBD 50 was mostly positive in midday trading. On the upside, fiber-optic stock Lumentum (LITE) moved up almost 3%, while live video streamer Momo (MOMO) looked to rebound from its 50-day, rising 2.8%.

321,HD,"General Motors (GM) stock skid Thursday on reports the automaker is being sued again for allegedly using emissions-cheating software in some vehicles.The class action suit, filed in Detroit by the law firm Hagens Berman Thursday, names the Sierra HD and Silverado pickup truck models with Duramax diesel engines as vehicles that General Motors allegedly tampered.The same law firm filed a similar suit last year against General Motors in California.In real-world driving, the GM models emitted two to five times the legal limit of certain dangerous pollutants — and may have caused more environmental harm than Volkswagen's vehicles, Thursday's lawsuit said.The law firm estimates that consumers paid premiums of $5,000 for vehicles sold as a powerful, efficient and eco-friendly diesel option, but which allegedly hide illegal levels of pollution.GM said the suit has no merit and will vigorously defend itself.Shares were down 1.8% to 32.60 on the stock market today after falling 3.9% intraday to a fresh six-month low.On Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), claiming the carmaker used software to get around emissions tests in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014. It followed a consumer lawsuit brought by Hagens Berman in December.Doubts about carmakers' diesel emissions statistics took off in 2015 after German car giant Volkswagen (VLKAY) admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests. VW has since agreed to $24.5 billion in penalties and vehicle repurchases.

333,HD,"Your stocks to watch this week are five Dow Jones industrial average components showing compelling chart action: Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), DuPont (DD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Home Depot (HD).X The market uptrend is under pressure following Friday's sell-off in leading tech stocks, including Apple. So investors should be cautious about any purchases.Apple had been forming a shallow base with a potential buy point at 156.75, but as tech stocks sold off Friday, the iPhone maker is facing a test at the key 50-day line. Apple breached that level intraday but was able to close the session back above the line. If Apple can rebound higher from that support level, it could provide an opportunity for existing shareholders to add to their position.DuPont rose 1.5% to 82.90 on Friday, hitting a 19-year high and clearing a double-bottom entry at 82.40. This pattern is called a double-bottom because it resembles a ""W"" — the middle peak plus 10 cents is your entry. (In a double-bottom base, the second leg down of the W must be lower than the first leg, shaking out weak holders.Volume on Friday's breakout was only slightly above normal. It's best to see powerful buying activity when a stock clears an entry, as that indicates institutional support.DuPont is currently seeking regulatory approval for its ""merger of equals"" with Dow Chemical (DOW). Dow's chart pattern is similar, but the stock has not yet cleared its own double-bottom entry.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for growth stocks with actionable trading opportunities? Check out Leaderboard, where our markets team curates a list of top names at or near buy points.Boeing remains in buy range from a flat base with a 185.81 entry, but the stock has recently hit some resistance around the 190 level. Boeing closed up 10 cents to 190.03.Disney shares have fallen about 10% from their April 27 peak of 116.10, hitting their lows of the year. But the stock found support Friday at the 200-day line. Holding above this long-term trend level is key. Disney is now working on a base with a buy point that's 10 cents above that recent high, at 116.20. But it's got a lot of work to do before then.After paring much of its gains from an all-time intraday high of 160.86 on May 16, Home Depot is testing support at its 50-day line. This is a second test of that level after the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base in late January. When a stock rebounds higher off the 50-day line, that's an opportunity to add a few shares to your position.

338,HD,"U.S. stock indexes ended Monday's session little changed, as volume fell off in the run-up to the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting.The Nasdaq crept 0.2% higher while the S&P 500 was flat. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%. The small cap Russell 2000 outperformed with a 0.4% gain. Volume was down on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.Blue chips were mostly off. Intel (INTC) fell 2% despite announcing it would acquire Mobileye (MBLY) in a $15 billion deal. Mobileye's stock jumped 28% on the news.On the upside in the Dow, Home Depot (HD) was among leaders with an incremental gain — 0.4% in soft volume.As the Fed's meeting approaches, individual investors should be aware of four factors that could determine the market's next thrust or next dive.No. 1: A rate hike from the Federal Reserve is widely expected. Chances are a rate hike is already baked into stock prices. The swing factor will be what the Fed says or hints at in relation to further rate hikes this year. The Fed officials have signaled that there will be three rate hikes in 2017 — two more after Wednesday's presumed increase. The Street will be parsing the language to get a sense of what comes next.No. 2: A marketwide pullback to digest gains since early November is still possible. The Nasdaq, for example, gained 17% from its low Nov. 4 to its high March 1. So far the current pullback, if it is fair to call it a pullback, has reached only 1.7% on the Nasdaq. The Nasdaq hasn't suffered a significant pullback since bottoming about 13 months agoNo. 3: A change in sector leadership would have consequences. Chips and bank stocks have been the leaders of the current uptrend. But while chips are in the No. 1 spot, banks fell to No. 4 of 33 sectors going into Monday's session. It's possible that banks could recover the No. 1 or No. 2 perch they held for months. But if something else rotates into the leadership, that could create some turbulence.No. 4: Optimism matters. Before Tuesday's open, the National Federation of Independent Business will release its February optimism gauge for small businesses. Since small business accounts for most job creation, this sentiment index is important. The Street's consensus number is 105, down from January's 105.9 reading. The range of estimates runs from 102.5 to 106.8. January's reading followed December's biggest month-over-month increase in the survey's history.West Texas intermediate crude oil was nearly unchanged at $48.46.RELATED:Why Oil Prices Could Face More Pressure Next MonthWhy Intel's Mobileye Deal Could Be 'Defensive' Driving

351,HD,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

The figures followed Commerce data last week that showed lower housing starts and building permits for April.On Tuesday, homebuilder Toll Bros.'

That's been good for Home Depot and Lowe's, as homeowners redo their kitchens, bathrooms, house additions and yards themselves.Customers also tend to prefer purchasing the larger, more expensive items sold there in person, since doing so makes it easier for them to size up what they're buying.

370,HD,"W.W. Grainger (GWW) shares are plummeting Tuesday after issuing worse-than-expected first-quarter results and shrinking sales and earnings expectations for the year, the latest nuts-and-bolts warning for industrial and construction markets.Earnings at the industrial-products supplier fell more than 9% to $2.88 a share as revenue notched up 1% to $2.54 billion, below Street expectations for $2.99 a share and $2.56 billion in sales.A ""stronger-than-anticipated customer response"" to pricing actions in the U.S. weighed on results, said CEO D.G. Macpherson in the release.""Based on the positive customer response thus far, we are pulling forward the remaining pricing actions originally scheduled for 2018 into the third quarter of this year,"" he said in the statement. ""This decision requires a significant change to our earnings per share guidance for the year but should enable us to accelerate growth with existing customers and attract new customers sooner than planned.""Grainger plunged 11.4% to 197.57 in the stock market today, crashing to a 14-month low.Grainger's slide follows Fastenal (FAST) and MSC Industrial Direct's (MSM) respective tumbles on earnings-result days. Fastenal sank 8.1% last Wednesday after reporting in-line profit and sales that beat slightly. MSC Industrial slid 6.2% on April 6, despite topping views, after offering Q3 guidance that disappointed. Fastenal fell 3.4% Tuesday, while MSC Industrial lost 3.85%.The recent reports from industrial and construction suppliers raise concerns about the health of the economy, as sentiment and other ""soft"" data start to fade and ""hard"" economic reports remain sluggish. Housing starts fell more than expected in March to a four-month low, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. Meanwhile, March industrial production sank the most since August on declining auto output.However, retail home and building supply chains Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) remain standouts. Both Home Depot and Lowe's edged higher intraday Tuesday, near record highs.IBD'S TAKE: Home Depot and Lowe's shares are acting well amid a struggling market, consolidating near record highs after breaking out around their last earnings reports that showed accelerating growth.In recent months, competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) — in the form of its business-to-business segment — has emerged as a worry among industrial-product suppliers.Macpherson told trade publication Industrial Distribution in March that he views Amazon both as a rival and a customer.""We view them as a competitor that we're watching closely,"" he told the outlet. ""We don't know where it's going to evolve, but we feel like if we step on the advantages we have around technical products or our sales and service model, our fulfillment, we're going to be in good shape.""The bulk of Grainger's sales are now online.Amazon shares rose 0.2% to 903.48 intraday.For 2017, Grainger now expects per-share profit of $10-$11.30 and 1%-4% in sales growth, down from prior guidance for $11.30-$12.40 EPS and a 2%-6% revenue increase.That comes in well below current analysts forecasts for $11.85 EPS and nearly 4% sales growth for the year.RELATED:HD Supply Falls To 3-Month Low On Earnings Guidance

373,HD,"Looking for some ideas for your portfolio? Want to boost the octane in your retirement account? Then check out how American Funds and Fidelity Investments — the second- and third-largest mutual fund complexes after Vanguard as of Dec. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. — were allocating their shareholders' money.The main lesson for individual investors? Even the smart money, in the form of these two fund families, can disagree about some key decisions.The three sectors in which their stock fund weightings differed from each other the most were information technology, consumer staples and energy.Fidelity's stock funds overall had 26% of their shareholders' money in tech, the group's largest sector weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for research firm CFRA.American Funds was well below that, with just 18% in tech.American Funds had more in consumer staples, 9% vs. only 7% for Fidelity.And American Funds had more in energy, 10% vs. just 6% for Fidelity.We recently dissected recent big buys by Fidelity, so here's a look at some big fourth-quarter buys by American Funds, whose 64 stock mutual funds were up 4.90% year-to-date as of Feb. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, was up 5.94%.American Funds boosted its share count in chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) by a whopping 43%.Analog Devices has a top-notch 98 Composite Rating from IBD, a peg under the highest possible on a scale from 1-99. The stock's earnings per share rose 6%, 2% and 68% in the past three quarters. Share price is up 14% this year going into Monday.Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was another stock in which American Funds made a big increase in its share count, adding 40% more to its stake.Bristol-Myers has a weak 61 Composite Rating. Share price has been trending lower since mid-July. Shares are down 2% this year but have rallied 22% since Jan. 26, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' consensus view and cut its 2017 guidance.One reason for Bristol-Myers' rally is that its cancer drug Opdivo recently won approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. It got a similar green light in Europe last year.American Funds jacked up its number of shares in Facebook (FB) by a net 39% in Q4. The stock has a good 92 Comp Rating. Shares have climbed 19% so far this year.Alphabet (GOOGL) is another name in which American Funds raised its bet, by 16% in the social-media giant's case. Share price is up 7% so far this year.Additional tech-oriented bellwethers were among the stocks in which American Funds made net new buys, including consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and software titan Microsoft (MSFT).But the big fund family hedged its bets in some other tech titans, including net redemptions in chipmaker Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN). It also trimmed big-box building products chain Home Depot (HD).Trims did not mean that individual mutual funds within the family had lost faith totally with individual stocks. Home Depot, a Q4 trim, remained a top-10 position in some of American Funds' largest portfolios.Home Depot was a top-10 holding by $84.9 billion Fundamental Investors (ANCFX), whose 10 biggest positions also included Amazon. Three net new buys — Broadcom, Microsoft and energy equipment and field services company Schlumberger (SLB) — were also top-10 positions in the fund, according to Rosenbluth.The $90.6 billion American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX) also had top-10 positions in Home Depot, Microsoft and Schlumberger.While Schlumberger was prominent in some individual funds, American Funds overall also made Q4 net big buys in integrated energy giant Chevron (CVX), boosting its share count by 4.8% to 70 million by the end of Q4.The fund group also boosted its share count in Royal Dutch Shell by 7.3% to 96 million.American Funds trimmed its share counts in several consumer-staples stalwarts. It trimmed 15% of its shares in household products giant Procter& Gamble (PG), soft drink leader Coca-Cola (KO) by 9.2% to 234 million and tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM) by 4.1% to 157 million.RELATED:Despite Brief Jitters, Investors Still Favor Online Leaders And Infrastructure PlaysMutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

376,HD,"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its peers.The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of the IBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this level, so investors may want to consider locking-in some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car- and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts. Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook (FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this year.Facebook is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax margin is 60%.Amazon (AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Southwest Airlines (LUV), MercadoLibra (MELI), Morgan Stanley (MS) and FedEx (FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames. It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter. Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company. It is often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names like Apple (AAPL) and MasterCard (MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the 80s and 90s, including Home Depot (HD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99 Comp Rating — the highest possible — and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration.

Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers.

Analysts had projected EPS of 29 cents and $9.84 billion in revenue.For 2017, T-Mobile forecasts adjusted EBITDA of $10.6 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range, excluding spectrum gains, vs. consensus estimates of $10.9 billion.T-Mobile said it expects 2017 postpaid subscriber additions of 2.4 million to 3.4 million, which again likely would lead the industry but which at the midpoint lags Wall Street expectations of 3.33 million adds.T-Mobile stock rose 1.2% to 61.60 in the stock market today, after falling in the premarket to near 60. Shares fell 2.4% on Monday on worries wireless competition has again intensified, after Verizon on Sunday announced its first unlimited data plan in more than five years. But T-Mobile continues to lead in subscriber gains with its ""Uncarrier"" deals, and its stock touched an all-time high of 63.68 on Jan. 27.""Not only are customers flocking to T-Mobile, but we're also producing rock-solid financial results including 11% growth in service revenues, 23% in total revenues, 31% in net income and 12% in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year in Q4,"" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in the company's earnings release.IBD'S TAKE: T-Mobile's 2016 revenue jumped 16%  to $37.2 billion. Look for more fast-growing companies at the IBD 50, which includes Nvidia, Momo, Broadcom and Facebook.T-Mobile in early January preannounced that it added 1.2 million postpaid subscribers in Q4, including 933,000 phone subscribers, topping Wall Street estimates. Sprint (S) added 368,000 postpaid phone subscribers in Q4, while Verizon Communications (VZ) added 167,000 and AT&T (T) lost 67,000.T-Mobile's Uncarrier marketing campaign, launched in March 2013, has enabled T-Mobile to gain subscriber and revenue market share vs. AT&T, Verizon and Sprint. AT&T has been the biggest loser of postpaid phone subscribers.Sprint and T-Mobile, smaller than Verizon and AT&T, have aggressively promoted unlimited data plans.Verizon fired back on Monday, offering its first unlimited data plans in more than five years, including high-definition quality video. T-Mobile late Monday also said that it would provide its unlimited subscribers with high-definition HD video rather than standard quality.RELATED:Verizon Returns To Unlimited Data In Battle Vs.

Investors had grown dangerously complacent.The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose 13% to 11.93 on Monday, hitting 12.90 intraday, after tumbling last week to its lowest levels since mid-2014, nearly hitting a decade low.The CBOE Volatility Index estimates expected volatility based on S&P 500 option prices. Commonly known as VIX after its ticker, the gauge highlights intense fear or complacency in the market. Low VIX readings are a sign that investors are especially bullish. Extremely low readings are often followed by market tops, at least in the short- or intermediate-term.Psychological market indicators like the VIX are secondary. That's why excessive bullish or bearish sentiment readings by themselves should not trigger a rush to sell or buy stocks. But you should be prepared, and focus even more closely on the action of the major averages and the price and volume action of leading stocks.The major market averages suffered their worst losses of the years. The Dow industrials lost 0.6% Monday after falling more 200 points at their low. Dow components Boeing, Intel and Home Depot (HD), pulled back toward buy points cleared last week, with Intel just closing below the entry area.

382,HD,"XThe Nasdaq composite led an uneventful session Thursday as Wall Street focused on another avalanche of earnings reports.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Home Depot (HD) outperformed in the Dow with gains of around 1% each. Nasdaq 100 leaders included Intuit (INTU), Xilinx (XLNX) and PayPal (PYPL), with gains ranging from 6% to 8%.The Nasdaq composite led the way, helped in part by strength in chip-equipment stocks, up 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 added less than 0.1%, weighed down by weakness in financials and oil and gas stocks. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in very close to Wednesday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, benchmark WTI crude oil futures settled near a four-week low, falling 0.9% to $49.18 a barrel.After the close, shares of Amazon.com (AMZN) jumped 4% after reporting earnings. Wall Street also eyed earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL), Fortinet (FTNT) and Western Digital (WDC).In the stock market today, Grubhub (GRUB) was a big winner, up nearly 23% to 42.95. First-quarter earnings and sales growth accelerated nicely from the fourth quarter, up 45% and 39% respectively. GrubHub's technical health improved quite a bit with a bullish gap above the 200-day moving average. It's only 3.7% off its high of 44.58 now.PayPal also had a good day, up 6% to 47.15. Headed into Thursday, it was still within buy range from a 43.90 buy point, but it's extended now. PayPal's Venmo social payment system has been a hit with the millennial crowd.

383,HD,"XLate-session declines whittled Wednesday's moderate gains to a weak finish.Earnings disappointments were the leading culprit, gnawing away at the week's early momentum and grinding the Dow Jones industrial average's early 0.4% gain to a 0.1% decline. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also shredded their gains, the Nasdaq ending flat and the S&P 500 down less than 0.1%.All the indexes remained firmly positive for the week.Compared to busy sessions Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday's action was comparatively quiet, with preliminary data showing trade slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.At either end of the Dow industrials, United Technologies (UTX) rose nearly 2% and Procter & Gamble (PG) dropped 2%, both on quarterly results. United Tech remained in a buy range, 3% above a flat base buy point of 114.54. More than half of the Dow's stocks traded higher, with Verizon (VZ), Home Depot (HD) and Travelers (TRV) also posting gains of around 1%.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) easily led the S&P 500, pulsing more than 10% higher after reporting that strength in U.S. heart-valve replacements helped power a 32% first-quart earnings gain and a 27% rise in sales. Both numbers clobbered analyst expectations. The move hoisted shares back above the 40-week moving average as Edwards works on the right side of a six-month consolidation.Gains were more modest on the Nasdaq, led by a 3% advance by Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH). The gain put shares narrowly above a 52.60 buy point in two-month long a flat base.The low end of the Nasdaq was a different story, with Seagate Technologies (STX) gouging out a 16% loss. The maker of computer hard drives posted a 400% EPS gain, above analyst targets. But a 3% revenue advance stopped short of expectations. The loss sent shares below their 10-week moving average in heavy trade, triggering a sell signal.Hard-drive peer Western Digital (WDC) slipped 3% in strong trade. It reports earnings after the market closes on Thursday.The Leisure–Lodging group posted the strongest gain among industries as Wyndham Worldwide (WYN) spiked 9% to a record higher after turning in a powerful first-quarter performance and raising its full-year guidance.

Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron outperformed Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front party, raising hopes that France will remain a member of the European Union. Round 2 between Macron and Le Pen will be on May 7. Among the Dow industrials, financial components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) were the runaway leaders, surging over 3% each.

Shares are approaching a 99.56 flat-base entry.Only three stocks traded in negative territory, Verizon (VZ), Wal-Mart (WMT), and Disney (DIS). Shares of Verizon fell further under their 200-day as they approach their 52-week low, while Wal-Mart briefly notched a new high before retreating 0.4%. Disney traded down 0.3% after being downgraded to hold from buy at Loop Capital, but remains above a 112.09 flat-base buy point.FANG stocks were performing well in the stock market today. Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) notched fresh all-time highs, while e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) reclaimed its 900 price level. Amazon's price target was raised to 1,250 by Wedbush Securities ahead of Thursday's Q1 earnings results. Video streaming company Netflix (NFLX) looked to retake its 50-day line, which it gave up last week after disappointing Q1 results. Among stocks breaking out today, home improvement stores Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Companies (LOW) both emerged above buy points in early trading. Home Depot leapt above a 150.25 flat-base entry, while Lowe's briefly surpassed its flat base's 84.10 buy point before faltering.On the downside, homebuilders drastically underperformed heading into midday trading. The past three trading days have not been kind to leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM). During that span, shares have fallen nearly 6% from highs to their 50-day line where they currently trade. However, shares remain about 4% above a 22.09 cup-with-handle entry. Shares dropped 1.2% early Monday. Among leading growth stocks, Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) paced the gainers with a 3.5% rise, while regional banks played a key role in the IBD 50's strength. Macom reclaimed its 52.32 cup-with-handle entry. Florida-bank Seacoast Banking (SBCF) extended its recent breakout's gains, but remains solidly within the 5% buy range. Shares broke on last Thursday when shares exceeded the 24.48 cup-with-handle buy point.RELATED:Amazon Price Target Raised To 1,250; Disney Downgraded; Sonic UpgradedChipmaker's Earnings Expectations Rise Ahead Of BreakoutWhere Is The Stock Market Headed?

385,HD,"XThe main indexes remained higher in afternoon trading Thursday, as small caps and retail stocks led a soft bounce in the market.Despite a bearish reversal Wednesday, the S&P 500 was up 0.4% and finding support near the 50-day moving average. That suggests the index can stay on track with its uptrend, although some institutional selling over the past several weeks poses a threat.The Dow Jones industrial average, also up 0.4%, is tracing a similar chart. Most of its 30 components were higher, with Home Depot's (HD) 0.6% rise adding to the gains in retail. Wal-Mart (WMT), however, was flat.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. But it was small caps that shined brighter, as the Russell 2000 climbed 0.5%. The index, though, remains below the 50-day moving average. Volume was lower across the board.Retail stocks led the market today. Apparel firms, discounters, department stores and other retail groups — all of them in the lagging industry rankings — were up 2% to 4.5%. Kohl's (KSS) jumped 6.5%, but like other department-store stocks it remains deep in a correction.Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, leaping past the 61.77 buy point in about one-third more volume than usual. The company's home brands include Master Lock, Moen faucets and several cabinet lines.Sociedad Quimica y Minera (SQM) broke out of a base-on-base pattern, surging past a 34.94 buy point in nearly double its usual volume. The Chilean provider of fertilizers and lithium and other chemicals is turning itself around, going from a few quarters of declining EPS to gains of 320% and 82% the past two quarters.Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI) found support after a sharp pullback to the 10-week moving average. Volume was tracking at three times the average.The IBD 50 was indicated 0.6% higher, and some of its semiconductor stocks behaved favorably.Cavium (CAVM), one of the many new technology components on the screen, rose 0.5% as the stock climbs from support at the 50-day moving average. Volume was tracking well below usual levels, so the stock may need more of a push before it can be considered in a new buy area. It would be a secondary entry for the chip stock, which has glided well from a flat base breakout Dec. 6.Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) made a bullish reversal after touching its 50-day line. But the stock remains below the most recent buy point at 91.86.RELATED:Are Retail Stocks Doomed? Shorting Potential Abounds, But Hope Remains

386,HD,"Samsung's newest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, is likely to provide a sales boost for a number of component makers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Universal Display (OLED), analysts say.After Samsung introduced its Galaxy S8 handsets at a media event Wednesday in New York City, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said the Galaxy S8 is a ""slight positive"" for Broadcom, Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks.Meanwhile, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri believes the Galaxy S8 has positive implications for Immersion (IMMR), Skyworks, Synaptics (SYNA) and Universal Display.Among the stocks highlighted by Pacific Crest and Cowen, the biggest movers on the stock market today included Universal Display, which surged more than 6% at one point but ended the day up 2.4% to 86.70. Immersion ended trading with a larger percentage gain, though it started off slower, finishing up 2.5% to 8.58. Qorvo was up 1.8% to 69.08.Broadcom slipped 0.6% to 220.04 while Skyworks was up 0.9% to 98.14.Universal Display provides technology and materials for making organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays. The S8 will feature a borderless OLED screen called an Infinity Display, using Universal's products.Immersion is seen providing haptic feedback technology, which adds physical sensations like vibrations to user interfaces. On the S8, it is used for the phone's force-sensing, on-screen virtual home button.Synaptics could benefit from Samsung's use of multimode biometric security technology in the Galaxy S8, Arcuri said in a report.Further, radio-frequency chipmakers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks will see an increased content opportunity from the S8 handsets, Vinh said in a report. IDT will benefit from sales of its next-generation wireless transceiver for wireless charging, Vinh said.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo is one of 10 chip industry stocks on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth companies.Samsung also introduced a new Gear 360 camera for taking 360-degree videos and still images for playback in virtual-reality headsets as well as PCs and mobile devices. This news was unfavorable for action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO), Arcuri said.""This is negative for GoPro, which we believe is late entering the consumer 360-degree capture market,"" Arcuri said.The pocket-size Gear 360 captures high-definition 4K video and can live-stream in HD. It is compatible with a number of Galaxy models as well as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. It is expected to go on sale in late April or May and cost less than its predecessor, which was priced at $350.RELATED:Samsung's Galaxy S8 Gets Jump On iPhone 8, But Apple Stock Hits High

387,HD,"Final Frontier: When NASA retired its shuttle fleet in 2011, space buffs moaned that the U.S. was abandoning its leadership in space. The opposite happened. In fact, it was arguably the best thing that could have happened to space travel, as private companies rushed in to fill the void.This week provided two stunning examples of the fierce private-sector competition and resulting rapid advances in space travel.On Thursday, SpaceX — the private company owned by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk — achieved a huge new milestone with its launch of a recycled Falcon 9 rocket that it had previously launched and then landed on a floating platform.Musk said this ""is going to be, ultimately, a huge revolution in spaceflight"" because it will drastically cut launch costs.Safeguard Your Retirement: IBD Annual Report On Retirement PlanningThe day before, Jeff Bezos announced plans to send paying customers into space using his Blue Origin-built rocket and space capsule by next year. The Amazon.com (AMZN) founder says Blue Origin — which has also successfully landed and reused a rocket booster five times — is on track to conduct the first human test flights later this year.Musk, meanwhile, announced plans to send two paying customers on a trip around the moon in 2018 aboard its privately built Dragon spacecraft.Bezos and Musk have arguably made more advances in spaceflight technology in just the past few years than NASA has made in decades.And these are just the latest headline-grabbing developments. Several other private companies are racing to develop better, safer, cheaper and more reliable ways to commercialize space travel.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Inc. is developing a Stratolaunch aircraft that would release a launch vehicle from a plane with a wingspan the length of a football field. The goal is to make it far cheaper to launch low-Earth orbit satellites.As Allen put it in a LinkedIn post, ""when such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine.""Axiom Space, founded last year, plans to build a privately owned space station starting in 2020. The company says the station will host private research and manufacturing, as well as astronaut missions and space tourism for ""'individual and corporate-sponsored participants.""Deep Space Industries started up in 2013 with plans to develop asteroid-mining technologies ""that will transform the space economy.""Google got into this game as well with its 2008 Lunar XPrize competition, which will pay out $20 million to the first team that can land a rover on the moon that can travel 500 meters and transmit HD video back to Earth. Five teams plan launches later this year.There are two important lessons to be learned from this frenzy of private-sector space activity.The first is that government doesn't need to be the driving force in exploration. In fact, NASA is becoming increasingly irrelevant to these endeavors. That's a lesson even some conservatives need to learn.Charles Krauthammer, for example, blasted the Obama administration back in 2010 for canceling NASA's Constellation program and turning the job of getting people into space over the private sector. ""This is nonsense,"" he wrote. ""It would be swell for private companies to take over launching astronauts. But they cannot.""Second, it shows why the liberal fixation on ""income inequality"" is so misguided. To hear the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warrens of the world tell it, it's not fair to let the super-rich keep their money, when the government could take it away in taxes and then ""spread it around.""But people like Bezos, Musk and Allen aren't sitting on their fortunes. They're investing the money in ambitious, innovative, risky new endeavors that promise to create new jobs and vast new opportunities down the road.Space remains the final frontier. And it will be private sector entrepreneurs, not government bureaucrats, who will take us there.RELATED:SpaceX Rocket Is A Capitalist TriumphAmerica Doesn't Need NASA To Stay On Top In SpaceBlue Origin: While NASA Fiddles, Private Sector Conquers Space

Home Depot rose 1.2% to 146.68, climbing further above buying territory after a January breakout.In November, Lowe's, which has also focused more on online sales, characterized the home-improvement industry as ""solid but moderating"" but said the market's growth had ""continued to outpace overall retail sales"" through the back half of 2016.Last week, larger rival Home Depot reported fourth-quarter results that topped expectations, helped by a ""healthy housing market"" and larger purchases of things like appliances and flooring.Home Depot's larger, difficult-to-ship offerings and its customers' needs for immediate service might protect it more from Amazon (AMZN) than other retailers, Jared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, noted last week.Still, Home Depot's management during the company's earnings call last week touted ""great strides"" in its online business, including improvements to its mobile app, easier search functions and quicker checkout.Roughly 45% of Home Depot's online orders in the U.S. were picked up in its stores, management said.Meanwhile, homebuilder sentiment has remained elevated since the election, and rising mortgage rates could temporarily encourage more homebuyers to buy before rates drift higher.RELATED:Lowe's Earnings Miss As Home Depot Keeps Outpacing Rival

395,HD,"Michael Clarfeld has helped steer $5.6 billion ClearBridge Dividend Strategy Fund (SOPAX) to solid performance by pursing high-quality stocks that provide price appreciation with improving dividends.The fund he co-manages has returned an average annual 8.89% in the three years ended Jan. 31, topping 80% of the diversified income-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.12%.His bull's-eye is dividend growth, not high dividends. He and co-managers Harry Cohen and Peter Vanderlee favor stocks that are financially healthy enough to pay dividends that rise. They avoid those with yields that are inflated either by companies desperately trying to attract investors or by falling share prices.The bonus is that the financial strength that provides a launchpad for dividend growth inoculates stocks against the risks of a rising interest rate environment, he says.""Stretching for yield is risky,"" he warns. ""Dividend growth is the place to be. That growth can offset the negatives of rising rates.""Dividends can be shock-absorbers, smoothing investors' rides during market turmoil. Yet their stock holdings still offer the potential of price gains, the thinking goes.Just look at some of his fund's holdings. Among the fund's four holdings with the highest Composite Ratings from IBD, Texas Instruments (TXN) is up 43% in the past 12 months ended Jan. 31; it has an annual dividend growth rate of 15.3% in the past three years, according to dividend.com. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 42%; its dividend growth rate is 10.6%. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is up 22%; its dividend growth rate is 6.8%. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is up 41%; its dividend growth rate is 31.2%.IBD'S TAKE: UnitedHealth is No. 1 in IBD's Medical-Medical Care industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 87 IBD Composite Rating and four straight years of earnings per share (EPS) growth — stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.That volatility antidote of dividend-paying stocks might come in handy sooner rather than later. The market has traded sideways since mid-December as investors wait to see how the newly installed president's policies play out and whether a Republican-controlled Congress makes good on the business friendly actions investors expect from it.Stocks offering dividend growth also might fare better than bonds if the Federal Reserve makes good on its signals that it intends to raise rates multiple times this year.From his office in Manhattan, 39-year-old Clarfeld talked with IBD about whether it's wise to own a dividend-paying portfolio in a rising rate environment and his fund's overall investment approach.IBD: Do you ever give in to temptation and buy high-yield stocks?Clarfeld: If you buy only stocks with high current dividends, you miss out on some good stocks. We own American Tower (AMT), for instance, which is a wonderful business. (Its share price is up 34% since the end of 2012. Its dividend yield is 2.2%.) But it only began to pay dividends in 2012. So you have to be open-minded.We used to own Heinz (now part of KraftHeinz (KHC)). Several years ago it was much easier to find great companies with solid growth and high dividends like Heinz. But then it got taken over. We couldn't find a replacement that was as good a company with a good growth rate and a high current yield, so we ended up tilting more toward dividend growth and a little less toward high current yield as the impacts of quant easing became more pronounced over the last many years.IBD: Dividend growers are among the most stable companies. Why not buy shares in them directly and avoid a fund's expenses?Clarfeld: There are a couple of reasons. One is diversification. It would not be particularly efficient for an individual to buy 4o to 50 stocks. The broker commissions would add up.And the average person who has a job and a family does not have time to follow 50 different companies, industries, competitors and figure out which to buy, the correct time to buy, and so on.IBD: You began a stake in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) not long ago, but well before its recent Trump bump. What's your thesis?Clarfeld: We bought it early in the year when it was yielding north of 3%. (Yield now is 2.3%.) Pre-election, there was so much investor fatigue toward large banks, prices were very beaten down. And the prospect of interest rates going up, it seemed like it would never happen. And it seemed like regulatory pressures would persist forever. We just thought the valuation was too pessimistic. And JPMorgan has lots of franchises that are valuable.IBD: Texas Instruments' (TXN) earnings per share growth has accelerated for four straight quarters. What's driving it?Clarfeld: We like their emphasis on analog chips. If you think about Texas vs. Intel (INTC), which we also own, Intel makes the brains of computers. They are high performance, high dollar value. Texas focuses on the other end of the spectrum. Their chips sell for 10 to 20 cents. They are basic but high quality. And they're attractive because they are the largest player in that space.Anyone designing a new alarm clock or refrigerator or car and needs basic chips knows that Texas Instruments has them. And once those chips are designed into something, it rarely changes. So they provide a recurring revenue stream like an annuity.High performance chips require huge R&D spending. Texas Instruments' chips are much less capital intensive. So they can direct 100% of their free cash flow to shareholders.IBD: Automatic Data Processing (ADP) got a nice Trump bump. But you've owed this for years, right?Clarfeld: It's been a core holding for 10-plus years. It's a business we think can compound earnings for years. And payroll processing provides recurring revenues. Once you get a company's payroll, the business is sticky. This company benefits from job growth in the economy. It is taking share. And it provides ancillary services. They help companies deal with Affordable Care Act compliance, although a potential repeal or replacement is now a risk for them. Still, the ACA is not a core driver of this business.And recently it's benefited like a lot of financials from rising interest rates. They earn a float on payrolls they handle. Rising rates mean that float will increase.IBD: You reopened your stake in Alphabet (GOOG) after closing it. What brought you back?Clarfeld: We're a dividend portfolio. We don't go looking for nondividend-payers, but we don't want to be overly dogmatic. We wanted this exposure and there is no other way to get it.Over the past 10 years, we've owned three nondividend-payers: Apple (AAPL), Berkshire Hathaway (BERKB) and Alphabet. There is no search company like Google. There is no company like Berkshire Hathaway, which won't initiate a dividend while Warren Buffett is alive. After he's gone, who knows? And we think Alphabet will likely initiate a dividend in the future. We're not forecasting that, but we think they will.IBD: You trimmed your Waste Management (WM) stake. Why is that?Clarfeld: Actually, it's an example of a business we like. The business is stable and predictable. It's cyclical with the economy. There's been enough consolidation to make the industry rational. In fact, they've been able to drive prices higher despite a relatively weak economy. We have trimmed some just on valuation.IBD: What distinguishes Walt Disney (DIS) from other media names?Clarfeld: Their ability to create properties and then monetize them. They make movies, then turn it into a theme park attraction and then sell merchandise from it to kids. They show an ability to do that in a way few other companies can.And they own ESPN, which is dominant in sports. The biggest piece of ESPN is monthly subscription income, not advertising, and their paid subscribers are growing. So their revenue is stable and predictable. They have multiyear contracts with (cable) systems, with built-in (price) escalators.IBD: Is Home Depot (HD) a play on an expected pickup in economic growth?Clarfeld: What we like about it is not what's going to happen to the economy in 2017. We don't own a lot of retailers because they're hard to understand. And they have a fashion element, which can become unpopular suddenly. Home Depot is not like that. They're not trying to call a fashion fad. And they don't need to spiff up their stores, which are warehouses. It took a huge step down in the financial crisis. We bought it back then. Our cost basis is below 30. (Now it's trading around the high 130s.) It's a play on people spending on their homes.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has trended higher since the election. Is this a play on the expectation of reduced health care regulation?Clarfeld: They have diversified their operations. The stock has done well because people expect reform or changes under the new administration that will be market based. Company management is very commercially oriented.RELATED:Where Vanguard's CEO McNabb Sees Fund Giant Headed In 2017Where Mutual Fund Bigwigs Expect To See Stocks Gains In 2017After 2016 Ends On Strong Note For Mutual Funds, What's Ahead For 2017

The small cap Russell 2000 fell 0.5%. Volume in the stock market today dropped on both major exchanges.As President Trump settles into the White House, some stocks that got a postelection pop now appear more iffy. IBD's building cement industry group jumped almost 10% the day after the election. But since then, the group has moved sideways. The group is now only up an additional 4% since the initial 10% gap up.On Monday, Trump's infrastructure advisor Richard LeFrak told CNBC that conservatives in Congress may cut Trump's infrastructure wish list in half. LeFrak said the battle will be between those concerned about deficits and those focused on jobs. But LeFrak said he expects Trump to prevail.Cement and wallboard provider Eagle Materials (EXP) has sketched a flat base. The stock recently found support at its 50-day moving average line. Eagle's fiscal year ends in March. The Street expects annual earnings to rise 36% in fiscal 2017 and then pop 24% in fiscal 2018. Both represent downward revisions.Flat bases and/or tests of the 50-day line are the pattern for most stocks in the concrete group. Downward earnings revisions also are typical.The sideways chart action may continue until the Street gets a clearer picture on Trump's infrastructure budget.

397,HD,"Days after the inauguration, President Donald Trump's impact on the stock market was atop the minds of investors and financial advisors who gathered in Hollywood, Fla., for the 10th annual Inside ETFs conference.At a roundtable titled ""Where To Invest In 2017,"" which helped to kick off Monday's sessions, ""Trump ETFs"" became the shorthand for the best investment ideas in the year ahead. Invest in steel, ships and railroads — and more broadly in the U.S. defense industry, said Dennis Gartman, editor and publisher of the Gartman Letter and an expert in the commodities and capital markets.""Don't overthink this,"" Gartman advised an audience comprised of financial advisors and investors. ""Mr. Trump has proposed investing in infrastructure, investing in the military. Those are going to be easy bets.""Moderator Bob Pisani, the ""On-Air Stocks"" editor at CNBC, asked the panel of experts about the specific ""Trump ETFs"" that could benefit from the new U.S. president's focus on tax cuts and fiscal spending. Their responses included the following three exchange traded funds:Andrew Lapthorne, another panelist at the roundtable and head of quantitative research at Societe Generale, said a fairly robust U.S. economy was likely to be pumped up further through fiscal stimulus. But he cautioned that American corporations are more leveraged than they have ever been and valuations are extremely high.""For me, the biggest risk of the Trump administration is how (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen responds"" to his policy moves, he added.On the sidelines of the ETF conference, Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim Investments, described some of his firm's products as belonging to the camp of ""Trump ETFs"" too.RSP's stock holdings should benefit from lesser regulation, the generally more favorable business climate and higher support for domestic manufacturing (under Trump), he added.""That yield focus has really been beneficial"" to its performance, he added, pointing out that most of the stock holdings have long-term government contracts and, as a result, tend to generate consistent and stable cash flow streams. It has a 4.3% distribution yield vs. 2.94% for iShares Global Infrastructure (IGF), one of the largest infrastructure ETFs.Panelists at the morning's roundtable also discussed how to construct a Trump-focused ETF portfolio given the outlook for the U.S. dollar, bond yields and the volatility index.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1%.Volume was tracking lower across the board.

399,HD,"Here's an estimate that may be hard to fathom: Nearly one-third of health care spending in the U.S. is considered wasteful.That's about $1 trillion in payment mistakes, excessive treatment, pricing errors and administrative waste.It's also a market opportunity for Cotiviti (COTV), a leading provider of technology and services that health insurers and retailers use to ensure accurate payments in an increasingly complex environment. Most of its clients are insurance companies, with a primary focus on payment inaccuracies.""We are, by far, the leader in this space,"" Cotiviti Chief Executive Doug Williams said in an interview with IBD. ""Our job is to help our clients understand the accuracy of what has been paid and, if there is an inaccuracy, help get that corrected.""In 2015, Cotiviti says it helped clients retrieve $2.7 billion in excessive fees paid for health care services, working with more than 40 health care organizations.That includes eight of the 10 largest U.S. insurers. Atlanta-based Cotiviti declined to name those customers.Cotiviti, however, does disclose some of its retail customers, for which it is a leading provider of payment accuracy services. It has more than 35 retail clients, including eight of the 10 largest retailers in the U.S., including Amazon (AMZN), Home Depot (HD), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT).By helping retailers identify variances in payment for goods and services, Cotiviti saved them more than $500 million in 2015. The company uses sophisticated analytics and data mining tools to identify potential inaccuracies.Still, finding mistakes can be tricky.""There's a lot of variable data, a dynamic set of data elements that are constantly changing and very difficult to have all at once,"" said Williams.Some companies do part of the job themselves. Health insurers comb through their data for errors, and by the time Cotiviti gets a look at it the easy stuff is already picked over.""We take their work, which is already very accurate, and advance it to a level of precision that's not reasonable for them to invest in at that level,"" said Williams. ""We're able to do it because we spread it across so many clients.""The roots of Cotiviti extend to 1979 as a company named Connolly, a provider of payment accuracy solutions to the retail industry. It was acquired in 2012 by Advent International. That year, Connolly merged with iHealth Technologies and Cotiviti was formed.Advent owns a majority of the common stock, giving it effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by Cotiviti stockholders.The company held its initial public offering on May 26, raising $236 million, the majority of which was used to pay off debt. Shares priced at 19 and now trade near 33, making it one of the top performing IPOs in the past year.Cotiviti reported third-quarter revenue of $156 million, up 14% year-over-year and the fourth quarter in a row of double-digit gains. Earnings per share rose 24% to 36 cents, the seventh straight profitable quarter.For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Cotiviti reported sales of $457.3 million, up 17% year-over-year, and earnings per share of 27 cents, up 30%. Its primary competitor in the health care sector is HMS Holdings (HMSY). In the retail segment the main competitor is PRGX Global (PRGX).In 2015, Cotiviti derived 86% of its revenue from its health care segment, with the balance of the company's sales stemming from separate retail operations.""There's a tremendous need for this company,"" said Robert Willoughby, an analyst at Credit Suisse who follows Cotiviti. ""Ultimately, if you want to bet against this business model you have to assume fraud and abuse will not happen in the health care system.""Willoughby said Cotiviti is well positioned to benefit from evolving demographic trends that include an aging population and increasingly sicker subpopulation that will drive health care costs higherWilloughby has an outperform rating on Cotiviti and a price target of 39. On Monday, Cotiviti shares gave back much of the 2% gains they had made in Friday trades, but recovered much of that to end trading down 0.4% to 34.53.IBD'S TAKE: IPOs are a seedbed of innovation and can be huge stock winners but can also reverse quickly. IBD frequently writes about IPO Leaders, and Cotiviti is one of the best performing IPOs of 2016.The process of timely and accurate claims processing and reimbursement in the U.S. health care system is extremely complex, with billions of claims submitted annually. Various estimates say there was nearly $1 trillion in unnecessary or wasteful spending in 2015 throughout the industry. Of that total, about $170 billion came from inaccurate submissions by health care providers.Its revenue is derived primarily through contracts with clients, which call for performance fees based on a percentage of the inaccurate payments that Cotiviti prevents. A small portion of revenue, less than 5%, comes from a fee-for-service basis whereby billing is based upon a flat fee or a fee per hour.Cotiviti estimates that the money-saving opportunity addressable by its technology and services is approximately $35 billion. From that, it sees a total market of about $5 billion addressable by its solutions. Its ability to expand the revenue pool will determine the long-term success of Cotiviti.The company says it has ""multiple strategies"" for achieving continued growth. Among them are significant opportunities to grow within its existing group of customers by increasing the volume of claims it reviews and cross-selling its products. Cotiviti has a history of innovation in improving existing solutions, developing new ones and expanding the scope of services. Additionally, it plans to selectively pursue acquisitions and strategic partnerships in payment accuracy and adjacent markets.""We are in a continuous process of reinventing ourselves,"" said Williams. ""We work on it every day, making sure we deliver in the current world but also creating the capability and capacity for the next opportunity.""But in a health care market full of complexity and uncertainty, more of that is coming. President-elect Donald J. Trump, is working with the Republican-controlled Congress to ""replace and repeal"" the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare. There's plenty of uncertainty as to how that will shake out and what it could mean for the already complex payment system. But Williams said that's not a major concern at this time.""Certainly there is a lot of political rhetoric and it seems there is a path to have some regulatory and policy changes,"" Williams said. ""They have to come up with ways to control costs and waste and abuse, and things like that are meaningful contributors of that cost.""Willoughby shares that point of view, saying: ""There will always be a growth environment for health care claims.""RELATED LINKS:Doctors' ObamaCare Warning To GOP Lifts Hospital, Insurer StocksTrump, GOP Face Huge 'Now What?'

Such turnover increases are impressive considering that Friday was a witching day in which weekly and monthly options expired, tending to boost turnover.Winners thumped losers on the NYSE by more than a 2-to-1 margin on Tuesday, while on the Nasdaq the margin was still bullish at roughly 4-to-3. Confidence in the economy and corporate earnings continue to encourage flow of money into big caps.Home Depot (HD), which reported yet another quarter of double-digit EPS growth (up 23% in the January ended quarter), rose 2.02 to 145.02 and is now 5.5% past a 137.42 saucer-with-handle entry. Revenue rose 6% to $22.2 billion, repeating a 6% increase in the fiscal third quarter that ended in October.As noted in this earnings review by IBD news reporter Bill Peters, Home Depot was able to increase its profit by a faster rate than sales thanks to its continued shareholder-friendly action of heavily buying back shares. Management also hiked its cash payout to shareholders by 29% to 89 cents per quarter and approved a new $15 billion share buyback plan.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Priceline Group (PCLN) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) are also rising further past recent proper entry points.Advanced Micro, fierce rival to Intel (INTC) in the personal-computer core processors space, gapped up at Tuesday's open and roared 6.6% higher to 14, nearly clearing a two-week pause. The stock with a $13 billion market cap, putting it squarely in the midcap to big-cap range, has acted very well since propelling past a 7.63 low-priced base breakout.Notice on a daily chart how AMD found bullish buying support during a nearly three-week dalliance with its fast-rising 50-day moving average. AMD lost money in both 2015 and 2016, but Wall Street expects a turnaround in earnings (7 cents in 2017, then 27 cents in 2018).AMD's RS Rating is a maximum 99 on a scale of 1 to 99.Intuitive, the pioneer in robotic surgery, rose 1% to 732.17 in heavy trading and rolled mildly past a 727.35 cup-base buy point. One could also see, on a daily chart, the stock forming a narrow five-day handle that started on Jan. 26, yielding an early entry at 700.52.Given Intuitive's slower moves vs. its hypergrowth years in the mid-2000s, it's not at all surprising to see the RS Rating be a middling 66 and the RS line still off its recent highs. However, that ""middling"" 66 RS is a vast improvement from a lowly 27 just 8 weeks ago.A 66 RS means Intuitive is now outperforming two-thirds of all companies in IBD's stock database over the past 12 months. The RS Rating puts a greater weighting on the latest three months' worth of action.Also, the company continues to post steady top- and bottom-line growth. In the past five quarters, sales have risen 12%, 12%, 14%, 16% and 12% vs. year-ago levels. In Q4, revenue eclipsed the $750 million mark.Meanwhile, Intuitive's medical systems and equipment group ranks a not-too-shabby 54th out of 197 industry groups for six-month relative price performance.See the entire list of 197 industry groups here or by going to the IBD Data Tables section inside ""Stock Lists"" at Investors.com.Apple (AAPL), one of the top performing megacap stocks so far in 2017, added 0.7% to 136.67, rising further past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. It broke out initially in dull volume on Jan. 6-9. Apple has led the way among battered blue chip names in breaking out after ending deep declines and building constructive bottoming base patterns.Apple is also up more than 23% since it cleared an initial cup with handle with a 110.33 entry on Sept. 14.Holders would not be wrong at all in taking at least some profits, based on the 20%-to-25% sell rule, which helps savvy investors capture gains during a stock's upside.Of course, those with supreme conviction in Apple may decide to be patient and hold longer. Indeed, some leading names are capable of rising 30% to 40% before staging a significant price correction. These corrections are the genesis of new bases during a confirmed market uptrend.U.S. equities are not rising alone. Chinese stocks have risen sharply in the past few sessions. Through Tuesday's trade, the mainland China-focused Shanghai Composite gained nearly 1.6% over two straight sessions; at 3253, the composite stood up a hearty 4.6% year to date.And despite fears of escalating tension between North Korea and its neighbors over continued nuclear tests, Japan's Nikkei 225 index bounced off its 50-day moving average in the past two sessions as it staged a 0.7% overnight on Tuesday.RELATED:The Big Picture: The Current Price Pattern In The Major Indexes Right Now Why Home Depot Is Sharing The Spoils With ShareholdersHow To Invest: Is The Trump Delay Of The Fiduciary Rule A Boon For The Banks?How To Invest: Why Apple Formed A Bottoming Base Pattern In 2009

405,HD,"With U.S. markets closed Monday for Presidents Day, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and other indexes pointed to little change Tuesday from last week's all-time levels.Dow components Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart (WMT) are among the notable earnings before the opening bell. Unilever (UN) is likely to give up much of Friday's big gains after Kraft Heinz (KHC) dropped its $143 billion takeover bid.Futures for the Dow industrials fell a fraction vs. fair value early Tuesday, with the S&P 500 index roughly flat. Nasdaq 100 futures pointed to a 0.2% gain. The major averages closed at session highs on Friday, with the Dow and Nasdaq composite at all-time bests and the S&P 500 less than a point away from record levels set earlier in the week.IBD'S TAKE: Following the market's direction is critical for every investor. Check out IBD's latest Big Picture: ""Will Stocks Get A Second Wind Or A Pullback?""Unilever likely will give up much of Friday's 15.3% spike to a record high. Unilever fell 6.6% in London trading Monday after Kraft Heinz dropped its takeover offer Sunday. Kraft, which leapt 10.7% Friday, also seems ripe for a pullback. Unilever's only-partial retreat suggests investors still see deal-making possible. Will takeover speculation turn to consumer products firms that rallied Friday.Meanwhile, mining giant BHP Billiton reported six-month earnings rose 687% vs. a year earlier early Tuesday. Mining stocks have generally rallied in recent weeks on strong Chinese demand, hopes for stronger U.S. growth and various supply woes that have supported prices. BHP recently declared force majeure on shipments from Chile's Escondida mine, the world's largest copper mine, due to a worker strike there.Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Macy's (M) also report before the opening bell.Home Depot should deliver earnings climbed 14% to $1.33 a share, with sales rising 4% to $21.793 billion. Home Depot shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 23. The stock has hit all-time highs but is still in range from the 137.42 buy point.Wal-Mart and Macy's will report fourth-quarter results after a holiday season dominated by Amazon (AMZN) and e-commerce. Investors will be looking for guidance on future results, and how these retail giants plan to respond to Amazon's gains and brick-and-mortar pains.Wal-Mart EPS likely fell 13% to $1.29 with revenue up 1.2% to $131.27 billion. Wal-Mart recently dropped its Amazon Prime membership rival and began offering free two-day shipping with minimum online orders of $35. Wal-Mart shares have retaken their 50-day line within a six-month consolidation, but are still below their 200-day line.Macy's sales likely fell 3% to $8.62 billion with EPS down 6% to $1.96. Macy's shares remain in a deep downtrend that started in July 2015. The stock has risen lately on Macy's takeover buzz. Papa John's (PZZA) reports earnings after the closing bell. Papa John's should report a 6% EPS gain to 66 cents, which would be the smallest yearly gain in 10 quarters. Papa John's is in a two-month flat-base pattern with a buy point of 90.59. Shares closed Friday at 86.01, just above its 50-day moving average.Most Asian stock markets rallied modest in Tuesday trading intraday after Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed Monday at its best level since August 2015. In European trading Monday, Germany's Dax rose 0.6%, while the U.K.'s FTSE was flat and France's CAC index edged lower.RELATED:Kraft Heinz Drops $143 Billion Unilever Bid: What's Its Next Target?Why You Need To Put These 5 Software Stocks On Your Watch List NowTesla, Mobileye, Home Depot, Shale, Acacia Lead Investing Action PlanHow Mayhem, Drama Can Help The American Mall Cheat Death

406,HD,"Verizon Communications' (VZ) new advertising message — unlimited data along with the ""best wireless network"" — is jelling with customers amid an industry price war, an analyst said Monday.Craig Moffett, analyst at MoffettNathanson, noted in a report to clients that AT&T (T) and Verizon last month reintroduced unlimited data plans amid market share gains by T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Sprint (S), which aggressively pushed promotions in late 2016. While rivals offer standard-quality video in unlimited data promotions, Verizon's advertising plays up its ability to deliver high-definition quality video.Further, Verizon's retail stores are reporting higher consumer traffic, Moffett says.""Verizon has seemingly found a path forward in what many have concluded is an irreparably commoditized wireless industry,"" Moffett said. ""Verizon is convinced that there is still room for network differentiation, and that offering full HD unlimited video will showcase not network deficiency, but instead will underscore its network advantage.""Moffett has a buy rating on Verizon stock. He rates T-Mobile neutral on valuation. Moffett has sell ratings on AT&T and Sprint.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Inphi and Mobileye are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Amid a down day for stocks, Verizon shares edged down 6 cents to 50.03 at the close on the stock market today. Shares in AT&T slipped 5 cents to 41.96. Meanwhile, Sprint stock lost 1.4% to 8.78 as T-Mobile stock was off 1.1% to 62.84.Verizon stock has been trading below its 50-day and 200-day lines while Sprint stock has weakened after touching a 32-month high of 9.65 last month. T-Mobile has retreated from a record high of 63.68 on Feb. 17.Moffett says T-Mobile is ""committed to network-based competition"" while AT&T is more focused on content. AT&T is seeking Trump administration approval to acquire media giant Time Warner (TWX).Moffett says Verizon may be able to increase ARPU (average monthly revenue per subscriber) with its unlimited data strategy. ARPU has been falling industrywide.One view among analysts is that the proliferation of unlimited-data offers among wireless firms could make it harder for cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR) to break into the wireless business. The cable TV firms hold rights to lease access to Verizon's network on a wholesale basis, under a so-called ""MVNO"" deal.RELATED:Sprint Could Sell To T-Mobile, But Dish Network LoomsVerizon, Comcast Merger Talk A 'Nonstarter,' Says JPMorgan

407,HD,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved past 20,000 this past week, so it should not be a surprise that many of the 30 blue chip stocks are market leaders. Several are extended, but there are six Dow stocks were in buy range to start this week: Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT), Home Depot (HD), Intel (INTC) and United Technologies (UTX).With the market selling off Monday, several breakouts were tested, with three of these highlighted Dow stocks closing below buy points.Apple broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point at 118.12. Shares have inched their way higher, closing Friday at 121.95.Apple fell 0.3% to 121.63 on the stock market today, rebounding from intraday lows of 120.66.That's still within 5% of the entry point. If you buy above that point, a stock is vulnerable to a pullback.Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, the only one of these six Dow industrials to report this coming week.Analysts expect Apple to report a 2% revenue rise, ending three quarters of decline. But EPS should fall again, though only 2%. Investors are betting that Apple's upcoming 10th anniversary smartphone, unofficially known as the iPhone 8, will revive its fortunes later this year.IBD'S TAKE: The Dow and other major averages are at record highs while leading stocks are breaking out but the CBOE Volatility Index hit a fresh two-and-a-half-year low on Friday, nearly reaching its lowest point since early 2007. Find out why sometimes the only thing investors have to fear is no fear at all.Boeing broke out of a flat base on Jan. 24, clearing the 160.17 buy point. The next day, Boeing topped earnings forecasts, while its 787 Dreamliner is now cash flow positive, a good sign for future stock buybacks and dividend hikes. Investors looked past weak guidance and pushed shares higher. Boeing on Thursday went beyond 168.18, the top of its 5% chase zone, but pulled back Friday to 167.70.Boeing sank 1.3% to 165.52.Intel broke out of a cup-with-handle base on Jan. 24, exceeding the 37.44 buy point. The world's No. 1 chipmaker late Thursday reported better-than-expected Q4 earnings and gave a strong Q1 sales forecast. Intel closed at 37.98, rising intraday to 38.45, a 16-year high.Intel sank 1.5% to 37.42, just below buy range.Home Depot moved beyond a 137.42 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern in solid volume on Jan. 23. The home improvement chain's stock didn't make much progress, ending the week at 138.33. Home Depot will report earnings on Feb. 21.Home closed up 0.1% to 138.47, barely above the entry point.Caterpillar cleared a flat base on Jan. 25, closing slightly above the 97.50 buy point as President Trump authorized a border wall, boosting construction-related firms. The stock dipped back below the entry area on Thursday as the heavy construction equipment maker reported Q4 earnings and trimmed its 2017 guidance. But Caterpillar nudged higher on Friday, ending the week at 98.99.Caterpillar fell 2.2% to 96.79, just below the buy point.United Technologies formed a cup-with-handle pattern with a 109.52 buy point. United Tech cleared that entry zone several times from the end of November to mid-December, but didn't finally hold that level until Dec. 19. Shares have not moved much since then.On Wednesday, United Tech reported earnings, with Q4 sales and its 2017 revenue forecast a little light amid Pratt & Whitney jet engine production woes.Shares fell 1% last week, closing at 109.70, just above the buy point and the rising 50-day line.United Tech dipped 0.5% to 109.16, below the buy point and the 50-day line.RELATED:Common Investing Mistakes: Chasing A Good Stock Too Far Up In Price

408,HD,"Donald Trump is a different kind of president, touting an ""America First"" vision and conducting trade negotiations and tax policy debates seemingly on the fly via Twitter and TV. Yet investors have taken the hyperactive populist in stride, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring above 20,000 for the first time this week.The stock market rally has breadth: Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS), Caterpillar (CAT), Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), Home Depot (HD) have broken out in recent days and weeks. (Apple, Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs and Home Depot are all Dow industrials components, but the five reflect a wide array of sectors). And the uptrend has depth: Hundreds of stocks have been hitting 52-week or all-time highs.No wonder investors aren't worried. And that's the problem.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighting growth stocks breaking out of proper bases. The CBOE Volatility Index estimates expected volatility based on S&P 500 option prices. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), commonly known as VIX after its ticker, highlights intense fear or complacency in the market. Low VIX readings are a sign that investors are especially bullish.The VIX has fallen steadily since Election Day as the Dow industrials and other major averages have rallied. On Friday, the VIX fell to a fresh two-and-half-year low intraday, nearly tumbling to a decade low.Extreme bullishness can be a sign of a market top, at least a short-term peak. Likewise, extreme bearishness can foreshadow a market bottom.IBD's David Chung issued a note of caution in Wednesday's The Big Picture:""At some point, U.S. stocks will indeed cool off. Investor complacency, as measured by the CBOE Market Volatility Index, or the VIX, is dangerously thick. The VIX hit extreme lows at the end of 1993, the end of 2006 and the spring of 2011, and each time the indexes staged sharp corrections of 20% or more.""Think of it this way. Stocks rally as investors turn bullish and pull money from the sidelines and into the market. But when ""everyone"" is optimistic and fully invested, who's left to buy? If the market assumes everything will go well, then what news will propel equities higher?The stock market is pricing in a lot of good news that hasn't happened yet — corporate tax cuts, regulatory reform and higher infrastructure spending. Meanwhile, investors don't seem concerned about the risk of growth-killing protectionism barriers or a full-blown trade war. And don't forget that the Federal Reserve is planning on several rate hikes this year, and markets have wobbled whenever policymakers even hint at hikes.In any case, when contrarian psychological market indicators like the VIX go to extreme levels, you don't need to rush into cash. They are secondary market gauges. But be ready to act and pay extra attention to the number of higher-volume declines in the major averages (distribution days), as well as the price and volume action of leading stocks.RELATED:Be Ready To Act When Investor Psychology Reaches Extreme Levels

409,HD,"The stock market closed modestly lower Monday, a day that saw a few breakouts by big caps Home Depot  (HD), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Adobe (ADBE).Indexes finished well off their session lows, but not enough to quench all losses. The Nasdaq fell a fraction, the Dow Jones industrial average 0.1% and the S&P 500 0.3%. The Dow transportation average slid 0.9%.Volume was lower across the board, early numbers showed.Sparse few stocks were up in unusual volume, while many saw busy trading on the downside.The stock down with most volume was Qualcomm (QCOM), which plunged 13%, touching the lowest level since July. The sell-off followed news that Apple (AAPL) sued Qualcomm over a licensing dispute. On Monday, Nomura Instinet piled on by downgrading Qualcomm to neutral from buy.Aetna (AET) tumbled 3% after a federal judge blocked its planned acquisition of Humana (HUM). Shares of Humana rose 2%.Adobe climbed past the 111.19 buy point of a base-on-base pattern. But the stock closed below that entry, with a minor gain. Volume was below average and the relative strength line is lagging — two dampers on the otherwise bullish move.Home Depot closed 2% higher, as the home improvement chain broke out past a 137.42 buy point in volume 30% above average.Texas Instruments climbed above the 75.35 buy point of a flat base. It closed in buy range. Volume was about 15% above normal — not particularly a rush of institutional buying. The company reports earnings after the close Tuesday.Some major companies are reporting earnings Tuesday, including Alibaba (BABA), Hawaiian Holdings (HA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Steel Dynamics (STLD).

Volume was lighter across the board vs. the same time Friday.Solar, oil and airline stocks were pressured in today's stock market action. West Texas intermediate crude futures slid 0.6% to below $53 a barrel. But gold miners, automakers and internet stocks advanced as gold prices rose nearly 1% to $1,215.50 an ounce.Among Dow losers, McDonald's pared early losses but was still down nearly 1% after reporting Q4 results that beat forecasts and U.S. same-store sales that fell slightly less than expected. General Electric shed 3%. Home Depot (HD) was the only blue chip holding a more than 1% gain. Significantly, its shares rose above the 137.42 buy point of a flat base.On the IBD 50, United Continental (UAL) led the downside with a 3% drop in tepid trade as the stock shapes a flat base with a potential 76.90 buy point.

413,HD,"Jim Cline was semiretired at 56, after an intense career as a manufacturing division head, finally able to enjoy fishing, boating, ham radio and remodeling his home.Then at the end of 2007, his former boss, Ron Kaplan, called him for help to turn around Trex (TREX), the world leader in alternatives to wood for building backyard decks. It had been run into the ground by a dysfunctional bureaucracy and was on the verge of bankruptcy.""I was attracted by the enormous challenge, a high-risk, high-reward opportunity,"" Cline told IBD. Before agreeing to take the job as CFO and right hand to Kaplan, its brand-new CEO, he visited the Winchester, Va., plant. ""I was impressed with some of the directors and middle managers, who knew the solutions, but were having a hard time getting them implemented.""Cline succeeded Kaplan, now chairman, as CEO in August 2015. Today, Trex is the global leader in the industry, and Zack Ajzenman of Griffin Securities estimates its 2016 revenues at $477.3 million, up from $440.8 million in 2015, and net income at $71.9 million vs. the prior year's $48.1 million. Since Cline and Kaplan took over, the stock has risen from 4 (adjusted for stock buybacks) to around 68.Cline, 65, grew up in Van Wert, Ohio, a farm community where his dad was a high school teacher and coach, and his mother ran a nursery in their basement. He knew he'd have to pay his own way to college and worked hard in his free time to save up. In two summers at Continental Can, a mentor showed him how to deal with factory-floor politics, which included winning friends by doing the hardest jobs and listening to the true leaders, who weren't necessarily the titled managers or shop stewards.While at Bowling Green State University, Cline cleaned the restrooms in his dorm to make ends meet, before graduating in 1973 with a degree in business accounting. His first job was as a cost accountant for a division of Eaton (ETN) in Roxboro, N.C. ""I learned a lot by being willing to do everything from payroll to inventory,"" he said.In 1976, Cline joined True Temper Hardware, which made lawn care and construction products and is now part of Griffon (GFF), and eventually he was made the director of finance. ""I went through seven ownership changes in my 18 years there and learned that new management always wants things done differently,"" said Cline, ""and to thrive you need to be very flexible and learn to adapt to new situations.""In 1994, he was recruited by Harsco (HSC) to be the vice president and controller of its GasServ division in Harrisburg, Pa., which made gas containment and control devices, including high-pressure aluminum cylinders infused with resins and Kevlar fiber to hold CNG and other gases. Kaplan was the president, and Cline says he was ""very tough and forced you to really be on your toes.""When Kaplan left in 2005, Cline took over and prepared the division for sale, which took place in 2007. Cline agreed to stay on for up to six months to help the new owners make the transition, but quickly realized that ""when you've run a division and someone else comes in and wants to do things in a dramatically new way, it's hard to stay.""Two months after the takeover, Cline received the SOS from Kaplan about Trex. They conferred by phone on some big decisions in January 2008 to help stave off bankruptcy.Cline began attending board meetings the following month, and joined as CFO in March. Over a dozen executives were let go.""Trex had excessive inventories and receivables that were not being properly managed,"" said Cline. ""Their materials requirement planning system hadn't been implemented to forecast needs. Quality control was poor and we had to grind up and recycle much of what had already been manufactured.""The most important initial change was changing the bonus system. It had been based on paying associates once a year, based on EPS, and many of them had no idea what that really was and what they could do about it. ""They hadn't been paid bonuses in several years, so we gave them $500 as a down payment towards our new monthly bonus plan, if the cost of production was lowered, while improving quality,"" said Cline. ""We invited everyone to give us their best ideas, and they have almost always earned bonuses since then.""Things had to move so fast initially to keep Trex from going out of business that Cline and Kaplan had little time to confer about the decisions each was making.In 2009, they asked research and development to come up with a better product that could last much longer and the result was Transcend, which was introduced the following year, revolutionizing the industry. Made from recycled plastic bags from retailers, and sawdust and chips from cabinet and furniture makers, its ""wood-alternative"" decks are guaranteed to be immune to termites, staining, fading, rotting, splintering and scratching for 25 years (the exact formula for creating it is a trade secret known only to a handful).  Less expensive versions are designed for different retail channels, including Lowe's (LOW), Home Depot (HD) and pro lumberyards, but carry the same warranty.Trex has won awards for having 95% of its products made from recycled materials, saving 200,000 tons of waste from going into landfills, while requiring no trees need to be cut down. Yet its appeal isn't so much the green factor, but the amount of money that a wood alternative can save compared with the expense of maintaining traditional wooden decks.Trex achieved financial stability in 2011, inventory turns have nearly doubled since then, and the company has paid off its long-term debt. In August 2015, Kaplan handed the reins to Cline and remains as chairman.Ajzenman is projecting 2017 net sales of $519 million, with net income of $82.9 million. While there doesn't appear to be much growth in new U.S. retail outlets beyond the current nearly 9,000, there is plenty of room for more profitability in market share from the ""composite wood alternative decking"" industry, with Trex having an estimated 44% vs. 30% five years ago. Its primary competitors are Advanced Environmental Recycling Technologies (AERT) and privately held Fiberon and AZEK/Timber Tech.That niche is just 16% of the total decking industry, and Cline anticipates taking increasing share from the companies making wood decks (a 1% gain would translate into $50 million in sales for Trex). Ajzenman also sees repair and remodeling spending, the source of 95% of Trex's business, growing 7.5% through the third quarter of this year, while Cline is aiming to add to its current tiny share of new homes that include its decks. He is also planning to expand overseas, especially in Europe, Latin America and Australia.Last year, the company bolstered the number of its sales reps to train retailers in the benefits of its product lines and has opened Trex University at headquarters, which both contractors and DIY consumers can attend.Trex has also diversified by acquiring and licensing other products, from substructures and outdoor furniture to stairways and lighting.""Jim motivates his colleagues with a combination of thoughtful analysis, concise communication and razor-sharp execution,"" Kaplan said. ""His quiet rectitude and humility instill respect in those in his charge. His staff would follow him anywhere.""Helped turn around Trex, which makes decking out of alternatives to wood.Overcame: The threat of corporate bankruptcy.Lesson: Listen to workers at every level.""Spending time in the field is important.

420,HD,"LAS VEGAS — In the near future, we're all going to be talking to TVs and household appliances. But it won't be a mental health crisis.It's the future of consumer technology, according to experts at the CES 2017 trade show in Las Vegas, where voice-based user interfaces are all the rage.""The next computing interface is voice,"" Shawn DuBravac, chief economist for CES sponsor the Consumer Technology Association, said at a preshow event Tuesday. ""Vocal computing is replacing the traditional GUI (graphical user interface) for robots and other emerging computing applications.""Leading the charge for vocal computing are hub devices such as Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Echo and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home. These smart speakers let users do web searches with spoken commands and questions and to control connected household electronics like lighting, heating and air conditioning, and home security systems.Amazon stock rose 0.47% Wednesday, but Alphabet slipped a small fraction in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Announcements made at CES can affect stocks. How can you find out which stocks are most active, on the upside or downside? IBD's Stocks on the Move is the place to go.Other companies competing in this fast-growing field include Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana and Apple's (AAPL) Siri.In just a year since Amazon opened its Alexa technology to developers — the voice and AI for its Echo — over 1,500 applications or skills have been created with it.""I would not be surprised to see another 700 launch over the next four days,"" DuBravac said, alluding to the many pre-announcements about Alexa integration by vendors exhibiting at CES.To date, 5 million voice assistant devices like Amazon Echo have been sold in the U.S., DuBravac said. Another 5 million likely will sell in 2017, doubling the market penetration for the devices, he said.Another big theme of this year's CES is artificial intelligence or AI. Devices are getting smarter and can think through complex tasks and anticipate your needs.AI is being used as a buzzword to connote: ""This is a sophisticated product. This is a sophisticated service,"" DuBravac said.Also at CES, telecom and device companies will talking about the coming age of superfast 5G wireless, he said.U.S. consumer technology spending is expected to reach $292 billion in 2017, up 1.5% over the last year, the CTA forecast Tuesday. Helping to fuel the increase are wearables, 4K ultra-HD televisions and smart home devices, the trade group said.The four-day CES trade show, formerly called the Consumer Electronics Show, officially opens Thursday and runs four days.RELATED:Google Home Takes On Amazon Echo; Can Apple Siri Be Home Hub?Amazon Says Top-Selling Holiday Item Was ...

421,HD,"Television sets equipped with Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV along with a voice remote powered with Amazon Alexa will arrive later this year.The new 4K TVs will be made by Westinghouse, Element and Seiki — all owned by China-based Tong Fang Global. The TVs will come with 4K Ultra HD picture quality, with screen sizes ranging from 43 inches to 65 inches, according to a release announcing the plan. The announcement was made at the CES show underway in Las Vegas.Separately, Whirlpool (WHR) said that it has partnered with Amazon on a line of voice-controlled appliances, launching in early 2017. The appliances will feature voice-control capabilities through Amazon Alexa,  which is the technology also used in the Amazon Echo digital assistant.Whirlpool said Alexa can be used to pause and start washers and dryers and also interact with smart ovens and refrigerators, among other things.Amazon stock rose 0.46% to 753.29 in the stock market today.It is the first licensing agreement by Amazon calling for a television manufacturer to add Fire TV into the set. Amazon is the latest vendor of streaming TV adapters and set-top boxes to have its TV operating platform integrated into smart TVs. It joins Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Chromecast and privately held Roku, among others.In addition to watching standard TV, viewers can also switch over to streaming content provided by Amazon without needing a Fire TV stick plugged into the set or a third-party set-top box.With the voice remotes, users can search channels and apps, manage TV settings and control smart-home devices on verbal command. Pricing would be announced closer to retail availability. RELATED:Amazon Fights Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple For Smart Device CloutAlexa, Why Did Morningstar Rate You As A Durable Business Pillar?

422,HD,"Fresh from a holiday season that saw 4K ultra-HD TVs and Amazon (AMZN) Echo smart speakers among the hot-selling items, the consumer electronics industry is about to make its annual splash to show off its candidates for the Next Big Thing.At CES 2017, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and voice-controlled technology are expected to be among the hot topics of conversation.The annual consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas officially runs Jan. 5 — 8, but preshow events start Tuesday.Produced by the Consumer Technology Association, CES will be celebrating its 50th anniversary with the 2017 show.The CTA expects the massive industry confab to draw more than 165,000 attendees and over 3,800 exhibitors covering more than 2.5 million net square feet of floor space. But the association is known for providing conservative guidance. CES 2016 reached a new attendance record, attracting 177,393 industry professionals from 158 countries. Organizers have been working to limit overall attendance to keep the show more manageable.CES 2016 played host to 3,886 exhibiting companies, and they took up nearly 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.CES 2017 will feature a diverse set of keynote speakers including the chief executives of cruise line operator Carnival (CCL), sports apparel maker Under Armour (UA) and graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).IBD'S TAKE: Has Nvidia peaked? The graphics and automotive chipmaker had its biggest decline of the year on Wednesday and continued falling Thursday. Even with that, though, shares have tripled this year and it remains No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks, a feature that should be on your regular checklist.At CES 2016, fitness wearables, drones, virtual reality, self-driving cars and hoverboards were headliners.The latest advancements of those technologies will be on display at CES 2017, but the tech press always gravitates to the next shiny new thing. After all, what's new is the nature of the news business.Six years ago, CES exhibitors en masse started labeling all their products as smart because they included a processor and connected to the internet. This year, companies are marketing their products as having artificial intelligence, or AI.Among the products at the show being promoted as having AI include cameras, drones, robots, autonomous cars, and even toothbrushes and patio umbrellas.""Artificial intelligence has the potential to be the story of the show,"" John Curran, managing director of Accenture's (ACN) Communications, Media and Technology business told IBD. ""It could be the golden thread that weaves together so much of what's happening at the show.""AI looks to be a core piece of many product categories, combining Big Data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, he said. AI allows for easy access to information and device controls as well as predictive capabilities for personalized experiences, Curran said.Another big theme of CES 2017 is expected to be products with voice controls and virtual personal assistants.Amazon is poised to dominate the show with its Alexa voice-response technology, which powers its Echo smart speakers. Amazon is working to make Alexa a standard interface across a range of consumer electronics devices.Companies at CES will be demonstrating Alexa voice controls in such products as air purifiers, smartwatches, speakers and sprinkler systems.Amazon is even hosting a series of educational sessions at CES on building next-generation voice interfaces with Alexa.Rival voice-based digital butlers, such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home and Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana also will be making their presence felt at the show.""One of the stories to watch at CES will be the platform aspects of these intelligent assistants,"" Curran said.Expect to hear about a lot of product partnerships using intelligent assistants from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and possibly Apple's (AAPL) Siri as those platforms seek to become standards in the home.""This has the potential to be a game changer and unlock a wave of innovation,"" Curran said.Intelligent assistants could spur sales of smart home devices and appliances such as connected thermostats, lighting and home security, he said.Augmented reality systems will be on display at CES 2017 for smartphones, smart glasses, toys, automotive head-up displays and other gadgets. Augmented reality overlays digitally created content into the user's real-world environment.""There's going to be a lot of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality"" at CES 2017, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News told IBD. ""There are going to be 360-degree cameras so people can create their own content (for VR headsets).""Major chip companies, which provide enabling technologies for consumer electronics, will be touting their latest advances at the show. Intel (INTC), Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among those planning a big presence at the CES 2017.Major car companies including Ford (F), Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) also are exhibiting at the show, as are auto tech suppliers such as Mobileye (MBLY), Continental and Valeo (VLEEY).As usual, there are some big no-shows among exhibitors at CES, including Apple and Microsoft, which prefer to do their own product events.Big-screen TVs will remain a staple of the show, with major vendors expected to show off super-crisp OLED TVs and lower-priced 4K TVs with high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging.RELATED:Amazon Gets Big Boost For Echo As Microsoft Readies A Rival DeviceThe Top Selling Products On Amazon Over Holidays Came From ...

423,HD,"Look up ""sad mall"" or ""dead mall"" online and you're likely to be confronted with images of desolate, shuttered shopping centers that have been left for dead. Overgrown plants crack through abandoned storefronts; crumbled tile litters broken-down escalators. It's a common-enough phenomenon that entire photography projects revolve around the state of the country's retail centers.Is this what 2017 holds for American shoppers?Not quite, but the upcoming year isn't exactly going to be a cakewalk, either. The hundreds of collective store closures (from Macy's (M), Wal-Mart (WMT) and others, combined) and bankruptcies (Sports Authority, Sports Chalet) in 2016 are enough to make even the most devoted shopaholic wonder if the future of commerce is one big Amazon.com (AMZN) screen.""It's going to be a year of transition and a year of reckoning and a year of awakening for retailers,"" said Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst.Retail sales excluding autos and gasoline rose 4% from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24, according to MasterCard's SpendingPulse. That suggests a stronger-than-expected holiday season, perhaps reflecting more optimistic consumers. But while digital sales continued to boom, with Amazon grabbing an ever-larger e-commerce share, brick-and-mortar locations faced declining traffic. And those trends are likely to intensify into the new year.The big discounts offered at apparel stores this holiday season echoed prior sales-heavy years, particularly 2015's. While retailers generally went into this important shopping period claiming that inventories were lean, stores feel they have no choice in an already cutthroat environment.""Consumers have been trained that if they hold out, they will get a promotion,"" said Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. ""The other problem is that it's a really overcrowded space with no barriers to entry. A lot of retailers are choosing to compete on price.""IBD'S TAKE: What's holding Amazon back from becoming a major player in beauty? For an in-depth look, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said that outside of a few busy hours on the weekends, Holiday 2016 was ""somewhat eerily quiet"" at the mall.During store checks, his research firm observed but a ""handful of people"" at Foot Locker (FL), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) brand Hollister, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) and Macy's. L Brands' (LB) Bath & Body Works ""always seems to have a buzz,"" he said, but even Apple (AAPL) stores seemed less bustling than in years' past.""Each year it feels like that lull is a bit deeper and deeper,"" said Perkins.Some of the lag can be attributed to holiday promotions being pushed up earlier in November, said NPD's Cohen, spreading out the spending. But the perhaps greater problem is the lack of product innovation and uniqueness on shelves, he said.In other words, there's not enough new, fun stuff to buy — for other people or for self-gifting purposes.NPD, which tracks the November-December shopping period week by week, said in its latest report that as of the week ending Dec. 10, dollar sales in the first six weeks of the holiday retail season were lagging the prior-year period by 4%.Brick-and-mortar traffic fell about 10% at stores through Dec. 17, according to Prodco Retail Traffic Index.One saving grace for brick-and-mortar locations: Christmas Eve — also the start of Hanukkah this year — was on a Saturday, while Dec. 26 was also a day off.The issues that faced retailers in 2016 are likely to continue to face them in 2017, without much abatement. Perkins highlighted the ongoing shift to online and mobile spending, a consumer taste for experiences instead of products, high promotional activity and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class that leaves less disposable income on the table.And, of course, Amazon's insistent gains. On top of Prime shipping and Prime Video, the company's smart-home device, Alexa, can help Prime members place orders.""(Alexa) cuts retailer out of the equation for consumers that are pressed for time,"" he said.Upper-tier malls — the kind that house Tiffanys (TIF) and Louis Vuittons and Shake Shacks (SHAK) — are expected to continue to perform well enough. But the average mall might still see some individual stores close up shop, say experts, unless they go out of their way to attract more foot traffic.""Mid-tier malls are going to need to step up their game"" with restaurants, movie theaters and lifestyle stores, said NPD's Cohen, adding that ""the food court won't be good enough.""Simon Property Group (SPG), a major mall operator, has tumbled 24% over the last five months, sinking Wednesday to the lowest level in nearly 16 months.That young people are doing more mobile shopping and are craving experiences is no surprise. But how retailers respond may foreshadow the brick-and-mortar industry's fate.Wal-Mart (WMT) investments (which include its e-commerce efforts) may weigh on short-term income growth but lead to foreseeable rewards in the future, said Perkins, whose store checks found that Wal-Mart has been ""one of the busier stores"" this season.In 2017, the top-performers list should feature some familiar names, by Perkins' estimate. Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are ""two of the strongest performers in retail."" He also sees off-price trio TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) continuing to do well, as well as Ulta Beauty (ULTA), which is ""obviously a standout player.""Home improvement, off-price and beauty all involve some element of in-store necessity: looking for just the right part, digging through bargain racks and trying on new makeup brands are usually best done in person.Department stores have had a choppy year, though Nordstrom (JWN) frequently gets a shout-out from analysts for being an ""omnichannel"" retailer that knows how to engage its customers across platforms. And unlike Macy's or Kohl's (KSS), which compete ""with Amazon and everyone else on the internet,"" says Morningstar's Weishaar, Nordstrom has differentiated itself by catering to more affluent shoppers with a highly curated selection.""If you go to Amazon and type in 'red dress,' you're going to get literally hundreds of pages of results to sift through that (are) not useful,"" she said. ""If you go to Nordstrom, you're going to get 10 (products in line with) your price points and brands.""Even so, Nordstrom was recently handed a downgrade from JPMorgan after the department store's management team said brick-and-mortar levels hadn't been that bad since 1972.In the future, being omnichannel might not be enough, particularly in a world increasingly populated by Alexa and Google Home devices.Retail ""omnipresence"" is key, said NPD's Cohen.That is, instead of simply giving customers a way to buy products both in-store and online, it would behoove retailers to latch onto shoppers before, during and after the transaction, he said. Educate them and anticipate their needs ahead of potential transactions, allow them different ways to buy, then stay in touch via product reviews or other methods following the purchase.The goal, said Cohen, is ""that the store becomes the epicenter for the entire process.""RELATED:Amazon's Top Selling Holiday Products Came From ...

425,HD,"While there's attention on how Apple (AAPL) and the so-called FANG internet giants are performing, several megacap stocks have broken out and retaken buy points in the past week. General Electric (GE), IBM (IBM), Home Depot (HD) and Comcast (CMCSA). All four have market caps above $150 billion.Keep in mind that these four giants, with fundamentals that range from decent to lackluster, are late to the party. Many other stocks have had earlier run-ups and breakouts.General Electric rose 8 cents to 31.86 on the stock market today. GE closed Friday up 0.8% at 31.78, slightly above a 31.59 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. GE just topped that entry on Wednesday, then pulled back on Thursday. Volume was not impressive on the breakout, raising at least a yellow flag.GE peaked at an eight-year high of 33 on July 19, then pulled back to the 50-day line, where the stock clung tightly, barely moving for the next several weeks. Shares then broke down until early November. Shares have rebounded nicely since then, regaining their 50-day line on Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election, and then their 200-day line on Nov. 10.GE has struggled to deliver growth in core industrial orders and revenue, but investors are betting that the company will benefit from tax cuts, infrastructure spending and pro-energy moves under the Trump administration.GE's relative strength rank is a mediocre 46 out of 99. But its RS line, which gauges a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, has improved since late October. (The RS line is the thin blue line on the chart below).IBD'S TAKE: Here are five shale stocks that were near buy points before non-OPEC members agreed Saturday to join and OPEC production cut.Big Blue fell 0.6% to 165.50 Monday. IBM retook a 161.96 buy point on Wednesday in above-average volume, continuing to rise through Friday to close at 166.52, the highest since late July. IBM initially moved into buy range on Nov. 21, but fell back down on Dec. 1.IBM revenue has fallen vs. a year earlier for 18 straight quarters, though the declines have shrunk to just 0.3% in Q3.Home Depot rose 0.9% to 134.58. Shares climbed 0.65% to 133.39 on Friday, adding a little distance from a buy point of 132.23 first topped on Wednesday in above-normal trade. Home Depot hit a record 139 on Aug. 2, then retreated somewhat over the next three months before bottoming on Nov. 1.Comcast fell 0.7% to 68.97, just above a 68.46 buy point. Comcast first topped that entry on Nov. 17, after racing from the bottom in the prior two weeks. Much of the run-up was in very heavy volume, though the actual breakout had essentially flat trading activity. As recently as Wednesday, shares sometimes fell back below the buy point, at least intraday.Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal in addition to its cable and internet infrastructure, could benefit from tax cuts and a possible reversal of net neutrality rules under the Trump administration.As for Apple and the FANG stocks, Apple and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) fell less than 1% but closed above their 50-day lines after both retook that key support level on Friday for the first time in weeks, joining Netflix (NFLX). Netflix ended virtually unchanged.Amazon (AMZN) fell 1.1%, consolidating between its 50-day and 200-day lines. Facebook (FB) remains stuck below its 200-day after coming up just short on Friday. Facebook pulled back 1.6%.RELATED:FANG+: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook Regain Key Support Areas

The Dow Jones industrial average also hit an all-time high, adding 1.4%. The small-cap Russell 2000 made a record high of its own, adding 0.6%.Dow component Home Depot (HD) rose 2.5% and is drawing near the 132.23 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. IBM (IBM), another of the Dow 30 stocks, rose 2% and is back above the 161.96 entry of a cup with handle.IBM, the tech services and Big Data computing giant, could also be viewed as forming an additional handle over the prior six sessions, furnishing a slightly higher yet relevant entry of 164.76.The Nasdaq climbed 0.9%, as a rout in pharmaceuticals and some health care stocks failed to spread to other sectors. The composite still has some recovery to do before topping prior highs.Volume was tracking higher across the board. That was a good sign on a day when indexes hit new highs, as was the day's breadth: Winning stocks led losers by more than 3-to-1 on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Technology and financial stocks were the best performing in the IBD 50. But the index was indicated 0.3% higher, a lagging performance that was curious, to say the least, in the context of today's strong market.An eclectic mix of metal, consumer, technology and transportation stocks led the broad market today. Airlines were active on the upside.Southwest Airlines (LUV) rose 3.5%, making its best move above a 48.10 buy point so far. But volume was running well below Southwest's usual levels, which made the breakout suspect. The airline reported November traffic that outpaced capacity growth. Southwest also kept its Q4 unit revenue outlook, which had disappointed investors. Delta Air Lines (DAL) jumped 2.7% to 50.85 and surged past a 49.51 buy point of a large cup-with-handle pattern. Shares are still in proper buying range. Yet volume also was tracking roughly 19% below normal levels with an hour left in Wednesday's session.Hawaiian Airlines parent Hawaiian Holdings (HA) rose more than 2.3% and is barely out of proper buy range from a 51.63 buy point it cleared a couple of weeks ago.In the IBD 50, Middleby (MIDD) made a new high and is adding a bit of cushion above the 139.34 buy point of a cup-with-handle pattern. Middleby makes commercial cooking and baking equipment, making it a key supplier to the restaurant industry.Synchronoss Technologies (SNCR) deepened losses. The stock slid as much as 5% in heavy trading, falling deeper below the 50-day moving average. Shares of the software company sold off Tuesday also after the company announced it is acquiring business software provider Intralinks Holdings (IL) for $821 million.RELATED:Southwest Airlines Hits Buy Point On Traffic Data; Delta Breaks OutSynchronoss To Buy Cloud Software Provider Intralinks

429,HD,"The major market indexes turned south Tuesday morning as earnings reports continued to dominate stock action and with Apple's (AAPL) results due out after the close.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 sank 0.3%. Volume was mixed, tracking higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Monday.Apparel makers, restaurants and building-related stocks were among the biggest losers in the stock market today, while steel, gold and metals miners outperformed.Procter & Gamble (PG) led the Dow with a near-5% jump in heavy volume, regaining its 50-day moving average, after the consumer products giant reported better-than-expected quarterly results.Also among blue chips, United Technologies (UTX) rose 1.3%, Caterpillar (CAT) edged higher; 3M (MMM) fell 3%, while Home Depot (HD) and Nike (NKE) were each down 2%.Apple was quiet, falling fractionally ahead of its earnings report. Shares have trended higher the past four months and are 4% off their 52-week high. Analysts expect the iPad maker to earn $1.65 a share, down 16% from the prior year, on a 9% sales decline to $46.9 billion. That would mark a third straight quarter of year-over-year declines on both the top and bottom lines.Under Armour (UA) gapped down and tumbled 14% to a nine-month low after reporting Q3 results that beat estimates, but offering guidance below analyst forecasts.Sonic (SONC) crashed 17.5% to a two-year low in massive trade after the burger chain reported fiscal Q4 earnings that topped views, but revenue that missed estimates.In economic news, the S&P Case-Shiller home price index rose 5.1% year over year in August and 0.2% on a monthly basis, meeting views. The Federal Housing Agency's housing price index climbed 0.7% in August, topping forecasts for a 0.5% increase.RELATED:GM, United Tech, Caterpillar, 3M Earnings Beat Views; Outlooks MixedApple Analysts Place Final Bets Before Earnings Window Closes Under Armour Stock Crashes On Weak Guidance, Margins

430,HD,"The stock market saw mild morning losses expand a bit by lunchtime on Friday, but the decline masked a nice rebound by leaders in the brick-and-mortar space. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to struggle in the wake of bearish commentary by Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 slipped around 0.6%, while the NYSE composite fell 0.7%, hurt by sharp losses in aerospace, steel, paint, meat-product and toy stocks. Small caps slid harder; the Russell 2000 was off more than 1%. Volume was mildly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time Thursday.Airplane-components giant TransDigm (TDG) dropped nearly 2% to 280.73 and slid further below its 50-day moving average in volume running quadruple average trade. Failure to hold above the 50-day line would result in a sell signal; the stock initially broke out of a long saucer with handle at 233.87 on May 10.TransDigm is falling in sympathy with Honeywell (HON), a former Dow 30 component that is on pace for a weekly drop of more than 9% after issuing weak sales and profit guidance for the full year. The stock, at 105.95 is trading below the 40-week moving average for the first time since early March.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%, seeing drops of 1 point or more in at least six of its 30 component stocks including Home Depot (HD). The home improvement chain giant has struggled to rebound back above its 200-day moving average since crashing below it on Sept. 9.Tesla, the big stock market winner in 2013 to 2014, fell more than 1% to 197.33 in heavy volume. While the leader in all-electric vehicles failed to surpass upside resistance at the 200-day moving average, it also isn't giving up much ground considering that the stock is still above recent lows of 187.87 in late June and 193.45 on Sept. 13. Watch to see if the stock can find support near the 200 price level.Tesla's RS Rating of 12, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, continues to be terrible since it reflects the stock's poor action over the past 12 months vs. all other companies in IBD's database. Meanwhile, Tesla's 50-day moving average has crossed back below the slower-moving 200-day moving average, a bearish sign.Tesla is still forecast to report its first profit in eight quarters when it releases third-quarter results, likely in early November. The Street on consensus expects earnings of 7 cents a share, but the range of estimates of 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters varies widely, from a net loss of 46 cents to a net profit of 60 cents.On the upside, Nordstrom (JWN) defied the skeptics of mall-based retail selling, rallying more than 1% to 54.58 for a fourth straight gain.The stock is still more than 30% below an all-time high of 77.65, yet it's certainly on the verge of snuffing out a shorter-term downtrend. Notice how the stock has traded relatively tightly for six weeks, forming a long handle on a long, deep cup base. While the stock is still nearly 22% below a 52-week high near 70, aggressive traders could consider an entry point at 53.81, 10 cents above the long handle that recently formed.Nordstrom is likely gaining ground on upbeat earnings guidance for the third quarter from clothing rival Gap (GPS). Gap stores tend to be in the same mall locations that are anchored by large department store operators such as Nordstrom and Macy's (M).Gap gapped up in price, rising more than 14% to 26.17 in whale-like volume to jump back on the north side of its 50- and 200-day lines. It too is trying to fashion a bottoming-style base pattern since hitting a multiyear peak of 46.85 back in September 2014.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base?

431,HD,"In a darkened master bedroom, David Kaiserman stood in shirtsleeves next to a turned-down king bed. ""Good morning, Siri,"" he said to the iPad in his hand, and the lights went on while the blackout shades retracted.""Your home is ready to rise and shine,"" the virtual assistant replied.Inside this four-bedroom stucco house in Alameda, Calif., Kaiserman, president of the technology division at construction company Lennar (LEN), was pitching a vision of a home controlled via iPhone or iPad.Tap your phone, and AC/DC's ""Back in Black"" blasts. Tap again, and the bath runs at a blissful 101 degrees. Sweet, right? Of course, your dad might view it as a bit over the top. All told, $30,000 worth of gadgets and gizmos were on display here, many run with Apple's free HomeKit app.As iPhone sales growth  slows, Apple (AAPL) is teaming up with a handful of builders and using these kinds of test beds to inch its way into the market for Internet-connected home furnishings, a nascent field that has attracted rivals like Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Amazon.com (AMZN).The gamble is that pricey wireless home devices will be an easier sell when bundled into the home itself. Builders market granite countertops and brushed-nickel fixtures at thousands of model homes across the U.S. Why not video doorbells?Unlike Google and Amazon, however, Apple isn't hawking hardware meant to connect the home. Instead, the HomeKit app could increase the value of its iOS ecosystem — and make it tougher for users to switch to Android phones and tablets.""We want to bring home automation to the mainstream,"" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of product marketing. ""The best place to start is at the beginning, when a house is just being created.""The convenience on display in the Alameda stucco doesn't come cheap. A single motorized, battery-operated Lutron shade starts at $349. Or consider the Schlage ""touch-screen deadbolt,"" which can be controlled remotely, so you can text an unexpected visitor a code. It can retail for $200. A regular deadbolt fetches $32 at Home Depot (HD) -- and there's always hiding a key under the flower pot.In Fremont, Calif., about 15 minutes from Facebook's (FB) headquarters, Los Angeles-based KB Home (KBH) is also getting its own Apple house ready. Along with the automated thermostat, lights, security system, locks, fans and shades, it lets you, on voice command, change the color of the light underneath a vanity.With the words ""good night,"" the light turns purple. With a ""good morning,"" it switches to white.KB offers wireless devices as upgrades. A basic package runs about $2,000, ""which once rolled into a mortgage is pennies a month,"" according to spokesman Craig LeMessurier. Lennar builds the cost into the price of homes. The Alameda house sells for $1.2 million, though it was a beta model and an actual dwelling wouldn't include $30,000 worth of gadgets.Apple is also working with Brookfield Residential Properties (BRP) and other builders. The companies declined to say when the homes would go on sale.Consumers will buy about $24 billion worth of connected home devices in 2016, according to Strategy Analytics. Though that's a drop in the bucket compared with smartphones, the research and consulting firm expects those sales to nearly double by 2020.For most people, connected homes remain a ways off, said Jonathan Gaw, an analyst with research firm IDC. The proliferating devices remain difficult to install in older homes and, in some cases, seem useless. Gaw cites the wireless candle he saw the other day.""Give me a break,"" he said. ""That only hurts the message. It tells people that we have gone too far. There's too much crap out there, it's only diluting stuff that's really cool.""Even some who sell such gadgets say the hype may be getting ahead of the reality. The discount retailer Target (TGT) opened its own Target Open House showroom a year ago in San Francisco. Shoppers walk through a futuristic home, watching prerecorded displays projected onto its transparent acrylic walls and furniture.In the nursery, a baby wears a Wi-Fi onesie — made by a company called Mimo, founded by whizzes from MIT. It tracks the infant's breathing, skin temperature, sleep and body position. When she stirs, it triggers the home's lights, turns on soothing music on the Sonos wireless speakers and even tells the coffee maker downstairs to start brewing java for red-eyed parents.You can pick one up for $199. Many parents brew the coffee themselves and let their babies wail — or buy a traditional baby monitor for as little as $19.99. Connected home devices can cost five times the price of the old-fashioned version, according to Target spokeswoman Jenna Reck.""The smart home will get there but it's not there yet,"" Reck said. ""Adoption is happening even slower than people predicted.""As with all things tech, there is the matter of glitches, frustration and complexity. Markus Giesler, 40, equipped his 1924 house with an Apple home system so he could be a subject for his own academic research at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Canada.When the associate professor of marketing pulls up to the house in his BMW, the GPS on his phone alerts the garage door to open and turns on lights in various colors and brightness throughout his home, depending on his preferences and the time of day. At least, in theory, they do.""Certain devices obey, and some do not,"" Giesler said.Homebuilders started offering smart devices such as automatic locks and thermostats more than five years ago. In its current model homes, Miami-based Lennar works with a company called Nexia, a unit of Ingersoll-Rand (IR).Lennar's Kaiserman hopes working with Apple will have a ""halo effect,"" helping convince customers that a new home in a subdivision can be a ""cool"" alternative to an existing one.No doubt, Apple would be heartened by the experience of Ken Bieber. Last year, Bieber, a 39-year-old executive at a consulting firm, bought a $357,000 Lennar smart home after visiting a model north of Tampa, Fla.With his Nexia system, his lights automatically start dimming in the evening, signaling that it's time to get ready for bed. When his wife, April, went into labor two months ago, he stayed with her in the hospital and texted a temporary entry code to a friend who walked the dog.Since buying his house, Bieber has spent another $1,000 for wireless motion detectors, a video camera and controls for his light dimmers, ceiling fans and irrigation system.Neighbors ask him for advice on their own smart-home device purchases, and he plans to add motorized blinds.""I'll be watching a movie and suddenly I have to get up and pull blinds — apparently it's just too much for me at that point,"" Bieber said. ""I'm so used to saying things and they just happen.""Related:No Need To Ask Jeeves When You Can Ask Apple, Amazon, Facebook, GoogleHomebuilder Confidence Cools As Housing Market Takes A BreakApple iPhone 7 Makes Big Q3 Impact In Just 2 Weeks Of Sales

432,HD,"The overall 0.6% bounceback in retail sales last month comes with a caveat: Total spending looked healthy, but much of the gain came in categories that may not drive growth going forward.A core measure of goods spending that strips out restaurants, cars and gas, as well as building materials, rose just 0.1% in September. That was well below the 0.4% gain expected by economists and came after a 0.1% decline in this broad ""control group"" category of retail spending.Sales at electronics and appliance stores like Best Buy (BBY) remained a sore spot. Despite the midmonth launch of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7, seasonally adjusted sales fell 0.9% from August and 3.8% from a year ago. Best Buy shares fell 1.3% on the stock market today but are still near 52-week highs. Apple is near 2016 highs amid strong initial iPhone 7 demand and rival Samsung's overheating problems with its Note 7, which finally prompted the company to end sales and production of the smartphone.Slumping demand for PCs and printers led Hewlett-Packard (HP) on Thursday to announce a gradual reduction of 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. Electronics retailers also are being squeezed by the likes of Amazon (AMZN). Nonstore retailers saw September sales rise 0.3% from August after a 0.1% dip the prior month. Though online sales momentum has cooled a bit in the past few months, nonstore retailers still are posting double-digit year-over-year gains — 10.6% in September.Department store sales slid 0.7% from August and 6.4% from a year ago. Some of the slide reflects store closures. Still, analysts at Sterne Agee downgraded shares of Macy's (M) to neutral from buy on Friday, noting a slowdown in same-store sales growth. JPMorgan cut price targets and Q3 estimates on Macy's, JCPenney (JCP), Kohl's (KSS), Nordstrom (JWN) and Dillard's (DDS).Macy's, Kohl's shares fell about 3% Friday while Dillard's skidded 4.6%. Kohl's and Nordstom fell fractionally.Everything to do with the housing market shined in September. Sales at building materials and garden equipment stores like Home Depot (HD) surged 1.4% from August, more than reversing a 0.8% decline the prior month. Meanwhile, furniture store sales rose 1.0% from August and 2.7% from a year ago.Home Depot shares rose 0.1%.One of the surprises in the retail report was the strong gain in spending at food service and drinking places, up 0.8% from August, when sales rose 0.7%. Sales have moderated on a year-over-year basis to 6.1% from the 8%-plus pace that prevailed for most of 2015. Still, the gains over the past two months are a pleasant surprise given that McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK) and others have cited pressure from the growing cost gap between eating in and eating out.McDonald's stock fell 1.1%, while Wendy's and Jack in the Box rose fractionally.IBD'S TAKE: The Retail-Restaurants industry group is ranked in the lower tier by IBD, No. 113 out of 197 based on share performance. Investors will generally have more success buying leaders in top-tier groups, when the market trend is favorable. Sill, Papa Johns and Dunkin' Brands, are close to buy points and worth watching. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find out why they're the two top stocks in the group.September restaurant sales data out Thursday from TDn2K covering 25,000 locations shed further light on industry trends. Overall, same-store sales fell 1.1% from a year ago in September, while customer traffic slumped 3.5%. The sector is on pace for its worst performance since 2009.Still, overall sales are performing better than same-store sales because of continued industry expansion, and the quick-service industry is doing a whole lot better than the rest, growing same-store sales 2.2% from a year ago in the third quarter, Nation's Restaurant News reported.On Friday, Bank of America analysts upgraded Domino's Pizza (DPZ) to buy from underperform, noting that the research firm expects 10.4% U.S. same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Domino's reports on Tuesday before the open. Domino's rose 0.5%.Auto sales jumped 1.1% in September, as U.S. vehicle sales rose to a 17.76 million annual rate from 17 million the prior month. Sales of higher-margin pickups and SUVs outperformed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), helping offset their unit sales declines vs. a year ago.""The decline in gasoline prices relative to a year ago is likely to continue to support SUV sales,"" wrote Jefferies economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons. ""Nonetheless, overall vehicle sales are at a level that may be close to a ceiling.""Ford shares closed unchanged. GM rallied 1.1% and Fiat Chrysler shares 2.3%.Gas station sales helped pump up the overall retail sales gain, rising 2.4% from August. McCarthy and Simons noted that the big rise was based on seasonal adjustments: Gas prices fell in 0.8% in September, but they usually fall 2.8% during the month after the peak summer driving season.RELATED:Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

433,HD,"A month that saw the stock market go basically nowhere was not without its fair share of drama for ETF investors. As any respectable drama should, it held triumphs, surprises and disappointments.Among commodity ETFs, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) dumped 5.3% in the month ended Oct. 12 as a hawkish Federal Reserve spooked gold bugs.Among sector equity ETFs, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) charged 4.4% higher as investors uncovered growth in a weak market. Nvidia (NVDA), a top five holding in SMH, set a record high in early October after revealing a new artificial-intelligence supercomputer chip for self-driving cars.Among international equity ETFs, iShares MSCI Brazil Capped (EWZ) rumbled ahead 5.1% as the price of oil unexpectedly spiked to its best level in four months.All three exchange traded funds are among the best-performing ETFs of 2016 in their respective categories, with yearly gains ranging from 18.0% to 72.7%.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is up 6.5% so far this year through Oct. 12.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Investors find themselves at an interesting crossroads in this stage of a long bull run. They see potential for stocks to trend up again, in the glimmer of recovery for corporate profits and in policymakers' extreme caution about making a rate move that could unsettle the markets.Yet the stock market today is rife with uncertainty. In the short term, the November presidential election could create volatility. In the longer run, the global oil glut and the health of the European financial sector remain troubling.Many ETF investors find themselves wondering whether to play it safe with low-volatility and high-dividend ETFs as they did early in this year, or to move more aggressively into riskier trades.Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, suggests the latter may be worth considering.""A brighter oil price outlook, due to an unexpected OPEC plan to cut production and a surprisingly big drop in U.S. oil stockpiles, is positive for risk assets and supports the case for some reflation,"" he wrote in an Oct. 10 note.Higher oil prices would reinforce current market trends, he added.That means so-called haven investments such as utilities and low-volatility stocks could get hurt. Cyclical assets such as emerging markets would be helped.There are lessons to be learned, too, from how the big money managers are positioning their client portfolios.So IBD reached out to two pros for their stock market outlook and their best ideas on how to make money investing in ETFs.Here's what they said.Mark Diorio is chief investment officer at Brookstone Capital Management in Wheaton, Ill. The firm has $1.5 billion in assets under management and takes a risk-managed approach toward investing.Our monetary analysis leads us to three main areas of challenges and opportunities based on the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and a reasonable path for future interest rates. First, the nominal level of interest rates is low and conventional bonds with low, fixed coupons do not protect against inflation.Second, the shape of the yield curve (a graph plotting interest rates along the maturity schedule) is flattening. Simply, the interest-rate differentials between long-term bonds and short-term bonds have narrowed, leaving investors yield-starved for current income.Third, our base-case scenario for the reasonable path for future interest rates is for a series of one-quarter point (0.25%) rate hikes annually. This low-intensity path may promote stability in the stock and bond markets.IShares Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIP): Unlike traditional bonds, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are designed to eliminate inflation risk by adjusting both the principal value and coupon payments to keep up with inflation.IShares Preferred Stock (PFF): For investors that desire current income, preferred stocks may offer an attractive alternative or complement to traditional income sources such as investment-grade or corporate bonds.Preferred stocks are income-generating securities that are somewhere in the middle of the risk spectrum between common stocks and traditional bonds. PFF had a 12-month yield of 5.74% as of Oct. 12.IShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM): In a scenario where future interest rates are on a low-intensity path, stocks may resume their uptrend and thrive.MTUM invests in well-performing stocks with the idea that stocks with higher relative performance may continue to produce strong performance in the near-term relative to stocks with weak performance. Top five holdings out of 121 include Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook, AT&T (T), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Home Depot (HD).Chris Cook is founder and CEO of Beacon Capital Management in Dayton, Ohio. With $2 billion in assets under management, the RIA firm helps investors capture stock market gains while limiting losses from market volatility.Since the market has many uncertainties today -- the presidential election in the United States, the question as to whether or not the Fed will raise the interest rates, or whether or not the Europeans will continue with negative rates -- a neutral, equal-weight sector allocation is appropriate for most investors.We prefer Vanguard's sector ETFs because they cover all 11 sectors of the S&P 500, have exposure to small- and midcap companies, and are extremely inexpensive. They generally have a 0.10% expense ratio ($10 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested) and allocate 25% of their assets to smaller stocks.No one sector is showing significant momentum, although energy and technology are showing early signs of strength. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities are showing short-term price weakness, but not enough to offset their relatively high yields.Vanguard Technology (VGT): The tech sector is experiencing a lot of activity through mergers and acquisitions right now. Top holdings in VGT include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Intel (INTC).The largest of the technology companies are cash-heavy and not subject to interest-rate sensitivity, so they are well-positioned to acquire other notable tech firms, such as Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX).Vanguard Energy (VDE): In the energy sector, profits are directly correlated to supply levels and it looks like the supply levels of energy may taper off in the coming months.The Mideast is working to cut back on supply levels with the expectation that crude prices will go back up to $50 a barrel, the breakeven point, potentially leading to more profit. Weather may have an impact on energy production in the U.S., making it difficult for drilling to take place in areas impacted by severe weather, further limiting supply levels and resulting in increased profits.Vanguard Financial (VFH): On the assumption that interest rates will be raised in December, the financial sector will benefit through increases in profit margins across the board. Lending institutions will generate greater spreads and margin on cash or money market accounts.RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?

434,HD,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

435,HD,"Alaska Air Group (ALK) forecast third-quarter unit revenue that was better than the prior two quarters, making the company the latest airline to signal improvement in the key metric.In an investor update dated Tuesday, the carrier forecast a unit-revenue drop of 4.5%, stronger than the second quarter's 6.4% slide and a first-quarter decrease of 6.1%. The company also forecast slightly lower unit costs.Unit revenue measures an airline's revenue in relation to flight capacity. It has fallen after airlines aggressively expanded during the oil crash.Meanwhile, JetBlue (JBLU) on Wednesday reported improved preliminary unit revenue for September but held to its third-quarter unit revenue forecast for a 3%-4% decline.Preliminary unit revenue for the month fell around 2%, JetBlue said, compared to a roughly 5.5% drop in August. Traffic in September rose 10.8%, outpacing capacity growth of 7.9%.Shares of Alaska Air Group rose 1.6% to 70.43 on the stock market today, emerging above their 200-day line.JetBlue fell 0.5% to 17.79 after rising as high as 18.29 intraday. JetBlue has been trying to regain its 200-day line after finding support at the 50-day line through much of September. JetBlue reports third-quarter results on Oct. 25.The figures from Alaska and JetBlue come after more upbeat forecasts issued Tuesday from American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL). Southwest (LUV) and Spirit Airlines (SAVE) on Tuesday also reported traffic growth in September that outpaced capacity growth.Wall Street has wanted airlines to align their flight capacity with passenger demand, hoping that doing so would keep unit revenue from falling.IBD'S TAKE: With concerns related to terrorism, the Zika virus and capacity, most airline stocks have had a bumpy ride this summer and haven't had a chance to form bases from which to break out. Things could be a bit better in the medical sector.Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reports third-quarter results on Thursday, said that its executive chairman, Richard Anderson, was retiring, effective today after nearly 10 years on Delta's board.Lead director Francis Blake, a former chief executive of The Home Depot (HD) will succeed Anderson's as nonexecutive chairman, Delta said.Delta Air shares rose 0.85% to 39.27.American Air lost 2.2% to 37.37 and United Airlines 1.2% to 52.88.Stifel reiterated its buy rating on American Airlines, but cut its price target to 45 from 50. Imperial Capital maintained its outperform rating on United and raised its price target to 63 from 57.RELATED:Virgin Extends Drop As Alaska Air Merger Review Grows LongerUnited Airlines 'Aggression' Seen With Kirby; Hawaiian Tries BreakoutCould Brexit Actually Help Airlines?

Stocks yawned amid clear evidence of a growing rift in views on interest rates among leaders of the most powerful financial institution in the U.S. The market on Wednesday likely disappointed the bulls as much as the bears.

437,HD,"Stocks overcame mild selling pressure at the open and traded nearly break-even in late-morning trade Wednesday. The initial sell-off came amid a negative preannouncement of quarterly results by data network security firm Fortinet (FTNT), bringing down its peers in the software field. Yet Apple (AAPL) rose 0.7% to 117.13 and continued to draw demand in the wake of a colossal failure in one of its rival Samsung's key wireless products and is perhaps offering an additional entry point.Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to defend the 200 level, rising 1% to 202.30 in heavy turnover. Analysts on consensus see the EV maker posting a profit of 8 cents a share in the third quarter despite controversy over whether the company, which plans to merge with SolarCity (SCTY), needs to raise cash in the fourth quarter to keep up with investing for the scheduled rollout of the Model 3 entry-level sedan in late 2017.The Nasdaq composite, down 0.2% at the open, was flatlining while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials edged roughly 0.1% higher. Gains by Apple and fellow Dow 30 components Travelers (TRV), Nike (NKE) and Home Depot (HD) offset the 1-point loss by Chevron (CVX) as crude oil prices retreated 1%.Alibaba (BABA), down 2.9% on Tuesday, sank another 1.2% to 103.91, but the decline appears normal. Notice on a daily chart how the stock still maintains a thick air pocket above its fast-rising 50-day moving average — a sign of strength. The e-commerce behemoth is also still up 22% past an 85.10 entry in a long cup with handle pattern — this means an investor who bought correctly may still take at least some profits at 20% to 25%, which in this long-in-the-tooth bull market run going back years could be considered as executing the ""platinum rule"" of selling right.Also in big cap land, Apple is already extended more than 5% past a 110.33 buy point in a bottoming-style cup with handle that formed from April 15 to Sept. 9. Yet sometimes, stocks can reflect multiple patterns simultaneously, and such is the case with the largest company on the U.S. equity markets.As seen in either a daily or weekly chart, Apple has formed another handle that began with a Sept. 16 pullback, generating an additional pivot point at 116.28 — 10 cents above the handle's intraday high of 116.18.Keep in mind that Apple had peaked with an all-time high of 134.54 back in the spring of 2015. So while there may be some ""overhead supply"" of disgruntled shareholders itching for the stock to rebound so they can close their positions with small losses or at break-even, that price peak is now more than 18 months in the past. This means the price levels carry less psychological relevance for today's traders.Apple's RS Rating continues to improve, now at 76 as seen in IBD Stock Checkup; five weeks ago it was at a lowly 26 out of a maximum 99. A 76 rating means Apple is outperforming 76% of all companies in terms of 12-month price performance within IBD's database.Are there other ""bottoming bases"" in the works? Yes.Alaska Air Group (ALK), which led the airlines during an extraordinary run by the industry group from December 2012 to the start of 2015, rallied 1.2% to 70.16. The highly profitable airline is trying to clear its 200-day moving average for the second time in as many months.Good stocks trade above this long-term support line en route to building a solid base, holding near 52-week or all-time highs, then breaking out to lead the market and produce tradable rallies. Alaska Air holds a poor 36 RS Rating for now, but watch to see if it improves over the next few months.Last week, Alaska reported a 7.4% jump in September revenue passenger miles despite a dip in the load factor -- a gauge of how full are planes -- to 81.6% vs. 84.1% a year ago. The revenue passenger count rose 5.4% while capacity in the form of available seat miles grew 4.2%.Wall Street sees Q3 earnings down 4% to $2.08 a share; the estimate incorporates a tough year-over-year comp as Q3 profit jumped 47% in the year-ago quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Want to master how to time purchases of excellent growth stocks to maximize potential gains?

438,HD,"Investors could toast the third quarter, the strongest of the year, but September alone was about as exciting as a bottle of bubbly that gone's flat.In the third quarter, the S&P 500 rose 3.85%, lifting U.S. diversified stock mutual funds by 4.8% on average. The broad market advanced despite barely breaking even in September, nosing upward a modest 0.02%. Stock funds edged ahead a mere 0.22% last month.That raised stock funds to a 6.38% gain year to date.The stock market's start-and-stop motion in the third quarter has prompted many fund managers to plan ahead by sticking with names driven by strong trends, such as the shift to cloud computing, and with companies that seem capable of grinding out growth no matter how blah growth may be in the broader economy.Click Here To See A List Of IBD Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""The first half of the year saw more of a defensive-led rally,"" said Lew Piantedosi, a manager of seven Eaton Vance funds with $3.8 billion in total assets. ""But in Q3 that reversed. Cyclicals like tech and industrials did better.""Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWorld equity funds advanced 6.42% in Q3, outperforming U.S. diversified stock funds. Last month, world equity funds rose 1.33%. China regional funds, which gained 11.36%, led the world equity market. In September they racked up a 2.39% return.If cyclical sectors stay hot, then stocks tied to transportation of industrial goods and commodities could continue their third-quarter gains. Piantedosi held Norfolk Southern (NSC), which gained 14% in the third quarter, in his Focused Growth Opportunities Class I (EIFGX) as of July 31.His Tax-Managed Growth 1.1 (EITMX) held Union Pacific (UNP), which rolled to a 12% gain.But what if most cyclicals lose their head of steam? Piantedosi prefers the long view.""I focus on big-picture growth trends that are sustainable despite shifting macro noise,"" he said.Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) are sustainable growers.""They benefit from great secular tailwinds,"" he said. ""While those names have done well — especially Amazon — there's still a runway for them.""IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Brian Deagon analyzes the tailwinds driving Amazon.

""This is a short-term theme.""Macy's (M) has gone through markdowns after having to discount last year's overstock, he says. The mild winter dampened consumer demand for warm clothes. And competition is stiff from Amazon.""The company has done a great job managing inventories going into the holidays this year,"" Piantedosi said. ""Expectations are low. And they've been monetizing real estate"" by selling or closing unneeded locations.And he continues to like home-improvement giants Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD).""Housing is still strong,"" he said. ""Interest rates are still low. Consumers are OK. And (stock) prices have come in a little over fears of a housing slowdown.""Jeff Rottinghaus, T. Rowe Price manager of $1.6 billion Growth & Income (PRGIX) and of $314.1 million U.S. Large-Cap Core (TRULX), says stock prices in general seem fairly priced. But he likes some names in health care, where prices have been pushed down.He calls Becton Dickinson (BDX), Medtronics (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ""quiet"" because none is under political pressure over drug pricing. Becton develops medical supplies, Medtronic develops implantable cardiac devices and other products and UnitedHealth is the industry's biggest managed-care provider.Yet Rottinghaus is shopping among biotechs because prices are so beaten down.He is underweight in the tech sector. But he likes companies benefiting from the secular trend of cloud computing's growth. Those include Alphabet and Microsoft (MSFT). He also likes the sustainable secular growth of Visa (V) and Facebook.Rottinghaus also likes NextEra Energy (NEE), which has a 2.9% dividend yield.""It's the largest renewable-energy generator in the U.S.,"" he said. ""Its dividend yield is roughly 3%. But we wouldn't own it without the low-double-digit earnings growth we expect from them.""Growth-oriented sectors led stock funds' third-quarter charge.

439,HD,"U.S. stock indexes on Thursday afternoon reverted to the back-and-forth action they've shown since the Nasdaq's all-time high was posted two weeks ago.The Nasdaq inched down 0.1%, trimming an earlier 0.6% loss. The S&P 500 edged up nearly 0.1%, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running close to Wednesday's levels.In recent weeks, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 have been shifting sideways. Weekly closes look tight over the past three weeks, though that could still change this week.In the IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, bulls had to scratch for stocks rising in strong volume. A few stocks rose in brisk turnover, but most were of secondary quality.Home Depot (HD) advanced 1.5% in strong volume, scoring the biggest gain in the blue chip Dow. Home Depot remains under its 200-day and 50-day lines. The company grew earnings 15% in the most recently reported quarter. Home Depot has sketched the left side and at least part of the bottom of a possible base. Work on the right side has not yet begun.Home Depot rival Lowe's (LOW) is in rougher shape, falling fractionally Thursday afternoon. Lowe's is 14% off its high and in an ugly consolidation that will take some time to repair.Wine, beer and spirits provider Constellation Brands (STZ) took a second shot at a breakout. On Wednesday the stock cleared a 168.78 buy point but reversed to close under the buy point. Constellation retook the buy point Thursday in heavy volume.Constellation, Home Depot and Lowe's all have Composite Ratings below the minimum 90 level associated with top stocks.

The stock has been trading above its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Toll has a potential buy point of 32.35.The housing market has been strong this year thanks to wage growth as well as low interest and unemployment rates. But mortgage rates have climbed along with Treasury yields in recent weeks.Last month, the Commerce Department reported housing starts jumped 25.5% in October to a nine-year high. But building permits ticked up just 0.3%, suggesting a sharp deceleration in activity later.Hovnanian Enterprises (HOV) is out Thursday and analysts expect it to report an 19% drop in fiscal Q4 EPS to 13 cents but a 15.7% increase in revenue to $802.3 million.Hovnanian shares were in a slump from early 2013. But the stock has taken off in recent weeks.

441,HD,"Donald Trump's economic policies, uncertain as they are, have sent the stock market to new highs, but are the days of slow growth really over?While economists are boosting their GDP forecasts for 2017, they are by no means expecting a boom. And some are worried that the gains from tax cuts and more infrastructure spending may be relatively short-lived.Economists are hardly of one mind, and their views should be taken with an even bigger grain of salt than usual given that Trump and Republicans in Congress have yet to show their cards. Still, investors should understand the high degree of difficulty of the maneuver the incoming administration is about to undertake.Consider that the Ronald Reagan boom fueled by tax cuts and defense spending started when interest rates and unemployment had nowhere to go but down, whereas Federal Reserve economists now think the U.S. is close to full employment and the 10-year Treasury yield sank to a historic low of 1.34% in July. In other words, rates have nowhere to go but up and the jobless rate may not be able to fall much without increasing inflation pressure.The spike in interest rates since Trump's election — the 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.33% on Monday despite pulling back from last week's 16-month high — will cut total home sales (new and existing) by 5% from October's nine-year high over the next several months, wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.That can't be good news for big homebuilders like D.R. Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN) and Pulte Group (PHM), and the sector has been a laggard during the postelection stock market rally. Still, Shepherdson says, the economic impact of slower housing market activity will be modest for three reasons. The sector makes up a much smaller share of GDP than it did before the mortgage crisis. Further, retailers of building materials and appliances , such as Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD), will only feel the effect of the housing slowdown on a lagged basis, perhaps not until the spring of 2018.But the big reason that the economy won't sweat higher rates next year is the coming fiscal boost courtesy of Trump and the GOP Congress. While Shepherdson thinks tax cuts are more likely to pass than an infrastructure spending package, he notes that the Tax Policy Center's measure of Trump's corporate and individual income-tax cuts comes to $198 billion in fiscal 2017.""Even if half of that money is saved, the boost to GDP growth would be some 0.5 percentage point, more than offsetting the housing hit,"" Shepherdson wrote.Shepherdson said he's upped his GDP growth forecast to 3.25% in 2017. Yet, the election forecast also led to his ""sharply weaker forecast for the second half of 2018,"" because he expects the fiscal boost to lead to higher inflation.IBD'S TAKE: As markets reassess prospects for faster growth, stocks like Freeport-McMoRan, Nucor and Martin Marietta are consolidating postelection gains. Read The Big Picture every day to find out whether the rally has further to run. And check out IBD Leaderboard to look for insight on stock standouts.The big uncertainty is whether the tax cuts encourage a substantial increase in labor-force participation, as Trump's advisors expect. In that case, faster growth won't fuel an overshoot in inflation that leads the Federal Reserve to step up its pace of rate hikes.""We can't know what will happen to the labor market in the face of substantial fiscal stimulus,"" Shepherdson admits, but he's worried that companies will continue to have trouble finding workers who have the skills they need.Another possibility is that the GOP could create more slack in the labor market by changing work-reducing incentives, including the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer coverage to workers clocking 30 hours per week and the Obama administration overtime rule that a federal judge just put on hold.Shepherdson is hardly alone in worrying that a GOP burst of tax-cut and spending fuel is coming at a less-than-ideal time. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a Nov. 17 appearance before Congress, interpreted the bond-market reaction to Trump's election as factoring in the potential ""inflationary consequences"" from enacting a stimulus when the economy was ""relatively close to maximum employment.""Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research, figures that the Trump tax cuts and infrastructure spending worth $650 billion over two years could add up to 0.9 percentage point to annual GDP growth, though the same package could have had twice as much bang for the buck if enacted during a recession.A third big difference between the task facing Trump and the one that faced Reagan is that publicly held federal debt has more than doubled as a share of GDP. That raises the risk that Trump and the GOP Congress will fire their fiscal bullets, leading the economy to overheat, resulting in ""a deeper recession"" because there's less fiscal space to help revive growth several years down the line.It's unclear whether concerns about the budget will limit Trump's coming infrastructure spending package, which has led investors to snap up shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and steel maker Nucor (NUE).Not everyone is so concerned about the timing of the coming fiscal expansion. In fact, the 35-nation Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday urged policymakers to seize ""a unique window of opportunity to make more active use of fiscal levers to boost growth and reduce inequality without compromising debt levels.""The group sees U.S. growth picking up to 2.3% in 2017 and 3% in 2018.Beyond the issue of timing, economists have big concerns over what steps Trump will take regarding immigration and trade. Moody's Analytics figures that deportations and a less-welcoming environment for unauthorized immigrants under Trump could reduce the labor force by 2.16 million workers. Since GDP growth equals the increase in hours worked plus productivity growth, that would be a negative.Trade is an even bigger wild card. The possibilities range from Trump using his bully pulpit to get Ford (F) and United Technologies (UTX) unit Carrier to keep work in the U.S. to a growth-killing trade war.The forecast from Jefferies & Co. economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons may be about as good as it gets for Republicans trying to protect or expand their majorities in the 2018 elections: GDP growth of around 3% in 2018, with a jobless rate of 4% and the personal consumption expenditures inflation at a manageable 2.5%.""Donald Trump's domestic fiscal policy proposals are pro-growth and will promote a stronger consumer sector (and) improved labor-market conditions for semiskilled and unskilled workers,"" they wrote. ""Reduced regulation will also free resources for more productive uses.""RELATED:What's Really Doable In Trump's First 100 Days?Trump Makes 'Progress' On Indiana Carrier Plant, Using Twitter Bully Pulpit

443,HD,"Home improvement retailer Lowe's (LOW) on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of Wall Street estimates amid weak traffic, a day after larger rival Home Depot (HD) reported strong results and in-line guidance.Estimates: Earnings per share to jump 20% to 96 cents, on 10% revenue increase to $15.859 billion, up 10%.Results: EPS advanced 10% to 88 cents; revenue climbed 9.6% to $15.74 billion.Outlook: Lowe's sees full-year EPS of $3.52 and sales growth of 9%-10%. Analysts expected $4. Even with Lowe's Q3 miss, that assumes a Q4 earnings shortfall as well.""While we expected moderation in the second half of the year, traffic slowed more than we anticipated in August and September before improving in October, which put pressure on our profitability in the quarter,"" CEO Robert Niblock said.Shares: Lowe's fell 2.9% to close at 67.02 on the stock market today after losing 1.4% on Tuesday. Home Depot, which reported earnings on Tuesday, rose 0.8% to 125.33 after sinking 2.6% on Tuesday.Home Depot on Tuesday said the housing market was still working in its favor, but its full-year guidance was only in line with expectations despite beating in Q3.Home Depot's same-store sales growth — 5.9% in the U.S. and 5.5% overall — easily outpaced Lowe's 2.7% gain. Home Depot has been growing faster than its smaller rival in most quarters over the last several years.IBD'S TAKE: Even as home improvement stocks contend with potential rate hikes, the broader construction industry could see a bigger uptrend if President-elect Trump carries out plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.Investors have had concerns about home-improvement spending, discounting, weaker big-ticket spending and, for Lowe's in particular, how its acquisition of Rona would affect margins. Still, big-ticket items flooring and appliances remained solid for Home Depot in the third quarter.RELATED:Dick's Sporting Goods Sees Weak Earnings For Holiday QuarterOctober Retail Sales Jump 0.8% As Retail Stocks SoarTJX Cos.

445,HD,"Sales of previously owned U.S. homes unexpectedly climbed in October to the highest level since February 2007, a sign of momentum in the housing market a month before a jump in borrowing costs, National Association of Realtors data showed Tuesday.Existing-home sales rose 2% to a 5.60 million annual rate, above views for about 5.44 million. The median sales price rose 6% vs. a year earlier to $232,000.The supply of available homes fell 4.3% vs. October 2015 to 2.02 million, the 17th straight year-over-year decline. At the current pace, it would take 4.3 months to sell the houses on the market, the quickest since January and down from 4.4 months in September. NAR deems six months' supply as normal.Credit steady job growth and accelerating wage gains for fueling demand despite limited inventory that's pushing up prices.But housing demand may falter going forward. October existing-home sales reflect contracts signed a month or two earlier. Since then, mortgage rates have risen sharply, especially since Donald Trump's surprise election win sent Treasury yields soaring. The 30-year mortgage rate has risen to a three-year high.That could curb home buying, especially from millennials and other first-time buyers.The October advance ""may be indicative of pent-up demand that was unrealized in the summer,"" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the Realtors group in Washington, told reporters as the data were released. More recently, ""with the rise in rates, we may begin to see some modest reduction in home sales."" As long as there's job creation, the impact should be ""minimal.""Mortgage applications tumbled last week to their lowest level since January, the Mortgage Bankers Association said.""This is all very encouraging, but it has to be seen in the context of the recent decline in mortgage applications, which if sustained likely will push home sales down sharply in the early part of next year,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd., said in a note. ""We expect further declines in demand as rates climb.Housing-related stocks were mixed. Tuesday afternoon.LGI Homes (LGIH) advanced 2.6% and KB Home (KBH) 0.7%. But D.R.

447,HD,"Home Depot (HD) on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings that topped estimates and said the housing market is still helping, not hurting. But the home-improvement retailer offered a full-year forecast that was merely in line with expectations.Earnings per share rose 18.5% to $1.60, topping views for $1.58. Revenue rose 6% to $23.154 billion, past estimates for $23.044 billion, but the second straight quarter of slightly decelerating growth. U.S. same-store sales climbed 5.9%. Overall comps rose 5.5%.The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $6.33 up from an earlier forecast of $6.31. Analysts had already expected $6.33, before Q3's 2-cent beat. Credit Suisse analyst Seth Sigman said in a research note that the guidance was raised ""primarily to reflect a lower share count and tax rate.""Home Depot said it continued to expect full-year revenue growth of ""approximately 6.3 percent,"" roughly in line with views, and comp growth of roughly 4.9%.Home Depot rose before the open, but closed down 2.6% to 124.40 in the stock market today. Home Depot has fallen below its 50-day moving average, a day after finding resistance at the 200-day line.No. 2 improvement chain Lowe's (LOW) fell 1.4% to 69.03. Lowe's reports earnings on Wednesday.Home Depot's implied fourth-quarter forecast — which Sigman said amounted to 3% overall same-store sales growth, below consensus for 4% — could also be worrying some investors.Sigman, however, appeared to be more optimistic.""We don't think there is anything in the Q3 results that would indicate a slowdown, and if the quarter ended on a healthy note as we had expected, that may give investors more confidence that guidance is conservative,"" Sigman said.IBD'S TAKE: Even as home improvement stocks contend with potential rate hikes, the broader construction industry could see a bigger uptrend if President-elect Trump carries out plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.Sigman also noted that foreign exchange and Hurricane Matthew hurt results, but he said solid ticket growth of 3% ""seems to imply continued strength in big ticket and larger projects, as well as progress with its own Pro related initiatives.""Flooring and appliances, both big-ticket items, were strong in Q3.The earnings for both Home Depot and Lowe's come amid investors' worries about weaker home-improvement spending.Home Depot said it still sees the housing market boosting its business, with executives not worried about the recent spike in mortgage rates.""We've got a long way to go before there's any impact to our business from rising interest rates,"" CFO Carol Tome said.even as some analysts say home-improvement spending has stayed strong compared to the broader retail sector.Investors had also been concerned about weaker big-ticket purchases, aggressive promotions, and the growing likelihood of a Fed rate hike.RELATED:Dick's Sporting Goods Sees Weak Earnings For Holiday QuarterOctober Retail Sales Jump 0.8% As Retail Stocks SoarTJX Cos.

449,HD,"Think you've got the post-election stock-market winners' sorted out? Well, have you considered consumer discretionary or companies likely to gain an edge as new tax rules are applied? Award-winner Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) sees stocks like CarMax (KMX), Charles Schwab (SCHW), 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) doing well as a Trump administration ushers in corporate tax cuts and interest-rate hikes.Schwab and Fox also stand to benefit from demographic trends and the rising prospects of media-content winners.And despite issues weighing on Alphabet, Macauley expects the internet giant to nearly double earnings in the next five years.The $2.4 billion Hennessy Focus Fund (HFCSX) is a Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner. To learn more about its managers' visions of likely stock-market leaders in the months and years ahead, IBD turned to Brian Macauley, one of the fund's three managers. Macauley, who is 42 years old, shared insights on those and other stocks he thinks will do well as corporate America adapts to life under new political leadership. He spoke from his office in Arlington, Va.IBD: Your fund's low turnover rate makes it look static. But the fund is flexible in other ways. Is that its real secret sauce?Macauley: Right, we don't manage to a style box or by market-capitalization size.This is a go-anywhere portfolio with an emphasis on finding long-term compounders — businesses with the competitive position, growth, and management to create outsized value over an extended period of time. We most often find business with these characteristics in the mid cap space, but sometimes small- or large-cap companies will fit our model.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders We try to build a portfolio with attractive expected returns and low risk of loss. We do not want artificial capitalization limitations or style boxes to constrain us.IBD: You recently told me your usual turnover rate is slightly higher. Why is that?Macauley: On average our turnover is about 15%. This past year is one of the lower years. The reason is that in general we've not had a lot of market volatility, so we haven't seen a lot of mispricing to take advantage of.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Whether 4% or 15%, this fund differs from its Hennessy stablemates, which rebalance just once a year, right?Macauley: We buy and sell when it is appropriate in the marketplace. We have a very different approach from our stablemates.IBD: Your turnover rate is a fraction of the 66% pace for U.S diversified stock mutual funds on average, according to Morningstar Inc.Macauley: Right.IBD: Tell me more about the traits you seek in stocks.Macauley: We're looking for businesses with a wide competitive moat, durable competitive advantages that can earn outsized returns on capital even if competitors come into their market. We look for businesses that have a different mousetrap that can gain a lot of market share over time, or that have a secular tailwind that benefits them or their whole industry.We look for high quality management that thinks and acts like long-term owners. We look for a low risk of catastrophic outcome. We try to stay away from situations where there's rapidly changing technology or a fad or a fashion risk.And we try to meld growth with valuation. We will pay for quality, but we want to make sure we get in at a discount. Warren Buffett says that a lot of accounting vagaries obscure the true economics of a business. We try to look through vagaries and understand a business's true economics.IBD: I know this is unlikely, but has the fund done anything to take advantage of the Trump election?Macauley: We don't make directional bets based on individual economic influences. We had a number of REITs and yield-sensitive positions do poorly (amid election results), but those have been offset by strength in our more consumer discretionary and yield beneficiary names.Names that benefited were CarMax, Charles Schwab and Encore Capital Group (ECPG).CarMax is the largest used-car retailer in the U.S. It has a differentiated consumer proposition — it is a no-haggle-on-price dealer. And it offers a wide selection of late-model used cars, making them easy to use to purchase a car.IBD'S TAKE: To get a handle on whether no-haggle pricing helps car-sellers like CarMax, read this IBD report.They've grown to 170 stores and should be able to about double their store base as they march across the U.S. in the next 10 to 12 years.They get two benefits from the Trump election. One, if there are tax cuts, then consumers will have more discretionary dollars in their pockets. Second, they are a purely U.S. company that pays a high tax rate. To any extent that corporate tax rates change, they could see a cut.Schwab is a broker and custodian of investor assets, serving individuals, wealth planners and registered investment advisors. They benefit from brokers leaving wirehouses like (Bank of America (BAC)-owned) Merrill Lynch and becoming fee-only advisors. Schwab provides the enabling technology for advisors to do that. Also, as baby boomers retire and roll their 401(k) balances into IRAs and look for financial advice, Schwab is a solution for them.And Schwab holds a lot of cash from clients. They can lend that out and buy securities with it. As rates rise, they earn more from that.IBD'S TAKE: Schwab is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Finance-Investment Bank/Bankers industry group due to key growth metrics. It has a top-notch IBD Composite Rating. Consulting IBD's Stock Checkup is a quick way to get a handle on the traits of a stock like this.Encore Capital Group purchases charged-off credit-card receivables. Encore is a specialist in trying to get people to pay what they owe on those credit-card debts. Regulatory burden has compressed this industry to essentially two competitors that control 90% of the industry. It's difficult for new players to come back in. And it takes a large operation to collect debt efficiently.A softer regulatory environment should allow the supply of debt to come to market more quickly.IBD: Does Alphabet's recent softness reflect investors' fear that a Trump presidency will bring trade wars and an economic slump?Macauley: Our thesis is that between growth in online advertising and improved monetization of mobile search and growth at YouTube, that Google (Alphabet) should nearly double their earnings over the next five years. From the current valuation, that's a reasonable opportunity given the high quality business we believe Google is.Their competitive moat is not technology so much as it is users' habits. So there's a low risk of Google being leapfrogged.The election has done three things: One, it has caused scrutiny of low corporate tax rates. We think Google's taxes are not so low, but there still could be some increased tax burden. Second, if there is a trade war, Google and other large technology companies are high-profile places that other countries can retaliate against. Finally, there is the obtuse risk that these technology companies were biased in their presentations of (political) information during the campaign. They may receive more scrutiny from the new administration because of that.IBD: What's driving accelerating earnings per share growth at American Woodmark (AMWD), a kitchen cabinet maker?Macauley: About half of their business is driven by new home construction, which is still climbing out of a depression. We have a long way to go to get to long-term historical norms, so that cyclical uplift is a tailwind.Another thing: during this housing recession they had net cash that they used to improve their service levels and gain market share.After partnering with Home Depot (HD), then Lowe's (LOW), then large home builders in the 1980s, in the last few years they finally had the bandwidth to service the small kitchen-bath market.And they've culled out a lot of lower margin customers in the last few years, filling their capacity with higher-profit customers. So they will have much higher operating margins going forward.And they benefit from the election. Some of their competitors import products. Woodmark pays a full tax rate, so if corporate taxes go down they benefit. And if people have more discretionary income due to tax cuts, they're more likely to buy a home or remodel.IBD: Marlin Business Services (MRLN), which provides leasing for small-ticket equipment leasing, has trended higher in recent weeks. Any election cause and effect?Macauley: They are simply very good at underwriting those leases. They work with people leasing copying machines, equipment for dentists' offices, restaurant equipment. Because of the regulatory environment, regular banks have pulled back from this space. Even where banks compete, it can take weeks to get a loan from banks, but just hours from Marlin. And Marlin is working to bring this to other (business areas). That provides a good forward outlook.IBD: Why do you like 21st Century Fox among media companies?Macauley: The media world is separating into winners and losers, and 21st Century Fox will be a winner. They have must-have content. And they are included in all important over-the-top solutions like Hulu, Google Unplugged, Dish Network (DISH).IBD: Does ""over-the-top"" mean independent from a cable provider?Macauley: Yes. All you need is an internet solution. It's a more efficient means of distribution. People who want to cut the cord with their cable provider are likely to end up with a noncable solution that includes Fox content. And over-the-top is attractive to advertisers because ads can be targeted and lower advertisers' cost per thousand of reaching viewers.In addition, Fox owns 30% of Hulu, which we think will be successful.IBD: Insurance seems staid. What's the appeal of Aon (AON)?Macauley: This is a company that should be relatively a-cyclical, with a low teens growth profile.They are one of only three providers with a global insurance footprint, so there aren't many other places you can go for global coverage. And with their size, they collect a tremendous amount of data. They create information solutions that are valuable to clients and insurance companies, which enables them to grow market share. And they are available at a fairly attractive price — about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: American Tower (AMT) pulled back after the election. Do you still like it?Macauley: The stock has come under pressure as almost all REITs have because interest rates have risen and there's some expectation they might continue to rise, which would make (some) REITs worth less.In addition, there's concern that the new administration would be more amenable to a merger between Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS). Obama was strongly against the merger. If two large tenants merge, it would reduce revenue growth at American Tower for some period.Despite the risk, with its growth profile this is one of our four best ideas, which is why on one of our largest positions we (recently) could buy it cheaper than it was just days earlier.IBD: Why has O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) rallied in recent weeks?Macauley: O'Reilly is the best in their industry at getting parts to customers quickly. They've set up a distribution network that's more robust than anyone else's. And in this business, especially on the commercial side, a mechanic needs same-day parts so he can fix a car and return it to a customer in the afternoon. O'Reilly is in the best position to do that.They have 4,500 stores today. They'll have 6,500 or 7,000 stores in the U.S. over the next 10 years.They pay a full tax rate, so any tax cut should benefit them. As for possible new tariffs, they do import parts from Asia, but all of their competitors do as well. And any increase in tariffs will be passed on to their end customers.IBD: Mistras Group (MG) gapped down 13% on Oct. 7, a day after reporting a 4% decline in first-quarter EPS growth and a downward revision for the fiscal year. It has rallied since then. Do you still like the stock?Macauley: If you run an oil refinery, let's say, you deal with a very corrosive product. Mistras inspects plants to make sure it does not blow up. They are the leader in nondestructive testing for oil and gas and other infrastructure assets, like aerospace and bridges.Our thesis is that they can hold their market position and improve margins by applying some better-business practices being brought to them by the CFO they hired a few years ago. The business will be valuable to a private equity or strategic buyers. We think somebody else will own it after (current management) fixes the operations.IBD: Since you don't trade a lot, how do you spend your days?Macauley: We spend time monitoring businesses we own and industry developments. We have a watch list of 75 companies that represent our next-best ideas, and we always try to stay on top of that. It's a continual process of looking for ideas that are superior to what we already own.IBD: How do you and your co-managers divide portfolio responsibilities? Is each of you responsible for certain sectors, for example?Macauley: We're all equally responsible for names in the portfolio. Our voting on trades is one-third, one-third, one-third, majority rules. Day to day, we have a primary analyst in charge of each name. I'm the primary on CarMax, for example. My partners know my primary businesses well, but not in quite as much detail as I do.IBD: Financials are the fund's largest sector, with a 29% weighting as of Sept. 30. Why is that?Macauley: There is an important distinction for us. We're really invested in specialty companies. We do not tend to own traditional depository banks or commodity financials. Markel (MKL) is our largest. It's a specialty insurer. It's also our oldest holding. The records don't still exist, but I believe it's been in the fund since the fund opened in 1997.Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) (the fund owns A shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange) is an alternative asset manager. It invests in assets other than stocks and bonds. It owns office buildings, toll roads, retail real estate, hydroelectric plants, electrical transmission lines. They are infrastructure related assets.IBD: You had a 15% cash weighting as of Sept. 30, well above the industry average. Is that much cash normal?Macauley: We've averaged about 8% over the past seven years. We've had a lot of inflows. We're patient about deploying new capital.IBD: How long does it normally take you to build a full position in a stock?Macauley: Every situation is different. It may take two weeks on average.As a winner in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards, it outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.

Comps were seen rising around 3.1%, according to the Credit Suisse note.Stock: Lowe's shares rose 0.4% to 70.01 Monday, finding resistance at its 50-day line.The earnings for both companies come amid investors' worries about weaker home-improvement spending, Jefferies said in a research note this month, and the firm cited concerns about commentary from companies like Whirlpool (WHR) and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).During its third-quarter earnings call, Whirlpool said it saw ""temporary softness"" in U.S. demand in the first two months of that quarter with improvement in the third. The company attributed the lag to election-related consumer anxiety.There are also concerns about weaker big-ticket purchases, discounting and Fed rate hikes for Home Depot and Lowe's. Weather, as always, could play a huge role in the companies' future results.""Comparisons will get more challenging the next two quarters as a warm winter extended the outdoor selling season last year,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in the research note. ""Forecasts suggest a more typical and colder winter this year, so we would expect a deceleration in comp trend over the next two quarters.""IBD'S TAKE: Even as home improvement stocks contend with potential rate hikes and colder winters, the broader construction industry could see a bigger uptrend if President-elect Trump carries out plans to overhaul the nation's infrastructure.However, the investment firm said, home improvement spending was still better than in other areas of retail, with higher home prices and healthy consumer finances helping the industry. The housing market, and some companies associated with it, have benefited from lower interest rates in recent years.Home Depot has generally outperformed Lowe's in recent years. Credit Suisse also said that more than 120 Home Depot stores ""may have been in the path"" of Hurricane Matthew. Those stores, analyst Seth Sigman wrote, could have seen an uptick in demand from customers looking to prepare for the storm or make repairs to damage afterward.Credit Suisse said Lowe's gross margins could be strained by its purchase this year of Rona, a Canada-based retailer that sells home-improvement products and building materials.The two companies are in IBD's retail and wholesale building products industry group, which is lagging at No. 108 but rising in the past three weeks.RELATED:Lowe's Q2 Earnings, Revenue Miss Views As Comps Lag Home Depot'sHome Depot Earnings Solid On Housing 'Tailwind'; Stock Flirts With Buy Point

Mining issues lagged.In the stock market today, Chipotle (CMG) got off to a strong start, rising nearly 6%.

Shares rose 3%, but are now extended from a 31.79 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: HealthEquity's industry group, Commercial Services-Health Care, has been top performer over the past six months. See who the other leaders in the group are with IBD Stock Checkup.Retailer Francesca's (FRAN) was another solid gainer, up more than 7%, on bullish guidance.On the downside, HD Supply (HDS) crashed 15% after reporting sluggish earnings and issuing weak guidance.

468,HD,"Lowe's (LOW) on Wednesday reported weaker-than-expected second quarter earnings and sales growth, once again lagging its larger rival on key metrics.Lowe's also cut its full-year EPS forecast, sending its stock down as much as 7% in heavy volume.Same-store sales rose just 2%, far below Q1's 7.3% gain and about half of the 4.1% gain that analysts had expected.That's also well below the 4.7% same-store sales gain of Home Depot (HD) -- 5.4% in the U.S. Lowe's topped Home Depot's comps growth in Q1 with a 7.3% jump, but has only exceeded its larger rival in one other quarter since 2009.Home Depot reported earnings on Tuesday that met views for a 16% rise while sales growth of 6.6% just missed. Home Depot did raise its full-year EPS guidance slightly as it still says it's benefiting from a housing ""tailwind."" Lowe's Q2 earnings per share minus one-time items of $1.37 were 14% higher than the same quarter last year. Revenue grew 5.2% to $18.26 billion.But Wall Street expected $1.42 EPS on $18.45 billion revenue. It was the first time in four quarters that Lowe's quarterly profit came in below analysts' consensus.Lowe's is positioned ""to capitalize on a favorable macroeconomic backdrop for home improvement in the second half of this year,"" Chairman and CEO Robert Niblock said a statement.Financial markets tracker S&P Global IQ maintained a hold rating on Lowe's but raised its price target 90 from 82, saying in a client note, ""We believe product and geographic mix caused U.S. same-store sales growth to lag its key peer.""NPD Group's Checkout Tracking noted in a report that during the past 12 months 67% of all buyers bought something from Home Depot and 59% from Lowe's. Both generate loyalty among customers. Home Depot buyers give that company 51% of their hardware store purchase in dollars, while Lowe's buyers give 46%.The construction and home repairs supplies retailer's gross margin of 34.44 % was just below the 34.47% it reported a year ago. Lowe's noted that its Q2 results included a loss on a foreign currency hedge in advance of its acquisition of Canada's Rona. That $2.4 billion deal, which closed in May, cut diluted EPS by 6 cents a share.IBD'S TAKE: Lowe's broke below a recent buy point Tuesday, but the housing sector remains on solid foundations. Here are several top-rated building stocks acting well.Lowe's cut its full-year EPS target to $4.06, in line with analyst views but down from its prior goal of $4.11. But it sees full-year revenue climbing 10%Lowe's shares gapped down 5.7% to a 76.88 close in Wednesday trading on the stock market today, tumbling below an 80.86 buy point and its 50-day moving average.Home Depot closed down a few cents at 136.15.

469,HD,"The National Association of Realtors reports existing-home sales for July on Wednesday.Annualized sales pace should dip from June's cycle high to a still-strong 5.57 million, according to the consensus forecasts.Mortgage applications fell 2.1% in the week ended Aug. 19, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday. Demand for loans to buy a home fell for the fifth time in the last six weeks to the lowest level in six months. That signals weakening housing demand, but other data signal robust purchase activity.New-home sales surged 12.4% vs. June and 31.3% vs. a year earlier to an annual rate of 654,000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. That was the highest since October 2007 and blowing out economist forecasts.Also Tuesday, Toll Bros. (TOL) reported a 69% EPS gain, in line with views, while revenue rose 23.5%, slightly topping forecasts. Toll reported strong orders for its luxury homes.Toll Bros. skyrocketed 8.8% to 31.91 on the stock market Tuesday to a 7-month high, blasting above its 200-day line for the first time since December.Other homebuilder stocks also did well. LGI Homes (LGIH) rose 2%, PulteGroup (PHG) 2.9% and KB Home (KBH) 4.9%. LGI Homes, PulteGroup and KB Home have been consolidating in recent weeks near 52-week highs.IBD'S TAKE: Toll Bros. is a luxury builder, but it hasn't been a premium stock lately. Even after its latest strong earnings and share price jump, it's ranked 11th in the Building-Residential/Commercial group. To see who the real leaders are in the group, based on company fundamentals and share price performance, visit IBD Stock Checkup.Housing has been a ""tailwind"" to Home Depot (HD), the home improvement chain said in its Q2 earnings statement last week. Home Depot earnings met views while revenue fell a bit short. Home Depot shares flirted with a buy point that day, but closed slightly lower and continue to hold under a proper entry area.That was better than smaller rival Lowe's (LOW), which missed views on the top and bottom line and once again lagged Home Depot's same-store sales growth.Lowe's stock, which had been in a buy zone, tumbled below that level and through its 50-day line.RELATED:Lowe's Q2 Earnings, Revenue Miss Views As Comps Lag Home Depot's

470,HD,"U.S. stock indexes tacked on small gains Tuesday, as the market lingered near recent all-time highs.The Nasdaq crept 0.3% higher, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.2%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average added 0.4% as it crossed the 19,000 level. Volume in the stock market today was about 10% higher on the NYSE and about 7% higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary data.While the indexes haven't been rising in long strides, a number of stocks have been making aggressive moves up or down.In the S&P 500, apparel and accessories retailer Urban Outfitters (URBN) was one of the day's best performers only to undo it after hours. The stock sprinted almost 5% higher in twice its average volume in the regular session. Then the stock dropped about 9% after hours. Urban Outfitters reported quarterly results after the close. The Street's consensus estimate on earnings called for a 5% gain to 44 cents a share. Revenue was pegged at 5% to $869.07 million. The figures came in at 40 cents and $862 million, a double miss, according to preliminary data.On the chart, Urban Outfitters cleared a 37.32 buy point in a shallow double-bottom base a little more than a week ago. The double-bottom base is a pattern that is shaped like a W. The middle peak plus 10 cents becomes the buy point. Urban's 5% buy zone runs to 39.19, which was nearly reached in Tuesday's regular session.A stock should not be bought more than 5% beyond the ideal buy point.Urban Outfitters is recovering from a deep sell-off in 2015, but Tuesday's quarterly results are a setback. The stock's IBD Composite Rating is a respectable 82. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 82 puts the stock in the top 18 percentile.In the IBD 50, a proxy for highly rated stocks, fast-food chain Jack In The Box (JACK) rose 6% in heavy volume. Jack fell 3% in after-hours trade Monday on quarterly results and weak guidance, but the bulls won Tuesday's battle. Jack retreated 4% in the first five minutes of trade and then reversed higher en route to its 6% gain. The low of the day nearly took Jack to its 50-day line, where it found support and then broke out. As Jack's case illustrates, after-hours trade is not always a reliable guide for a stock's action in the next regular session.Also, in the IBD 50, metal products maker Worthington Industries (WOR) surged 5%, but volume was only average. Meanwhile, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) advanced 3% in volume 30% above average.Blue chips were mostly up. Verizon Communications (VZ) and Home Depot (HD) held the day's biggest gains, 2.5% and 2%, respectively. Verizon is lowly rated, but Home Depot's 94 EPS Rating is the highest in the Dow. A rating of 94 means the stock is growing earnings faster than all but 6% of the stocks in IBD's database.RELATED:Existing Home Sales Strongest Since 2007Marvell Technology: What Is The Chart Really Saying?

471,HD,"Wal-Mart (WMT) is pushing up its ""Cyber Week"" deals to start the day after Thanksgiving, as retailers engage in their own Black Friday tussles for shoppers.Three-quarters of their customers say they want cyberdeals earlier, said Walmart.com SVP of Merchandising Steve Breen in a statement, which is why the company is nudging up the online holiday sales event.Some of the Wal-Mart deals that start just after midnight Friday include $30 off Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home smart-home device, a $1,120 discount on a Samsung 60-inch HD TV and activewear starting at $5. Electronic gadgets and athleisure are expected to remain popular items this holiday season.The National Retail Federation said that 137.4 million U.S. consumers plan to go shopping on Thanksgiving weekend, either online or in-store, with 36% of shoppers looking to shop on Cyber Monday, up from 34% last year.""Black Friday remains one of the busiest shopping days of the year, with Americans planning to take advantage of aggressive in-store and digital promotions over the entire holiday weekend,"" said NRF CEO Matthew Shay in a release last week.IBD'S TAKE: Adobe data indicate that Black Friday sales will be the ""biggest ever,"" growing 11.3% from last year to $3.05 billion in sales. For a look at what else is happening this week, check out IBD's Investing Action Plan. As brick-and-mortar stores nudge Black Friday into Thanksgiving Day, it seems unsurprising that Cyber Monday deals would creep into a day reserved for in-store promotions.Wal-Mart has been beefing up its online sales efforts to become a bigger rival to Amazon.com (AMZN). Wal-Mart reported strong e-commerce growth in last week's earnings report, but overall sales fell short.Wal-Mart shares climbed 1.2% to close at 69.37 on the stock market today. Amazon was up 2.6% to 780. Alphabet advanced 1.1% to 784.80.RELATED:Wal-Mart Q3 Sales Miss Despite Online Boom

472,HD,"When the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on June 15, among the stated reasons was concern about Brexit just a week ahead of the United Kingdom's fateful vote.Minutes of that meeting show that rate-setting committee members discussed the magnitude of the effect on financial markets from a U.K. vote to leave the European Union.""It is a decision that could have consequences for economic and financial conditions in global financial markets,"" Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in her post-meeting press conference. ""If it does so, it could have consequences in turn for the U.S. economic outlook that would be a factor in deciding on the appropriate path of policy.""The same might be said of the coming U.S. election. Economists and market analysts have estimated that a victory by Donald Trump could send major indexes down 5% to 12% and emerging market currencies, particularly Mexico's, could take a hit.(Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied at 44% in the latest IBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll, after Clinton led by four points as of last Friday, when the FBI announced it was investigating new emails related to Clinton's email scandal.)Yet it's a safe bet that the Fed's decision Wednesday won't be guided by a candid discussion of the impact of a Trump victory. The GOP nominee has already criticized Yellen for letting politics determine the easier-than-expected path of policy. While there's ample reason to doubt that charge, contributions to Hillary Clinton's campaign by Lael Brainard, a leading dove and possible Clinton treasury secretary, have put the Fed in the political spotlight and risked undermining its reputation for independence.The Fed can avoid that uncomfortable conversation for now because there's never been a chance of a rate hike so close to next week's election. The real question is how a Trump victory could alter the chances of a hike in December. Odds have fallen from all-but-certain territory as Trump's electoral odds have improved since the FBI bombshell. The CME Group's FedWatch tool now shows 69.1% odds of a rate hike next month, down from roughly 85% last week.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks have fallen, gold prices have soared and the dollar has retreated in recent days, as the FBI reveals more evidence that stocks will fall if Trump wins.The 10-year Treasury yield and dollar both surged before Trump's rebound, as the Fed moved toward hiking rates even as other global central banks are still in easing mode for the foreseeable future. The rise in rates has been a modest negative for interest-rate sensitive sectors. Shares of Ford Motor (F) are close to a four-year low, while Home Depot (HD) shares are near an eight-month low.Meanwhile, the dollar's strengthening boded poorly for U.S. multinationals like General Electric (GE), which is close to an eight-month low after curbing its full-year earnings guidance as the dollar's rise cuts 6 cents per share from its bottom line.But now investors have bigger concerns, even as yields have come down and the dollar has lost a bit of the ground it gained on other major currencies last month. While the actual policies that Trump will implement as president are difficult to predict because he's unpredictable and they will require the backing of Congress, his threats of tariffs, walking away from Nafta and an immigration crackdown are making investors nervous.RELATED:FBI Reveals More Evidence That Stocks Will Fall If Trump WinsFed Keeps Rates Steady, Signals Slower Rate Hike Future

The Dow industrials, after the prior week's postelection spike to a record high, rose just a fraction. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, also close to record highs. Bank stocks moved sideways or higher as Treasury yields dipped initially but then rose again. Some fiber-optic, chip and cybersecurity stocks broke out.Fed chief Janet Yellen said that a rate hike would be ""appropriate relatively soon."" She stressed the risks of delaying a move but also didn't sound like the central bank would follow up with a series of tightening steps. Yellen said she intends to serve out her term through January 2018, despite criticism from President-elect Trump during the campaign. Meanwhile, economic data were strong. Jobless claims tumbled to a 43-year low, housing starts spiked to a nine-year high and retail sales were robust heading into the key holiday shopping season. Consumer inflation hit a 2-year high, though it remains relatively low.RELATED:Fed's Yellen: Rate Hike 'Soon,' Will Serve Full TermTech unicorn Snap, owner of the popular short-duration photo and video site Snapchat, reportedly filed for a confidential IPO.

477,HD,"Retail sales rose 0.8% in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday morning, providing fresh evidence of consumer strength. Retail stocks have rebounded after the election and heading into the holiday season, though many pulled back Tuesday.Sales also rose 0.8% excluding autos and 0.6% excluding autos and gasoline.Economists had expected retail sales to rise 0.6% with sales up 0.5% ex autos and 0.3% excluding autos and gasoline.Meanwhile, September figures were revised up, with total sales now up 1% vs. 0.6% initially. Ex auto sales were revised up two-tenths to 0.7%, whith ex auto and gas sales revised up two-tenths to 0.5%.Auto dealers, grocery stores, restaurants, apparel chains reported solid gains, with gas station sales jumping on higher fuel prices.Year over year, retail sales rose 4.3%, the best since November 2014.The recent gains in retail sales are a good sign for the U.S. economy and holiday shopping. And it comes amid big gains in retail stocks, though several notable retailers fell after reporting earnings Tuesday morning.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX) reported earnings before Tuesday's open. Home Depot and TJX topped views and raised their outlooks but fell nearly 2% in morning trade on the stock market today. TJX edged higher. Dick's Sporting Goods tumbled 7% on weak holiday guidance.Home Depot and TJX found resistance at the 200-day moving average on Monday, reversing to close down nearly 2%. Dick's nearly broke out of a base Monday, but that doesn't seem likely Tuesday.Department store sales fell once again in the retail sales report, but the department store stocks are rebounding from downtrends. Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) reported strong results, Macy's (M) missed but raised full-year guidance while JCPenney (JCP) gave generally weak results. But all four enjoyed double-digit gains last week, and continued to climb Monday. They pulled back on Tuesday, retreating 1%-3% in morning trade.E-commerce and other nonstore sales jumped 1.5% in October, the best gain since May. The sector has been a big retail leader for years. But Amazon (AMZN) shares have been selling off hard since reporting weaker-than-expected profit growth on Oct. 27. Amazon profit tripled (up 206%), but fell well short of views. Amazon also gave cautious holiday guidance.Amazon stock fell 2.7% Monday, approaching its 200-day line. But Amazon rose 2.6% before Tuesday's opening bell.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's surprise presidential win has boosted blue chips and small caps. Here's the case for a Trump bull market.Meanwhile, it's unclear what holiday shoppers will be buying in stores or online. It does not appear to be a blowout year for gadgets. Apple (AAPL) has the iPhone 7 and other new products. But Apple missed sales estimates in the latest quarter and gave a conservative outlook, even with Samsung reeling from its Note 7 overheating fiasco.Fitbit (FIT) issued a dismal holiday sales forecast, though the wearables maker may face tougher competition from the Apple Watch 2.

478,HD,"Will it be a blue Christmas for consumer electronics vendors?Recent downbeat guidance from Fitbit (FIT) and GoPro (GPRO) points to a crummy holiday season for those gadget makers. The big question is whether other consumer electronics vendors will end up with coal in their stockings this quarter.Consumer electronics is a top sales category for the holidays. And it could be that Fitbit wearable activity trackers and GoPro action cameras have simply fallen out of favor with shoppers.As retailers and device makers prepare for the traditional kickoff of the holiday selling season on Black Friday, analysts are placing their bets on what the big gadgets will be this Christmas.Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) likely will provide some commentary on what it sees as big sellers in the December quarter, when it releases fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday before the market open.IBD'S TAKE: Institutional money was rotating into new sectors after a wacky few days for stock markets following Donald Trump's surprise presidential win, but one thing remained constant: Facebook continued to be an IBD Leaderboard stock. This is the place to go to find leading stocks, which includes the social network leader even though a 5.6% drop on Nov. 3 triggered a sell signal for some investors. But it's more complex than that, as Leaderboard can explain.This past Thursday, Best Buy revealed its Thanksgiving weekend door-buster specials designed to entice consumers to come to its stores. It's offering steep discounts on 4K ultrahigh-definition televisions from the likes of LG, Samsung and Sony (SNE); ultraportable notebook PCs from Microsoft (MSFT), HP (HPQ) and others; and video game consoles bundled with software.The Consumer Technology Association predicts that U.S. holiday spending — covering all of November and December — on tech products will rise 3.1% this year to $36.05 billion, after rising just 1.4% last year.CTA Chief Economist Shawn DuBravac told IBD that retailers and consumer electronics makers waited until after the presidential election to begin advertising for the holiday season.The most popular tech item on holiday shopping lists this year is headphones, driven by the shift to wireless audio devices, DuBravac said. Other desired tech gifts include laptops, TVs, smartphones, tablets and video game consoles.Some 40% of shoppers plan to buy headphones as gifts this holiday season, according to a CTA survey.Apple (AAPL) has helped fuel the move to wireless headsets with its bold decision not to include an analog audio port on its iPhone 7 smartphones. It is selling Beats brand wireless headphones and will soon debut its AirPods wireless earbuds.Several vendors are looking to take on Bose this holiday in the subcategory of noise-canceling wireless headphones, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News, told IBD.Bose released its QuietComfort 35 headphones for $349 in June. Sony followed in September with its MDR 1000X headphones for $399. And Plantronics (PLT) released its BackBeat Pro 2 headphones for $199 in October.""Those are not inexpensive gifts, but they're really good gifts to give anyone who travels,"" Costello said. Headphones are a no-brainer gift ""because everyone has ears,"" she said.Emerging product categories likely to see a boost in sales this year are drones, virtual reality headsets and smart home devices, DuBravac said.The CTA predicts about 1.2 million drones will be sold this holiday season, up 112% over 2015. That's despite the fact that GoPro issued a product recall and stopped sales of its just-released Karma drone. Market leader DJI is likely to benefit from consumer demand for flying-camera drones, such as its Mavic Pro quadcopter.The trade group forecasts sales of 700,000 VR headsets this holiday season. Those include premium VR headsets from Sony and Facebook's (FB) Oculus unit, as well as lower-cost smartphone-based headsets from Samsung and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google.But NPD analyst Stephen Baker expects VR headset sales will be ""lukewarm"" this holiday season. ""VR will elicit a tepid response from consumers,"" he said in a report.The CTA also is looking for higher sales of smart-home devices this season, including voice-activated digital assistants such as Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo and Google Home.Voice-enabled smart speakers that can play music on command, answer spoken questions and perform other tasks will be in high demand this holiday, NPD's Baker said.Ultra HD, or 4K, televisions will dominate Black Friday and Thanksgiving weekend sales, Baker said. Such TVs, led by sales of sets with screen sizes of 55 inches and larger, will account for 60% of TV dollars spent this holiday, he said.Holiday shipments of 4K TVs in the U.S. are expected to reach 4.5 million units, the CTA said. The trade group predicts full-year sales of 4K TVs will rise 40% over 2015 to hit 10 million units.PC sales, meanwhile, will be the best in at least four years this holiday as consumers upgrade to sleek new models, Baker said.Among product categories likely to disappoint this holiday is wearables, Baker said.""While prices for wearables may begin to decrease (especially in the fitness segment where competition is growing), expect a slight slowdown in sales as consumer interest fades,"" Baker said. That would be bad news for market leader Fitbit, which provided weak Q4 guidance.Another category facing a slowdown is action cameras, a market dominated by GoPro with its Hero cameras. The market for wearable sports cameras has matured and sales overall are poised to decline, DuBravac said.Other new products hoping to make a splash this holiday season are Snapchat's Spectacles, $130 sunglasses with a built-in camera; Apple's second-generation Apple Watch with new fitness features; and upgraded versions of existing game consoles, including Microsoft's Xbox One S and Sony's PlayStation 4 Pro and PS4 Slim.RELATED:Google Home To Overtake Amazon's Smart Echo By 2020: IHSSony PlayStation VR Aims To Make Virtual Reality MainstreamTeens Stoked About iPhone 7, But GoPro Is So Yesterday

480,HD,"Stocks shaved a small chunk of their intraday losses with an hour left in Wednesday's session. Bargain hunters swooped in after the Federal Reserve announced -- without surprise to investors -- no change in the fed funds rate it charges on overnight loans to Wall Street banks.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, showed its mettle with a nearly 0.5% gain to 111.40, holding mildly above a 110.33 cup with handle breakout point.However, two members of the policy committee, Esther George of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank and Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed, voted against the action, as they both argued instead for a 25-basis-point hike in the rate. The current fed funds rate is in a target range of 0.25% to 0.5%.The Nasdaq composite, down as much as 0.9% just after 2 p.m. ET, cut the loss to around 0.7%.The S&P 500 rebounded to trade less than 0.5% lower. The 2100 level may be acting as a support level, but the 50-day moving average, which has been sloping lower for nearly four weeks, continues to cap the large-cap index's recent rally attempts.The Dow Jones industrials is outperforming the other key indexes, down less than 0.3% and getting a boost by a 1.1% gain by 3M (MMM) as well as modest gains from Apple and Home Depot (HD). Small caps continued to bleed more red, with the Russell 2000 down nearly 1%.Fellow Dow 30 component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) cut early losses and was down just 0.4% at 68.69, up from a recent breakout from a bottoming base at 65.08.The 65.08 entry derives from adding 10 cents to a handle that formed on a long cup base. Last month, the Wall Street bank and consumer lending institution reported its best quarter in years as earnings grew 20% on a 10% revenue jump.JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley (MS) was off 1.4% to 32.89, still up 1% past a 32.47 handle buy point, while Citigroup (C), down 0.9% in slow turnover to 48.49, was clinging to minute gains from a breakout at 48.28.Apple initially broke out on Sept. 14 and gained nearly 8% before pulling back. So far, the decline appears normal, particularly during a stock market as choppy as today.The iPhone company has benefited by a tragic misstep by rival Samsung Electronic in its battery problems with the Galaxy Note big-format smartphone, which the South Korean company has decided to discontinue.Apple has unveiled a new refresh of its Macbook computers that have a new touch bar feature at the top of the keyboard, making it easy for users to apply emoji icons and other commands into emails and messages. Apple watchers are also speculating that next year's iPhone 8 will include new features such as wireless charging. In other words, the company continues to innovate relentlessly.Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings in the December-ending first quarter to decline just 2% to $3.22 a share, an improvement from year-over-year declines of -18%, -23% and -15% in the prior three quarters.Also in the stock market today, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continues to slump after holding in a range of 190 to 215 for months. The stock fell 1% to 188.90 and is near taking out its June 27 low of 187.87.FleetCor Technologies (FLT) sold off, gapping down at the open and falling more than 12% and hit as low as 149.21 before rebounding a tad. The former growth stock leader saw turnover surge more than six times usual levels and gave back all of its gains since an Aug. 3 breakout sent the stock past a 152.83 double bottom with handle buy point.The fuel card technology firm, serving the trucking industry, posted a 15% increase in earnings to $1.92 a share, narrowly edging the Street's view, as revenue rose 7% to $484.4 million. Perhaps the recent fall in crude oil prices are dampening investors' expectation of future demand for FleetCor's fuel cost efficiency-boosting services.RELATED:Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged, Awaits 'Further Evidence'What Is The Bottoming Base Chart Pattern, And How Does Help Investors Make Money?When Did Citigroup Break Out?When Was The Right Time To Buy Apple Shares?

481,HD,"More than 9 million posts on Facebook's (FB) Instagram get the hashtag #selfiesunday, 6 million-plus are marked #selfienation, about 275 million are tagged #selfie, and 302 million are simply tagged #me.So is it any surprise that products like Make Up For Ever's ""Ultra HD"" foundation, Temptu's airbrush foundation kits, or Pur Cosmetics' ""Love Your Selfie"" palette exist?""Millennials have a mindset of being 'selfie-ready,'"" Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. That has helped drive lip and eye products to become two of the best-performing cosmetic categories for the last three years, she says, highlighting that the beauty sector's growth tracks ""almost exactly"" with the rise of smartphones and mobile devices.Camera-friendly cosmetics — once the realm of news anchors and movie stars — are now mainstays at specialty beauty stores Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora. But as Amazon (AMZN) continues to suck up more dollars from consumers, brick-and-mortar chains are increasingly latching on to the social media-driven fire for cosmetics and skin care products, which are proving to be a glimmer of hope for a surprising range of shops trying to lure Instagram-savvy shoppers.Last year, cosmetics, skin care and fragrance made up a $37.7 billion market in the U.S. vs. $266.8 billion in apparel and footwear sales, according to Euromonitor research. But beauty has been the fastest-growing retail segment for at least the last three years, outpacing apparel, footwear, food, in addition to being one of the fastest-growing segments online, said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.Echoing that trend, Ulta continues to crank out double-digit same-store sales gains — 14.4% in its most recent quarter — while the Gap (GPS) and Macy's (M) each posted comps of negative 2% in their latest reports, while Nordstrom (JWN) reported a 1.2% decline. Their respective stocks have followed the diverging sales trajectories as well.IBD'S TAKE: Robust and reliable growth appeals to institutional investors, so it's not surprising that Ulta has seen eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Plus, four typically better-performing mutual funds have reported a position in the stock.The major chains have taken notice, and are looking for a makeover with some social-media flair.Retail icon Macy's, which by Cowen & Co.'s estimates will be overtaken by Amazon next year as the biggest U.S. clothing seller, is planning to open more in-store locations of luxury beauty retailer Bluemercury, a 2015 acquisition, and is expanding its brand assortment beyond traditional prestige names to include smaller labels.And for any shoppers who bought $35 in Rampage accessories, the nation's largest department store also recently offered a free selfie stick.""Beauty is the new hoodie, in terms of being a product that works well with social media,"" said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, noting that retailers are looking for categories that are less vulnerable to promotions and unseasonable weather. ""You can't deny the power of social media. On average, someone will spend over 15 hours a week on social media.""Social media help shape and stimulate new trends, he added, as well as educate others about those trends. Makeup lovers now scour Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube for contouring tips and skim hashtags for brow-shaping tutorials from the seemingly endless parade of self-appointed beauty gurus with a domain name and an Instagram account.Department store beauty counters remain a fixture but are in particular danger of losing relevance in this digital age. NPD Group said that compared to two years ago, 11% more women are doing cosmetics product research online.By the time the customer enters the store, she's frequently past the product research stage, says Wissink. ""She walks in, she says 'I need palette 212,' and (the salesperson) goes 'Wait a second, don't you want to see our lip, our eye (products)?'""The social-media driven shift in habits means retail heavyweights have to enhance the store experience. In fact, chains that previously had no service aspect are adopting in-house experts to guide customers through the beauty aisle.For example, CVS Health (CVS) now has in-store beauty consultants and last year upgraded its makeup and skin care offerings in a few thousand locations. In its August earnings call, CEO Larry Merlo said the drugstore chain was focused on shifting its assortment toward health, beauty and store brands, all of which are higher-margin segments.And Target (TGT) features a ""beauty concierge,"" clad entirely in black and available to answer questions about the big-box retailer's brands.""It's meant to create retail theater,"" said Wissink, noting that customers ""crave that tactile in-store experience.""Shoppers enjoy sampling new products in store, and the quest for a Holy Grail blush can become a day out with the girls. In the process, it's not uncommon to snap a selfie and send it to a friend — or to Twitter (TWTR) followers — for immediate feedback.For their part, premium brands like Estee Lauder and Clinique are loosening their grip on exclusivity as they accept that shoppers like to sample different brands from a variety of retailers.They've broadened their distribution to specialty retailers like Ulta and lower-tier department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP), which nixed creating a whole new in-store beauty experience in lieu of bringing in an already-successful titan: Sephora.Its in-store Sephora locations were among the department store's top-performing divisions, the company said in its Q2 earnings release in August, and there are plans for more Sephora shop-in-shops to drive beauty-revenue growth.""Seems like everyone's trying to get a piece of that pie,"" said FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""It's working, at least for Sephora and Ulta, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon.""And as beauty products increasingly drive traffic to stores, chains that traditionally haven't sold them are now testing them out.A Barnes & Noble store seems like a peculiar place to open up a beauty counter, but it may be inclined to seize trends early, given that Amazon laid waste to book sellers.The Glossary, as it is cleverly called, is a college-focused shop-in-shop stocked full of makeup and skin care products from Smashbox, Burt's Bees and other millennial-friendly brands, not far from the Jane Austen paperbacks and math textbooks needed to survive freshman year. Barnes & Noble College — a subsidiary of Barnes & Noble Education (BNED) -- has rolled out the pilot program at a handful of locations, including Emory University, Southern Methodist University and the University of California at Riverside.""(It's) similar to what they did a few years ago with coffee shops,"" said NPD's Grant. Barnes & Noble wants shoppers ""to browse, to know that they can hang out."" After all, the longer retailers can get customers to stay in the store, she said, the better the chances of them buying something.Apparel stores like Urban Outfitters (URBN) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) are also cultivating nascent beauty offerings. Teen retailers have broadly been trying to reconfigure their identities now that their millennial consumer base has grown up and out of midaughts trends.Urban's curated ""Back-to-School Beauty"" collection showcases a small mix of products, including trendy Korean brand Tonymoly and uberhip Milk Makeup. (Besides select Urban Outfitters, the only other place to buy Milk in a store is Sephora.) In its mid-August earnings call, Urban Outfitters management called out the strength of its beauty segment, as well as its home and intimates divisions.American Eagle's foray into the beauty space has been more hesitant, though it may have more up its sleeve. Its Aerie Global Brand President Jennifer Foyle noted in American Eagle's May earnings call that the company has assembled a team ""to venture into the beauty business, but we are going to walk before we run."" It, too, sells Tonymoly face masks, plus some assorted Aerie-branded lotions and body washes.Rolling out new display cases is one thing, but building up a healthy following on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram is another.Out of all of its department store brethren, Nordstrom has the strongest social presence, with 2.1 million Instagram followers to Bloomingdales' paltry 608,000 and J.C. Penney's 300,000 follower count. It was one of the first major companies to incorporate Like2Buy into its Instagram profile, allowing customers to click through and buy the pictured products.All of them pale in comparison to Sephora's 8.8 million followers and Ulta Beauty's 2.4 million Instagram devotees. Still, the department stores are seeing progress at the cash register.Nordstrom's summer ""Glam-Out Days"" offered free makeup tips and services during its yearly ""anniversary sale"" event. According to Piper Jaffray research, beauty products had the highest sellout rate during the promotional period, with 51% of Nordstrom's makeup and skin care products selling out, up from 30% last year and 8% in 2014.""One of the things that makes beauty important within department stores is (that) it's a gateway,"" said Grant. ""It helps the retailer attract other consumers, whether it's apparel or footwear. One of the things they've used the beauty space to do is carve out new consumers or drive traffic through the rest of the store.""RELATED:Beauty's A Hot Industry, But Does That Make E.L.F.

482,HD,"The stock indexes were off session lows in afternoon trading Wednesday, as Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) led a sell-off in organic-food stocks, but PayPal (PYPL) fortified broad gains in financials.The Nasdaq was down 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were each off 0.2%. Apple (AAPL), a major component of the main indexes, was little changed in the stock market today when it announced what's expected to be a new iPhone model.Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE. Despite index losses, winning stocks led losers by 7-to-5 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Sprouts Farmers Market gapped down to a 13% loss in huge volume, touching the lowest level in more than a year. The company warned that same-store sales in Q3 will be flat, and it forecast full-year comps growth of 1.5% to 2.5%. Analysts had expected closer to 4% comps growth in Q3 and the full year. The natural-foods grocery chain's forecast for full-year profit of 83 to 86 cents also was below views for 94 cents.The company sees weak pricing. ""The prolonged deflationary environment, competitive landscape and industry dynamics have prompted heavy promotions across the industry, adversely impacting retail deflation and traffic generation,"" it said.The news sparked selling in related stocks.Natural and organic-foods wholesaler United Natural Foods (UNFI) fell 4.5% to the lowest level since mid-June. United Natural reports earnings Monday after the close. Whole Foods Market (WFM), a longtime laggard stock, gapped down 5% to a four-month low.In other retail, Casey's General Stores (CASY) plunged 10% in huge volume after the chain missed profit expectations for its July-ended quarter. The company earned $1.70 a share, an increase of 8%, while sales fell 4% to $1.97 billion. It was the seventh straight decline in quarterly sales. Wednesday's plunge ruined a chart that had been shaping up well for Casey's, which was forming a base-on-base pattern.The financial sector performed much better Wednesday, with credit-card firms, payment processors, real estate investment trusts, some banks, and savings and loans bucking the market's decline.PayPal shot up more than 3% in active trading after the payment processing firm announced an agreement with MasterCard (MA) that makes it easier for PayPal users to pay with MasterCard. PayPal users also will be able to select a MasterCard as a default payment option, and they'll be able to transfer money to their MasterCard debit cards instantly.PayPay climbed back above its 50-day moving average as it works on a new pattern. MasterCard, which is forming a base with a 100.10 buy point, rose a fraction.Tempur Sealy (TPX) broke out of a large cup-with-handle base, clearing an 80.88 buy point. But volume was only about average for the maker of mattresses and bedding products. Despite a deep stock correction of nearly 40%, Tempur Sealy has a top IBD Composite Rating.RELATED:Western Digital Ups Targets, HD Supply Outlook Weak, Sprouts WarnsApple iPhone 7 Leaks Point To Waterproofing, New Colors, Better Cameras

Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management reported Tuesday evening it held a 9.9% stake in Chipotle, valued near $1.2 billion at Tuesday's close.Western Digital (WDC) popped 7% after the disk-drive maker raised its fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue guidance to above consensus forecasts. Western Digital closed on its $19 billion acquisition of flash-drive leader SanDisk in May. Seagate Technologies (STX) caught some sympathy lift from investors, posting a 3% gain.Houston-based Apache (APA) leapt 14% at the open. The company announced the discovery of a new gas-rich resource play, named Alpine High, for which it has accumulated leasing rights to 352,000 gross acres in Reeves County, Texas. Apache has been finding support at its 40-week moving average, but resistance at its 10-week line has kept it from turning up the right side of a 14-week consolidation.IBD 50 stock Dave & Buster's (PLAY) took an early hit, down 4% after reporting above-forecast earnings and revenue for its second quarter, but lowering its full-year comparable-store sales guidance.

Housing starts were strong but permits flat in what was a mixed report for the nation's housing sector.Jared Wiesel, a partner from Revenue Analytics, a consulting firm, said although Home Depot's results weren't all that strong vs. estimates, the raw numbers pointed to continued growth.""It was a good quarter from a pure performance standpoint vs. Wall Street expectations,"" he said. He later added: ""To get 5% comparable store sales is pretty strong. And there are a number of economic indicators helping them. Housing is a tailwind. And low gas prices free up discretionary income for consumers.""IBD'S TAKE: Home Depot's stock boasts an 82 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 82% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.

485,HD,"Stocks accelerated losses as they approached the midday mark Wednesday, with investors nervously awaiting release of the Federal Reserve's July 17 meeting.The minutes will be parsed for clues as to whether an interest-rate increase is on the table for the remainder of the year. The markets are skeptical.Traders in fed funds futures are pricing in an 18% chance of a rate increase at the Sept. 21 meeting, 19.3% at the Nov. 2 meeting and 42.6% odds at the Dec. 14 meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were down 0.4%, with the Nasdaq not far behind with a 0.3% deficit.

"
486,HD,"Stocks continue to grind sideways, while the latest run of retail earnings, including Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) didn't offer much clarity on consumers. Cisco Systems (CSCO) offered job cuts and a weak outlook. But Chinese internet stocks continue to deliver robust earnings, while oil made a strong advance.The major averages moved sideways, closing little changed. The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, grinding out its eighth straight weekly gain. The S&P 500 fell less than one point and the Dow lost 0.1%. Several Federal Reserve officials made hawkish hints, insisting a September hike was in play. While markets doubt that, the comments did have an effect. Energy stocks were strong as oil prices rallied. Retailers generally rose, led by Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST), though TJX Cos. (TJX) was among the losers. Cisco Systems cut jobs and its outlook. Tencent (TCEHY) led a slew of  top-rated China internet stocks reporting earnings.Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose above $50 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude prices shot up 9.1% for the week to $48.52 a barrel. Buzz about a new push for an oil production freeze among OPEC and large non-OPEC producers helped lift prices. But Saudi Arabia is raising production to meet domestic demand, and Iran hasn't made a decision on joining the informal freeze talks in September.Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the first time in four weeks, with gasoline supplies also down. But U.S. production rose. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for an eighth straight week to a six-month high.Cisco Systems said it will slash 5,500 jobs, or 7% of its workforce, as it continues to shift from hardware to software and services. Cisco topped fiscal Q4 views while sales edged higher. But Cisco's current-quarter EPS and revenue targets were below forecasts. Cisco stock on Monday had its highest close since late 2007, but it went on to fall 1.1% for the week.IBD'S TAKE: While Cisco revenue barely rises, fiber-optic component makers are booming amid strong demand from telecoms, internet giants and China. Acacia Communications shares have skyrocketed since their May IPO. Learn what Acacia CEO Raj Shanmugaraj has to say about the so-called fiber optic ""super cycle"" in a recent IBD interview.Wal-Mart earned $1.07 a share, a penny below a year earlier but beating views. Revenue increased slightly as U.S. same-store rose again and e-commerce growth picked up. The brick-and-mortar retail giant emphasized digital marketing after buying Jet.com this month for $3.3 billion, as it tries to fend off Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba (BABA) and other online retailers.Rival discounter Target (TGT) beat profit views, but sales fell short as Apple (AAPL) product sales fell 20%. Target cut full-year EPS guidance, citing a ""challenging environment"" in the back half of the year.Wal-Mart shares hit a 14-month high on Thursday, but closed the week down 1.5%, back below the 50-day line, while Target lost 7.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should focus on the true leaders. While brick and mortar retailers work hard to achieve sluggish growth, Amazon and Alibaba are delivering strong and accelerating revenue gains.

But Home Depot raised its full-year EPS view as it still benefits from a housing ""tailwind."" Meanwhile, smaller rival Lowe's (LOW) missed on the top and bottom lines. Lowe's same-store sales growth was just half of Home Depot's. Home Depot briefly topped a buy point closed the week off 0.8%. Lowe's tumbled 4.8%.Ross Stores late Thursday earned 71 cents a share, up 13%, while sales climbed 7% to $3.18 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 71 cents and sales of $3.18 billion. Same-store sales rose 4%. The off-price apparel chain raised full-year EPS guidance. Meanwhile, off-price peer TJX on Tuesday topped Q2 EPS and sales views, but it gave cautious guidance.Ross Stores rose 3.5% to 65.06 on Friday and 3.1% for the week, becoming extended from a 59.78 buy point cleared last month. TJX is down 4.25% for the week, tumbling through a buy point that it cleared a month ago.Ford Motor (F) said it hopes to have a fully autonomous vehicle in five years, echoing a similar 2021 target from a BMW (BMWYY), Mobileye (MBLY) and Intel (INTC) joint effort. Meanwhile, Uber later this month will offer ride-hailing services using self-driving Volvo SUVs, with a human driver ready at the wheel. It's part of a $300 million Uber-Volvo alliance.NetEase (NTES) and Tencent Holdings, China's two largest internet gaming companies, both reported strong quarterly results that soundly beat estimates.Tencent, which is also a leader in mobile messaging, said revenue rose 52% to $5.38 billion, as EPS rose 45% to 17 cents. Tencent revenue growth accelerated to a three-year high. Its U.S. shares rose 8.3%, hitting fresh highs.NetEase reported revenue of $1.47 billion, up 96% in local currency year over year, as EPS rose 91% to $3.67. NetEase stock hit a high early in the week, but it fell Thursday after the results. It rose 1.9% for the week.China is now the world's largest online game market, but NetEase and Tencent have opportunities to expand further. China has the world's largest internet user population, at 686 million, yet the market is still estimated to be only about half penetrated, vs. roughly 90% for the U.S.In the previous week, Alibaba and JD.com, China's two largest e-commerce retailers, both posted double-digit growth in revenue and earnings that topped estimates.Some youth-oriented apparel chains reported strong results.Children's Place (PLCE) posted a smaller-than-expected loss and a slim revenue gain. Children's Place also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $4.60-$4.70 from an earlier outlook of $4.17-$4.27. Shares rose 4.4%, hitting a record high.American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) delivered a 35% quarterly EPS jump, while sales' 3% gain edged past views. Same-store sales rose just 3% though.

Shares shot up 23% to a 15-month high.Intel (INTC) is throwing down the gauntlet with a ""merged reality"" headset that eliminates cords and controllers, rivaling efforts by Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Facebook (FB) and HTC. The chipmaker announced the move during the annual Intel Developer Conference in San Francisco, Calif. The conference saw a record 6,000 in attendance and featured news that Intel is partnering with longtime rival ARM Holdings (ARMH) to make some of its mobile and Internet of Things chips.The Justice Department said it would phase out its use of privately run prisons, arguing that the government is better equipped for the job. Private prisons ""do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs ... they do not maintain the same level of safety and security,"" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said in a memo. GEO Group (GEO) plunged nearly 40% on Thursday, and Corrections Corp. of America (CXW) 35%, both hitting multiyear lows.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) all beat quarterly earnings views, though Hibbett's sales fell short. Dick's and Hibbett are dealing with the fallout from the liquidation of rival Sports Authority. Dick's won a bankruptcy bidding war for some Sports Authority assets earlier this year.Dicks' stock hit a record high, up 7.5% for the week. Foot Locker rose 12%. Hibbett Sports fell 0.7% in a volatile week.

487,HD,"Stocks ended the week with decent gains Friday, cheered by a so-so August jobs report. Apple (AAPL) was a top percentage gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, up 0.9%, ahead of its Sept. 7 press event where it's widely expected to introduce a new iPhone. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) outperformed in the Nasdaq 100, rising 1.5% to 42.81 as it vies for a breakout from a flat base with a 43.15 buy point.The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite ended with gains of around 0.4%. Small caps outperformed with the Russell 2000 up 0.9%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in lower than Thursday's levels ahead of the long weekend. The stock market will be closed Monday in observance of Labor Day.The economy created 151,000 jobs in August, a bit below the consensus estimate of 175,000. The unemployment rate held steady of 4.9%. The new data lowered the chances of a rate hike at the Sept. 21 Fed meeting to around 21%. The chances for a hike at the Dec. 14 meeting are now at 54%.Separately, a fresh IBD/TIPP poll showed a virtual dead head between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.In the stock market today, gold miners outperformed for the second straight session, but top performers like Franco Nevada (FNV) and Royal Gold (RGLD)are still stuck below their 50-day moving averages.China names got attention as names like Sina (SINA), Momo (MOMO), Yirendai (YRD) and New Oriental Education (EDU) closed solidly higher in fast trade.IBD's TAKE: Bullish fundamentals are fueling gains for many leading growth stocks in China. To learn why earnings growth is so important for a stock's success, visit IBD University.HD Supply (HDS) rallied nearly 2% ahead of its upcoming earnings report. Results are due Wednesday before the open. It's currently working on flat base with a 37.09 buy point.

"
488,HD,"It's been awhile since a Target-level security breach erupted, but make no mistake, by many key measures network security breaches continue to rise.The number of reported breaches actually fell March through July compared with the previous five months, yet breaches are up 16% in 2016 through July vs. the year-earlier period, says Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski. He says the trend will equate to robust spending on security software in the second half of 2016.Publicly reported breaches are only ""the tip of the iceberg,"" Nowinski told IBD. There's an underworld of hacking activity that doesn't get disclosed or that disclosure laws don't always touch. Ransomware, malware and social engineering -- hacking du jour today -- aren't always disclosed.""Breach activity is definitely increasing on a year-over-year basis, but the breaches are smaller than they were,"" he said. ""The increase in breaches should translate to increasing revenue growth (for security vendors) in the back half of 2016 and early 2017.""Cybersecurity stocks are on an upswing following a Q1 crash that saw IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group touch a 15-month low of 1484 on Feb. 9. Since then, the group has risen more than 40% and has climbed to No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, from No. 191 just 13 weeks ago. The group, though, is down 6% this year.The group is led by CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Qualys (QLYS), which both have IBD Composite Ratings of 98 (99 is the highest possible).IBD'S TAKE: CyberArk Software is among a number of Israeli tech companies traded in the U.S. As the world economy expands, investors are advised to keep a broad lookout for winners. One way to do this is to track the IBD Global Leaders list, which currently includes CyberArk among its 10 companies.Wall Street, in general, recognizes there will be flux in the breach environment, says Caleb Barlow, a vice president for IBM (IBM) Security. He says credit-card fraud soared in 2014 and plummeted in 2015. But then came a big jump in health care industry breaches last year, he told IBD.Health care hacks accounted for 49% of the total in July, up from 31% in June, says Nowinski. The health care field had the most breaches that month, but breaches at businesses were No. 2, accounting for 35% of total breaches.Health care data can be coveted by the bad guys, Barlow says. He expects an increase in ransomware and social-engineering attacks for the sector, saying it can be years before these attacks become apparent. For that and other reasons, he says breach data are only a general barometer for the industry.""Bad guys are often in the system for a year before people realize it,"" he told IBD. ""So we don't know yet.""Still, he says it's possible that one in three U.S. residents have had at least some health care data lost to breaches.Entrepreneurial bad actors forced 55 breaches exposing more than 590,000 records in July, down from 67 breaches and 5.7 million records in July 2015, with both months below the historical average of 69 breaches, Nowinski wrote in an Aug. 15 research report.March and April saw more breaches than usual, he said, helping offset the big breaches in 2015 that hit health insurer Anthem (ATHM) and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Big 2014 breaches including those at retailer Home Depot (HD) and at bank JPMorgan (JPM). Retail chain Target (TGT) discovered its major breach of customer data in December 2013.July wasn't wracked by a ""mega-breach"" -- a breach that exposes more than 10 million records-- but the breach of Athens Orthopedic Clinic in Georgia resulted in 397,000 online medical records unleashed. That was the largest-known breach in the past three months, Nowinski says.This year has seen some big breaches, though no big headline grabbers, led by attacks on the Office of Child Support Enforcement, 21st Century Oncology and Verizon Enterprise Solutions (a unit of Verizon Communications (VZ)). Through July, there have been 569 reported breaches this year in the U.S., up from 492 in the first seven months of last year, says Nowinski.""Total breach activity is actually increasing, albeit at a slower pace than a few months ago,"" Nowinski said.But Germany-based cable manufacturer Leoni in August announced it had fallen victim to a sophisticated attack, losing about $44 million in the process.Dan Wiley, head of incident response at security software vendor Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), likens the threat landscape to a balloon.""You squeeze it at one point and it moves to an equal opposite area,"" Wiley told IBD. Credit-card fraud has plummeted as banks have invested in strong chip-card/EMV technology and mobile wallets from the likes of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Samsung improve security. So, he says, bad actors are switching tactics.""A lot of the financial gains for credit-card fraud have changed,"" he said. ""And the attackers are doing other things like ransomware, or cloning of cars or NFC (near-field communication) card hijacking, or all the million other different ways to steal credit-card numbers.""Industry trackers Gartner and IDC say ransomware attacks are rising. In some instances, those breaches must be reported. Such was the case when Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center had to pay a $17,000 ransom to regain control of the hospital's systems.Many other ransomware attacks, though, go unreported.Enterprises continue to spend for security, says Wiley. The security industry is now within a mile of most hackers -- rather than the six-mile lead the Black Hats used to have, he says. But the small-business sector often still plays ostrich, he told IBD.""If they have an attack, I see them spending,"" he said. Otherwise, ""they're sticking their heads in the sand and continuing to do their business, not wanting to lift their head to see if there's a lion about to pounce on them.""IBM's Barlow estimates that 80% of breaches are the work of highly organized criminal gangs. Some of their motives are apparent, but not all. In any case, criminal gangs, nation-states, teen hackers on a lark and other culprits will continue to try to breach networks, with only a few big cases making headlines.""Tune in to this idea that bad guys go into systems and gather data,"" Barlow said. ""It doesn't always result in large breaches.""RELATED:'Nimble' Proofpoint Takes Share From Cisco, SymantecPalo Alto Networks 'Deceleration' Worries InvestorsIBD 50: CyberArk, Activision, Dave & Buster's Near Buy Points

489,HD,"The major indexes lost some more gains Friday afternoon after an August payrolls report showed decent gains on the jobs front, but not enough to spur a fast move to raise the cost of money.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%, backing a bit from its early gain of almost 0.7%. So far this week, the Nasdaq is up about 0.5%. The NYSE Composite gapped up at the open and advanced 0.7% on the back of solid gains by oil, mining, security software, gaming software, long-term Medicare facility and hospital stocks.Oil and silver futures shot higher. Government bonds sold off as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed to 1.61%, up 4 basis points.Analysts gave a nearly unanimous response that the 151,000 increase in August payrolls was not enough to spur the Federal Reserve to go ahead with its first new increase in short-term interest rates when the U.S. central bank meets later this month. In December, the Fed raised the fed funds rate for overnight loans to a 0.25%-0.5% range.""This number definitely doesn't force a rate increase in September and is at the lower end of expectations -- a weak overall report,"" Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at Florida-based EverBank, said. ""If the data continues to match the recent pattern of disappointment we could see the chances of ANY rate increase in 2016 fade away.""The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.3%. On the Dow, big price movers included Chevron (CVX) (up 1%, still lagging below its 50-day moving average), Boeing (BA) (up 1%, testing resistance at the 200-day line), and Home Depot (HD) (up 0.7%, just shy of a 137.92 base-on-base entry).Volume on both exchanges was running mildly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time on Thursday. The stock market will be closed Monday for Labor Day.Apple (AAPL) helped all the major indexes with its heft and market cap of $577 billion. The iPhone maker, set to announce new products next week, gapped up at the open and rose as much as 1.2% to 108. It is now up 0.3% to 107.04, yet the stock continues to slowly position itself for a potential breakout, at 110.33. That's 10 cents above the top of downward-sloping handle in a consolidation.Indeed, Apple is no longer a big growth stock. The savvy CAN SLIM investor will keep both eyes open for brand-new names that have the kind of awesome growth in profits, sales, and outstanding return on equity and profit margins that Apple once had. Stocks that went public within the past three to eight years are often great candidates.One may be Impinj (PI), a brand-new name on the Nasdaq. The semiconductor play surged 13%, to 31.17 in heavy trading Friday, adding to Thursday's 21% rally.After peaking at 24.93 on Aug. 18, Impinj cooled off for 10 trading sessions -- enough time to form a narrow IPO base. The stock burst past the 25.03 pivot point on Thursday in the heaviest trade since its July 21 debut at 14 a share. It's now sharply extended from proper buy range.Impinj produces RF (radio frequency) ID tags that get placed in medicine bottles and other consumer products that allow manufacturers to make better supply-chain decisions. Late Wednesday, the Seattle-based firm reported earnings of 5 cents a share, smashing Wall Street's consensus view yet down 44%, but that may have been due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. Third-quarter earnings are expected to jump 500% to 6 cents a share. Revenue rose 37% to $25.9 million.The stock has just 19 million shares outstanding and a float of 9 million, so keep in mind that it tends to swing more wildly than the average stock. Plus, it hasn't yet reported quarterly earnings of more than 10 cents a share, so year-over-year gains may be in part exaggerated by the small figures.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Amplify Snack Brands (BETR), another young gun and fast-growing food firm, rallied 1% to 16.98, moving a bit further past a new 16.76 V-shaped cup base entry. The Austin, Texas-based company went public on Aug. 5 at 18 a share, so watch for potential upside resistance at the price level.Lululemon (LULU) plunged 8.5% to nearly round-trip its gains after breaking out past a 68.03 flat-base buy point in July. The yogawear firm posted fiscal Q2 earnings of 38 cents a share, up 12% and the best bottom-line growth in 11 quarters, but it only matched Wall Street's consensus view. Revenue jumped 14%, the 10th quarter in a row of modest double-digit increases, but slightly below views. Lululemon's guidance was cautious.But some names in the apparel and clothing retail field still joined Friday's rally. They included Anthropologie chain operator Urban Outfitters (URBN) (up 0.6%, holding a recent powerful upward price gap) and Nordstrom (JWN) (up nearly 2%, trying to hold its rebound back above the key 200-day line).IBD's TAKE: Impinj is part of a top-performing sector. Within IBD's ranking of 33 broad industry sectors, the chip sector ranks easily in the top 10 at No. 2.

490,HD,"J.C. Penney (JCP) is in a surprising position more than four years after it was almost run aground by a former chief executive officer: It could be the last department store standing at your local mall. As rivals retrench, J.C. Penney is adding new merchandise, exclusive partnerships and services to draw shoppers to its more than 1,000 stores. Sears Holdings (SHLD) has closed stores amid $9 billion in losses in recent years and Macy's said this past month that it would shutter 100 in as-yet unidentified locations — an act likely to leave J.C. Penney as the main anchor in some malls.""When I joined the company, my first thought was, 'Man, we've got a lot of stores to close,' "" Marvin Ellison, who became president in 2014 and CEO last August, said in an interview. ""It was the opposite.''Some of J.C. Penney's most profitable locations turned out to be small stores in rural areas where the retailer pays almost no rent; two California stores opening this year will be completely funded by the landlord. Ellison's focus on mall negotiations, coupled with the changes in merchandising, are helping to move the retailer this year beyond $1 billion in EBITDA  — earnings before interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization — for the first time since fiscal 2012. As of this past week, its stock had surged 40% this year, compared with 3% for Macy's (M) and a 33% decline at Sears.Today J.C. Penney has fewer than 10 stores that aren't making money, Ellison said. The Plano, Texas-based company's fiscal second-quarter net loss was smaller than analysts predicted, and it has outlined a path back to profitability even without achieving the $18 billion in sales it last hit in 2009. Comparable-store sales — a key industry metric — rose 2.2% last quarter.""They have really unique opportunity, given there's a strong employee commitment to service and a customer focus,"" said Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""They have to prove it to everybody that their strategy will yield comparable store sales in an environment that's seen lots of volatility.""Ellison, a former Home Depot (HD) executive, succeeded Mike Ullman, who had returned as CEO after Ron Johnson's disastrous run ended in 2013. Ullman had tossed much of Johnson's strategy and stabilized the chain's finances through loans and stock offerings. That set the stage for Ellison to focus on improving customer service, selling more private brands and revamping online operations.While the turnaround isn't complete — at about $10, its shares are far below a 2007 peak near $86 — the company is strong enough to take advantage as rivals pull back. When a Sears or Macy's closes, J.C. Penney uses direct mail in the ZIP code to convert those customers. ""You make sure you invite them in,'' said Ellison, 51.If a mall operator has planned well, there can be side benefits when a competitor leaves, Ellison said. Some types of new tenants — like entertainment options and restaurants — will do a better job at driving traffic than the department stores they replaced.""They're second movers in things, and being second mover can be turned into a strength,"" analyst Chen said. ""The world's not really growing, but you have other retailers with problems that give J.C. Penney an opportunity to execute on.""The bad news keeps coming at Sears, which on Aug. 25 reported a $395 million quarterly loss. Through April, Sears had closed 18% of its stores since 2006, compared with 6% for Macy's and just 2% for J.C. Penney, according to Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm.Of 1,560 malls tracked by researcher CoStar Group, 181, or about 12%, had all three retailers as anchors.J.C. Penney has spent a lot of time and energy identifying its customer. With a heavy emphasis on testing first, the retailer plans to focus on beauty, home goods and special sizes to achieve these goals, along with investments in customer service and online capabilities.""They're putting their eggs in reliable baskets in beauty and home,"" Cowen's Chen said.About 70% of J.C. Penney's shoppers are women, and the retailer is working to attract a younger, more diverse set of moms. More than half its revenue comes from shoppers who are, on average, 60-year-old women with incomes above the U.S. median. Most of the rest comes from mothers who average 33 years of age and are more reflective of U.S. cultural demographics.J.C. Penney is using beauty products to help draw the latter group — technologically savvy women looking for value in both their time and money. The retailer has 5% market share in prestige cosmetics, Chief Merchant John Tighe said. That's due in large part to the 574 Sephora stores open inside J.C. Penney locations. There are plans to expand that partnership even to smaller sites.To encourage shoppers drawn in by LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora to stay and explore, the company collaborated with beauty magazine InStyle to rebrand 120 of its 850 beauty shops as Salon by InStyle. Sales have increased 720 basis points from last year at the revamped salons.Ellison wants the retailer to be the go-to destination for women shopping for their homes. The chain is introducing 500 appliance showrooms this year, selling brands like LG and Samsung. The retailer has cleared as much as 4,800 square feet for appliances — items that bring in eight times more in gross profit dollars than the goods they replace, Ellison said.In all this, stores are a key component. Half of online sales go through stores, whether items are picked up or returned there, shipped from a location or ordered by an associate to a shopper's home. Expanding its home goods and beauty offerings is part of Ellison's efforts to make the stores a draw, a concept the company refers to as ""retail-tainment.""That idea ""could speak to how the J.C.

492,HD,"Home improvement chain Lowe's (LOW) and discount giant Target (TGT) reported second-quarter earnings Wednesday morning. Both disappointed investors.Estimates: Q2 EPS up 18% to $1.42 on a 6.3% rise in sales to $18.45 billion.Prior Quarter: Q1 EPS up 24% to 87 cents on revenue up 7.8% to $15.234 billion.Results: Q2 EPS was $1.37, while sales rose 5.3% to $18.26 billion. Both numbers missed views. Same-store sales rose 2%, about half of the 4.1% gain analysts had expected.Lowe's also cut its full-year earnings forecast.Stock: Lowe's tumbled 5.5% to 77 soon after the opening bell on the stock market today. That put it below a recent entry point of 80.86 cleared last month. Lowe's had been consolidating and possibly setting up another buy point.Why It Matters: Home improvement stores have been holding up due to housing and remodeling demand, despite a general retail malaise, so Lowe's report is worrisome. On Tuesday, larger rival Home Depot (HD) reported in-line EPS growth and sales that just fell short of views, but it said housing remains a ""tailwind.""Also Tuesday, the housing starts report for July showed builders broke ground on more homes than expected last month, with a 2.1% rise to an annual rate of 1.21 million. Still, starts remain far below the 2-million-plus levels in the years before the crash.Home Depot stock fell 0.2% early Wednesday. On Tuesday, shares briefly hit a buy point before closing down 0.6%.Estimates: EPS down 8% to $1.12 on a 7% decline in revenue to $16.18 billion.Prior Quarter: EPS up 17% to $1.29, while sales fell 1% to $21.626 billion.Results: EPS was $1.23 a share excluding items, topping views. Sales fell about 7% to $16.17 billion, a touch light. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, a bit more than forecasts for a 1% drop.But, amid growing competition from Amazon (AMZN) and weaker demand for apparel and electronics, Target cut guidance. It now sees full-year EPS of $4.80-$5.20, down from $5.20-$5.40, with same-store sales flat to down 2% in the second of the year.Stock: Target tumbled 5.9% to 71 early Wednesday, falling back below the 200-day line after finding support there.Why It Matters: Along with Wal-Mart (WMT), the big-box retailer offered promotions last month to coincide with Amazon Prime Day. But overall retail sales for July were flat despite the e-commerce giant's blowout event -- highlighting the sluggish state of the retail sector and continued pressure on brick-and-mortar stores.Target's weakness could turn sentiment against retail. Keep in mind that despite the investor euphoria surrounding last week's department store earnings, actual demand at Macy's (M) and other rivals isn't great, just better than feared.Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, reports earnings Thursday. Wal-Mart fell 0.4% soon after the opening bell, just below the 50-day line.

494,HD,"Chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA) will fly on GoPro's (GPRO) three Hero 5 iterations this Christmas season, while one question is whether drone segment power is sustainable, Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson said Tuesday.Erickson had expected only two Hero 5 cameras this Christmas. But checks of the retail segment show GoPro will likely unveil a ""basic"" version featuring 1080p video, and Black and Silver versions with 4K video at 60- and 30-frames per second, respectively.""Thus, we think this should drive a bit better elasticity than our previous expectations,"" he wrote in a research report.Erickson maintained his overweight rating on Ambarella stock, but boosted his price target to 200 from 180. He has a sector weight rating on GoPro stock.Drone sell-through has been in line with expectations recently, Erickson said, noting conversations with 12 specialty drone retailers. But huge holiday builds are likely on the horizon. Erickson expects a rush of new products for the holiday and new entrants to the sector.His major question now is whether GoPro, and thus Ambarella, can maintain sell-through.Besides GoPro, Ambarella is the high-end leader for all major HD video processing verticals and has unmatched technology making it an acquisition target, he says. Plus, it has no exposure to the volatile smartphone segment and declining PC sector.His bottom line: ""Ambarella has too many things going for it for us not to stick with the name,"" he wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Ambarella has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it performs in the top 8% of all stocks in key growth metrics. But it's 12th in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, trailing No. 1 Broadcom.

On Monday, it dipped 10 cents to 82.77, about 4% above a 79.26 buy point cleared last month.Off-price apparel chain Ross Stores reports Thursday. Ross Stores fell 2% in premarket trading to 62. That would put the stock back into buy range from a 59.78 entry point last month.Estimates: Non-GAAP EPS of 8 cents, up 167%, based on one analyst's forecasts. No reliable consensus Q2 sales estimates are available.Results: EPS ex items were 12 cents, up 300%. Net revenue climbed 222% to $99 million.Momo's live video service, launched in Q3 2015, generated revenue of $57.9 million.Operating costs leapt 171% to $85.2 million.Prior Quarter:  Q1 profit rose 200% to 6 cents a share, with sales up 93% to $50.9 million.Stock: Momo rose nearly 8% to 17.35 in premarket trading.

Momo is already extended from that entry point and is set to open at a 52-week high.Momo operates a mobile social-networking platform and dating app in China. Go-private talks moved the stock last year, but that buzz seems to have died down.

TJX (TJX) slipped 3% after meeting Q2 expectations but lowering its Q3 guidance. Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) opened 3.5% lower after weak second-quarter results.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) muscled up 6% at the open after thoroughly beating consensus expectations for second-quarter results and third-quarter guidance.Convenience-store owner CST Brands (CST) popped 6% after reports said the company may be near a deal to be taken over by Circle K chain owner Alimentation Couche-Tard with a price tag estimated in the $3.4 billion range.Positive quarterly reports sent a raft of China-based stocks higher for a second straight session. Among those, online retailer Vipshop Holdings (VIPS) surged 5% after turning in strong second-quarter results, including a 62% increase in total active customers, to 23 million. Vipshop shares are extended above a 15.13 buy point after clearing the marker in heavy trade Friday.Momo (MOMO), a mobile social networking platform, swung up 7% after a 300% earnings gain and a 22% revenue increase clobbered analyst expectations. Shares are extended above a 15.39 buy point.Cayman Islands-based Fabrinet (FN) inched up 0.5% at the open. The assembler of electronic networking and laser components reported a 50% earnings gain and a 33% rise in revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter. Both numbers were above analyst targets. And management also lifted its first-quarter guidance past consensus views. The stock is now extended above a 39.15 buy point in a flat base.On the downside, Hain Celestial Group (HAIN) plummeted 29% at the opening bell.  The organic and natural foods maker late Monday delayed its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report due to accounting concerns.July housing starts increased to an annualized pace of 1.211 million, according to the Commerce Department.  That was above June's pace of 1.189 million and easily above expectations for a slowdown to 1.180 million. Building permits, a cue to upcoming starts, eased to a rate of 1.152 million - down from June's 1.153 million and undercutting forecasts for 1.160 million.Consumer prices were flat in July, vs. a 0.2% rise in June but in line with expectations. The Labor Department also reported core prices -- minus food and energy -- rose 0.1%, down from June's 0.2% gain and below estimates for a 0.2% advance.Industrial production data for July is due out from the Federal Reserve at 9:15 a.m. ET. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart is scheduled to speak at 12:30 p.m.The dollar notched broad declines, apparently following written comments by San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams that suggested raising inflation target rates -- a move that would allow the Fed to maintain its current policy stance. Oil reversed early gains, with West Texas Intermediate down a fraction and back below $46 a barrel. Gold held a half percent gain and was near $1,352 an ounce.

500,HD,"Just how strong is the U.S. consumer and what did Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day mean for the broad retail sector last month?Those are two big questions going into Friday's retail sales report from the Commerce Department to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.After a solid 0.6% rise in June, economists expect to see continued momentum, with overall sales rising 0.4% amid an uptick in auto sales from June levels. Yet, thanks partly to lower gas prices, sales excluding autos are expected to rise just 0.1%.But the latest signal on consumer spending offers a hint of possible upside in the retail report. Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday when they reported earnings for the quarter ended July. But Macy's and Kohl's did report lower sales vs. a year earlier.A host of retailers, including Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), offered bargains and free shipping in the week of Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from its inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to buy.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Nonstore retailers (largely e-commerce) have been by far the strongest retail category, with sales up 14.2% from a year ago in June.With low mortgage rates, building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) likely stayed on a roll after June sales jumped 3.9% from May and 7.6% from a year ago. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.All signs, though, point to continued softness in sales at food services and drinking places after a 0.3% decline in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%.

501,HD,"Hot IPO Twilio (TWLO) late Monday reported second-quarter revenue of $64.5 million, up 70% from the year earlier period, topping consensus estimates.Twilio said it lost 8 cents per share excluding items in the June quarter vs. an 11-cent loss in the year-earlier period, also beating expectations, as the cloud communications software firm released earnings for the first time as a public company.Twilio's stock rose a fraction in after-hours trading following the earnings news release. During the regular session Monday, Twilio stock rose 2.4% to 42.50 on the stock market today. Twilio's stock had shot up 180% since its initial public offering in June.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected Q2 revenue of $58.2 million and a 14-cent per share loss on a non-GAAP basis.San Francisco-based Twilio had a net loss of $9.6 million and revenue of $38 million in the year-earlier period, according to a regulatory filing. Twillio said it had a $10.9 million net loss in the three months ended June 30.Twilio's software provides real-time communications. App developers use its software tools for text messaging and other communications. Twilio outsources its cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN).IBD'S TAKE: Twilio and Acacia Communications are among stocks that have broken out, despite a tepid IPO market.

503,HD,"ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund (SBLGX) makes a habit of staying on top. The now-$3.5 billion portfolio's 15.72% average annual return over the five years ended July 29 ranked No. 5 among all large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.It was also in the top 3% and top 5% among its direct rivals over the past 12 months and three years.How does the fund do it? Co-manager Peter Bourbeau, who has been at the helm since July 15, 2009, says he and Margaret Vitrano -- co-manager since Oct. 11, 2012 -- stick to a few techniques, including investing in just their best ideas and investing in not one but several types of growth stocks.The results speak loud and clear. Their fund was in the top 33% of all U.S. diversified stock mutual funds last month. And their track record has made them an IBD Best Mutual Funds of 2016 award winner. The fund outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.Forty-eight-year-old Bourbeau, who is based in Manhattan, spoke with IBD about his investment approach, while he was on the road in Nashville, Tenn.IBD: Peter, you hold three types of growth stocks: cyclical, stable and what you call select. Why not just focus on one?Bourbeau: We believe different types of growth companies will perform better at various stages of a market cycle. We seek to deliver solid performance through the full cycle by owning a diversified portfolio of growth companies which we divide into three categories of growth stocks or buckets: stable, cyclical and select.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe select bucket of growth stocks -- which has about 35% of our assets -- are elite growers with disruptive technologies or business models. These are growing earnings at a double-digit rate. We base our growth projections on the size of the addressable market. Facebook (FB), for instance, will only invest in new opportunities that represent 1 billion or more potential users. These companies often look expensive because many of them, like Amazon (AMZN) with aggressive capital spending on its web services business, invest heavily to support future growth. This focus on long-term value creation tends to make them volatile.The stable bucket has about 50% to 65% of our assets. These are stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Microsoft (MSFT). They are industry-leading companies that are growing earnings slightly above average on a very consistent basis. It's this long-term compounding of earnings and cash flows which gives these companies so many options to create shareholder value such as stock buybacks, acquisitions or dividend payments.Comcast (CMCSA), for example, recently announced the acquisition of DreamWorks Animation (DWA). Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) last year purchased SABMiller. Disney (DIS) has the cash to expand its theme parks globally with the opening of a park in Shanghai.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceOur cyclical-stocks bucket has companies whose revenue or profits are depressed for reasons that we think are fixable. Cyclical growers maintain the growth characteristics that we look for, but have issues with a visible inflection point. As patient, long-term investors, we can take advantage of price dislocations caused by near-term headwinds to establish new positions or dollar cost average into existing positions at attractive valuations.Schlumberger (SLB) and Grainger (GWW) are two. American Express (AXP) has faced revenue pressure on the top end by (JPMorgan) Chase (JPM) and Visa (V), and on the bottom by Capital One (COF) and Discover (DFS).IBD: And why do you prefer to be concentrated?Bourbeau: We usually have 40 to 50 names. We're around 47 now. We have 15% annual turnover, so we hold for eight to 10 years on average.We're concentrated because we're looking for the No. 1 leader in a market. Those companies have the highest margins, best free cash flow. They take over weaker companies. They become bigger and more powerful, harder to compete with. They have visionary men and women. Great companies remain great for a long time. Who needs the No. 2 or 3 company?IBD: Give me an example, please, as of your latest disclosure.Bourbeau: Sure. Schlumberger's rivals include Halliburton (HAL) (in oilfield services) and Baker Hughes (BHI) (in oil & gas machinery). But Schlumberger is three times bigger than Halliburton (in terms of market capitalization), its nearest rival in oil field services. (And more than five times the size of Baker Hughes.) It is by far the leader in products, distribution, margins. It is the favorite partner of exploration and production companies and integrated multinationals.IBD: What's your Facebook thesis?Bourbeau: Its rare business model takes advantage of the move of advertising from old media to new and to mobile from the desktop.They bought WhatsApp, they've got Messenger, they've got Instagram. And look at what they've done with video. They're building apps for billions of users as opposed to some of their smaller competitors.If you're an advertiser, you're getting targeting that you never had before. It can be refined down to age, demographic, gender, likes and dislikes. Your ads' effectiveness goes higher. And Facebook is just beginning this movement.IBD: Is Amazon the same -- one innovation building on another?Bourbeau: You're frustrated as investors, seeing huge ramp-ups in capital expenditures. But you know they're also seeing opportunities that we mere mortals could never see. Amazon Web Services started as a pet project for their retail operation. They built an infrastructure that they used maybe one month a year, then they wondered how to use it the rest of the year, and it grew 50%, 60%, 70%. They created an industry, renting software vs. buying it, which (Amazon founder and CEO) Jeff Bezos says will be bigger than retail.What's next? We don't know. Logistics? Moving packages around the world? Not all of their innovations will work. And we're aware of stretched valuations. But an innovative company with $10 billion in free cash flow gives us no reason to be alarmed.IBD: You boosted your stake in VMware (VMW) not long ago. Why?Bourbeau: This is another innovative company that created an entire business, which is server virtualization. Now, that's the mature part of their business. They still have a massive lead, but that will erode over time.They have another suite of products. And creating an easy user experience to a hybrid cloud is something they're going to have a leadership position in. They made acquisitions in network virtualization. One was Nicira (in 2012). They've got deployment to paying customers. The value proposition vs. Cisco Systems (CSCO) is early, but if it works it will be a massive home run.To be balanced, the Dell acquisition (of EMC (EMC), which owns a stake in VMware) was unfortunate. Structuring the deal with tracking stock (that mimicked shares of VMware) punished equity in VMware and made a messy transition. But we're finally toward the tail end of that. VMware will operate as a public company.It has double-digit free cash flow yield. It is a very cheap asset. They've got a huge buyback in place. It is a name we continue to like.IBD: Another position you've boosted is Xilinx (XLNX). Why?Bourbeau: This is an interesting company. They don't own their own manufacturing. They design intricate, high-power chips for very particular applications like cell towers, moving massive data, programmable logic device (PLD) chips that can handle enormous amounts of instructions and can change instructions on a chip remotely.They're used in defense. There are 17 PLD chips in the Mercedes S-class cars. And the fact that they don't manufacture them means this is almost a software company in terms of margins. Lastly, this was a duopoly. But Intel (INTC) bought Altera, so Xilinx could be an acquisition target down the road, not that's that what we're playing for.IBD: Cyclicals that you like or added to recently -- American Express, Schlumberger, VMWare, Xilinx: only VMWare has average growth of 10% or faster in the last three and five years. Only Schlumberger has expected earnings north of 10% in 2017. Do these companies need faster growth to get their stocks moving? When will that happen?Bourbeau: Growth rates are not the main criteria with cyclical stocks. We target an inflection point for each. If reached, it should cause earnings to normalize and stock valuation to increase.Here are their inflection points. For SLB, they include crude oil prices reaching supply-demand equilibrium and global production ramping up. Also, 65% incremental margins, which is a lot higher than any other recovery. For AXP: normalization of business post Costco (which no longer accepts AmEx cards). Normal earnings growth rate should return in 2017. XLNX: product cycle and further application penetration as well as market share gains. VMW: we don't have a comment.IBD: How do you and Margaret Vitrano divide duties, running this fund?Bourbeau: We don't divide up the portfolio. We're devoted to the same process. But we each have a slight bias in our knowledge bases. Margaret, given her consumer discretionary and technology background, has different experiences from my health care and financials background. But when we look at companies, we're on the same calls at the same time. Our different backgrounds helps us fact-check each other.IBD: And who was your mentor, Peter?Bourbeau: The first was Richie Freeman, who has run ClearBridge Aggressive Growth (SHRAX) (since 1983, and whose co-manager now is Evan Bauman). We talk every day. He's just down the hall. We're constantly talking ideas, sports.But our portfolio construction is now a little different. Richie's turnover is zero. When he's comfortable with a name, he's on it forever. Margaret and I are more disciplined in valuation. Our turnover is 15%, which makes Richie's fund look like a hedge fund.If you look at sectors, Richie and Evan are eclectic. Richie is more likely to have zero in a given sector if he doesn't like it. That's not how Margaret and I look at the world. We have industrials, media (and something in every sector). And Richie can have significant overweights. And he is more all-market-capitalizations. Margaret and I are more large cap.

505,HD,"The median salary for a cybersecurity job is 2.7 times that of average wages in Australia, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., yet 82% of organizations in those countries are experiencing a shortage in skilled cybersecurity workers, chipmaker Intel (INTC) found in a poll by its Intel Security business.More than half (53%) of respondents say the cybersecurity skills shortage is worse than talent deficits in other IT professions.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski agrees. Cybersecurity firms ""can't hire people fast enough,"" he told IBD.A major challenge is that cybersecurity jobs require much more than a degree and applicable coding abilities, says Candace Worley, vice president of enterprise solutions marketing for Intel Security. Some of the best cybersecurity workers, she says, have hacking backgrounds, a skill with a questionable reputation in the industry. But it's a skill she calls crucial.IBD'S TAKE: Most stocks make their biggest gains fairly early in their publicly-traded lives, so IBD's IPO Leaders list is worth tracking. Security firm CyberArk Software is on the current list, making its IPO in September 2014 at $16 a share and now trading near 55.""Computer science and math degrees provide a certain intellectual skill set, but (they) don't necessarily hone the hunting and detective skills required for this industry,"" Worley told IBD. ""Coding, incident response ... there are a lot of skills required to play in the cybersecurity space.""Over the course of May, Intel Security teamed up with market research specialist Vanson Bourne to survey security staff at 775 companies and other organizations of 500-plus employees, in eight countries.Some jobs are especially hard to fill, Worley said. Jobs in intrusion detection, attack mitigation and software development -- creating software that is less susceptible to hacking -- are the ones that most often go begging, she says. Those skills are rarer than less-technical abilities like communications and management.To that point, Intel Security noted the highest technical security job last year in the U.S. paid $233,333 annually. That's $8,000 more than most chief information security officers (CISOs) make, according to job tracker Dice.Last year, the U.S. left 209,000 unfilled security jobs on the table, Intel said, citing a Peninsula Press analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That's about $41.8 billion in unpaid salaries, assuming a $200,000 average wage for each position. Nearly three-quarters of respondents (71%) say the shortage in skills left their organizations vulnerable to attack.The trend is continuing this year, but perhaps at a slower pace, according to Piper Jaffray's Nowinski. In June, there were 2,843 unfilled jobs at 13 cybersecurity firms in the U.S., according to job-postings information examined by Piper Jaffray. At, say, $200,000 a head, that's roughly $570 million in unfilled salaries. Among those with the most total open positions were KEYW Corp. (KEYW) (658), Fortinet (FTNT) (459) and Symantec (SYMC) (431).Overall, however, the number of unfilled positions at those 13 firms fell 28% in June vs. June 2015, and they fell 25% in May vs. a year earlier. In April, though, the number of unfilled jobs had risen 14%.Nowinski credits the fewer unfilled posts in June and May not just to companies filling slots, but also to some layoffs. Such was likely the case for Symantec. It had 71% fewer technical job openings this June vs. June 2015, but in May it announced 1,200 layoffs.""Cybersecurity firms can't hire people fast enough,"" he said.Networking companies such as Brocade Communications (BRCD), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) can fill technical jobs more easily because the required skills are similar, Nowinski says. ""But (jobs at) Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (and) Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) are all vastly different,"" requiring multiple specialists, he said.Organizations aren't all on the same page in terms of hiring practices, says Intel's Worley. The lion's share of respondents (68%) to the survey say hands-on experience is critical to developing cybersecurity skills. And though more than half require at least a bachelor's degree, 23% say education isn't properly preparing students.There is a lack of master's programs for cybersecurity, says Tim Ashford, IT director for Ashford Capital Management, an independent research and analysis firm. Ashford is working toward his master's of science in information security engineering with the SANS Institute.The SANS Institute provides cybersecurity training for more than 165,000 security professionals worldwide, and it offers two cybersecurity master's programs. Two summers ago, Ashford, a 19-year veteran of the IT industry, began looking for cybersecurity programs.""I hit up websites like MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and Stanford (University) and saw courses here and there, but as far as programs for preparing people with hacking techniques, managed qualitative skills, I saw next to none of that,"" he told IBD.In December 2014, the SANS Institute had just six graduates of its program, Ashford says. But breaches like those of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and LinkedIn (LNKD), dating back to 2013, have spiked interest, he says. Like Worley, he says there's a need for cybersecurity professionals who can ""break stuff.""Also like Worley, Ashford cites a need to reach younger minds.""You've got to find a way to get kids to think about cyber,"" Ashford said. ""It's part deconstruction, breaking things down. But there's always a delicate risk with kids. Let's teach them how to break stuff, but also educate them on the heart and soul of cybersecurity.""Workers at cybersecurity companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Check Point and Fortinet try to hunt down the origins of a breach, close it and then remedy the potential fallout.""That takes ability to deduct, it takes problem-solving, and it takes logic,"" Worley said. ""We're unlikely to see a decline in hacking and malware, so we're seeing the industry work with high schools and universities to build the curriculum.""Government also has a role to play. But 76% of respondents say their governments aren't investing enough in cybersecurity talent, and the same percentage say the laws and regulations surrounding security infrastructure in their nations are insufficient.In the U.S., Obama has pledged $19 billion for fiscal 2017, which starts Oct. 1, to bolster the government's aging security infrastructure. That could boost spending, but Piper Jaffray's Nowinski says that won't necessarily produce more qualified folks to fill cybersecurity jobs.Yet, 9 in 10 respondents say technology can help organizations fill the hole in skilled security workers. More than half (55%) say technology like automation and managed security service offerings will advance sufficiently in five years to meet the majority of a firm's security needs.Worley isn't as bullish on the rapid advance of security automation, but she says the idea is getting greater acceptance. Automation is a relatively nascent tool, relying on supercomputers like IBM's (IBM) Watson to hunt needle-in-the-haystack security abnormalities or automate update deployments.""If you go back a decade, most people were extremely uncomfortable with automation,"" she said. ""But now, and most companies are more tolerant of automation.""Still, she emphasized, ""skills that require significant analysis will continue to require human intervention.""RELATED:

508,HD,"Major index-tracking ETFs reversed higher to close with modest gains Wednesday, as investors parsed newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting.Utility exchange traded funds turned sharply higher, as the minutes seemed to indicate that the Fed is in no rush to raise rates again. Lower interest rates benefit this capital-intensive industry, which is sensitive to borrowing costs.Utility Select Sector SPDR (XLU) rose 1.5% in huge volume on the stock market today. The sector led the S&P 500 higher.The consumer discretionary sector trailed S&P 500 peers, slipping 0.2%.Retail earnings disappointed investors, including home improvement chain Lowe's (LOW).

The ETF has been range-bound for much of the past year and is trading 4% below its July high of 30.The largest gold ETF ended a volatile session flat. Gold bugs struggled to judge the overall tenor of the Fed's message.""Gold prices were trading only modestly lower in afternoon dealings Wednesday, after selling off moderately following an FOMC statement that was initially deemed hawkish on U.S. monetary policy,"" wrote Kitco analyst Jim Wyckoff. ""Gold prices rebounded from lower levels to trade just a bit lower as the marketplace began to reckon the latest FOMC minutes may just be more of the same Fed rhetoric and not much has really changed.""IBD'S TAKE: Home improvement stores have been holding up due to housing and remodeling demand, despite a general retail malaise, so Lowe's report is worrisome.In other ETF market news, August trading in SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is bearish and trading in iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) is bullish, according to independent Manhattan-based financial analytics firm S3 Partners.That's a reversal from July, when both ETFs traded with a bullish trend and were rewarded with gains of 3.7% and 5.9%, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research for S3.Dusaniwsky wrote in a research note: ""In August, we are seeing a continuation of this bullish trend for the Russell 2000 ETF, while the S&P 500 ETF is showing us a pronounced reversal of sentiment. Short interest for the (small-cap) ETF has dropped $1.7 billion, down to $10.1 billion, which is the lowest short-interest level since mid-February, and long holder inflows have increased $955 million for a total of $29.6 billion. On the other hand, short interest in the (large-cap) ETF has increased $3.9 billion so far in August, or 7%, up to $56.5 billion, and long holders sold $1.2 billion of the ETF to bring its market cap down to $201.6 billion.""While investors were bullish in both the large-cap and broad indexes in July,"" Dusaniwsky added, ""it seems that while the bullishness is continuing in the broader index, there is definitely a bearish sentiment in S&P large caps.""Short-selling aims to profit from a decline in a stock or other security.

511,HD,"The major averages ended little-changed near record highs Friday after weak retail sales and producer price data tempered investor sentiment.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.2%, and the S&P 500 edged down 0.1%. The Nasdaq eked out a 0.1% gain.Volume in the stock market today was mixed, rising about 10% on the NYSE, but falling a fraction on the Nasdaq compared to Thursday, according to preliminary data.Telecom stocks broke out of the stock market's doldrums, led by IBD 50 issue Acacia Communications (ACIA), which rocketed 41% after a blowout quarterly earnings report announced after the close Thursday.Acacia, a maker of high-speed interconnect modules for internet cloud infrastructure, went public in May and has doubled after clearing a 45.85 buy point of an IPO base in early July.Lumentum (LITE) climbed nearly 3%. The provider of optical communications products for the telecommunications and other industries recently rose 20% past a 28.01 buy point of a 15-week consolidation. Those who bought at the breakout should consider selling at least some shares, as growth stocks tend to correct after rising more than 20% past their buy points.Chinese e-commerce website Alibaba (BABA) was another big mover, soaring 7% in heavy volume and adding to Thursday's 5% jump following a strong quarterly earnings report.The stock is now well out of buying range from a 85.10 buy point of an odd-shaped cup-with-handle base.Department stores had another good day despite a government report showing retail sales were flat in July, trailing expectations for a 0.4% gain.JCPenney (JCP) jumped 6% in heavy volume after reporting a much lower-than-expected loss of 5 cents a share in the latest quarter.

512,HD,"Even with Amazon (AMZN) Prime Day, retail sales were merely flat in July, with non-auto sales down 0.3%, the Commerce Department said Friday.While July's totals came in well below expectations for an overall 0.4% gain, and a 0.2% rise outside the auto sector, the disappointment was softened by an upward revision to June numbers. The overall gain was revised to 0.8% from 0.6%, with sales outside autos rising 0.9%, up from 0.7%.Still, the year-over-year gain in retail sales slowed to 2.3%, which may slightly ding confidence in the strength of the American consumer. While a 2.7% drop in gas station sales held down July spending, consumers didn't put the money to work elsewhere.Non-store retailers continued to stand out, with sales rising 1.3% on the month and 14.1% on the year. That was surely helped by Amazon's 24-hour sales event for Prime members. Amazon said Prime orders in the U.S. surged 50% from the company's inaugural event in 2015, but it didn't reveal its sales tally.But efforts by Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and others to piggyback or cut into Amazon's big day may have fallen flat. General merchandise store sales dipped 0.1%, while department stores saw sales continue to decline, off 0.5% on the month and down 4.0% from a year earlier.Both Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) slightly beat modest revenue expectations on Thursday, while Nordstrom (JWN) saw a much smaller drop in same-store sales than analysts expected. All three companies saw sales drop from a year earlier. JCPenney (JCP), a relative bright spot, said on Friday that same-store sales rose 2.2% from a year before, about as expected.IBD'S TAKE: While the consumer continues to be the main driver of U.S. economic growth, most retailers have underperformed the stock market because the retail sector is overbuilt and online competition is intense. Watch this IBD Video for tips on how to quickly identify and research leading stocks that may be ready to be bought.July is typically a slow month for retail before the back-to-school season kicks in, so it's possible the sales push could lead to an upside surprise. Two unknowns: Will Prime Day sales by Amazon and competitors eat into back-to-school shopping, and how will July sales look on a seasonally adjusted basis? The latter may depend on how much the Commerce Department has adjusted its seasonal models after last year's Prime Day.Building-materials and garden-equipment retailers like Home Depot (HD) saw sales ease 0.5% after an upwardly revised 4.2% surge in June. Home Depot and rival Lowe's (LOW) will report quarterly earnings next week.Sales at food services and drinking places continued to be soft, falling 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.3% rise in June. The problem cited by McDonald's (MCD) and multiple industry players is that food at home is looking like an unusually good deal relative to the cost of food away from home. On Wednesday, Wendy's (WEN) scaled back same-store sales growth guidance for 2016 from 3% to a range of 1%-2%.

513,HD,"Stocks moved sideways at all-time highs this week, but the week was packed with market-moving news. Alibaba (BABA) broke out as growth accelerated, while Acacia Communications (ACIA) exploded as fiber optic and IPO growth names sparked. Macy's (M) triggered a huge relief rally, and Wal-Mart (WMT) bought Jet.com to better compete vs. Amazon (AMZN). Oil prices rebounded, but solar stocks crashed.After weeks of the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hitting all-time highs, the Nasdaq eclipsed its 2015 peak. All three major indexes rose fractionally for the week -- the Nasdaq and Dow closed up 0.2% while the S&P 500 climbed 1 point. More quality breakouts appeared. Retailers, energy plays and some hot growth stocks led the market amid earnings reports and higher oil prices. But solar stocks tumbled on weak SunPower (SPWR) guidance. REITs struggled as investors sought growth names -- and worried about store closures.Alibaba reported revenue of $4.84 billion, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $4.53 billion. Revenue rose 59% in local-currency terms, the best gain since Alibaba's September 2014 IPO. EPS rose 33% to 74 cents, beating the consensus of 63 cents.JD.com reported revenue of $9.8 billion, slightly above the consensus and up 42% in local currency. It reported earnings per share of 4 cents, double the 2 cent consensus, but its Q3 revenue estimate fell short of projections. Both companies showed strong growth in mobile users.Alibaba stock soared 16% for the week, breaking out of a base to their highest level since January 2015. JD.com leapt nearly 13%.Next week, messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY), perhaps Alibaba's biggest Chinese rival, reports earnings.

But Russia's energy minister said he didn't see a reason for renewing talks. The International Energy Agency said the oil glut has disappeared, but it warned of weaker demand on a ""dimmer macroeconomic outlook"" in 2017. OPEC said Saudi Arabia pumped a record amount of crude oil in July, and the cartel left its 2017 demand outlook unchanged at 95.41 million barrels per day. The Energy Information Administration said that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.1 million barrels to 523.6 million for the week ended Aug 5. And U.S. production fell by 0.2% to 8.44 million barrels, a second straight week of declines.U.S. oil rigs in operation rose by 15 to 396 in the week ended Aug. 12, Baker Hughes said. That's the seventh straight weekly gain and the highest level since late February.Still, U.S. crude oil prices closed the week at $44.49 a barrel, up 4.4%.Wal-Mart Stores, looking to keep pace with Amazon, agreed to buy Jet.com for $3.3 billion. Wal-Mart has sizable online sales, but growth has been decelerating. Wal-Mart also will put Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of all of Wal-Mart's e-commerce operations, though Jet.com will remain separately. Lore previously founded Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, before Amazon bought it.Wal-Mart stock rose 0.2%, hitting a 14-month high during the week.Solar stocks after SunPower cut its 2016 guidance and inverter-supplier SolarEdge (SEDG) cited a slowdown at U.S. installers. For Q2, SunPower's Q2 revenue growth and adjusted loss topped estimates. But SunPower sees Q3 revenue of just $700 million to $800 million vs. the consensus for $1.13 billion, as demand for utility-scale solar projects tumbles. And SunPower also cut its 2016 view to $2.8 billion-$3 billion, missing analysts' view for $3.3 billion.SolarEdge's $124.8 million in fiscal Q4 sales missed analysts' expectations for $129.4 million, but 44 cents EPS minus items beat by a nickel. The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million-$139 million trailed the consensus at $137 million, and EPS missed by a penny.SolarCity (SCTY), which has agreed to a takeover deal by Tesla (TSLA), topped analysts' Q2 projections for adjusted loss and revenue. But its current-quarter view for $155 million-$168 million in revenue lagged the consensus for $174.6 million.SunPower stock crashed 28% to a 3-year low.Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), involved in everything from gaming to autonomous driving and AI, rose 8.3% for the week to a fresh high after the Tesla partner reported $1.43 billion in sales and 40 cents earnings per share. That topped the consensus for $1.35 billion and 37 cents, and was up 24% and 700%, respectively, vs. last year. Nvidia sees current-quarter sales at $1.68 billion, plus or minus 2%, beating analysts' model for $1.45 billion.With China, telecoms and data centers spending heavily for higher-speed connections, makers of fiber optic components are seeing huge demand.Hot IPO Acacia Communications said Q2 revenue rose 101% to $116 million, and adjusted earnings soared 305%. Lumentum (LITE) and Inphi (IPHI) also reported stronger-than-expected figures. NeoPhotonics (NPTN) sales growth fell short due to sluggish demand for older parts, but production of 100-gigabit gear is ramping up. IBD's 14-company Telecom-Fiber Optics industry group hit a 15-year high Thursday and ranks No. 10 out of 197 groups.Acacia rose 41% Friday and nearly 50% for the week, blasting to new highs. Lumentum rose more than 4% and Inphi 16%, also to new highs. NeoPhotonics climbed 2.6% to 14.01, clearing a 13.85 buy point on Friday.Related:IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications is among several tech leaders that have risen 20% past a buy point, putting them in profit-taking zone. But when you should you sell these top stocks? IBD's latest Tech Leaders column explains when to hold onto winning stocks, and how those rules apply to Acacia, Weibo and others right now.Recent IPO Twilio (TWLO), a communications software firm, reported a narrower than-expected non-GAAP loss. Q2 revenue jumped 70% to $64.5 million, vs. Wall Street estimates of $58.2 million, although sales from its top customer, Facebook (FB)-owned WhatsApp, fell 8% year over year. Twilio's full-year guidance edged consensus estimates.Twilio shares surged 28% for the week, hitting a new high.Medpace Holdings (MEDP) soared 20% to 27.79 in Thursday's debut after pricing at 23, the high end of its expected IPO range. Shares edged up 0.9% to 28.04 on Friday. Medpace provides outsourced clinical development services for drug and medical device companies.Specialty drugmakers ended what had been a strong Q2 season for the drug industry on a more ambiguous note. Allergan (AGN), freshly divested of its generics business, beat expectations slightly but trimmed its sales guidance. Shares fell 1.7% for the week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) missed Q2 numbers but affirmed its guidance as it reorganized. It said its deal with Walgreens (WBA) was finally turning profitable and that it was willing to sell $8 billion worth of non-core assets. The stock soared 25% Tuesday, but pared weekly gains to 13.5% on a report that Valeant could face criminal charges of defrauding insurers.Medivation (MDVN) reported a ho-hum quarter, but profit will likely be flat until an expected market expansion for its drug Xtandi in Q4. Shares rose 4.4% to 66.02, a 14-month high and just barely in buy range from a 63.04 entry. Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) missed EPS estimates and lowered guidance, partly due to a change in tax reporting and partly due to higher costs. Its stock dropped 9.3%. Mylan (MYL) beat its profit estimate slightly and affirmed its guidance, with its controversially high-priced EpiPen making up for light generic drug sales. Mylan closed the week unchanged.Walt Disney (DIS) topped Wall Street estimates late Tuesday and said it had bought a 33% stake in streaming company BAMTech. As it vies to remain competitive in digital, the media conglomerate plans to launch an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, but it will not include current ESPN content. Q3 EPS rose 12% to $1.62 on 9% revenue growth to $14.28 billion. Shares were up about 1% for the week, but failed to hold above their 50-day line.Southwest (LUV) cut its third-quarter unit revenue outlook and said it expected higher unit costs due to 2,000-plus flight cancellations in July after a single router failure blacked out much of its technological infrastructure. The guidance came as Delta Air Lines (DAL) spent much of the week trying to recover from some 2,000 of its own flight cancellations caused by an outage early Monday. American Airlines (AAL), meanwhile, forecast an improvement in its Q3 unit revenue.Southwest and Delta shares fell 3.5% while American Air climbed 1.4%.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) reported lower sales, while Macy's also had declining earnings and said it would cut 100 stores. But they both topped forecasts after weeks of bad news from consumer stocks such as Ford (F) and McDonald's (MCD). So Macy's and Kohl's skyrocketed 16.7% and 14.3%, respectively for the week. Nordstrom (JWN) and JCPenney (JCP) topped on earnings and missed on revenue, with their shares also soaring for the week. But overall, retail sales were flat in July -- and down 0.3% excluding autos -- according to the Commerce Department. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the retailers reporting this coming week.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose to a 14-month high in August, climbing 2.9 points to 48.4. That's still below the neutral 50 level.

514,HD,"No. 3 solar installer SunPower (SPWR) drew First Solar (FSLR), Canadian Solar (CSIQ) and Vivint Solar (VSLR) stocks into an inferno Wednesday after unexpectedly cutting its 2016 outlook, thereby torching its own credibility, according to Credit Suisse analyst Patrick Jobin.IBD's 20-company Energy-Solar industry group toppled 7% to a three-year low Wednesday following mixed earnings reports late Tuesday from SunPower, SolarCity (SCTY) and SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG). SolarEdge cited a slowdown at U.S. installers, reflected in SolarCity's and SunPower's reports.SunPower stock crashed by more than 30% to close at a three-year low of 10.31 on the stock market today. SolarEdge stock was down 9.7%, to 16.82. Bystanders Canadian Solar lost nearly 9% to 13.16, First Solar fell 7.2% to 38.66 and Vivint Solar slid 3.4% to 3.37. SolarCity was off 0.7% to 24.38.IBD'S TAKE: The Energy-Solar industry group ranks No. 196 out of 197 groups tracked. Daqo New Energy stock leads the group with a Composite Rating of 88, but that means it only performs in the top 12% of all stocks in terms of earnings power and growth.The massive deluge was sparked by SunPower's 2016 guidance cut. It sees 2016 revenue of $2.8 billion to $3 billion, up 11% but missing analysts' view (and its own earlier model for $3.3 billion). Also, SunPower cut its EBITDA minus items view by 37% to $275 million-$325 million.It cited competitive PPA (power purchase agreement) pricing, a tepid market for issuing new 8point3 Energy Partners (CAFD) stock and market disruption from the late 2015 extension to the Investment Tax Credit, a key subsidy underpinning the industry. 8point3 is the yield company co-owned with First Solar. Its shares were down 7% midday Wednesday."" ... It is now clear that the team also took too aggressive a stance underwriting utility-scale projects and was slow to react to a changing market,"" Jobin wrote in a research note.SunPower also cut its 2016 deployment view to 1.55 gigawatts at the midpoint vs. its earlier 1.75 GW model. Initial 2017 EBITDA ex items guidance for $350 million was well below the consensus model for $530 million and the rough $540 million guide in November.For Q3, SunPower guided to $700 million to $800 million in sales, lagging far below analysts' $1.13 billion view, and $115 million to $140 million EBITDA minus items. That implies 83% sequential growth in Q4 and the need to sell a minority stake in its Henrietta project to 8point3, Jobin wrote.SunPower said it will move manufacturing assets to Mexico, ramp its Equinox and Helix platforms into the residential segment, and expand its X-series production while ramping its P-series. It will also delay power plant deliveries and deepen its utility buyer universe.""Needless to say, it is an ambitious agenda to pursue with execution under a microscope,"" Jobin wrote. He suggested SunPower start first by ""repairing its reputation."" He slashed his price target on SunPower stock to 12 from 32 and downgraded shares to neutral from an outperform rating.Solar and battery power ""go together like peanut butter and jelly,"" Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said late Tuesday. But the financial community hasn't been gung-ho on Tesla's nearly $3 billion plan to buy ""cousin"" firm SolarCity.""For the quarter, we consumed $216 million (in cash),"" SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive told analysts on the Q2 earnings conference call. ""A big cause of this was the Tesla announcement, and the Tesla announcement delayed our tax equity funds.""Otherwise, SolarCity's Q2 was a beat. Sales of $185.8 million beat analysts' views for $146.1 million and grew 81% vs. last year. Its $2.32 per-share loss ex items topped projections by 12 cents, though widened from a $1.61 loss in Q2 2015.SolarCity wrapped up Q2 with 201 megawatts in installations, beating its earlier 185-MW projection, but slow bookings in Q1 are still reverberating in Q3. For the current quarter, SolarCity guided to 170 MW in installations, down 15% sequentially.That implies Q4 installation of 315 MW to 415 MW to meet its 2016 target for 900 MW to 1.06 GW, Needham analyst Y. Edwin Mok wrote in a report. Mok says it's possible some of those Q4 installations will instead spill over to 2017.But Mok sees SolarCity benefiting from its new 10-year and 20-year loan products, which makes up 19% of gross MW bookings in Q2.SolarEdge and rival Enphase Energy (ENPH) say a slowdown at U.S. residential installers already is reversing, but Needham's Mok says the inverter suppliers could face additional pressure from Chinese competitors looking to flood the market.That happened in 2009, when a glut on component supplies drove pricing down amid slowing demand.But SolarEdge has a structural cost advantage in its HD-Wave technology, Mok wrote. Still, SolarEdge's fiscal Q4 was mixed. Sales missed analysts' projections as the company focused on profitability.For fiscal Q4 ended June 30, SolarEdge reported $124.8 million in sales, up 27% vs. the year-earlier quarter but missing analysts' views for $129.4 million. SolarEdge's 44 cents EPS ex items, however, topped views for 39 cents.The quarter was characterized by ""a general slowdown"" in the residential U.S. market, SolarEdge CEO Guy Sella said in a statement. But SolarEdge increased international sales.The midpoint of current-quarter sales guidance for $130 million to $139 million lagged the consensus view for $137 million. The company's guidance implies 44 cents EPS minus items, trailing expectations by a penny, Mok wrote.

515,HD,"July was a gift. When Brexit -- the U.K's vote to exit the European Union -- clobbered the market on June 24 and 27, few investors dared to be optimistic. But lo and behold, July turned into a rebound month, with U.S. diversified stock mutual funds returning 4.05% on average as the S&P 500 gained 3.69%, according to Lipper Inc.And investors bid the market up despite a lack of a dramatic driver. "" Companies' forward earnings expectations didn't move much, but the prices people were willing to pay for companies on the same earnings have gone up,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. ""So movement in the S&P 500, 90% of it was driven by people willing to pay more for stocks even though earnings didn't move. Only 10% was attributed to earnings moving up.""Going forward, Lafferty's team at Natixis, which has $874.5 billion under management, expects the U.S. to continue to outgrow Europe and Japan. But foreign stocks in general offer better values than U.S. equities. ""So we're leaning more to Europe in developed markets than to the U.S., where share prices already reflect expected growth,"" he said. ""And I'm fairly positive on emerging markets. But you must have a stomach for volatility.""Small-cap growth funds led U.S. diversifieds, gaining 5.77% last month. World equity funds rose 4.24% in July, lagging U.S. diversified stock mutual funds.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersDavid Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial, also sees U.S. growth outpacing the competition. But unlike Lafferty, he's more bullish about prospects for U.S. corporate earnings gains in the second half of the year. ""So looking at world equity markets, the only geography we are overweight in is the U.S.,"" Joy said.Macro trends fuel his outlook. Reported in July, U.S. jobs increased by 287,000 in June, a big jump up from the anemic 11,000 jobs gained in May. ""Retail sales and consumer activity look solid,"" Joy said. ""There was a rebound in manufacturing."" GDP rose at a 1.2% annualized rate in the second quarter, nearly double Q1's 0.8% pace.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance""Those create conditions that could lead to the long-anticipated recovery in earnings in the second half of the year,"" Joy said. ""And we're half through Q2 earnings season. They're not great. But they're a little better than expected.""The S&P 500 is trading at a multiple of about 20 times trailing corporate earnings but only a multiple of 17 on forward earnings. ""That disparity tells me that the market is looking down the road, seeing positive earnings growth, maybe in Q3 or Q4 and into next year,"" Joy added.His team's only sector overweights are in technology and telecommunications.Precious metals funds rose 10.46% last month, topping science and tech funds' 7.50% gain and health/biotech funds' 7.24% advance.""Our attraction to tech varies,"" Joy said. ""A couple of themes include: e-payments, return of capital, dividend yield and quality growth."" Apple (AAPL) and VeriFone Systems (PAY) are examples of companies helped by consumers' increasing use of e-payments, Joy says. Also, Apple boosted its share buyback program in April to $175 billion from $140 billion. Oracle (ORCL) said in March it is buying back $10 billion of shares this year. Cisco Systems (CSCO) carries a 3.4% dividend yield. And Alphabet (GOOGL) has shown durable earnings growth.Telecom is largely a yield play, he said.His team is also overweight in alternative investments to lessen its risk of volatility. ""Also, for investors who have the wherewithal and qualify, we want investments that might produce better returns, like private equity and venture capital,"" he said. ""You give up liquidity, but over time you have the opportunity to outperform.""And Joy warns investors to expect volatility in the run-up to the election, based on past election years. ""If the market is true to history, that will be the case again,"" he said.Volatility could also be fed by coming votes in a number of European nations that could hurt European Union cohesion, he added.Justin Kelly, lead manager of $15.4 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth (MLAIX), says prospects for outperformance are best in three traditionally growth-oriented sectors -- technology, health care and consumer discretionary.In tech, his fund has bet on Alphabet, Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Visa (V).""We like Alphabet based on continued strong market share gains in the global advertising market and improved cost discipline and capital deployment,"" he said.""Facebook is rapidly gaining share of the global advertising market as (advertisers find that) return on investment is much better in online than traditional offline media advertising spending,"" Kelly added. His team likes Microsoft because ""we think (Satya Nadella's) new management team will accelerate the company's earnings per share growth profile as they shift business to the cloud.""Visa (V) has a long-duration growth opportunity as we move from cash and checks to electronic payments, Kelly said. ""And we think they can grow at an above-average rate for a long time,"" he said.In health care, he holds orthopedic and dental implant maker Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) and medical-device maker Boston Scientific (BSX). ""Both have new products that are accelerating their growth and expanding their operating margins,"" he said.In the consumer discretionary sector, his team's bet on Home Depot (HD) reflects optimism about the U.S. housing cycle. ""Home Depot is the best way to play it because they're gaining share. And expanding their margins, they can grow earnings at attractive rates for years to come.""Larry Pitkowsky, co-manager of midcap value $270 million GoodHaven Fund (GOODX), likes sectors and stocks that have been out of favor. Barrick Gold (ABX) edged up 2% in July and was up 196% this year through month end.Q2 earnings per share were up, the second quarter in a row of growth after 12 straight stanzas of declining EPS. The price of bullion has trended higher since December.Barrick Gold has trimmed $968 million in debt year to date and said it is on track to cut debt by $2 billion this year. ""They have reduced leverage and costs,"" Pitkowsky said. ""They are generating earnings and cash flow. There are many ways for them to grow intrinsic value from here.""He also likes Birchcliff Energy. Shares of the Canada-based oil and gas explorer and producer, which are trading below 10, rose 37% in July and were up 134% this year through July 29.EPS has fallen for six quarters, falling faster the two most recent quarters.Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual FundsClick Here To See A List Of Latest Sells Of Top Mutual Funds

517,HD,"The consumer is back. So are jobs. Services prices are increasing at the fastest pace in more than seven years. Even industrial production, the economy's weakest link, is back on the rise. Stocks have shrugged off Brexit and are trading at record highs.What more does the Federal Reserve need to resume nudging up interest rates from close to zero?June sales surged 3.9% at building material and garden stores like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), the Commerce Department said Friday. Sales from nonstore retailers led by Amazon (AMZN) continued to impress, rising 1.1% on the month and 14.2% from a year ago. The latter was the strongest gain in a decade.Overall, retail sales rose 0.6%, triple the estimated gain. Auto sales edged up 0.1%, amid a down month for General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM), but gains at Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Core retail sales, excluding frequently volatile auto, gas and building material sales, rose 0.5% for a second straight month, following a 1.1% gain in April.The economy likely grew at a 2.75% annual rate in the second quarter, propelled by a gain of at least 4% in real consumer spending, says Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research.Yet he expects the Fed to stay on hold through the U.S. presidential election, then hike its key interest rate a quarter-point in December. Markets don't see another rate hike until March 2017, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool.But markets have been on a roller-coaster ride since they woke up after the U.K. Brexit vote results came in on June 23. Stocks initially tumbled, but the S&P 500 and Dow industrials hit all-time highs this week. After falling to a historic low of 1.34% before last week's June employment report, the 10-year Treasury yield has bounced back to 1.59%. That jobs report, showing a 287,000 increase in payrolls, erased concerns caused by the negligible May payroll gain.For now, yields may keep rising without a Fed hike because markets might start to price in a faster pace of rate increases in 2017 and 2018.Fed policymakers have signaled that they want time to assess the impact of the U.K. voting to leave the European Union. Initial indications are that the vote will hurt the U.K. but shouldn't be much of a negative for the U.S., which got a short-term boost from lower interest rates that fueled a surge of mortgage refinancing.While eurozone economies are expected to face a drag from weaker trade with the U.K., the real wild card is whether the political backlash that spurred the Brexit vote spreads to other parts of Europe, especially Italy. The next shoe to drop could come in October, when Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's package of constitutional reforms meant to overcome gridlock faces a referendum.If Renzi's vote fails, he'll be on the way out, and the vacuum could put the anti-EU Five Star Movement in the driver's seat. But all that could take a year or more to play out, and the odds of Italy ever abandoning the euro are slim.Bottom line, European politics are unlikely to provide the Fed much of an excuse to stay on the sideline for long, particularly if core inflation continues to pick up.The core CPI, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2% in June and 2.3% from a year ago. The annual gain matched the biggest increase since September 2008.Services inflation, excluding energy services, rose 3.2% from a year ago in June, also matching May's gain for the biggest since September 2008.The Fed has set a 2% inflation target. But the central bank's preferred price gauge, the PCE deflator in the income and spending report, showed only a 1.6% annual gain as of May.Food prices fell 0.1% in June, as the price of food consumed at home fell 0.3% and the food away from home rose 0.2%. Now, food at home costs 1.3% less than a year ago, while food away from home is up 2.6%. That pricing differential may be among the reasons why fast-food chains like McDonald's (MCD) and Wendy's (WEN) have a seen a slowdown.Sales at food services and drinking places fell 0.3% in May, one of the softest spots in an otherwise solid retail report.Meanwhile, industrial production perked up 0.6% in June, the best gain in 11 months. Manufacturing output rose 0.4%, mining 0.2% and utilities 2.4%. That's the first time all year that each of the three categories saw an increase.Overnight, China said the world's No. 2 economy expanded 6.7% in the second quarter vs. a year earlier, matching Q1's pace. Economists had expected a dip to 6.6%. Meanwhile, separate June reports on industrial production, retail sales and bank loans all showed accelerating growth, topping forecasts.
"
518,HD,"June retail sales rose much more than expected, led by Amazon.com (AMZN) and other e-commerce. Meanwhile, underlying inflation matched its highest level in nearly nine years.Retail sales rose 0.6% last month the Commerce Department said Friday. That was much more than the 0.1% gain expected, but May's advance was revised down to 0.2% from 0.5%. Sales rose 0.7% excluding autos vs. views of 0.5%. Sales rose 0.7% excluding autos and gas vs. forecasts of 0.3%.Year over year, retail sales rose 2.7%. They climbed 3.2% excluding autos, their best gain since November 2014.Gains were broad-based, though apparel was weak.Building material stores such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) sales shot up 3.9%, their best gain since 2010, after some recent weakness.Nonstore sales, mostly e-commerce, remained strong, climbing 1.1% vs. May. Nonstore sales shot up 14.2% vs. a year earlier, the best in 10 years. Amazon has accounted for a huge share of e-commerce growth in recent years. The latest figures don't include the July 12 Amazon Prime Day.On the downside, apparel store sales fell 1%. Auto sales edged higher after falling in May. Industry reports from General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and others pointed to plateauing U.S. demand.Still, the overall strong retail sales data contradict the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report that saw some ""softening"" in consumer spending.Amazon shares fell less than 1% Friday morning on the stock market today. General Motors, Ford, Home Depot and Lowe's all rose fractionally.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon is working on its fourth straight modest loss, but is still near its record high set Tuesday morning. The stock is performing very well, but it's far too extended from a proper buy point. For detailed chart analysis of this long-time winner, go to IBD Leaderboard.Meanwhile, consumer prices rose 0.2% in June, the Labor Department said. Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, also rose 0.2%. Core consumer inflation climbed to 2.3%, matching February's peak. It hasn't been higher since September 2008.Also, the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Index dipped to 0.55 in July from June's 6.01. That's just above break-even, suggesting slight expansion in New York-are factories. Economists had expected 5.0.Today's data followed last week's much-stronger-than-expected June payrolls gain and 16-month-high reading in the ISM manufacturing index. While fed funds futures currently aren't pricing in much of a chance of rate hike in 2016, the idea no longer seems completely off the table.June industrial production rose 0.6%, the best gain in 11 months, the Federal Reserve said. Economists predicted a 0.4% rise. May's 0.4% decline was revised to -0.3%. Manufacturing output rose 0.4%, slightly better than targets, reversing May's 0.4% loss.

Revenue grew 11% to $84.3 million, just above views for $83.1 million.Earnings growth has slowed from 167%, 167% and 75% in the respective past three quarters. Sales growth was the weakest in six quarters. Same-store sales climbed 8.2%, a solid gain but also decelerating.Tile Shop forecast full-year EPS of 41-45 cents, up from its prior range of 40-45 cents. But that's still below views for 45 cents, even with Q2's 1-cent beat. Tile Shop sees full-year revenue of $322 million to $329 million, up from its prior target of $320 million-$329 million. The new midpoint of $325.5 million is slightly below Wall Street predictions for $327 million.Tile Shop tumbled 9.7% to 17.84 by the close on the stock market today. That undercuts a late June buy point of 19.16 from a cup-with-handle base, which followed an April breakout from an earlier consolidation. The stock on Tuesday also fell below its 50-day moving average, which it has generally exceeded for the past four months.IBD'S TAKE: Tile Shop had been a leader in the Retail/Wholesale Building Products group, which has been faring well. Lowe's (LOW) is still in buying range, while Home Depot (HD) shares are near a buy point. See how Tile Shop compares with the leaders in its group at IBD Stock Checkup.

525,HD,"CyberArk Software (CYBR) garnered another buyout prediction Wednesday, as Summit Redstone relaunched coverage with a buy rating on CyberArk stock, saying its double-digit growth trajectory makes it a ""compelling"" acquisition candidate.Summit analyst Srini Nandury expects the information security company to continue to gain from the high-profile breaches of Home Depot (HD) and Target (TGT), and the whistleblower cases involving Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning) and Edward Snowden, because of the niche that CyberArk fills in privileged account security.""Unlike other parts of the security landscape, privileged account security (PAS) still remains a greenfield opportunity given that businesses have under-invested for a long time, leaving their critical infrastructure vulnerable,"" Nandury wrote in a research report.CyberArk has near-term and first-mover advantages, but could see rivalry from Exceedium (acquired last year by CA (CA)), Lieberman Software, Centrify and BalaBit.Total addressable market estimates range from $2 billion to $10 billion, Nandury wrote.CyberArk is ""profitable and prolifically cash-generating,"" making it a rarity among rivals, he wrote. Over the past six quarters, CyberArk beats sales views by 20% and EPS views by even more, he said.""We expect the beats and raises to continue, driven by elevated spending and increased sales capacity,"" Nandury wrote.He has a 55 price target on CyberArk stock, which rose 2.3% to 46.54 on the stock market today.

526,HD,"How does an investor steer a straight course when governments, central banks, and companies around the world are muddling through monetary policy, foisting shocks like Brexit on the markets, and grappling with diminished profits?It begins by keeping a sense of perspective, said one investing expert at the 2016 UBS CIO Global Forum held on Tuesday at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles.""We need to recognize that we're in a maturing bull market; we're not seeing signs of an emerging bear market"" yet, Jeremy Zirin of UBS (UBS) Wealth Management Americas, which organized the event, told an audience of more than 200 of the firm's financial advisors and their typically high-net-worth clients.Moreover, he added, ""the worst of the headwinds"" of the recent past -- a rout in energy prices and a strong dollar -- is behind investors.The annual event, now in its third year, brought to the fore for its more than 200 attendees key topics impacting the market landscape, from the November U.S. election to the just-transpired Brexit referendum to the impact of program traders on execution of trade orders.How does an election year affect your investment thinking, moderator Steven Schroko of UBS asked the panelists at a session titled ""Equities: Prognosis for an aging bull market.""The short answer, Charles Brandes, chairman and founder of Brandes, a leading investment advisory firm, replied, is it doesn't.""We look around the world to find good businesses trading at a significant discount for one reason or another,"" he went on to explain. ""Long term, the question is, do I want to own that business, not who is the political head of these countries.""An instant audience poll followed and found that a majority of attendees expect the U.S. to outpace other countries for the best equity returns over the next six months.That led Schroko to ask: Does diversifying into global markets still make sense?Kent Whitaker, a research analyst at independent money manager Davis Advisors, responded that he constructs portfolios with a long-term view and was excited by some European opportunities. ""There are individual companies that tend to go on sale in events like Brexit,"" or Britons' vote to leave the European Union, he said. One he particularly likes Safran, a French manufacturer of jet engines that is growing at a tidy clip within a slow-growth industry and has a ""fantastic franchise.""Brandes pointed to Sberbank, Russia's biggest bank, as another quality international stock. The conservatively run company, he said, was focused on cutting costs and paid an attractive 6% dividend.Schroko then turned his attention to program traders and flash traders, whose computerized, high-volume trades execute automatically when index prices rise or slide to a certain level.""They've added to intraday market volatility,"" Robert Doll, chief equity strategist at asset manager Nuveen, said. ""As a portfolio manager, I embrace it rather than be a victim. I use more limit orders than I used to in the middle of the day.""Zirin and Brandes broadly agreed with Doll. Whitaker added that while he doesn't like program trading, the higher volatility it can create offers opportunities to capture a stock at below its underlying value.""I don't associate volatility with risk in any way,"" Whitaker said, noting it had helped him to some ""home runs"" in the stock market.Schroko proceeded to ask the panelists about their highest conviction ideas over the next six to 12 months.Whitaker said the dislocations in the market had created opportunities in financials and energy. As an example, he cited Apache Energy (APA), which can look forward to decades of drilling opportunities in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. ""We like to align with managers that understand how to create long-term value in the business,"" he added.Zirin responded that consumer discretionary stocks look attractive to his team, which does top-down work on industries and sectors. Consumer discretionary, he explained, was largely insulated from risks stemming from outside the U.S. and American consumers' spending power is looking the strongest it has in roughly 15 years. He singled out housing-related companies such as Home Depot (HD), which are seeing pent-up demand for their goods and services.Doll, of Nuveen, replied he was long the S&P 500 and short the 10-Year Treasury. Recently he has added to Delta Airlines (DAL), a stock that has sold off hard but belongs to an industry that is increasingly efficient. He's trimmed his position in Verizon (VZ), a stock that's had a nice run-up in the past year.Other panels at the one-day event grappled with macroeconomic challenges, low yields in fixed income, multiasset portfolios and emerging trends in the wealth management industry.

529,HD,"The stock market was nicely higher in morning trading Thursday, as Wall Street seemed confident that the U.K. would end up staying in the European Union. The results of the referendum will be out well after the U.S. markets close.Early gainers in the Dow included JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), up 2% and 2.5%, respectively. Home Depot (HD) was fractionally higher after climbing as much as 1.2% on a Nomura upgrade to buy from neutral and a price target hike to 155 from 140.The Nasdaq rose 1.1% while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 1%. Early data had NYSE and Nasdaq volume tracking higher than Wednesday's levels.Nasdaq 100 component Priceline (PCLN) cleared a 1374.08 buy point, rising 2% to about 1387. The online travel firm has recovered nicely after an earnings sell-off in early May. In the stock market today, Red Hat (RHT) was the latest earnings casualty despite reporting its third straight quarter of accelerating sales growth. Earnings per share rose 14% from a year earlier, while sales grew 18% to $567.9 million. Investors got spooked after Red Hat said its acquisition of 3Scale would lower adjusted earnings in the current quarter by a penny, and by 3 cents for the fiscal year. Shares fell 4%.Early gainers in the IBD 50 included Acuity Brands (AYI). Shares rose nearly 1% as Acuity tried to reclaim its 50-day moving average ahead of next week's earnings report. A 260.93 flat-base buy point is still in play for the LED lighting firm.In IPO news, Twilio (TWLO) priced last night at 15, above the proposed range of 12-14. On Thursday morning, shares opened up 60% to 23.99 and are currently up 71% to 25.68. Twilio provides a cloud communications platform for adding voice, messaging and video to mobile apps. According to Renaissance Capital, Twilio is the first IPO to price above its proposed range since December.In economic news, weekly jobless claims tumbled to an eight-week low of 259,000 from 277,000 the prior week. Economists expected a much smaller drop to 270,000. May new-home sales fell 6%.
"
530,HD,"They're leaving!After weeks of U.K. public opinion swinging back and forth, on Thursday the United Kingdom shockingly voted to leave the European Union. The outcome forced the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron.Early Friday, the British pound plunged as much as 11% and the euro sagged as much as 4%. U.S. markets were expected to be highly volatile Friday. The turmoil was expected to put the kabosh on any Federal Reserve interest-rate hike in the near term.Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said, ""There is little point in investors taking precipitate portfolio action, as selling what you wish you had sold yesterday is rarely the right reaction in markets dominated by position-adjustment and recalibration of expectations. Better to wait for opportunities to be revealed by volatility than to be part of it.""Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy, State Street Global Markets, said, ""In the three months before the referendum it was noticeable that international investors increased their holdings of U.K. equities ... in spite of the uncertainties created by the vote. The only place where investor behavour changed was in the currency market where investors hedged their currency risk. While this hedging has proven prescient given sterling's depreciation following the vote, the key question now is whether international investors will now seek to reduce their underlying holdings of U.K. assets. If the uncertainty following the leave vote persists and because investors bought rather than sold U.K. assets before the vote, there is a heightened risk of outflows from both U.K. equities . . .""So how should U.S. investors play the situation?Mutual fund managers and investment strategists with whom Investor's Business Daily spoke advised investors to stick with their long-term investment plans. Still, some say they had hedged their exposure to the pound and euro.Several said that within their overall strategy they are tilting toward U.S. stocks, especially those that draw little if any of their revenues from abroad. Some are tilting toward emerging markets.A key question facing U.S. investors is: Should you trim your weightings to stocks, mutual funds or ETFs with exposure to the U.K. or the rest of Europe? That would cut your losses if U.K. or other European stocks lose more ground.But what if you get out and the market rallies without you?""You can miss a lot of whatever rally takes place,"" said David Tannehill, head of the investment group of Regions Wealth Management.And the question does not become moot now that the voting has concluded. The vote for Brexit starts a two-year process in which the U.K. and EU would renegotiate a bevy of trade pacts. Prospects for U.K. and continental stocks almost certainly would rise and fall like a teeter-totter on every little stock market news report.""Markets will not stop functioning during those two years,"" said Alessio de Longis, who is a manager of four OppenheimerFunds with assets totaling $1.6 billion. ""It will be a period of extended volatility.""De Longis, who also leads macro strategy for the global multi-asset group at OppenheimerFunds,  thinks it will not be a seismic disturbance for which investors must reshape their investment plans.""We don't expect it to be a (systemically disruptive) event with catastrophic market action,"" he said. ""We may get one month of volatility and noise and erratic action. But at the end of the day, it won't be a Lehman Bros.-type event. It won't force the rest of the market to make fire sales, stop trading and disrupt capital flows.""Late last year, de Longis' team hedged all of its British pound sterling and almost all of its euros by shorting currency forwards. In addition, his team went long on the Japanese yen with currency forwards, betting that it will appreciate as investors seek non-European safe havens.Since Dec. 31, De Longis' team has also more than doubled his $1.5 billion Global Allocation Fund's (QVGIX) weight in emerging markets stocks.As of April 30, its emerging markets stocks included China's internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), India's real estate lender Housing Development Finance and its media company Zee Entertainment Enterprises, Korea's cigarette seller KT&G, chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Brazil's stock exchange operator BM&F Bovespa, according to Morningstar Inc.At this point, de Longis cautions investors, it is probably too late to hedge the pound or euro.""With the pound sterling, volatility is insanely high and bid-ask spreads -- for, say, one-week or one-month options -- are very expensive,"" he said. Over the long term, it would typically take just a 0.5% drop in value for a hedge to become profitable. By Tuesday, it took a 2.5% move.Bob Doll, a manager of nine Nuveen Asset Management funds with $1.1 billion in assets, intends to stick by his broader, overall investment plan.""There is more economic weakness and more uncertainty outside the U.S. than inside,"" he said. ""Therefore, I have chosen companies that get most of their revenues here. With or without Brexit, this is the best house in a bad neighborhood.""Doll, who who is also Nuveen's chief equity strategist, has lightened his exposure to multinationals. Also, he lightened exposure to financials in April.His flagship $250 million Large Cap Core Fund (NLACX) had 99% of its shareholders' money at work in North American stocks as of May 31. The balance of its holdings were in Asian emerging markets.Apple (AAPL), Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) were his top five holdings.Like Doll, Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, tilts toward U.S. stocks as safer than U.K. and EU equities. She also favors small caps.Aside from the Brexit question, she has been waiting for emerging markets stocks to rally. She says they are undervalued and have become one of the few options for yield-hungry investors in a low-rate world.She's also keeping an eye on beaten-down European stocks.If Brexit had been defeated, her team intended to add that market to the mix of undervalued securities. Natural resources producer Glencore is one such name.""Europe has benefited from the recovery in commodity prices,"" Rathbun said. ""They suffered from a quick drop. But they are diversified and positioned to do well.""The dollar has trended down since February, which has buoyed commodity prices. The downside risk for Glencore is that commodity prices are tied to the price of the dollar. If the Federal Reserve raises rates, that would strengthen the dollar, putting downward pressure on commodity prices.Among U.S. stocks, she likes paint maker Sherwin-Williams (SHW).""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession,"" Rathbun said. ""But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home improvement projects.""

533,HD,"Economists have been puzzled all year over how retail employment has surged despite the fact that Wal-Mart (WMT), Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and other major players were closing stores and laying off thousands of workers.The retail hiring boom has been happening even as customers have accelerated their shift to nonstore retailers like Amazon (AMZN). Meanwhile, Home Depot (HD), the leader in a category that has done relatively well in fending off online competition, stopped opening new stores in the U.S. more than a year ago.Nevertheless, retailers have added 323,300 workers over the past year -- a spurt of growth that's nearly the best since 2000.Getting to the bottom of this mystery is important because the explanation suggests that the job market hasn't been quite as strong as it appears, yet there may be less slack in the labor market due to Obama administration policies than dovish Federal Reserve policymakers suspect.Early in June, Jefferies fixed-income economists Ward McCarthy and Thomas Simons noted the ""incongruous"" retail job gains of more than 50,000 per month during the first quarter, and they predicted some payback with a weak reading in May's employment report. Yet even though the overall report was lousy, with a net 25,000 private-sector jobs added, retailers accounted for nearly half of those gains.Given the sector fundamentals, it makes little sense that retailers would need to bolster their ranks in a big way. But upon closer examination, they really haven't: While they may have more workers, they aren't doing more work. Since August, the retail sector has added more than a quarter-million jobs, but aggregate hours worked haven't budged. While seasonally adjusted retail employment has climbed 1.6%, those nearly 16 million workers are clocking 1.6% fewer hours, as the workweek has slumped from 31.5 hours to 31.0.Supermarkets are a notable example: Over the two past years, employment is up by 70,000, or 2.9%, but the sector's 2.5 million workers are working, in aggregate, 1.5% fewer hours per week.Here's the puzzle: Shorter workweeks and more part-time workers are supposed to be evidence of slack in the labor market, giving employers some flexibility to raise hours and easing the pressure to hike wages. Yet take a look at the supermarket sector, where wage gains have accelerated to more than 6% from a year ago, even as the average workweek has shrunk -- to a record-short 27.8 hours for nonsupervisors in April from 29.5 hours two years ago.The logical takeaway is that there may be less labor market slack than there appears to be, and Obama administration regulations offer a likely explanation because they're designed to make employers pay a stiff price for longer workweeks.ObamaCare's employer mandate requires companies with at least 50 full-time-equivalent workers to offer ""affordable"" coverage to workers who average 30 or more hours per week. Fines for failing to comply range from $2,160 to $3,240 per worker in 2016. Because those fines aren't deductible from taxes, they equate to between $3,547 and $5,123 in pretax wages. In other words, there's a big potential cost cliff for allowing workers to exceed 29.9 hours per week.While the ObamaCare employer mandate hasn't led to the dramatic work-hour cuts that some critics feared, that's likely because employers have figured out how to minimize liability by offering coverage that qualifies as ""affordable"" even if it costs far more than low-wage workers can pay. Yet the mandate has clearly had an effect: The number of U.S. workers clocking just above 30 hours has fallen to a record low relative to those with work hours just below ObamaCare's full-time threshold.The second regulation that will encourage shorter workweeks is the Department of Labor's new overtime rule that will require time-and-a-half pay above 40 hours per week for salaried workers who make up to $47,476 per year, up from $23,660 currently. While the rule change won't take effect until December, it was first proposed in June 2015, so employers have had a chance to begin reacting.Asking full-time workers to clock in excess of 40 hours per week has allowed employers to spread out the costs of benefits over more hours, reducing per-hour compensation costs. But overtime pay eliminates that as a cost-saving option.For retailers seeing their profit margins squeezed by higher wages and online competition, these two regulations add costs for both full-time workers and for part-timers working at least 30 hours per week. In that context, it's not entirely surprising to see a shift to a lower average workweek.Yet it's not just employers who have an incentive to hold down work hours or face a cost cliff. ObamaCare also provides such incentives to modest-wage workers who, along with their spouses, lose eligibility for subsidies via HealthCare.gov and the state insurance exchanges if they work at least 30 hours and their employer offers health coverage.For a full-time worker earning $17,500, paying $1,690 for bronze coverage with a $5,000-plus deductible qualifies as ""affordable."" That's $1,000 more than someone at the same income level would have to pay for an exchange plan that caps total out-of-pocket expenses at about $550 in 2016.

"
537,HD,"In 1981, Toro Co. (TTC) flirted with the prospect of bankruptcy. Thirty-five years later, it’s reporting record results.It's safe to say the Bloomington, Minn.-based maker of lawnmowers, snow blowers and other outdoor equipment -- a mainstay in superstore retailers like Home Depot (HD) -- has persevered. Founded in 1914, Toro has been through two world wars, the Great Depression and countless recessions.But it was the company's rebound from near death to surging growth that provides a case study in sustained innovation.""It was unleashing the power of our people to understand we needed to innovate and drive performance,"" Mike Hoffman, Toro’s chairman and chief executive, told IBD.Hoffman, 61, joined Toro during a heady period. In the 1970s, the company grew from $200 million to $400 million in sales.""We were flying high,"" he recalled. ""It was an exciting time.""By the second half of 1980, though, years of steady expansion dissolved into a crisis. Though it already survived a number of economic downturns, Toro was hit hard by the recession that ushered in the Ronald Reagan administration. At the time, it was reported that the company made a series of missteps and was stuck with large inventories due to lack of rain and snow.Instead of declaring bankruptcy, Toro began retrenching and cut production. It also drastically reduced its employee ranks, trimming staff by more than half and eliminating virtually all management positions.The company turned to Ken Melrose as its new CEO, and he initiated a concept called ""servant leadership."" Melrose determined that rank-and-file employees were the real strength of Toro, so he kept stock options for higher-ups to a minimum and gave all workers a share as a symbolic act. From there, he created a 401(k) that rewarded employees annually with new shares of stock. Names on employee badges were followed by the word ""Owner.""""If we did have to cut wages and salaries, we started with the officers, and then the management (e.g., no bonuses first, then salary reductions, and so forth),"" Melrose would later say. ""Our plan was to protect the lower-paid employees as long as we could.""The strategy worked, said Hoffman, who joined the company in 1977 as a 22-year-old service representative and took over for Melrose as CEO in 2005. He has kept Melrose's corporate philosophy intact to this day.Toro now commands more than $2.4 billion in annual sales and has roughly 6,000 employees. In addition to commanding shelf space at Home Depot, Toro has a presence in 90 countries, making irrigation and outdoor lighting gear in addition to lawnmowers and snow blowers. Toro also makes professional gear for golf courses and sports fields.For Hoffman, employee engagement and innovation go hand in hand. With his strong technical background, Hoffman thrives on finding fixes to thorny problems. He asks his assistant to schedule ""MBWA time,"" or ""managing by wandering around."" He likes to chat with employees at all levels.When he visits with engineers or technicians, he often asks what they're working on and encourages them to share problems that they’re trying to solve. In some cases, he’ll roll up his sleeves and explore solutions with them.""Sometimes, there’s more than one right answer,"" he said. ""There are alternative ways to solve a problem.""Toro also has grown largely through a series of internal initiatives that often span three years, though not always.""Prior to each initiative that we’ve launched, we’ve engaged employees to get input,"" Hoffman said. ""We pick a group of people across the enterprise and ask, 'What should we consider next?' and 'What learning needs to happen?'""The first was a three-year program called ""Five-By-Five"" from 2001-03 designed to get after-tax profits up to 5%. Then there was ""Six Plus Eight,"" geared to up profits to 6% and boost revenue growth by 8%, from 2004-06.The one program that didn't accomplish its goals, ""Grow Lean,"" ran from 2007 to 2009, through the heart of the recession. That was followed by a one-year plan, ""Five In One,"" designed to restore profits to 5%. The focus shifted in 2011 to a four-year plan, ""Destination 2014,"" to boost organic revenue growth and operational earnings. Toro's current three-year program, ""Destination Prime,"" has similar goals and began in 2015.""They’ve set these three-year specific targets for employees on where they expect their business to be,"" said Jim Barrett, managing director at C.L. King & Associates in New York City. ""By and large, they’ve met those targets.""How? Toro employees test ideas to improve product quality and solve customers’ problems. In 2008, for example, customers sought to conserve water. So Toro rolled out its Precision Series spray nozzles that cut overall water use by as much as 30%.Two years later, the push to reduce emissions and boost energy efficiency led the company to introduce the industry’s first push mower powered by a lithium-ion battery for golf greens called the Toro Greensmaster eFlex.""Toro has a history of innovation,"" said Barrett, who has followed the company since 2008. ""In areas such as golf (course) irrigation and turf maintenance, they continue to innovate to reduce customers’ labor expense or improve their overall efficiency.""Shares now are near an all-time high, and ended trading down slightly to 86 on Monday. Shares fell as much as 4% on a rating downgrade to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" from Sidoti on Friday, falling below their 50-day moving average, but close to their high. But the company remains tops in its industry in terms of stock performance and getting a 93 composite rating out of a possible 99 by IBD.Despite that, Barrett lauds Toro’s commitment to frugality and controlling costs.""In 2009, Toro was the only company that I follow to take a management pay cut,"" Barrett said. ""They didn’t have to do it. No one made them. But its leaders sent a signal to employees that management was tightening its belt.""In Toro’s biggest businesses such as commercial landscaping and golf course maintenance, the company has established strong customer loyalty. And demographic trends bode well for its future.""An aging population means more people are outsourcing lawn mowing,"" Barrett said. ""Commercial landscaping is a much healthier segment growth-wise than golf.""He adds that as long as landscaping crews continue to mow lawns and maintain golf courses, their machines will run hard and wear down over time. That’s good news for Toro.""If Toro has a better mousetrap to offer, the temptation to invest in a new machine with new features will be stronger than fixing the broken one,"" he said.

538,HD,"HD Supply (HDS) on Tuesday reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates, with the company providing upbeat guidance but coming up short on revenue.The industrial supplies distributor said net revenue rose 7% to $1.78 billion, lighter than analysts' consensus for $1.84 billion. Preliminary net sales for May grew 4% to $609 million.""Preliminary May performance was negatively affected by approximately 100 basis points associated with weather,"" the company said in the earnings statement.Adjusted earnings rose 54% to 51 cents a share, topping views by 4 cents. It has beaten quarterly earnings estimates for the last two years. Although still strong, its profit growth rate was the slowest in a year.HD Supply forecast second-quarter sales of $2 million to $2.05 million, below Wall Street’s $2.12 billion target, and diluted earnings of 85-90 cents a share, well above views for 84 cents a share.On May 31, HD Supply concluded the sale of its Interior Solutions business, formerly known as Creative Touch Interiors, to Interior Specialists for an undisclosed sum.HD Supply shares rose 2.4% to 35.77 in the stock market today.

541,HD,"Stocks pared losses Tuesday afternoon ahead of Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision on short-term interest rates.Meanwhile, some NYSE-listed British companies, including Unilever (UN), got doused with more heavy selling, falling nearly 2%, as angst apparently is increasing over how Britons will vote in a June 23 referendum regarding staying in or leaving the European Union.The Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average all nursed losses of 0.4%, after falling 0.6% or more in late morning action. Volume picked up on both exchanges vs. the same time on Monday.The U.K. is not the only country harboring anti-EU sentiments. A movement in the Netherlands to leave the union has also reportedly gained strength. No wonder, then, that Unilever, which has major operations in both Great Britain and Holland, is getting whacked hard in recent days as investors ponder the tax and business consequences of a British exit.The stock dropped to as low as 42.69 in heavy volume. The food and personal care products powerhouse also undercut its 200-day moving average, a long-term trend line that recently tilted upward.Unilever, which reports results on a semiannual basis and not quarterly, is an excellent example of a long-term income play, and it's actually quite suitable for income investors. The reasons include the following: 1) Its IBD 3-year earnings stability factor of 3 on a scale of zero (extremely stable) to 99 (extremely volatile); the annualized dividend yield of 3% is much higher than the S&P 500's yield of 2.1% (as of Monday's close); and 3) both operating cash flow and pretax margins continue to be robust, further reducing the likelihood that cash payouts diminish or get canceled.As a growth stock, however, Unilever draws inferior ratings at IBD Stock Checkup, including a 49 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99, a 58 for EPS Rating (based on near-term and three-to-five-year profit growth rates). The 63 Relative Strength Rating is not bad, reflecting the super-long sideways motion of the stock. Unilever hit an all-time high of 47.90 on April 19 before pulling back.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, a few retail plays bucked the general market decline following a better-than-expected U.S. retail sales report. Restaurant chain Dave & Buster's (PLAY) lifted 1.9% to 47.72 in strong turnover. That put the stock 13% past a 42.22 cup-with-handle buy point, so Dave & Buster's is extended in price for now.The IBD 50 stock holds a 98 Composite Rating, bolstered by strong EPS growth in recent quarters (up 51% in Q4 of FY 2016 and up 57% in Q1 ended in April). Dave & Buster's achieves high profit margins and robust sales gains in large part to its plethora of video game and amusement options within each restaurant.Five Below (FIVE), another member of the IBD 50, climbed 1.5% to 44.64, up 13% from a breakout within a choppy base at 39.62. The seller of goods priced $5 and below is No. 7 in the IBD 50 as seen in Monday's IBD Weekly Edition.Home improvement chains soured as the U.S. retail sales report revealed a disappointing 1.8% drop in sales at building materials and garden equipment stores. Home Depot (HD) slumped nearly 2% to 125.60, undercutting its key 200-day moving average in heavy trading. The retailing giant recently gave back all gains from a March 29 low-volume move past a 132.23 double-bottom-with-handle buy point. Rival Lowe's (LOW) fell 2% to 75.95, taking out its 50-day line in big volume.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market's current outlook was downgraded from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure."" This means an investor can still buy stocks that break out from properly formed bases, but the probability of making money is lower given the increased intensity of professional selling. The Nasdaq composite saw its distribution day count (denoting heavy selling) rise back to 4.Is your stock is best in class within its industry group in terms of profit growth, margins, sales, return on equity, institutional fund sponsorship and relative price strength?

545,HD,"Stock indexes posted solid price gains in declining volume Monday, holding firm after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's vague remarks about timing for the next rate hike.The Nasdaq gripped a 0.7% gain, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 rose 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running behind Friday's pace.Yellen, head of the U.S. central bank, said Friday's jobs numbers were disappointing and dropped any reference to the timing of the next rate hike.Bank stocks did well, apparently on the conviction that a rate hike is inevitable, even if the timing is unclear. Chicago-based PrivateBancorp (PVTB) retook a 43.22 buy point after closing below the entry Friday. The stock popped 3% in volume 35% above average. A rate hike would probably help swell profits at banks.Phoenix-based Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL) also reclaimed a 37.58 buy point, under which it had retreated on Friday. The stock climbed about 2%, but volume was about 10% below average. Western Alliance joined IBD Leaderboard as a potential true stock market leader on May 25.Blue chips were mostly up, but falling shares of Home Depot (HD) attracted the heaviest volume in the Dow.

For the first five months of 2016, closings rose 35.5%.LGI's move adds to a rally in homebuilding stocks, most of which remain in deep price consolidations.

He says those growth rates are consistent with the past two years.Palo Alto, Fortinet and Check Point all had been hot stocks in 2014 and much of 2015 on the strength of their broad security platforms, but not this year. The focus has shifted to specific security areas such as privileged account management, email and cloud security, and endpoint protection, analysts say. So, while some vendors might be slowing, others are rising, Owens says.Fears of a broad security slowdown go back to last year, Owens told IBD.""We've been having this end-of-the-world discussion for a year now,"" he said. ""Certain vendors that may have been growing at rapid rates (have) decelerated.""Palo Alto Networks -- the No. 2 security software company by market cap, behind Check Point -- is an industry bellwether.Last month, Palo Alto disappointed Wall Street. It guided to 37% year-over-year sales growth for the current quarter, which would be great for most companies but would represents the highflier's slowest-ever growth. Last quarter was the first in eight where its sales rose less than 50%.But the slowdown is relative, Pacific Crest's Owens says.""Palo Alto will continue to perform well, but it can't continue to grow at four times the industry,"" he said. ""Fifty percent to 60% growth is unsustainable.""Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski anticipated slow April demand for Palo Alto products, citing checks with resellers.But Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick characterized the April slowdown as a ""blip"" in a typically seasonally weak quarter. She blamed FireEye CEO David DeWalt for the panic. During FireEye's fiscal Q3 earnings call in November 2015, DeWalt said ""emergency spending"" in the wake of the notable Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) breaches had normalized.""The CEO of FireEye last year said, 'You're just not having all these big breaches and we're not getting attacked from China as much, so spending is slow,'"" she said. ""So, everyone has been chanting the mantra.""(DeWalt is set to step down June 15, leaving COO and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia to take the reins. FireEye acquired Mandiant in 2014.)Palo Alto Networks wasn't the only pure player to spot braking growth. On May 5, FireEye guided to its slowest quarter ever, and Imperva's outlook for this quarter would mark a fourth straight quarter of sales deceleration. In April, Check Point guided to 6% growth for Q2, down from six straight periods of 9% growth.Fortinet expects sales growth to slow to 27% in Q2 from 34% growth in the prior quarter. And even email specialist Proofpoint -- among those analysts peg as on the rise -- guided to its slowest quarterly growth in 11 quarters, to 32% growth from 37% the prior quarter.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group reflects fears of a general tech slowdown. The group was down as much as 34% for the year in early February, hitting a two-year low, as many tech stocks tanked on dour views from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA). The group has since recovered in part, but is still down nearly 16% for the year.Cybersecurity Ventures Managing Editor Steve Morgan says pure players like Palo Alto, Check Point and Fortinet are no longer good barometers for the health of the industry. Instead, thousands of venture-capital-backed startups -- as well as tech giants increasingly expanding their security presence -- are gouging share.In Q1, IBM pulled in $400 million in security sales -- topping Palo Alto, Fortinet and FireEye, and closing in on Symantec (SYMC) -- up 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and accelerating from 12% growth in all of 2015. Its overall sales fell 5%. For its fiscal Q3 ended April 30, Cisco said its security sales jumped 17% year over year, accelerating from 11% growth in fiscal Q2.Still, the accelerating growth for the IBM and Cisco security businesses falls short of the decelerating growth for most of the pure players. The big companies, though, aren't going away.Microsoft (MSFT) swept three cybersecurity players off the public map in 2015 via acquisitions, but the company doesn't break out its cybersecurity revenue, Morgan points out. And Dell subsidiary SonicWall, acquired in 2012, is potentially pulling in billions, but since Dell is now privately held those figures aren't reported publicly.""That revenue just goes away from what's reported in the public market,"" Morgan told IBD. ""Unless you cover the market really carefully, you won't hear about it.""But the cybersecurity VC market is still booming, he says. In 2015, Dow Jones estimated that $1.9 billion in VC funding was spent backing cybersecurity startups, Morgan says. At one time, it was unheard of for cybersecurity startups to raise more than high single digits in funding, and ""now we're routinely seeing (funding hit) $50 million, $75 million, $100 million.""Those VC-backed companies are ""competing aggressively in the market,"" Morgan said. ""But if they're not public, their revenue figures aren't necessarily being reported.""As private businesses like MalwareBytes, the Herjavec Group (tied to Robert Herjavec of the ""Shark Tank"" TV show) and Black Duck Software begin to achieve scale, they'll further steal share from the publicly traded security firms, Morgan says.Pacific Crest's Owens sees pent-up demand. He says companies still aren't spending enough on security. He ballparks annual IT spending overall near $1 trillion, and cybersecurity spending at $25 billion to $30 billion.""I think security has been an under-spend area for decades,"" he said. ""You're spending about 3% of your capex (capital expenditures) that's focused on IT on security. That's relatively low. Some regulated industries like health care might be two or three times that, but there's still a long way to go.""Building up security spending takes time, Owens says.""There's that perception that you're able to spend an unlimited amount of dollars overnight within security, but that's just not the case in reality,"" he said. ""It's not an overnight type of thing.""Network security still has headroom, Owens says, and he sees products focused on authentication, detection, remediation and endpoint solutions as leaders. Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury pegs privileged account management -- CyberArk's bread and butter -- as the industry's next growth vector. Dougherty's Trebnick expects email security providers like Proofpoint and Mimecast to pick up share. Morgan's bet is on cloud security.Meanwhile, Symantec, Juniper Networks (JNPR), Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and FireEye will continue to struggle, Owens says. Symantec may ""throw out billions in cash flow"" to survive attempts to transition from legacy antivirus to next-generation endpoint protection. FireEye is shifting to a subscription model. Juniper and Barracuda deal with broader macro issues outside cybersecurity, he says.So, back to the original question: Is security spending slowing?Not for many, Morgan says.""What I think you're seeing is a squeeze on the pure-play company,"" he said. But overall, instead of any slowdown, ""I think we're entering an uptick. Spending is up, undoubtedly.""

555,HD,"It may not have the cachet of a Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), but Tractor Supply (TSCO) -- a home products retailer for the pastoral set -- is seeing strong growth thus far in 2016.After a rare dip in same-store sales in the last three months of 2015, as unseasonably warm weather dampened demand for heating products, Tractor Supply came roaring back in the first quarter of this year.Fueled by increased store traffic, same-store sales at outlets open more than a year grew 4.9% in an otherwise typically slow period, with gains across a number of product types and regions. For the fourth quarter, same-store sales slipped 1.2%.""We’re off to a good start,"" Chief Executive Greg Sandfort said in a recent interview with Investor's Business Daily. ""We got back to normal business in the first quarter. It’s a good thing the (business) model is resilient.""Despite its name, the company likes to say it sells ""everything except tractors,"" though some of its products can be used to repair the farm vehicles. The company was founded in 1938 as a mail-order tractor parts business and it opened its first retail store a year later in Minot, N.D.Now based in a suburb of Nashville, Tenn., its mission has morphed over time. Tractor Supply sells basic maintenance gear and other products to farmers, animal owners, ranchers, hobby farmers and other customers who live what it calls the ""rural lifestyle"" well beyond metro areas. It also sells things that help repair wells and build fences, weld gates, construct feed bins and take care of livestock and pets.Customers own horses, chickens, goats and various pets -- lots of pets. Livestock and pet merchandise accounted for 44% of sales last year, the biggest category by far.Tractor Supply's niche rural market has served the company well, as it continues to open new stores around the country, 114 last year and 36 in the first quarter. It has more than 1,500 stores in 49 states, and aims to grow to 2,500 stores, up from a target of 2,200 a year ago.Earnings have grown 20% on a compounded average rate since 2012, though the fourth quarter saw barely any gain. Sales have been growing around 11% on average over that time.""The most remarkable thing to me is their ability to drive traffic to their stores,"" David Magee, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told IBD. ""They’ve shown positive year-over-year traffic growth for a number of years. Most retailers are showing flat to down traffic because of e-commerce (competition) and the (slow) economy.""Tractor Supply's e-commerce sales are tiny and for a reason, Magee says.""(The company's merchandise) is stuff people need pretty quickly,"" he said. ""Their stores are convenient and easy to get in and out of. It's not the type of transaction people are anxious to do on a computer. It's like a hardware-store transaction.""Rivals are typically independent farm stores rather than the much bigger footprints of big-box home centers such as Home Depot and Lowe's. But nearly half of Tractor Supply's outlets, much smaller by comparison, are located close to either of those chains.Unlike most retailers, though, Tractor Supply doesn't have to stick to conventional rules for opening a store by sticking to clusters in targeted areas.""We can open stores across the country, one or two counties out from the large cities, where our customers live,"" CEO Sandfort said.Its highest volume stores are in the South and Northeast. Texas has the most outlets of any state, with 165 at the end of December.Job and population losses in the oil patch have been a concern. Texas underperformed relative to the overall chain, analysts say. But oil-impacted markets generated positive comps in the first quarter, analyst Seth Sigman said in a research note for Credit Suisse.""While they underperformed the control group, the spread was the same as Q4, in the 4%-5% range,"" he wrote.Added SunTrust's Magee: ""Texas is probably doing OK because the state is pretty diversified.""The next largest state after Texas by store count is Ohio, followed by Pennsylvania, Michigan and New York, the latter largely in rural upstate regions.""Not New York City, for sure,"" Sandfort said.Tractor Supply began shipping in December from a newly opened distribution center in Arizona to better serve a growing number of stores in Western states, and with an eye on lowering transportation costs compared with shipping points further afield.Sandfort says the company has become more efficient through business-management technology. For example, it uses a pricing module from a third-party provider to fine-tune pricing by local markets.The company tweaked its inventory flow in the first quarter to five dates from three so that southern states could sell spring merchandise earlier and northern states their cold-weather products longer. That, along with pricing, helped margins as well as to reduce inventory levels, said Barclays’ analyst Matthew McClintock in a recent research note.Tractor Supply also has been rolling out a number of new products, many based on strong results from tests in select stores. A kayak was introduced last year after a successful test run and has since become a “tremendous hit,” Sandfort said.""Customers typically have a lake or pond on their property. This year we have a far larger assortment in stores,"" he said, adding that the plastic kayaks are similar to ones carried by Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) and privately held outdoor-products chain REI.After posting a scant 1% growth in per-share earnings in the fourth quarter vs. a year ago, Tractor Supply seems to be back on its usual double-digit track. First-quarter earnings jumped 19% to 50 cents and analysts expect 13% to 19% gains the next three quarters. They see the year ending up 16% vs. 2015 to $3.49 a share.Management kept its 2016 outlook at $3.40-$3.48 in per-share earnings and 3.5%-5% same-store sales growth.JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers wrote in a recent note to clients: ""We believe this will ultimately prove conservative given the strong start to the year and easier comparisons in the back half.""

556,HD,"Lowe's (LOW) reported surging first-quarter profits and comparable-store sales boomed in the midst of a strong recovery in the U.S. housing market.The Mooresville, North Carolina, company boosted its outlook for the year, as did its rival, Home Depot (HD) on Tuesday, as home improvement stores continue to distance themselves from a retail sector that can’t seem to get shoppers through the door, or to spend much money when they do.Lowe’s profit jumped 31.4 percent to $884 million, or 98 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, were 87 cents per share, which topped Wall Street expectations by 2 cents, according to a poll by Zacks Investment Research.Revenue rose 7.8 percent to $15.23 billion, also beating analyst expectations easily.Lowe’s and Home Depot are riding a robust housing construction rebound.The Commerce Department on Tuesday reported that the construction of new homes climbed 6.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.17 million units.Ground breakings are running ahead of last year’s pace, largely because of a dramatic increase in the construction of single-family houses, especially in the Midwest and South. Relatively few existing homes are listed for sale, creating an incentive for developers to expand supplies through building during a period of low mortgage rates.And owners of those existing homes are plowing money into them, which is translating into big ticket sales for retailers like Lowe’s.Same-store sales, a key measure of a retailer’s health, rose 7.4 percent in Lowe’s most recent quarter.Builders and home improvement retailers appear confident that the boom will go on.The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released this week held steady for the fourth consecutive month.On Wednesday, Lowe’s boosted its full-year profit outlook to $4.11 per share from $4.Lowe’s is about to close on its $2.3 billion buyout of Canadian home improvement retailer Rona, which runs nearly 500 stores. Canadian regulators signed off on that deal last week.As of April, Lowe’s operated 1,860 home improvement and hardware stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.Company shares, which rose in premarket trading, hit an all-time high late last year and were trading close to that level before Wednesday’s opening bell.

557,HD,"Home Depot (HD) crushed first-quarter estimates and raised its full-year guidance, as customers of the home improvement retail giant paid an extra 2.4% per visit, or an average $60.03 during the period, the company said Tuesday.But its shares fell early on the stock market today after Chief Financial Officer Carol Tome told analysts on the earnings call that sales at stores open at least a year fell from 10.2% in February to 6.7% in March and then to 4.3% in April. Home Depot stock stayed down and ended the trading day off 2.5% to 132.""It does dovetail with a bit of a spending slowdown we saw at a number of retailers that pointed to April being a slower month,"" Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins told IBD.Home Depot is more insulated from the Amazon.com (AMZN) effect than other retailers, such as apparel chains, Perkins said. So its slowing same-store sales at outlets open more than a year aren't as much of a red flag as they are for top chains like Macy's (M), Nordstrom (JWN), Kohl's (KSS) and Gap (GPS). Those four retailers reported dismal results last week, sparking a sell-off in the sector.Perkins likes prospects for Home Depot and rival Lowe's this year.""We visited a number of retailers including Home Depot throughout the spring and they and Lowe's (LOW) were the busiest stores we visited,"" Perkins said.Home Depot's adjusted first-quarter earnings of $1.44 a share were up 24.1% year over year, according to figures provided by Thomson Reuters. Revenue grew 9% to $22.76 billion amid continued strong housing market growth, favorable spring weather and sustained consumer spending.Wall Street expected $1.36 earnings per share and $22.39 billion in revenue for the fiscal quarter ended May 1.Home Depot Chief Executive Craig Menear said in a press release that it was a ""stronger-than-expected start to the year"" and noted it came in ""a quarter marked by week-to-week demand spikes caused by weather variability.""Home Depot raised its 2016 earnings view to $6.27 a share, a penny above analysts' forecasts. It also lifted its sales projection for the year to 6.3% growth to about $94.097 billion, topping estimates of $94.082 billion. The company also projects same-store sales -- sales at outlets open more than a year -- will be up about 4.9% for the year, though that would be below first-quarter same-store sales growth of 6.5%.Shares initially fell more than 2% in morning trading, falling through their 50-day moving average. They recovered somewhat before tumbling even further by the close.After consolidating for nearly three months, the company's stock climbed above a 135.57 buy point on April 18 and rose to a fresh all-time high at 137.82 on May 10 before consolidating again.Jared Wiesel, partner at corporate consulting firm Revenue Analytics noted that the company is focusing on engaging millenials. For example, Home Depot is employing omni-media marketing that employs everything from print to digital.""Their online sales were up 21.5% for the quarter, which is excellent,"" Weisel said.Wiesel said that some investors may be concerned that what would normally be early summer sales were pulled into the first quarter because of favorable weather, which could hurt second-quarter results.""There could be an expectation that this quarter was so strong at the expense of future quarters,"" Wiesel said.Home Depot’s earnings came on the heels of the Commerce Department's announcement on Monday that U.S. housing starts climbed a strong 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.17 million units, topping estimates of 1.13 million.The government also revised March starts up a bit to a 1.10 million-unit rate from 1.09. The housing starts data and strong April retail sales indicate that economic growth is picking up momentum after getting off to a sluggish start in 2016.""Our view of the macro environment remains consistent. We believe housing data indicates continued tailwinds for our business,"" CEO Menear told analysts on an earnings call early Tuesday.CFO Tome added: ""We estimate weather driven demand positively impacted U.S. sales growth by approximately $250 million.""Lowe's (LOW) is set to announce first-quarter financial results early Wednesday. Analysts predict earnings per share will rise 21% to 85 cents and revenue should jump 5.1% to $14.87 billion. Shares lost 1.2% at the close.

561,HD,"X President Trump's political woes sent the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite tumbling, but not for long. But Alibaba (BABA) and other China internet stocks rallied on generally upbeat reports. Dow retailers Wal-Mart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) had strong results, but many other retailers are struggling. Dow tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO) sold off on its weak guidance.An ongoing stream of damaging media reports took their toll on President Trump, raising concerns that he'll be too distracted or too weak to push tax cuts through this year, if at all. The Dow industrials and S&P 500 fell 1.8% on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite tumbled 2.6%. But stocks slashed losses on Thursday and Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 off 0.4% and the Nasdaq 0.6%. Credit Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and the other FANG+ stocks, along with Alibaba (BABA) and other Chinese internets.Alibaba's Q1 EPS rose 37% to 63 cents, but missed the consensus by 3 cents as tax expenses and spending on its entertainment and cloud computing businesses ramped up. Revenue jumped 60% to $5.61 billion, beating views. The Chinese e-commerce giant also OK'd a $6 billion buyback. Shares rose 0.5% Thursday after falling 5% early, then rose to a record high on Friday. On Wednesday, archrival Tencent (TCEHY) reported EPS surged 57% in local currency to 22 cents, beating by a penny, as revenue popped 55% $7.18 billion. Tencent stock hit new highs.On Tuesday, internet portal Sina (SINA) and its majority-owned social messaging site Weibo (WB) reported stronger than expected earnings. Weibo reported daily active users of 154 million, up 28% vs the year earlier. Weibo shares soared 25%, Sina 22%.Specialty online retailer Vipshop (VIPS) reported in-line earnings, better-than-expected revenue and solid guidance, but shares tumbled 10.3%.Baozun (BZUN), an Alibaba-backed provider of e-commerce services for brand partners, reported EPS that just met views. Shares dived 12% on Wednesday, but were up 8.6% for the week.Target (TGT) earnings fell 6% while sales dipped 1% to $16.02 billion, but those were not as bad as feared. Comps skidded 1.3% but better than the expected 3.7% tumble. Shares rose Wednesday but finished the week up just 0.4%, still close to five-year lows. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Q1 profit unexpectedly ticked up 2% to $1 a share, surprising Street estimates for a 2% dip, though 1.4% sales growth to $117.54 billion just missed. Still, U.S. same-store sales rose, unlike Target and many other retailers. The megastore credited organic growth at Walmart.com for its 63% boost in U.S. online sales, although it also acquired two e-commerce properties, Moosejaw and ModCloth, during the quarter. Wal-Mart shares rose 4.1% to a two-year best.Cisco Systems (CSCO) adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 5% to 60 cents, beating views by 2 cents. Revenue fell 1% to $11.94 billion, above estimates but the sixth straight year-over-year decline as the networking giant transitions from sluggish switch and router hardware to software and security. Current-quarter revenue guidance was far short of forecasts, in part because of concerns that President Trump's economic and tax agenda has stalled.Cisco shares fell 6.7% for the week.Home Depot (HD) reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates, making it one of the few retailers that isn't cracking under the weight of e-commerce, discounts, discounters, too many stores and not enough traffic. The home-improvement chain hiked its full-year EPS forecast, which was still below expectations. Home Depot shares hit a record high Tuesday but dipped 0.4% for the week. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which reports next week, lost 0.3%, but in buy range.The semiconductor equipment manufacturer's second-quarter profit rose 132% while sales climbed 45% to $3.55 billion, both better than expected. It was the third straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth for Applied Materials (AMAT). For the current quarter, Applied gave EPS and sales targets above the consensus. Applied Materials jumped early Friday, but closed up just 0.4%.RELATED:Applied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% AgainSalesforce.com said fiscal Q1 adjusted earnings were 28 cents a share, up 17% vs. a year earlier, with revenue rising 25% to $2.39 billion.

Off-price retailers have typically been gems, but both TJX and Ross are trading below their 50-day moving averages amid a greater retail shudder. TJX shares fell 3.9% for the week. Ross rose Friday, paring its week loss to 2%.Computer-aided design software firm Autodesk (ADSK) saw its stock surge 14.7% to record levels Friday after it beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter ended April 30. Autodesk lost 16 cents a share excluding items on revenue of $486 million, when analysts were looking for it to lose 24 cents a share ex items on sales of $470.4 million. The San Rafael, Calif.-based company is taking a revenue hit as it continues its business model transition from licensed software to cloud computing services. Another design software firm, Synopsys (SNPS), also posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings.

563,HD,"Amazon (AMZN) is pushing deeper into business-to-business e-commerce, which one analyst estimates could add $18 billion in company revenue by 2020.The B2B unit, Amazon Business, began as Amazon Supply in 2012. The initiative was rebranded in April 2015 and Amazon -- which posted 2015 revenue of $107 billion -- recently indicated it reached more than $1 billion in annual sales, with 300,000 customers.Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Justin Post estimates Amazon Business will reach gross merchandise volume of $3.5 billion this year, resulting in revenue of $3 billion. He anticipates GMV of $8 billion next year and revenue of $6.4 billion. By 2020, estimates Post, Amazon will hit GMV of $25 billion and $18.6 billion in revenue.“Based on recent management comments, Amazon Business appears to be ready for prime time, and we wouldn’t be surprised if Amazon invests in marketing to raise awareness as Amazon’s procurement systems improve,” said Post in a research note.According to market research firm Frost & Sullivan, the U.S. B2B market is expected to reach $1 trillion in sales by 2020, and $6.7 trillion globally.“We think B2B provides significant runway for growth, which could help Amazon sustain its growth rates and premium valuation for many years,” wrote Post.He has a buy rating on Amazon stock, and a price target of 840.Amazon stock ended trading up more than 1%, to 704.20, in the stock market today, after touching a record high above 722 on May 12. It’s an IBD Leaderboard stock.Amazon Business sells a broad line of goods, such as office supplies, tools, industrial equipment, tractor equipment and office products. Competitors in the B2B e-commerce sector include Staples (SPLS), HD Supply Holdings (HDS), Office Depot (ODP), Grainger (GWW) and Fastenal (FAST).

565,HD,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

569,HD,"Stocks were higher in early afternoon trade Wednesday, as investors awaited the release of the minutes from the late-April Federal Reserve meeting, due out at 2 p.m. ET.Recent statements from Fed governors and economic indicators, including a mild uptick in consumer prices, have led to a growing feeling that the Fed will raise interest rates at its June or July meetings. Investors will be sifting through the minutes for clues about the Fed's intentions.The Nasdaq gained 0.6%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were each 0.2% higher in the stock market today.Volume was tracking slightly higher than Tuesday's pace on the Nasdaq.

Lowe's shares rose 3.6% in strong volume, breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 77.73 buy point.Lowe's reported earning 98 cents a share compared to Wall Street estimates for 85 cents. Revenue also beat, coming in at $15.23 billion vs. estimates of $14.87 billion.Lowe's same-store sales were reported to have grown 7.5%, edging out Home Depot's 7.4%.Despite a cheery earnings report of its own Tuesday, Home Depot slid 2.5% on the news. Home Depot edged higher Wednesday.Home improvement and construction-related stocks have been strong, and Lowe's said in its earnings call that it remains positive on the industry.Sonic (SONC), which operates retro-style drive-in hamburger joints, fell nearly 8% to 30.01 in heavy volume. Sonic said same-store sales won't rise the 4% to 6% for the quarter ending May 31 as previously forecast.

570,HD,"The Federal Reserve convinced markets that a June rate hike is on the table. Warren Buffett disclosed a big Apple (AAPL) stake. Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Wal-Mart (WMT) reported strong results, but Target (TGT), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) were among those with weak results or outlooks. Cisco (CSCO) and Salesforce (CRM) had upbeat reports that were good news for IT spending. General Motors (GM) and Uber tested self-driving cars on the road, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) Google cars, while Google held a major developers conference.The major averages continued to move sideways in a choppy fashion as the market remains under pressure. The Nasdaq rose 1.1% for the week after falling for the prior four weeks. The S&P 500 eked out a 0.3% rise while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%, its fourth straight weekly decline. The S&P 500 and Dow moved back above their 50-day moving averages on Monday as Apple rose on Buffett's stake, but then fell back as near-term Fed rate hike buzz took hold, pushing up the dollar. Thanks to Friday gains, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq are slightly higher for the week.While some stocks broke out -- Salesforce and Lowe's -- older breakouts struggled. Facebook (FB) closed just below a buy point Thursday, though it regained its entry point on Friday. McDonald's (MCD) fell below its late March entry area.Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s April meeting showed policymakers are close to raising benchmark interest rates again next month, surprising Fed watchers who priced in an increase later in the year. But before raise rates for a second time, the Fed wants to see signs growth is picking up in Q2, along with stronger labor markets and inflation heading for the 2% target.New York Fed President William Dudley said the next day a rate hike in the June-July timeframe is reasonable, unless the economy stumbles. He said a June rate hike is ""definitely live."" Other policymakers made similar comments. The next meeting will be held June 14-15, followed by another on July 26-27.April consumer prices had their biggest monthly gain in three years.

Buffett's investment reflects confidence in Apple's pipeline of products, including future iPhones or even a rumored Apple Car.

Apple rival Xiaomi plans to ship its Android-based TV set-top box to the U.S. in 2016.Both home improvement chains topped estimates on strong housing market growth and favorable spring weather, raising guidance. But Home Depot fell 2.5% on Tuesday and 1% for the week, as same-store sales growth cooled from 10.2% in Feb. to 6.7% in March and 4.3% in April. Meanwhile, Lowe’s shares climbed 6.4% to an all-time high, breaking out of a nearly four-month long consolidation.Salesforce.com reported Q1 EPS and revenue that topped views as the business software provider signed more big deals with enterprise customers. Billings rose 31% year over year, accelerating from 28% in Q4. Salesforce.com increased its full-year revenue guidance slightly to $8.2 billion. On its earnings call, management touted a new cloud alliance with Amazon Web Services. Salesforce stock jumped 6.1% for the week, breaking out of a base and nearly hitting an all-time high.Cisco Systems reported a 6% adjusted EPS gain for its fiscal Q3, with revenue up 3%, both edging past analyst forecasts. Profit and sales guidance was also bullish. Analysts had lowered expectations ahead of Cisco earnings due to the growing number of companies outsourcing to cloud computing service providers such as Amazon Web Services, reducing demand for Cisco’s networking gear. The lowered expectations also reflected lower spending on information technology overall.Well aware of the trends, Cisco is diversifying into newer, higher-growth segments such as software, data centers, security, wireless and the Internet of Things market.Cisco stock rose 5.4% for the week.The Energy Information Administration reported a domestic stockpile increase of 1.3 million barrels vs. a 3 million barrel decline expected by analysts. The American Petroleum Institute reported a drawdown of 1.14 million barrels. U.S. production continues to fall while gasoline demand ramps up.Oil prices hit fresh seven-month highs during the week. U.S. futures closed the week at $47.75 a barrel, up 3.3%.Goldman Sachs said that oil could hit $50 per barrel later this year as the market “likely shifted into deficit in May,” earlier than Goldman expected.

But Oxy said it didn’t “have any knowledge” about an offer. In November, Anadarko (APC) withdrew a bid to buy Apache, which had rejected the offer.Wal-Mart and Target moved in opposite directions after issuing their quarterly earnings reports.Target’s Q1 EPS increased 17% to $1.29, beating views for $1.19. But sales dropped 5% to $16.2 billion, missing estimates. Same-store sales grew 1.2%, short of predictions for a 1.6% gain. Target’s Q2 EPS guidance of $1 to $1.20 widely missed expectations for $1.36.Shares plunged 7.1%, hitting their lowest levels since late 2014.Wal-Mart’s Q1 profit fell 5 cents to 98 cents a share but beat estimates by 10 cents. Sales rose 0.9% to $115.9 billion vs. forecasts for a drop to $113.2 billion. U.S. same-store sales climbed 1%, the seventh straight gain. For Q2, Wal-Mart sees EPS of 95 cents to $1.08, with the midpoint above estimates for 98 cents.Shares popped 7.6% for the week, retaking their 200-day and 50-day lines after gapping down in sympathy with Target on Wednesday.Outshining its ailing department store peers, TJX (TJX) Q1 EPS and sales rose 10% to 76 cents and $7.54 billion, comfortably topping. Comps rose 7%. The off-price retailer guided full-year EPS up to $3.35-$3.42, still shy of estimates. Off-price peer Ross Stores edged past Q1 EPS views with a 6% gain, but revenue's 5% gain to $3.09 billion missed. Comps grew 2%. Q2 and full-year EPS guidance fell short of consensus. Ross Stores fell 3.4% for the week, while TJX climbed 3.7%.General Motors acquisition Cruise Automation confirmed that its self-driving technology was being tested on Chevy Bolts after photos of the all-electric cars surfaced online. Uber on Thursday also posted a photo of a hybrid Ford (F) Fusion outfitted with self-driving technology that it said would be undergoing testing.GM and Lyft plan to road-test autonomous Bolt taxis in the coming months, and Ford has established a subsidiary focused on autonomous-car technology and ride-sharing. But the carmakers face stiff competition from the likes of Toyota (TM), Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet, which recently inked a tech deal with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB) plunged 21% this week to a 3-year low on weak sales and slashed revenue guidance. Sonic (SONC) said it would miss its own fiscal Q3 same-store sales target, triggering an 8.65% weekly stock loss. The reports, which followed a weak May 11 sales outlook from Wendy’s (WEN), intensified fears about burger competition as both value and upscale offerings spread. Wendy’s stock fell 2.8%. Shake Shack (SHAK), which popped on solid results earlier this month, slid 6.9%. McDonald’s lost 4.9%.Campbell Soup (CPB) and Hormel (HRL) reported disappointing quarterly results, perhaps indicating that sluggish consumer spending is spilling over into the foods group. Hormel, the parent of Spam lunch meat, Skippy peanut butter and other leading brands, plunged xx% for the week to a 2016 low. Q2 earnings growth was strong as sales in 4 of 5 product groups rose, Hormel also raised guidance. But its Q2 profit margin shrank to 11.9% before interest and taxes, down from 14.4% in the prior quarter. Campbell said fiscal Q3 EPS rose 5% to 65 cents, beating by a penny. But sales fell 1.6% to $1.87 bil, missing Wall Street’s target. Shares fell 6.4% Friday and 9.4% for the week, falling to a 3-month low.

It beat on earnings, but missed on revenue. Shares of Red Robin gapped down, falling nearly 16% to a year-and-a-half low. The company owns or franchises 540 restaurants around the country.Two high-profile earnings reports from Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX) caused some volatility in both issues.TJX, which operates T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls, opened higher, lost its gain within minutes and is now holding onto a 0.8% gain. Home Depot fell at the open, partially recovered to a 1.8% loss and was struggling to hold its 50-day moving average. Both Home Depot and TJX reported issued cheery reports, though some analysts worried about Home Depot's same-store sales.WebMD (WBMD) set a new high with a 1.3% increase on above-average volume.

574,HD,"The troubling takeaway from the surprisingly weak May jobs numbers is that the economy is stuck in slow-growth mode for the foreseeable future.While last month's overall gain of 38,000 jobs, including a 25,000 rise in private payrolls, was dragged down temporarily by the labor strike of 35,000 Verizon (VZ) communications workers, the weakness was broad-based. On net, just 51.3% of industries added jobs, the lowest since February 2010, Labor Department data showed.Considering that Verizon likely brought in some temp workers during the now-resolved strike, private payrolls were close to flat in May outside of health care, which added 45,700 jobs last month and just under a half million over the past year.Although there were some pockets of hiring strength, the weak job gains and downward revisions totaling 59,000 to the increases reported in March and April suggest that growth is getting much harder to come by as the economic expansion gets long in the tooth.The slowdown looks like more than a one-month blip: The 155,000 private-sector jobs added over the past two months is the worst stretch since January 2011 -- even assuming that the strike artificially knocked 25,000-35,000 off the total.As markets priced in a slower timetable for Federal Reserve rate hikes, shares of Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) sold off hard on the stock market today.Instead of a likely hike in July, markets now see the Fed waiting until November, the CME Group FedWatch tool showed. The 10-year Treasury yield plunged to 1.71%, and the dollar fell 1.5% against other major currencies.One decent bit of news in the employment report is that the trend of firming wages remained intact, as hourly pay rose 0.2% from April and 2.5% from a year ago. That's consistent with anecdotal reports of companies having to pay more to attract or keep good workers, and many finding qualified workers in short supply.Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Costco (COST), Panera Bread (PNRA) and Wendy's (WEN) have all said they've raised pay in recent months.The drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% from 5% in April appears at first to be consistent with a tight labor market. Still, the sudden drop in joblessness, which reflected fewer people in the workforce rather than an increase in employment, should be taken with a grain of salt, given the household survey's higher margin of error.Yet the overriding problem is that employers, who are now paying new employees more, are seeing profit margins pressured and finding that opportunities for profitable growth have narrowed.""The 'disconnect' between weak real GDP growth and strong employment growth seems to be resolving itself as employers are defending profits (and trying to boost productivity) in a soggy environment by managing payroll costs,"" wrote IHS Global Insight economists Nariman Behravesh and Ozlem Yaylaci.The reality portrayed by the weak jobs report got some confirmation from the Institute for Supply Management's survey of non-manufacturing industries, with the index slipping to a 28-month low of 52.9 in May from 55.7 in April -- well below expectations. The employment gauge fell into negative territory, dropping 3.3 points to 49.7, just below the neutral 50 level.A range of other economic data points and industry trends suggest a similar conclusion that the much-anticipated pick-up in growth may not materialize.Analysts think U.S. auto sales are close to peaking, and those views were supported by lower sales in May for General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), even as Autodata reports that incentives have climbed north of $3,000 per vehicle.Construction spending fell a surprising 1.8% in April, more than reversing March's gain. To top off that bad news, the construction sector shed 15,000 jobs in May after losing 5,000 in April. Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, said that many private developers are concerned by possible overbuilding in commercial, office and lodging markets and sense that ""the current real estate cycle is now in its seventh inning or later.""Wal-Mart closed 154 U.S. stores at the start of the year, and Macy's (M) and other department stores are cutting their square footage as Amazon (AMZN) continues to eat into their business. Even Home Depot (HD), in one of the strongest retail sectors, hasn't added any stores in the U.S. in more than a year.Somehow, the retail sector has seemingly defied gravity when it comes to employment, adding 11,400 jobs last month and 323,000 over the past year. The explanation may be that the workweek has shrunk, since aggregate hours of work in the retail industry are down 0.3% over the past three months.Food services and drinking places added 22,200 jobs in May. But the accommodation sector shed 1,500 jobs, after cutting 2,300 the prior month.Manufacturers cut 18,000 jobs in May. While the sector has stabilized, there's little hope for an upturn, with the dollar still strong and global growth still weak.

577,HD,"Stocks wiped away most gains Wednesday afternoon after Federal Reserve policymakers said they would likely raise interest rates in June if incoming data showed the economy picking up.The Nasdaq was holding onto a 0.4% gain, but the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 erased early gains in the stock market today. Volume on the Nasdaq was little changed from Tuesday’s levels. NYSE volume was unavailable.""Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June,"" according to minutes from the Fed's April meeting.Statements from Fed governors and bullish economic reports, including a recent uptick in consumer prices and better-than-expected housing data, have fueled sentiment that the central bank will raise interest rates as early as June.Telecommunications stocks were among the day’s biggest gainers, led by Charter Communications (CHTR), which popped 10% to a new high after announcing Wednesday that it had completed its acquisition of Time Warner Cable.Meanwhile, building products retailer Lowe’s (LOW) jumped 4% to a new high, clearing a 77.73 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in heavy volume after a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.The results came a day after a better-than-expected earnings report from rival Home Depot (HD), which continued lower Wednesday for a second straight day.In the IBD 50, chip stock Nvidia (NVDA) rose nearly 3% to a new high, as the stock continues to climb following its blowout quarterly earnings report last week.

579,HD,"Walt Disney (DIS), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS), Kohl's (KSS), Fossil (FOSL) and others reported weak earnings or guidance, triggering a broad sell-off in retail and other consumer stocks -- but not for shares of Amazon (AMZN).

580,HD,"Tractor Supply (TSCO) reported accelerating earnings and sales growth late Wednesday, as the farming and ranching retail supply store topped Wall Street forecasts.The Brentwood, Tenn.-based company earned 50 cents a share in Q1, up 19% from a year earlier, and beating by four cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 10% to $1.47 billion, beating estimates of $1.45 billion. That ends a three-quarter string of decelerating EPS growth and two quarters of slowing sales growth.""Sales were broad-based, with all of our major product categories and geographic regions generating positive comparable store sales,"" Tractor Supply said in a release.Tractor Supply shares surged about 5% in late trading to around 95. That would be a breakout from a nine-month consolidation. Shares closed up 0.5% to 90.07. The stock had been finding support around its 200-day moving average for more than a month.Q1 comparable store sales rose 4.9%, largely on increased traffic, with pet and livestock food a strong segment. That's a deceleration from the 5.7% increase in the year-earlier quarter.Tractor Supply reaffirmed its full-year guidance for EPS of $3.40-$3.48 and net sales guidance of $6.9 billion and $7 billion. Both are in line with analyst forecasts. The retailer sees full-year same-store sales growth of 3.5%-5%.Tractor Supply targets hobby and small-scale farmers vs. large-scale operations. It has more than 1,500 stores, mostly in rural and exurban areas, They sell everything from tractor parts to horseshoes to steel fasteners to welding torches and farm-related apparel. A sizable share of each store's goods are localized for specific markets.In Q1, Tractor Supply opened 36 stores and closed three old ones. It plans to open 115-120 stores this year with an ultimate store-count goal of around 2,500 stores.Not surprisingly, Tractor Supply's business is highly seasonal. The winter Q1 tends to be Tractor Supply's slowest quarter, while the spring Q2 tends to be its busiest.""Although we are off to a solid start in the first quarter, we recognize the importance of the spring selling season to our first half performance,"" Tractor Supply CEO Greg Sandfort said in the release.Riding lawn mowers and fencing products did well in Q1 as early spring weather pulled sales forward.Many of Tractor Supply's products could be found at home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) or Lowe’s (LOW), but Tractor Supply believes it has the breadth of offerings in the right quantities for its customers. With less than 1% of sales online, Tractor Supply hasn't seen Amazon (AMZN) as a big threat so far.Tractor Supply has increased sales for 60 consecutive quarters, according to MarketWatch.The company's success comes amid challenging times for U.S. farmers overall. In February, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast that farm net income will be $54.8 billion this year, down 2.8% from 2015's estimate.If the forecast comes to pass, it will be the third consecutive year of slumping profits for U.S. farmers, after soaring to a record $123.3 billion in 2013. Excess crop and livestock production has sent prices downward and has forced some farmers to work through their supply gluts.Corn, the No. 1 crop in the U.S. by volume, earlier this year saw its price decline more than 50% since 2012.Soybeans and wheat prices have been cut in half during that period, but are bouncing back.Soybean prices have hit an eight-month high amid damaging rains in Argentina, increased China demand and expectations that U.S. and Argentine farmers won't plant as many acres of the crop in the upcoming months.Wheat prices are at a five-month high, boosted by market strength and investor-short covering by hedge fund managers.

584,HD,"Stocks were near lows Wednesday afternoon as better-than-expected economic data boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates.The Nasdaq fell 1.3%, the S&P 500 1.1% and Dow Jones industrial average 1.2%. Both the S&P 500 and Dow dropped back their 50-day moving averages a day after regaining that key support area. Volume was slightly higher on the NYSE and the Nasdaq compared to the same time Monday.The major averages sold off at the open as stronger-than-expected readings on April housing starts, industrial production and consumer prices strengthened the case for the Fed to raise interest rates later this year.

And home repairs are a high priority for consumers, especially in springtime.Consensus is for Home Depot to record a 17% increase in earnings per share to $1.36 on a 7.1% hike in revenue to $22.37 billion. If it meets EPS expectations it would be the 12th quarter in a row of double-digit profit growth on a year over year basis. At the end of 2015, Home Depot said it expects to reach $100 billion a year annual revenue in a couple of years.Shares closed up 1.7% at 135.34 on the stock market today.IBD's Take: How healthy are the shares of Home Depot and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupHome Depot stock has been consolidating for about 4-1/2 months, possibly forming a base with a 135.57 buy point.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Lowe's EPS to climb 21% to 85 cents and sales to grow 5.1% to $14.85 billion. Lowe's shares were up 2.1% at 76.61 in early Monday trading after Oppenheimer raised its price target to 85 from 77. Oppenheimer maintained an outperform rating, saying that home improvement spending remains brisk.Lowe's shares rose 2.65% to 77.00, nearing a 78.23 buypoint.The reports come in a challenging environment for retailers. Retail Metrics president Ken Perkins said in a report on Friday, ""It was a terrible week for retail earnings reports!"" He noted earnings misses by Dillard's (DDS), Fossil (FOSL) and a whopping 96-cent miss by flooring stores operator Lumber Liquidators (LL).Even Ross Stores (ROST), which has held up well amid the retail carnage, fell 5.4% last Wednesday after Piper Jaffray cut its rating on the stock to underweight from neutral, citing multiple headwinds including softening in the discount apparel sector. Ross reports quarterly earnings late Thursday.

590,HD,"Retail sales dipped 0.1% in February, about as expected, but January sales were revised sharply lower.Instead of the 0.2% January gain initially reported, the Commerce Department now says sales sank 0.4% on the month. That brings the year-over-year gain in sales down to a lackluster 3.1% from a year ago in nominal terms. Excluding lower gasoline sales, the annual increase would be 4.5%.Excluding a 0.2% drop in auto sales, despite strong gains reported by Ford Motor (F), retail sales dipped 0.1% vs. January.Sales excluding autos and gasoline rose a solid 0.3%, but January was revised from up 0.4% to down 0.1%.Even nonstore retailers such as Amazon (AMZN) saw a rare 0.2% dip in sales, lowering the 12-month gain to 6.3%. Electronics stores such as Best Buy (BBY) saw sales fall 0.1% from January and 3.2% from a year ago. It was the fifth straight monthly drop for the electronics/appliance sector as Apple (AAPL) iPhone sales appear headed for a first-ever year-over-year decline.Building material and garden supply stores, led by home-improvement leader Home Depot (HD), continued to thrive. Sales rose 1.6% on the month and 12.2% on the year.Food services and restaurants were a strong point, rising 1.0% from January and 6.4% from a year ago.Amid the surprisingly bad news in retail, the manufacturing sector got a surprisingly positive report for a change.

591,HD,"With Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Cloud Platform snaring more major customers, there's a three-company race between it, Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure that will only intensify.Cowen & Co. analyst John Blackledge wrote in a report on Thursday, after the first day of the Google Cloud Platform Next Conference in San Francisco, that ""our sense from talking to potential customers at the event is that they are giving Google Cloud Platform another look.""Blackledge said press reports have highlighted ""recent wins"" for Google's cloud business, including Spotify, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) and Snapchat, which ""were featured prominently in customer use-case discussions. Other customers include Home Depot (HD), Electronic Arts (EA), Zulily, Sony (SNE) Music, HTC, Best Buy (BBY), TiVo (TIVO), Wix (WIX), Philips (PHG), Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi, (and Tata Group's) Jaguar and Range Rover,"" Blackledge said.Public clouds ""are likely to be a highly competitive market where customer stickiness will be challenged by new technologies that make it easier to move workloads between public cloud vendors,"" Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter wrote in industry research note on Wednesday. ""It clearly has become a major focus area for Google and one in which it intends to compete directly against Amazon and Microsoft.""Competition between the three groups will rise ""particularly as enterprises become increasingly comfortable migrating select workloads to public cloud environments,"" according to Cloud Computing Today.Cloud services is ""a $25 billion jump ball"" that will likely be captured by the big three competitors: Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said in a Wednesday industry research note. ""With it being early in this opportunity, we think there will be wins and losses along the way, but we believe (Google) will be a significant competitor in the years to come, and it could help drive growth.”Apple recently signed a contract worth between $400 million and $600 million to use Google’s Cloud Platform, according to CRN. Apple now uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, but it intends to end its reliance on all its rivals in the next few years as it builds its own data centers, according to Re/Code.In February, music service Spotify, a high-profile customer of Amazon's Amazon Web Services, said it would use Google's cloud for some computing infrastructure.Google's cloud business generated about $500 million in revenues last year, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, as cited by Reuters. That compares with $74.5 billion overall for parent company Alphabet, but the cloud business is one of its fastest-growing business areas.Overall, Reuters said Google ranks as the No. 4 player in the cloud infrastructure industry, with 4% of the market last year, according to Synergy Research. Amazon's Amazon Web Services had a 31% share, Microsoft's Azure had a 9% share, and IBM (IBM) had 7%, according to the group.Google is also building up its data centers across the world, launching two new regional centers in Japan and Oregon to bring the number of regions it serves to five.Cloud computing is an increasingly popular way for companies to run their IT operations, and the $20-billion-a-year business is forecast to grow 35% over the next year, according to Gartner Inc.Alphabet and Apple stock both slipped 0.4% in the stock market today as Microsoft lifted that much.

Data for February showed that exports fell 25.4% from a year earlier.Oil, steel and mining stocks led the downside. In the S&P 500, Devon Energy (DVN) took the biggest hit, with the oil and natural gas explorer falling almost 9% in heavy volume, though there was no news specific to the stock.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks also skidded.

596,HD,"Stocks lost ground Wednesday, and the Nasdaq was once again rebuffed at its 50-day line.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 trimmed 1%. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.2%, partly because of Home Depot's (HD) 2.5% dent. Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges, according to preliminary data.From a stock chartist's viewpoint, action was bad. For the second consecutive day, the Nasdaq tried and failed to retake its 50-day moving average. Until the Nasdaq can turn that resistance into support, the uptrend isn't likely to make much progress.The IBD 50, a proxy for top-rated stocks, illustrated the lukewarm temperature of this uptrend. Hardly any stocks were moving up or down in strong volume. For example, fast-food chain Sonic (SONC) shed 4%, but volume was 20% below average.Constructive action, however, was evident among stocks that recently made good up moves. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) lost 0.7% in fast trade, but this came after four up days in a row. Gains were 2% to 3% each day in much heavier volume than Wednesday's negative action.RV parts maker Drew Industries (DW) also showed positive action, even though it fell. The stock gapped up 9% Monday, and then added almost 2% Tuesday. Wednesday's 0.8% loss was puny by comparison.On Thursday, the Labor Department will release first-time jobless claims. The consensus view among analysts is 267,000, down about 2.5% from the previous week. The range of estimates runs from 263,000 to 275,000.

607,HD,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences. (See our full list of best sector mutual funds.)To highlight the best mutual funds in the top-performing sectors, the ""best of the best"" list of IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners includes the top fund in each of six sectors.Click Here To View A Table Of Top Performing Mutual Funds By CategoryFidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) came out on top with a 10-year average annual return of 16.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.31%. The fund held $9.7 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29. Its expense ratio is 0.74%. Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said. ""We have that kind of historical understanding and depth of understanding of the industry and the individual players. Equally important is the ability of these companies to access capital at a low cost. I want my companies to be self-reliant.""The five top biotech funds all owned big-cap biotech and Soliris maker Alexion in their recently reported quarters. Four of the five funds also held biotechs Celgene and Gilead, which focus on cancer and hepatitis C, respectively. Generic drug makers tracked by IBD soared more than 900% from March 2009 to July 2015, while ethical drug stocks rallied nearly 750% from March 2009 to August 2015.T.

608,HD,"Shares of Coca-Cola (KO), one of Warren Buffett's ""Big Four"" investments, touched an all-time high Tuesday as consumer stocks continued to show strength amid the recent market volatility.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has 400 million shares, or a 9.3% stake, in Coca-Cola. American Express (AXP), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are the rest of Berkshire's top four stock holdings.Coca-Cola shares closed down 0.1% at 45.24 on the stock market today after rising as high as 45.56 earlier. Its stock rose above a first-stage base with a 44.01 buy point on Feb. 22. It's risen about 11% from the low point of the base and was extended far above its 10-week and 200-day averages.Coca-Cola's earnings per share growth appears poised for a comeback. Growth over the last three quarters has improved from -14% to -8% and -6% last quarter. Wall Street consensus is for the company's EPS this quarter to be flat on a year-over-year basis; it's expected to then return to growth, posting a 3% increase next quarter.The company on Feb. 18 said that it was raising its quarterly divided to 35 cents a share from 33 cents, prompting RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi to say in a report that Coke is about to kick off a long-term bull run that could last three to eight years.Coke joins other consumer stocks, such as McDonald's (MCD), Home Depot (HD), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and and Ross Stores (ROST), which are all trading in record high territory.McDonald's rose to a new high close at 124.61 on Feb. 1. On Tuesday, it rose 0.4% to at 123.43.Home Depot hit a fresh high at 134.74 on Nov. 27 before consolidating. It gained 0.7% Tuesday. Meanwhile, HD Supply (HDS), a home and building supplies distributor, gapped up as much as 6% after it reported better than expected earnings Tuesday and issued bullish guidance. Shares jumped 4.8% Tuesday.Domino's Pizza shot up 13% on Feb. 25 to 132.90 after reporting a 27% surge in quarterly EPS. Domino's dipped 1.1% Tuesday.

"
610,HD,"Underdog is a familiar role for Marco Rubio. It better be. He heads into Tuesday's Florida Republican primary reportedly trailing tall, rich guy Donald Trump perhaps by six, maybe eight points.That's the bad news. The good news is just a couple of weeks ago Rubio was behind by at least 20 points. Even then, he guaranteed a win.Politicians, especially those D.C. establishment ones, have under-estimated the son of Cuban immigrants before. Remember the 2010 election after incumbent GOP Sen. Mel Martinez suddenly retired? GOP Gov. Charlie Crist knew he should inherit the job. He appointed a pal as space-holder and announced his own candidacy.Like Chris Christie, Crist had notoriously hugged President Obama and even endorsed his stimulus spending. But crony blood runs deep; Washington's Republican establishment lined up behind Crist anyway, including 2008 GOP presidential loser John McCain and the National Republican Senatorial Committee putting up big bucks.Except this Rubio kid announced too. He was the Florida House Speaker, at 38 the youngest ever. With the enthusiastic support of Florida Tea Partiers, his optimistic messaging and an American-maid family success story, Rubio's conservative support grew. And grew.So much so that Crist was forced out of the Republican primary and became an independent enroute to becoming a Democrat.It didn't matter. Come November, Rubio racked up over a million more votes than Crist and 1.6 million more than the Democrat.You don't have to like Rubio to want him to win tomorrow. You just have to fear the unbelievable things faux conservative Trump would do to the Republican brand, not to mention the country if elected.If Trump captures Florida and perhaps snags Ohio too from Gov. John Kasich, he could become unstoppable to seize control of the party of Abraham Lincoln, who's turning over right now even beneath 15 feet of concrete in Springfield.Here's what Rubio has going for him: Donald Trump.The billionaire blowhard has managed to thoroughly alienate Hispanics, the fastest-growing voter cohort. ""I do great with Latino voters,"" Trump asserts absent proof. ""I employ so many Latinos. I have so many people working for me.""Working for The Man, however, is somewhat different than voting for The Man. Especially in a state like Florida where both Cuban and Puerto Rican voters play such an important role. Oh, did we mention Rubio is fluently bilingual?Just out is a new Gallup Poll. It shows Trump's favorable rating among Hispanics stands at 12%. 12%!! Gallup found Trump's unfavorable rating hovering at 77%, up from 66% last summer. Ted Cruz' ratings are also underwater, 26% favorable to 30% unfavorable. (Hillary Clinton's ratings, by the way, are 59% favorable, 26% negative.)Trump likes to claim Florida as a second or third home. But Rubio has the political and fundraising infrastructure of a sitting senator.Another Gallup survey finds the public images of Trump and Cruz sagging among Republicans, while Rubio's holds steady. The net positive ratings of Cruz (+14) and Trump (+15) are the lowest they've been this cycle.At +34, Rubio's net image is more than twice as positive.Rubio has done well almost everywhere he has focused in this campaign, especially among late-deciders. After being down 20+ points, he came close to upsetting Trump in Virginia.Another upset opening for Rubio is Florida's early voting, which locks in support, making it impervious to shifting daily news cycles.You may recall in 2012 Newt Gingrich was riding high, having vanquished vulture capitalist Mitt Romney in South Carolina. Only to run into and under Romney's early-voting steamroller in Florida. There, Newt's hopes were flattened.Just for fun, imagine Rubio thumping Trump in Florida. Half the real-estate guy's tirade would have to be bleeped. His supporters in their dandy red hats could make America great again by beating up all those dishonest reporters. And Trump's over-sized head would explode on national TV. In HD. Amazing. Just amazing.The ratings? They would be yuge. Yuge! Believe me.

614,HD,"Stocks swung into firm early gains Friday, as an upward revision to GDP growth, oil prices and earnings reports buoyed investor confidence.The Nasdaq jumped to an early lead, up 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.5% and the Dow tacked on a 0.3% gain.The stock market today  entered Friday's session with the Nasdaq up 1.7%. The S&P 500 opens ahead 1.8% and back above its 50-day moving average. Holding that level of support, and finishing out the week without incurring any distribution days, would be a nice feather in the cap of the market's young uptrend.Distribution days occur when an index declines in rising volume. Accumulation occurs when markets advance in rising volume. One shows institutional investors are selling, the other shows them buying. Market conditions are generally better for individual investors when the big funds are in a buying mode.Another encouraging point: Small caps are outpacing the general market. The Russell 2000 starts Friday up 2.1% for the week. But both the Russell 2000  and the Nasdaq are less than 2% below their 50-day lines and still face possible resistance at that level.Oil prices, for all their volatility, were also a positive this week. Oil traded up more than 1% Friday morning, above $33 a barrel and up almost 13% for the week. Baker Hughes (BHI) reports its weekly rig count data at 1 p.m. ET. Gold dipped slightly, holding above $1,237 and up less than 1% for the week.The economy expanded 1% in the fourth quarter, according to revised estimates from the Commerce Department. That was up from an initial guess of 0.7% and comfortably above consensus projections for a downshift to 0.4%. The outlook on prices also improved slightly, with the Q4 GDP price index up 0.9% -- up from 0.8% and a slice above expectations for no change.The University of Michigan reports its final consumer sentiment reading for February at 10 a.m. ET.Nearly all of the Dow stocks advanced in premarket action, but gains were mild. Home Depot (HD) led with a 1% increase.Kraft Heinz (KHC) kicked up more than 5%, outpacing energy and mining issues to lead the S&P 500. The ketchup, Jell-O and Velveeta giant reported Q4 earnings slipped less than expected. Revenue outpaced analyst forecasts and declared a quarterly dividend of 57.5 cents.Stamps.com (STMP) spiked 21% after a big fourth-quarter beat. Shares ended Thursday below their 50-day moving average in the ninth week of a possible cup base. Premarket action implies an open above that pattern's potential buy point of 114.36. Premarket moves in futures do not always carry through into regular trade.Other notable premarket moves driven by earnings reports included 15% from  Splunk (SPLK), 13% from Herbalife (HLF) and 10% each from Baidu (BIDU) and J. C. Penney (JCP).On the downside, Universal Display (OLED) crashed 15% after unexpectedly weak Q4 results. Both earnings and revenue missed consensus estimates, and management's full-year revenue guidance was far below expectations.Overseas markets moved modestly higher. The FTSE 100 and the CAC 40 were tracking toward gains of around 2% for the week. The DAX showed a gain of less than 1%.China's Shanghai Composite added 1% Friday, narrowing its loss for the week to 3.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged 2.5%, ending the week up 0.4%. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 eked out a 0.3% advance Friday. That gave it a 1.4% gain for the week and putting the index 9% above its Feb. 12 low.Image provided by Shutterstock.

615,HD,"A cart-full of good news on Tuesday -- especially for Home Depot (HD) -- showed that the housing sector continued to be one of the strongest parts of the economy to start 2016.Existing-home sales solidly beat expectations in January, more people are finally putting their homes up for sale to cash in on healthy price gains, and Home Depot saw same-store sales surge by 8.9% in the quarter ended Jan. 31.Existing-home sales rose to a 5.47 million annual pace, just shy of July's level that was the highest since early 2007, the National Association of Realtors said.Sales rose 0.4% from the prior month, but the gain was a surprise because December's total had been artificially goosed by new disclosure requirements that took effect in November, delaying many closings. Compared to the year-earlier period, existing-home sales were up 11% in January, the biggest annual gain since July 2013.The 1.82 million existing homes available for sale rose 3.4% on the month but were still down 2.2% from a year earlier. That means there’s just a 4.0-month supply of homes for sale, just above December's 3.9 months, which was the lowest since January 2005.Amid tight supplies, buyers bid up the national median home price by 8.2% from a year earlier, the largest gain since April.""Spring buying season is right around the corner, and current supply levels aren't even close to what's needed"" to meet housing demand, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.The shortage of existing homes for sale is good news for home builders. On Tuesday, luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) told analysts it now expects its average selling price will range from $810,000 to $850,000 this year, a $10,000 boost on the low end.With the pace of home sales on the rise, and more people getting their homes ready to sell, business is in great shape for Home Depot. Sales rose 9.5%, the best gain in 10 quarters, as big-ticket sales led the way, with transactions over $900 jumping 12%. Home Depot shares rose 1.4% to 124.53 on the stock market today, closing just below their 50-day line after rising as high as 127.19.Rival Lowe's (LOW) is set to report earnings early Wednesday. Lowe's stock closed down 2.3%.The strong housing sector is helping the economy withstand a case of the jitters brought on by the financial market rout that began the year. Home builders such as Toll Brothers and D.R. Horton (DHI) have a big order backlog to keep them busy in the near term.Toll CEO Douglas Yearly noted that home buyer traffic was up 13% in the first three weeks of February. Still, he said that contracts signed this month ""were basically flat compared to the prior year,"" something he attributed to the recent stock market decline.But despite weaker-than-expected earnings, investors were satisfied with the outlook for Toll Bros. and sent its shares up 3.8% on a bad market day.The pause in new-order momentum for the luxury home builder coincided with an overall drop in U.S. consumer confidence. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its confidence index fell to 92.2 in February, down 5.6 points to the lowest level since July. The expectations index slipped to its lowest point in two years, as the share of people expecting an income boost declined to 17.2% from 18.6%. Meanwhile, those who expect their incomes to drop rose to 12.5% from 10.7%.One concern about the housing market is that income gains are running far below the pace of home price increases, which is a negative for demand.December housing market data from S&P/Case-Shiller showed that national home prices rose 5.4% from a year earlier, up from 5.2% in November. But there's tentative evidence that price gains in major cities have stopped accelerating. The 20-city  index showed year-over-year price gains holding at 5.7%, while gains in Case-Shiller's 10-city index slowed to 5.1% from 5.2%.
"
616,HD,"Existing home sales rose unexpectedly in January to a 5.47 million annual rate, a six-month high, according to the National Association of Realtors.The upbeat news comes as Home Depot (HD) said its same-store sales surged 8.9% in the fourth quarter, way ahead of estimates. Home Depot shares rose 1.8% in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. Rival Lowe's (LOW) climbed initially, but then fell 0.7% as the broader markets sold off. Lowe's is due to report earnings Wednesday morning.Nationally, the median home price rose 8.2% from a year ago, the largest since April, amid tight supplies.But other snapshots of the economy out Tuesday painted a less positive picture.Momentum in gains of higher-priced markets showed signs of easing as luxury home builder Toll Brothers (TOL) said new contracts signed were running flat from a year ago in February. Toll Bros. reported weaker-than-expected quarterly profit, and its stock fell Tuesday morning, but rose 3.4% in the early afternoon after saying it's encouraged by early spring home buying traffic.The S&P/Case-Shiller index showed year-over-year price gains holding at 5.7% in December in its 20-city index, while gains in its 10-city index slowed to 5.1% from 5.2%.Meanwhile, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index fell to 92.2 in February, down 5.6 points on the month to the lowest level since July. General Motors (GM) and the broader auto sector, another of the economy's drivers in 2015, got an early warning sign in the form of higher subprime loan delinquencies.Existing-home sales rose 11.0% from a year earlier in January, the biggest annual gain since July 2013. Sales rose 0.4% vs. December.The 1.82 million existing homes available for sale was up 3.4% on the month but down 2.2% from a year earlier. That means there's just a 4.0-month supply of homes for sale, which isn't even close to what's needed to accommodate demand during the spring buying season, NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said.The risk is that tight supply will boost prices out of range of people enjoying only modest income gains.Wells Fargo reported that delinquencies on subprime auto loans hit 4.7% last month, the highest level since 2010. Oil producing areas are seeing a higher share of delinquencies. The default rate is also at the highest level sine 2010.General Motors shares fell 0.8% Tuesday intraday. But General Motors and auto stocks have been languishing for months, despite record U.S. sales, on fears that demand has peaked and that the industry is increasingly relying on long-maturity and subprime financing.

617,HD,"Stocks trended lower Wednesday morning as weak housing and services sector data added to early pressure from oil and overseas markets.The Nasdaq fell hardest, down 1.5%. The Dow and S&P 500 dropped 1.4% each. The Russell 2000 also fell 1.4%.Volume rose firmly, up 10% on the NYSE and 18% higher on the Nasdaq, relative to trade at the same time on Tuesday. Volume helps gauge the degree of participation by institutional investors.Oil prices remained down about 3%. Markets in Europe dug deeper into their losses in afternoon trade. In the U.S., early economic news was an emphatic negative for the stock market today.New home sales slipped to an annualized pace of 494,000 in January, according to the Commerce Department, down from a pace of 544,000 in December. Economist consensus projected a slowdown to a sales rate of 520,000.The U.S. services sector slipped into contraction this month, according to research outfit Markit, which put its preliminary services Purchasing Managers' Index at 49.8 for February, a sharp drop from 53.7 and well below consensus views for no change.Most Dow stocks veered lower at the open. Home Depot (HD) rose 0.6%. United Technologies (UTX) managed a 1% gain. At the low end, Boeing (BA), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) all fell more than 2%.Four of the top five decliners on the S&P 500 were from mining and energy plays. Ford (F) was number five, down 6% at the start of trade.Electrical utility Edison International (EIX) surged 4%, climbing beyond buy range above a 64.17 buy point after clearing that mark in rising trade on Tuesday. Edison reported a slight earnings decline, to 88 cents per shares, in its fourth quarter vs. expectations for 84 cents, and raised its full-year EPS guidance to above analyst consensus.Chesapeake Energy (CHK) soared 12% after reporting its fourth quarter revenue and earnings fell less than expected.

Fourth quarter earnings and revenue cleared consensus expectations, according to the New York-based outfit's late Tuesday report.  The site's web traffic increased 6%, page views rose 7% during the quarter.

Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi speaks to U.S. oil executives in Houston this morning.Consumers' outlook dropped sharply in February, sending the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index to 92.2, vs. a downwardly revised 97.8 in January. The tally was far below economists' consensus forecast for 97.8 and was the gauge's weakest reading in at least six months.Existing-home sales edged up to an annualized pace of 5.47 million in January, the National Association of Realtors reported. That was above December's 5.45 million pace, and above estimates of 5.32 million.Home Depot (HD) came off its opening high but still comfortably led the Dow with a gain of nearly 3% following a positive Q4 report that included strong revenue guidance. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) took the index's hardest hits, down 2% and 3%, respectively.Gains among Nasdaq 100 stocks held to less than 1%. Western Digital was the weightiest anchor.Chesapeake Energy (CHK) led the S&P 500, up 9% as it continued to track volatile oil price moves.Frontier Communications (FTR) gapped up to a 6% gain after reporting a 5 cent-per-share gain vs. expectations for a 2-cent loss. Revenue met expectations, and the telecom network services provider posted a 12th-straight quarter of strong broadband additions.Ellie Mae (ELLI) surged to the head of the IBD 50, rising almost 3% in heavy trade. That left shares just below a cup-base buy point of 83.02.AMN Healthcare Services (AHS) dropped nearly 3% in strong volume. The stock is leaning back toward its 50-day moving average after clearing that level in strong trade Friday.

620,HD,"Target (TGT) fell as much as 9.3% in early trading after first-quarter sales missed analysts’ estimates and the discount chain delivered a disappointing forecast, adding evidence that the biggest U.S. retailers are suffering from a slump.Target’s same-store sales gained 1.2% in the period, which ended April 30, the Minneapolis-based company said in a statement Wednesday. Analysts had predicted 1.6% growth, according to Consensus Metrix.Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said the company faces “an increasingly volatile consumer environment,” adding his voice to the chorus of retailers complaining of sluggish demand. As it copes with the slowdown, the company expects same-store sales to range from flat to down as much as 2% in the second quarter. Earnings will be $1 to $1.20 a share, excluding some items. Analysts had estimated $1.36 on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The results follow a string of weak earnings reports from some of the country’s largest retailers, including Macy’s (M) and Gap (GPS). Even Home Depot (HD), a bright spot in the retail industry, saw its shares sink this week over concerns about slowing growth. While the U.S. Commerce Department reported stronger retail sales for April, Americans appear to be shifting spending away from traditional retailers. Instead, more of them are putting their money toward online shopping or investing in homes, vehicles or technology.Still, Target has successfully used cost cuts to bolster profit. It reported earnings of $1.29 a share last quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.19.“We plan to successfully implement our long-term strategy, even in the face of a challenging short-term consumer landscape,” Cornell said in the statement.Prior to Target’s earnings release on Wednesday, analysts had been raising concerns that the retailer might not be able to keep up with Wall Street’s growth expectations. Analysts at Wolfe Research and Cleveland Research downgraded the company, citing a slowdown in sales last month.“The overall retail climate remains generally underwhelming,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst for Wolfe Research who downgraded the stock to hold from buy. “The climate appears to have deteriorated to a certain degree across retail from late March and into April.”A key challenge ahead for Target will be revamping its grocery department and improving the quality of its fresh foods and supply chain, Mushkin said. It will also have to battle increasing competition from Amazon.com Inc., which recently announced it would start offering a monthly Prime membership and is continuing to expand its same-day delivery.

622,HD,"In January 2005, Larry Summers made a comment about women during a speech that was a gross generalization. It was also grossly erroneous.Now, we are talking about a highly accomplished individual. Summers served as U.S. Treasury Secretary during the Bill Clinton presidential years. He became an economics professor at age 28 and has written 150 scholarly papers. He advised President Obama on what to do about the biggest banks and the auto industry during the Wall Street subprime debt meltdown of 2008.However, Summers' comment at a National Bureau of Economic Research luncheon -- that innate differences between men and women may explain the relatively low number of women scholars in the physical sciences -- raised a lot of hoopla in academic circles and at Harvard University, where at the time Summers was serving as president. The Harvard Crimson reported that MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins ""felt physically ill"" after hearing Summers' remarks.Some believe the controversy ultimately cost Summers his job.What does this anecdote have to do with the art and science of stock investing?If you want to be a great stock picker and an equally great stock seller, then it matters practically zilch whether you are a man or woman. The market is blind to your sex.What factors matter far more? They include your knowledge about the market and the companies in which you invest; your level of discipline in following sound rules; your strength of conviction when it matters most; and your ability to control your emotions. Being male or female does not give you an advantage or disadvantage in any of these factors.Such a statement may seem a minority view.Go on your computer, iPad or smartphone and type in, ""Are women investors better than men?"" Google will list a stream of stories that argue such a case. In December last year, AARP's website began one article in this way: ""Overall, women are better investors than men.""The reason? The writer cited research from professors at the University of California-Berkeley who concluded, after a study of stock trading patterns between the sexes, that men trade 45% more than women. The scholars argued that since frequent trading eats away at returns, women thus performed a full percentage point better than men.Excuse me?When it comes to mastering IBD's CAN SLIM investment system, frequent buys and sells are a part of the process. No one will perfectly pick the next Home Depot (HD) (up 1,835% from its Oct. 20, 1981, breakout to a peak in September 1983), Wal-Mart (WMT) (giant market winner from the late 1970s to 1990s), L Brands (LB) (formerly The Limited, one of the biggest stock market winners in the women's apparel industry), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Qualcomm (QCOM) or Apple (AAPL) in every single trade.In a field of 10,000 stocks trading each day, the mathematical odds are simply too low.Good trading is certainly an act of research and preparation before you buy any security. But the search for great stocks also carries a big element of trial and error.Speaking of errors, do you think the founder and chairman of Investor's Business Daily, William O'Neil, ever made bum stock trades? Of course. Not every stock O'Neil touched turned into gold. But O'Neil's greatness in the stock market came not only in the ability to find and clarify the elements of great stocks at the start of their huge price runs (what CAN SLIM is all about). As associates who have worked closely with O'Neil will tell you, he also succeeded by quickly recognizing his errors of market judgment and keeping losses in many stocks very small.Over the years, women have made strides in the field of equity research and portfolio management. You can read about their adventures on Wall Street via books such as ""Tiger Woman on Wall Street"" by Junheng Li. Meredith Whitney became famous for making a bearish call on Citigroup (C) in late 2007, saying the big bank will be forced to suspend its dividend (she was right). Whitney later left Oppenheimer as a research analyst and started a hedge fund. But in 2015, she was forced to close Kenbelle Capital LP due to poor results and an exit by its largest investor, according to a June 11, 2015, Wall Street Journal article.To be fair, innumerable men have had far more spectacular failures as fund managers. John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital Management, which included two Nobel Prize winners, blew up big time in the fall of 1998. The point: Being a woman doesn't provide you immunity from a stock market that is going the opposite direction of what you think or feel. Everyone must respect the market.""I will never give myself the luxury of thinking: I've made it,"" Zaha Hadid, the designer of the aquatics center at the 2012 London Olympics and other grand projects who died in March in Miami, once said. Although the star Iraqi-American architect wasn't likely talking about stock investing, such an attitude is valuable in the market.The stock market doesn't know who you are. It cannot know whether you're male or female. Nor will it ever care.

623,HD,"After crawling ahead at just a 0.5% annual pace in the first quarter, the slowest in two years, the American economy is due for a bounce -- but how high?The jury is out whether the economy has simply hit another speed bump or is facing a more fundamental slowdown, but some details in Thursday's Commerce Department report point to the latter.U.S. GDP also fizzled at the start of 2014 and 2015, shrinking 0.9% in the former and edging up 0.6% last year, only to come charging back in the second quarter, growing 4.9% and 3.9% respectively. But the momentum didn't last, with full-year GDP rising a moderate 2.4% in both 2014 and 2015.Yet it's iffy whether the economy can rebound to the same extent this year and offset the impact of a weak first quarter. Something has to give: If the economy doesn't speed up in a big way, it's hard to see how employers can keep adding 200,000-plus jobs per month.On the plus side, some really bad news is out of the way.Financial markets have rallied from an early 2016 rout after hitting bottom on Feb. 11.After crashing well below $30 a barrel, oil prices have climbed back above $45. That should mean a gradual easing of the sector's hit to capital spending, though ConocoPhillips (COP) on Thursday cut its capex forecast yet again. Overall, business fixed investment fell at a 5.9% annual rate in Q1, the worst decline since Q2 2009, at the tail end of the last recession.Inventory destocking, which subtracted one-third of a percentage point from GDP growth -- and acted as a drag for the third straight quarter -- may be less of an issue going forward.Lastly, the 3.6% drop in defense spending looks like an anomaly, according to Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight. ""Given the end of the sequester on spending,"" budget analysts expected an increase in spending, he wrote.Behravesh thinks 3% GDP growth the rest of the year is likely, with growth of 2% or more this quarter.Yet there are reasons to question whether the economy will be quite as resilient.Although this year's headline Q1 GDP figure wasn't especially weak relative to the starts of 2014 and 2015, real final sales to domestic purchasers rose just 1.2%, the weakest annualized gain since Q2 2013. Real sales, which strip out net exports and inventory investment, is ""about as core a measure of GDP as there is,"" wrote Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.His point is that U.S. final demand has been softening more than it did at the start of the past two years. Personal consumption expenditures rose a mild 1.9% from Q4, the weakest in a year. And spending on goods rose just 0.1%, the worst in nearly five years. Spending on durable goods, such as autos, fell 1.6%. It's unclear whether General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) can continue to propel sales higher to help fuel the economy this year.Blitz noted that 41% of the increase in consumer spending went toward rent and health, leaving modest gains in the rest of the consumer sector.Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said that the saving rate rose to 5.2% of disposable income, tied for the highest since 2012.Little wonder that a wide swath of corporations, from Wall Street banks to food companies and big industrial firms, are redoubling efforts to squeeze costs to boost earnings with domestic and global demand so sluggish.Residential fixed investment surged 14.8%, the best in four years and good news for the likes of Home Depot (HD). That contributed 0.49 percentage point to the rise in GDP growth -- basically the whole thing.Whether the economy bounces back as strongly as last year will ultimately depend on income growth, and so far the data don't look great, despite solid job gains. One problem may be that those gains have been tilted toward lower-pay jobs.Despite recent pay hikes from Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST) and Target (TGT), federal income and employment taxes withheld from paychecks are up 3.3% from a year ago since mid-March. That's an improvement from growth below 3% earlier in the year, but still well below the 5%-plus gains that helped the economy rebound a year ago.

624,HD,"JCPenney (JCP) missed on first-quarter revenue and cut gross margin guidance for the year on Friday, adding to the retail massacre that was earnings week.Shares closed down 2.8% as the struggling lower-tier department store reported a 32-cent per-share loss, though the result was better than views for a 38-cent per-share loss and narrower than the prior-year loss of 57 cents a share.But sales had been expected to rise from the previous year, and an unexpected 2% dip to $2.81 billion missed consensus estimates for $2.92 billion. Same-store sales dipped 0.4% during the quarter. Cowen, for one, had estimated a 4% gain. JCPenney's men's division performed well, along with Sephora beauty counters, footwear and handbags.JCPenney Chief Executive Marvin Ellison reiterated 2016 comp guidance for 3%-4% but dropped gross margin outlook to a 10-30 basis point increase, down from prior guidance for a 40-60 basis point rise.

629,HD,"The contentious issue over whether the U.S. government should be able to force tech companies to weaken security on their smartphones and software apps so that law enforcement agencies can access private data isn’t likely to be resolved soon.But it could be.All it would take is for President Barack Obama to make a statement supporting strong encryption on tech devices and Internet services.Obama holds himself up as a tech-savvy president, but his lack of leadership on the encryption issue has prolonged the dispute between the federal government and tech firms, tech groups and privacy advocates say.“The White House should be leading on this issue,” said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). “President Obama is trying to be the best tech president ever. He’s got really good technical consultants, and the idea that he wouldn’t listen to them is shocking.”The tech industry is united in its call to keep encryption strong, saying that weakening software security or creating back doors for authorities to bypass privacy protections opens the door for hackers and criminals.“The math doesn’t change,” Cohn said. “The math is the problem that the FBI has, which is: They cannot build a back door that only they can use. It doesn’t matter which technical expert you bring to bear on it. … This isn’t controversial in the tech community.”The FBI has sought court orders in two criminal cases to try to compel Apple (AAPL) to unlock password-protected iPhones. In both cases, the FBI ultimately backed down when it found other ways to access data on the devices. One involved paying a third party to hack the phone, and the other was resolved when the phone’s owner provided the password.Last September, EFF, Access Now, and a coalition of nonprofit and industry groups launched a public petition calling on President Obama to defend strong encryption and oppose back doors. They used the We The People API, Obama’s preferred petition tool, and quickly surpassed 100,000 signatures.Despite the White House’s pledge to respond to petitions with 100,000 signatures within 60 days, it has remained quiet and is now four months overdue in its response.But if Obama doesn’t support strong encryption for businesses and consumers, perhaps the next president will. On Wednesday, 13 U.S. tech industry groups representing companies such as Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Uber Technologies urged the two presumptive major party presidential nominees to support strong commercial encryption.The encryption stance is among a list of tech industry requests made in an open letter to Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.The trade groups asked the candidates to strengthen cybersecurity and encourage other governments to do the same. The letter urged the candidates to recognize the importance of encryption as a critical security tool and to advance policies that enhance data privacy.Groups signing the letter included the Consumer Technology Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Internet Association and the Semiconductor Industry Association.The encryption issue made headlines earlier this year when the FBI secured a federal court order to force Apple to unlock a smartphone belonging to deceased San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Farook. Apple fought the order, saying it would set a dangerous precedent.To help educate the public, Apple CEO Tim Cook stepped up to become the face of consumer data security. He gave high-profile media interviews and made public statements about the importance of strong encryption.Apple’s fight to protect its encryption is about securing the data on all iPhones in use from bad guys, Cook said. That means securing customers’ data, including financial and health information, confidential business documents, private communications and photos.The FBI might have retreated in the cases of the San Bernardino terrorist and a Brooklyn drug dealer, but it is likely to pursue similar cases against tech companies in the future. Unless the White House tells it not to.Meanwhile, law enforcement supporters on Capitol Hill are crafting legislation that could force tech companies to comply with all law enforcement demands for customer data.Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have proposed the “Compliance With Court Orders Act of 2016.” As drafted, the legislation would require any individual or company to comply with any U.S. court order and hand over data to authorities, including data that is encrypted. The bill has been roundly criticized by civil liberties and digital privacy groups.“I don’t think anything will happen in this session of Congress,” said Gary Shapiro, president of the the Consumer Technology Association. Political gridlock, especially during an election year, will ensure that no encryption bill is passed in Congress, he said.It is more likely that a court case will work its way up to the Supreme Court over the next couple of years, he said.Even if the FBI gets what it wants from the courts or Congress, the law would only be enforceable in the U.S. Foreign companies and their encrypted products would be unaffected, putting U.S. tech firms at a competitive disadvantage, Shapiro said.Public support for encryption is growing, especially in light of major data breaches at companies like Anthem (ANTM), eBay (EBAY), Home Depot (HD), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Target (TGT), as well as at government agencies, Cohn said.“We don’t live in a world where computer security is abstract and the damages and problems it causes for people are something that’s theoretical anymore,” Cohn said. “I think it strikes a lot of people as absurd that the government is engaging in trying to attack our security and undermine it and convince companies to give less of it when it should be their job to promote it.”Weakening security on mobile devices and software, says Shapiro, would destroy the confidence people have in businesses to keep their private data secure.

630,HD,"For a few exchange traded funds at crucial points on their charts, some major earnings announcements this week hold the potential for pivotal moves.Funds in health care, utilities, consumer and solar energy are poised to climb past ceilings. With major pieces of those ETFs releasing quarterly reports, significant moves could loom.To be sure, because ETFs are pools of stocks, the performance of a single component has a limited impact on the whole fund. Yet a blowout report or big disappointment can change the course of a sector ETF. For example, Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gapped down 2% on April 22 -- the fund’s largest percentage move since March 1 -- after Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), two of the fund’s top five holdings, slid on weak quarterly results.The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) ETF finds itself in a critical spot as it tries to regain its footing after dropping below its 50-day moving average. Its success in rising from that key level rests partly on how three companies will fare with their latest reports.Duke Energy (DUK), the ETF’s second-largest holding at more than 8% of the whole fund, is reporting Q1 results Tuesday before the open. Analysts expect a profit of $1.14 a share as the Charlotte, N.C.-based utility continues an uneven profit performance.On Wednesday, Dominion Resources (D) releases its earnings at 10 a.m. ET. The consensus estimate is 94 cents a share. Exelon (EXC) comes out with results Friday at 11 a.m. ET, and Wall Street is expecting a profit of 68 cents a share. Dominion and Exelon account for 7% and 5.4% of the fund, respectively.A lot of the top companies in the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) ETF have already reported, but two big ones are on deck this week.Pfizer (PFE) reports Tuesday and Merck (MRK) on Thursday before the open. The drugmakers are the second- and third-largest components of the ETF, which is nearing a key level. Shares are approaching the December peak at 73.16. A move above that level would be bullish.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR’s (XLY) second-largest component, Home Depot (HD), will announce May 17. Disney (DIS) releases its results after the close on May 10. Both heavyweights account for about 7% of the ETF and are among its top three holdings. The ETF is climbing toward new highs as it makes a steady advance.Guggenheim Solar’s (TAN) largest component, SolarCity (SCTY), releases first-quarter earnings after the market’s close May 9. The solar panel installer accounts for more than 7% of the ETF. The fund’s chart is testing resistance around 25, a level that it must conquer if it’s to continue a recovery from a deep decline.

632,HD,"Box (BOX) reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal Q4 loss as revenue growth of 36% topped expectations. It sent the online data storage and file-sharing service provider’s stock up 14% in after-hours trading, just after the market close.The company forecast current-quarter revenue above expectations and a narrower-than-expected full-year fiscal 2017 loss.Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, said the company closed 13 deals valued at more than $500,000 each in fiscal Q4.“Enterprise IT is experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime shift to the cloud,"" he said on the company’s earnings call.Box’s new customers include AIG (AIG), Genentech and Home Depot (HD).Redwood City, Calif-based Box said revenue for the three months ended Jan. 30 rose 36% to $85 million as corporate customer additions rose, beating views. Box said it lost 26 cents per share minus items. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled a loss of 29 cents per share and revenue of $81.77 million. Box said its non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 was $31.1 million (37% of revenue) vs $32.2 million (51% of revenue) a year earlier.For the current quarter, Box forecasts revenue of $88.5 million at the midpoint of its range, vs. analysts' consensus estimate of $86.9 million. For the fiscal year ending in January 2017, the company expects revenue of about $392 million and a loss of 84 cents at the midpoints of its ranges. Analysts had estimated that Box will report a full-year fiscal 2017 loss of 88 cents with revenue of $392 million.Box stock had closed up 3.7% in regular-session trading in the stock market today, prior to fiscal Q4 results.Known mainly as an Internet cloud storage provider, Box has evolved from a provider of basic online data storage into selling file sharing and collaborative tools for team projects. It also sells content management software for large companies.The company added 3,000 business customers in the January quarter. It had 57,000 paying business customers as of Jan. 30, up from 54,000 in the October quarter. Box says that its paying customers include 59% of the Fortune 500.Box said fiscal Q4 billings, a sales growth metric, rose 59% to $130 million.Box competes with Microsoft (MSFT), though it’s now a partner for Office 365 products as well. It also counts as rivals Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, privately-held Dropbox, Amazon.com (AMZN) and others.Data storage costs have been falling, owing to the availability of remote data centers packed with computer servers, putting pressure on pricing. One of Box’s challenges, analysts say, is driving average selling prices higher with add-on software modules, such as file-sharing tools, as prices for online data storage continue to fall.Box has been aggressive on pricing to grab market share in the enterprise market, analysts say. It has a strong retention rate among customers. The company's capital spending jumped in fiscal 2016 as it invested in server capacity and built a new headquarters, but capex is expected to drop sharply in the current fiscal year.“With data center investments nearing the end, 2016 is likely to see significant improvement in free cash flow,” said Rob Owens, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, in a research report.The bearish view is that Box will need to keep buying more servers as it adds customers, making it harder to turn profitable.Box has forecast that it will be free-cash-flow positive starting in fiscal Q4 2017 and FCF positive for the full year in fiscal 2018.Under a ""freemium"" business model, Box also provides consumers with free personal data storage accounts. Box had 41 million free users as of Oct. 31.Aside from Microsoft, Box has alliances with IBM (IBM) and Salesforce.com (CRM) in the enterprise market. Box partnered with IBM in June 2015 to develop new applications and jointly market products and services The IBM relationship has enabled Box to target larger business deals, analysts say.At a Morgan Stanley conference last week, Box said it’s developing a new workflow technology with IBM that will use tools from IBM’s “Watson” artificial intelligence program.While competition has been growing in online data storage, Google and Amazon focus mainly on small and medium-size businesses. Box aims to set itself apart by targeting government agencies as well as industries such as health care, retail, and media and entertainment. It acquired MedXT, a provider of cloud-based medical image viewing, in October 2014.Box currently gets a low IBD Composite Rating of 26 out of a possible 99. The company went public in January 2015, with shares priced at 14. The IPO raised $175 million. Box’s stock spiked on its first day of trading and traded above 20 in June but swooned into the end of 2015, and slid more sharply in January. Its stock touched an all-time low of 8.82 on Jan. 20. Shares began an ascent in early February, though short interest also rose significantly.

That contrasts with top fund managers like Carl Icahn, who trimmed his stake in Apple by 7 million shares in Q4.The added institutional ownership of Apple also came amid reports that demand for the iPhone was cooling off.Meanwhile, the eVestment's top 20 for the first time included Facebook (FB), which debuted at No. 16.But reordering the top 20 by IBD Composite Rating yields a different mix.

In 2015, they collectively had an operating loss of $3.56 billion vs. profit of $23.4 billion at the core.Alphabet closed down 0.2% in the stock market today, just below its 10-week line.With 1.5 billion plus monthly active users, Facebook has no strong competition in the social website arena.The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company also has a 99 Composite Rating and is expanding into adjacent markets like virtual reality with its Oculus Rift headset.IBD 50 list stock Facebook dipped 1.1%.Top U.S. wireless provider Verizon, which has a 98 Composite Rating, last fall declared its intention to be first in the U.S. to roll out 5G wireless, which will enable faster streaming of huge amounts of video and text.On Verizon's Jan. 21 Q4 earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo backed that up, saying, “We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the U.S., and we are currently preparing for (2016) field trials.”Verizon shares eased 0.15%.The world's largest home repair and building supplies retailer on Feb. 23 easily beat Q4 earnings estimates, easing investor concerns that economic uncertainty might derail the retail juggernaut.Home Depot, which earns a 93 Composite Rating, also its best sales growth in 10 quarters, with a 9.5% rise.Shares ended down 1%.The nation's No. 1 cable TV company, which has a 90 Composite Rating, is driving full-steam ahead on marketing of its Xfinity video service and new set-top boxes.Comcast this year launched a social media campaign targeting millennials, and some analysts say Comcast could see a net add in TV subscribers in 2016, despite a trend toward Internet video.Shares dipped 0.3%.

635,HD,"Stocks showed early strength Tuesday, racking up early gains in rising trade -- despite disappointing economic news.The Nasdaq jumped out to an early lead, up 1.5% on an 8% increase in trade. The S&P 500 leapt 0.9%. The Dow racked up a 0.6% increase on trade that was 9% above levels at the same time Friday.The stock market today opened to a weak reading from the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. The index posted a -16.6 tally for February -- better than January's -19.2, but weaker than the -10 expected by analysts.Homebuilder confidence eased in February from January's high levels, with the National Association of Homebuilders putting its Housing Market Index at 58 for the month and revising its January figure to 60, from 61. Analysts expected an unchanged tally of 61.Europe's market continued to trade mixed, with Frankfurt's DAX down 0.6%, Paris' CAC 40 up 0.2% and the FTSE 100 in London climbing 0.7% in afternoon trade. All three indexes posted solid rallies while U.S. markets were closed Monday.Oil prices continued to trade moderately higher, up a bit less than 1%, after news of a possible production agreement between Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar. The agreement would halt output at January's high levels, and require production ceilings on Iran and Iraq, recovering producers which analysts generally see as unlikely to commit to what for them would be low-level curbs.On the Dow, Goldman Sachs (GS) and Home Depot (HD) added more than 2% each. Intel (INTC) was the index's worst early performer, down 0.6%.ADT (ADT) topped the S&P 500 with a 51% gain. The home security services provider announced it would be taken private in a deal with Apollo Global  Management at 42 a share, valuing the company at just above $6.9 billion.Other top performers among S&P 500 companies included ore miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), up 8%, and natural gas pipeline operator Williams Co. (WMB), up 6%.Signet Jewelers (SIG) popped more than 5% after reporting plans to voluntarily delist from the London Stock Exchange. The diamond seller reported less than 1% of its annual trading volume was executed on the LSE, making the expense of maintaining its market status there more weighty than the benefits.Among IBD 50 stocks, TAL Education (XRS) rumbled almost 7% higher in huge trade. That put the stock well above its 10-week moving average and about 2% from a 48.94 buy point in six week flat base. The stock had tripped a sell rule last week by diving more than 8% below that buy point.Surgical Care Affiliates (SCAI) pared gains, but remained up 4% in strong trade. The hospital and surgical center operator  reported fourth quarter earnings in line with, and revenue growth well above analyst consensus expectations. Shares are in the fifth week of a shallow consolidation.The early few losses on the IBD 50 list were modest, holding to less than 1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

637,HD,"With events such as Apple's (AAPL) recent wrangling with the feds pushing the issue of digital security to the forefront, it's no wonder payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) is growing more prominent in the ongoing battle against cybercriminals.The No. 2 company in its field by volume, Vantiv continues to reap the rewards of merchants' and financial institutions' move to chip cards and their corresponding terminals. Its suite of other cybersecurity products continues to play a key role in the company's upward climb.Vantiv processed $842 billion in transactions last year, and this is showing up in the company's numbers. Fourth-quarter results surpassed analyst estimates as adjusted earnings jumped 23% to 65 cents a share, marking a third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Net revenue increased 13% to $453 million.“Vantiv has strong secular tailwinds, in our view, spanning digital payments, security, software and e-commerce with little exposure to macro headwinds like (currency exchange), gas, regulation, credit or discretionary spending,” Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck said in a recent note to clients. He also notes that Vantiv has ""above-average industry growth.""Vantiv can thank a number of entities for lifting awareness of cybersecurity, with the most recent example being Apple. The tech behemoth brought the issue of smartphone security front and center in recent days with its controversial refusal to assist the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that could contain terrorism evidence. The company says it wants to protect customer privacy.Cyberhacks have also struck customer databases at such merchants as Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) in recent years, and the threat they'll keep scouring the Internet for further vulnerability persists.One relatively new security measure in the U.S. payments space is that of chip cards and terminals known as EMV. Named for the three consumer credit companies that originated the technology -- Europay, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) -- EMV uses a chip embedded in the card, rather than the traditional black strip, in an attempt to process payments in a much more secure way.The card-and-terminal upgrade cycle is driving significant growth for Vantiv, which plays on both sides of the equation. Some 80% of the company’s revenue comes from merchants, via the sale of new terminals, as well as other e-commerce, mobile, compliance and data analytics products. Clients include Macy's (M), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), Kroger (KR) and the U.S. Postal Service.The other 20% comes from financial institutions, with Vantiv behind the reissuance of the cards that contain EMV chips. Partners include Comerica Bank (CMA), Fifth Third Bank (FITB), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and Capital One Financial (COF).Fortunately for Vantiv, the EMV upgrade cycle has a long way to go. Vantiv said last month during its fourth-quarter earnings call that, as of the end of 2015, more than two-thirds of the terminals of its merchant clients still needed to be upgraded. And more than half the debit cards of its bank clients still needed to be reissued as chip cards.""Some 15% of Vantiv's merchant transactions are chip-on-chip, meaning a chip card used by a consumer at a merchant that has a chip terminal,"" Beck told IBD. ""That gives you a sense that we're still pretty early, and my view is that this a multiyear cycle for Vantiv.""Further, the urgency for financial institutions and merchants to convert is growing. October 2015 marked a shift in liability to whichever party -- card issuers or merchants handling payments -- has the weaker technology. Prior to that, the card issuers were primarily responsible for cyber fraud liability.The company expects to see continued growth from EMV-related sales at least through early 2017, with an even longer tail from smaller clients on the merchant side, according to Vantiv Chief Executive Charles Drucker.""On the financial institution side, we're seeing the large banks adopt fast and reissue the cards,"" Drucker told IBD. ""The mid-size banks, as you pull into early 2017, you're going to see a lot of the cards out there with chips in them.""Along with upgrades, Vantiv is helping guide clients through the ever-changing regulatory environment, Drucker says. And its large clients are implementing Vantiv’s entire security suite, including end-to-end encryption and tokenization, a process that removes the credit card number completely from the retailer’s system.Beyond that, a number of merchants are buying terminals that also have near-field communication, or NFC, technology, which enables payments from the likes of Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google-owner Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Android Pay.The introduction of Apple Pay in September 2014 helped create a turning point in the payment processing industry, with nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals in the U.S. now enabled to accept billions of dollars in mobile payments, according to Juniper Research.""Most of the merchants, when they are designing their system, they're designing it in a way that when they get EMV, they are able to implement NFC inside of it,"" Drucker said.Another area of growth for Vantiv has been in the integrated payments space. For example, when a server enters an order into a restaurant's software system, Vantiv is embedded in that process. Plus, Vantiv is expanding into new verticals in the integrated payment category, including health care.Vantiv earns a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. Shares are trading 1%-2% below a cup-shaped base buy point of 53.46, with the stock retaking its 50-day line several weeks ago.Vantiv also has less exposure to the current volatile economic environment because of its concentration in everyday spending categories, including grocery stores and drug stores. The company doesn’t have much foreign exposure at this time, but in the long term, Drucker sees an international investment in the e-commerce space.And with the vast amount of information its transactions contain, Vantiv sees data analytics as a long-term growth driver as well.""Merchants and banks continue to be more interested in data analytics -- whether it’s banks using it to activate customers or see trends inside their base, or merchants using it to give a better customer experience, or to improve ticket sales that they have,"" Drucker said.

639,HD,"MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) has built a solid 10-year performance record investing in a variety of growth stocks. The fund's sector weights show where the fund managers see the best opportunities for stock price appreciation.The $15.5 billion fund had 23% of its shareholders' money at work in consumer cyclical stocks as of Feb. 29, by Morningstar Inc.'s count. That was double the S&P 500's 11% weighting.Consumer cyclical sector funds rank eighth out of 14 sectors in performance over the past year.The fund was also overweight in health care, 23% vs. 15%. And it was overweight in technology, 24% vs. 19%.Health care funds rank 11th in one-year performance. Tech funds rank seventh.Some of the fund's consumer cyclical stocks could be poised to run higher. Amazon (AMZN) is down 13% from its 52-week high but up 25% from its February low. Trading around 601, it was working on a cup-with-handle base with a 603.34 buy point. The 600 level has been an area of resistance in recent days. Amazon is also shaping the right side of a lopsided double-bottom base. If the stock doesn't find strong volume in crossing the handle buy point, the next likely buy point would be the middle peak of the double-bottom, or 638.16. Aggressive traders might have bought when Amazon broke out of a downtrend on March 24. New buyers should wait for a breakout past the handle.Home Depot (HD), another consumer cyclical, is just above break-even so far this year. Trading around 134, it has rallied 22% off its Feb. 8 low. And it is within 2% of its 132.22 buy point.It has IBD's Composite Rating of 96. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest.The home improvement retailer's sales have been lifted by the housing rebound. Also, its dividend yield is 2.1%.Among health care stocks, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is a bet that is already paying off. The provider of managed health care services is up 7% so far this year. And shares are up 18% from their Jan. 14 low.Earnings per share growth is slowing. In the past four quarters, respectively, EPS grew 30%, 15% and 3%, and then shrank 15%. Some of its slowdown is due to losses selling coverage on Affordable Care Act health exchanges.Analysts see earnings rising 11% in the current quarter and 20% for the full year.Tech giant Facebook (FB) is up 4% this year. Shares are forming a lopsided cup with handle. Trading around 111, its pivot point is 116.99.EPS grew 16%, 33% and 46% in the past three quarters, respectively. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 99.Alphabet (GOOGL) is down about 3% this year. EPS grew 1%, 5%, 17%, 18% and 28% the past five stanzas. The stock has a 98 Comp Rating.Trading around 761, shares are in a cup-with-handle pattern, showing a 777.41 entry.The fund had big underweights in financial services, 7.5% vs. 14%. It is also underweight in energy, 0% vs. 6.8%, and in consumer defensive, 3.4% vs. 10.4%.The fund is subadvised by a team from Winslow Capital Management. Clark Winslow and Justin Kelly have been on the fund since late 2005. Patrick Burton joined in early 2013.The fund's 7.47% average annual gain over the 10 years going into Tuesday beat 71% of its peer group. Year to date, in a turbulent 2016, the fund has lost 6.30% vs. a 3.16% setback for its direct rivals and a 0.54% gain for the S&P 500.Image provided by Shutterstock.

640,HD,"Stock indexes turned positive Friday afternoon, after reversing early gains, as the market headed toward its last hour of trade.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average hugged gains of 0.4% and 0.3% respectively, while the Nasdaq rose 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was down 8% on the Nasdaq but up 4% on the NYSE.Blue chips were mostly up but not one stock in the Dow was attracting above-average volume.Among top-rated stocks, Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN) nailed a breakout in above-average volume. The stock popped about 3.5% and crossed above a 42.43 buy point. Volume was more than 40% above average in early trade but then faded to about 20% above average.Beacon Roofing has been growing partly through acquisitions. In October, the company acquired roofing products distributor Roofing Supply Group. In December, Beacon bought selected assets from three other roofing-related distributors. On April 1, Beacon announced it acquired siding and gutter distributor Lyf-Tym Building Products and decking and siding distributor Atlantic Building Products.Beacon is the second biggest distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials in the United States and Canada.The stock carries a Composite Rating of 97. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A rating of 97 means the stock rates in the top 3 percentile.Other stocks in the retail and wholesale building products group include Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Tractor Supply (TSCO). The three stocks are 1%, 3% and 9% off their respective highs.The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil surged 5.5% to more than $39 a barrel. U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell by about 5 million barrels last week vs. analysts forecasts for an increase of 3.2 million barrels, according to government data.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, specialty steel was on track for the biggest gain of the day, while apparel manufacturers were down the most.

642,HD,"Heavyweight chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) again dominated as chip suppliers for the Apple (AAPL) Retina MacBook 2016, according to an iFixit teardown, which notes the MacBook finally joined its iPhone and iPad cousins in rose gold solidarity.The 12-inch MacBook comes equipped with ""a faster processor and zippier flash memory."" Intel again supplied the core processor and an HD graphics card, and both flash-memory NAND chips (256 gigabytes) came from Toshiba.Samsung and Micron Technology (MU) split the difference in other memory vectors. Two Samsung chips provide a total 8 GB of RAM, and Micron supplied a single 4-gigabit DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chip.Broadcom re-won its touchscreen controller and what iFixit believes to be a wireless chipset, and STMicroelectronics (STM) again supplied a microcontroller.Texas Instruments supplied a total of four chips, including a system management controller. The Dallas-based chipmaker showed up six times in the earlier iteration, but the 2016 teardown wasn't as extensive as the 2015 teardown, iFixit said.Fellow Apple supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) was seemingly ousted from the Retina MacBook 2016 logic board. In the 2015 model, the teardown showed NXP supplied a microcontroller and two interface expanders.Like its 2015 counterpart, the Retina MacBook 2016 earned a 1 out of a possible 10 in repairability from iFixit. The main reason is because the display is a single, fused unit, so ""if the display needs replacing, it'll cost a pretty penny.""In afternoon trading on the stock market today, shares of both NXP and STMicroelectronics were down 2%, while Intel stock was down nearly 1% and Micron down more than 1%. Broadcom stock was lower by a fraction, and Texas Instruments stock was up a fraction.

Home Depot (HD) led the upside with an 0.7% gain.Virgin America (VA) and Ruckus Wireless (RKUS) grabbed headlines, spiking 40% and 30%, respectively, at the start of trade. Virgin announced a $2.6 billion takeover by Alaska Airlines (ALK). Ruckus said that it would be folded into Brocade Communications (BRCD) for about $1.2 billion.Stocks related to natural gas packed into the top of the S&P 500, as natural gas prices popped 3%.But Edwards Lifesciences (EW) led both the S&P 500 and the IBD 50 list, spiking 16% out of the starting gate.  The Irvine, Cal.-based medical devices maker announced positive trials for its SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN XRT aortic valve replacements.

The stock remains in buy range through 102.74Smith & Wesson (SWHC) dived 14%, apparently tripped up by analyst downgrades. BB&T Capital Markets trimmed its rating to hold from buy. Cowen & Co. downgraded the stock to market perform from outperform. The stock had been fighting to hold a 26.64 buy point in a cup base. Monday's heavy-volume move sent shares 11% below that mark and below support at its 10-week moving average.Another possible factor was firearms background checks for March, which are a rough gauge for industrywide sales. March numbers were the lowest in four months.Peer Sturm Ruger (RGR) felt some of the suction, diving 7% in powerful trade and also cutting its 10-week moving average.

647,HD,"As a leading operator of work-site child-care centers, Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) is happiest when the labor market is thriving.When employers dangle perks to attract and retain talent, the company benefits. After all, work-site child care is one of those perks.""The competition for professional talent has continued to be a tailwind for us,"" CEOe David Lissy told IBD. ""We do business with companies in every sector of the economy.""Since its founding in 1986, Bright Horizons has operated child-care and early-education centers for large companies, mostly in on-site centers. Many of its early customers were big investment banks and money centers.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) remains one of its biggest clients. Other large customers include Comcast (CMCSA) NBC Universal, General Mills (GIS), Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD).Many of the firm’s newest clients are smaller companies and in technology, higher education, biotech and health care, Lissy says. Recent new customers include visual computing firm Nvidia (NVDA) and Dignity Health, the largest hospital company in California.At year-end, Bright Horizons operated 932 child care and early education centers. Most are in the U.S., with others in the U.K., Ireland, Canada, the Netherlands and a single location in India.JP Morgan analyst Andrew Steinerman notes that demand for high-quality licensed child care such as Bright Horizons' is driven by a ""high proportion"" of dual-income families.""Once employers offer child care, the benefit is difficult to take away,"" he wrote in a research report.The company’s core users are mostly the preschool-age children of professional working parents, who typically have household incomes above $100,000 a year, Lissy says. Employers subsidize a portion of the costs, about 25% on average.A growing number of its centers are off-premise hybrids called lease consortiums, which take in kids from parents working for multiple employers as well as from the community. These centers are typically in urban markets such as New York and San Francisco.Unlike its other centers, Bright Horizons usually builds lease consortiums. Until five years ago, it had been opening only a small number each year, but in the past five years it’s been opening 15 to 20 a year for a total of around 250.""We saw an emerging need in and around major cities,"" Lissy said.Analyst Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets says such new office complexes with onsite child-care centers typically offer tenants in the building first dibs and discounts.""If they can’t fill them up, they open (spaces) to the outside. It’s been a nice growth area for (Bright Horizons),"" he told IBD.Acquisitions – long part of Bright Horizons’ DNA  -- will continue to complement organic growth. Of the 8% to 10% top-line annual growth the company expects this year, 2% to 5% of that will likely come from acquisitions, both in and outside the U.S., Lissy says.Last year, the company acquired Hildebrandt, a 40-center chain operating in the mid-Atlantic. In 2013, it acquired a chain of 64 nurseries in the U.K. and 49 corporate-sponsored centers in the U.S., called Children’s Choice.Management sees the bulk of its growth coming from new child-care centers (an expected 20 to 25 net new centers this year), new enrollments in existing centers and price increases of 3% to 5% a year.In addition, it’s seeing faster growth from two smaller business lines -- in temporary backup care and education advisory services to help employers manage tuition reimbursement programs.""Companies in the U.S. spend about $17 billion a year on tuition reimbursement benefits for their employees,"" Lissy said. ""We do this for about 150 clients. It’s about a $30 million business for us and growing 20% a year.""In the highly fragmented market for temporary backup dependent care for young children and the elderly, Bright Horizons offers the service at its own centers or through a contracted network of home caregivers.Employers buy the backup service on behalf of their employees for a limited number of days. Employees pay a small co-payment ranging from $5 to $20 a day, Lissy says.These other services, added or expanded in the past several years, come with higher margins than the firm’s core business and have helped earnings grow faster than revenue.Per-share earnings in Q4 grew 21% over the earlier year and 28% for the full year. Analysts expect earnings this year to rise 18% to $2.19 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. That’s on the low end of the company’s forecast for 18% to 20% adjusted EPS growth.Since employers typically build out and equip the child-care centers, Bright Horizons’ capital costs are relatively low. Its biggest expense is staffing for teachers and assistants. Labor accounts for about 75% of costs, Lissy says.Revenue growth from Bright Horizon’s core child-care centers started accelerating in the first quarter of 2015 and have picked up steam in every quarter since, Lissy says.Fourth-quarter revenue grew 10% over the earlier year to $372 million. That was a step up from the third quarter’s 9.2% gain. For the full year, revenue rose 8% to $1.46 billion. Shares, meanwhile, have jumped 27% in the past 12 months.Management forecasts revenue growth of 8% to 10% this year.""It is going to be tough to keep that accelerating top-line growth, but it should grow at a faster rate than the overall economy,"" said analyst Silber.He says employer-sponsored child care is a late cycle business.""As unemployment declines and labor markets tighten, more companies use services like this for recruiting and retention,"" Silber said.

648,HD,"The March jobs report was even better than Goldilocks.In another era, stock markets cheered economic data that were not too hot and not too cold, but just right for keeping the Federal Reserve on hold. This month's employment report, by contrast, was strong, but a surge in the number of job-seekers still means that there's enough slack in the labor market to allow the Fed to take its time before hiking again.Even as the economy added 215,000 jobs last month, the jobless rate ticked up to 5.0% as job-seekers continued to flood into the labor force. The 2.4 million people joining the workforce over the past 12 months were by far the most since the beginning of 2007.That's why -- despite solid job gains and a nice 0.3% monthly uptick in wages, aided by pay hikes at Wal-Mart (WMT) and Costco (COST) -- financial markets showed no concern that the data would push the Fed to speed up its timetable. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq 0.9% Friday, even as oil prices tumbled. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield and U.S. dollar index barely budged.One reason that the Fed has leeway to hold off on rate hikes for now is that the job market's strong March comes after a period of relative weakness.Several data points signal significant labor market slack remaining.The shorter workweek has come, in particular, in low-wage areas seeing a big jump in hiring. Retail led all sectors with a gain of 47,700 jobs in March, with building-supply and garden stores like Home Depot (HD) adding 10,000 positions. But the overall retail strength looks deceptive when you consider that total hours worked in the sector actually fell 0.4% on the month amid a shorter workweek.Other sectors seeing strong job growth included leisure and hospitality (40,000), construction (37,000) and health care (27,000).On the downside, manufacturing cut 29,000 jobs, the most since December 2009. Most of the cuts came in the durable-goods sector, where employment has slipped to the lowest level since August 2014.Yet despite the employment loss, the manufacturing sector appears to be recovering. The Institute for Supply Management said Friday that its manufacturing index rose to 51.8 in March from 49.5 in February, crossing the neutral 50 level into positive territory for the first time since August. Economists had expected a reading of 50.5.The new orders and production gauges were both solidly positive, even as the employment gauge dipped further, to 48.1 from 48.5. While it's probably too much to expect a factory job rebound, job levels should start to stabilize thanks to the decline in the dollar that makes U.S. producers more competitive.The overall tenor of the jobs report points to an economy that is picking up some steam after a period of financial volatility and has a bit of running room with the Fed on the sidelines. Still, some analysts raised concerns that the flood of workers returning to the workforce may not meet the needs of many employers.""While these latest figures are encouraging, finding qualified workers continues to be a challenge for many companies,"" said Ken Esch, a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers' private company services practice.""From our viewpoint, the current economic expansion is only beginning to address the structural issues in the economy,"" wrote Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Sarah House. ""There remains a continuing gap between the demand for labor and supply of available workers.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

The stock fell below its 50-day moving average, a key technical support level.Late Monday, Netflix posted Q1 earnings per share that beat forecasts, but came up short on revenue.It earned six cents a share, up 20% year over year, on sales of $1.958 billion, up 24%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for three cents EPS on sales of $1.965 billion.For the second quarter, Netflix is targeting earnings per share of two cents. It did not give a revenue estimate. Wall Street had been modeling Netflix to earn five cents a share, down 17%, on sales of $2.117 billion, up 29%.IBD Take: Netflix has often been a highly rated stock, though now its ratings are mixed.The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company gained 6.74 million total streaming subscribers worldwide in Q1, topping its guidance for 6.1 million. It added 2.23 million streaming subscribers in the U.S. and 4.51 million in foreign markets. It ended the quarter with 81.5 million subscribers worldwide.What follows are five key takeaways from Netflix’s Q1 report.Netflix expects to add 2.5 million new subscribers in Q2, its seasonally weakest quarter. That would be its lowest new subscriber total in two years, even though Netflix has since rolled out its service worldwide, excluding China.Netflix projects that it will add 500,000 streaming subscribers in the U.S. and 2 million in international markets in Q2.Netflix faces increased subscriber churn in the U.S. as many longtime customers see a $2 increase in their monthly fee to $9.99 a month, starting next month. Over the last two years as Netflix adjusted its pricing, it grandfathered existing customers at the earlier rates.Meanwhile, Netflix's international subscriber forecast for Q2 faces tough comparisons to the year-earlier quarter, when the company launched in Australia and New Zealand.On a conference call with analysts to discuss Q1 earnings late Monday, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said that the company plans to roll out price increases over the rest of the year to those U.S. customers given generous grace periods.Currently, more than half of Netflix’s U.S. subscribers pay only $7.99 or $8.99 for the company’s most popular plan, now priced at $9.99 a month. The plan provides HD video streams to two devices at a time.Netflix ended Q1 with nearly 47 million U.S. streaming subscribers.“We will phase out this grandfathering gradually over the remainder of 2016, with our longest-tenured members getting the longest benefit,” the company said in a statement. “We are rolling this out slowly over the year, rather than mostly in May, so we can learn as we go.”Well-heeled, better-educated consumers fueled Netflix's early growth in overseas markets. The streaming video leader first grabbed the low-hanging fruit: consumers who enjoy English-language content and have international credit cards.Getting the next group of consumers to subscribe will take more work, the company said. Netflix needs to add more content in local languages and new payment options, Hastings said.“Over the next couple of years, as we further localize, we’ll be able to see more opportunity,” Hasting said.Netflix will premiere its first French original series, “Marseille,” a political drama starring Gerard Depardieu, globally on May 5, and a new Japanese original series, “Hibana,” globally in June.Netflix also is working on “3%” in Brazil, “Suburra” in Italy, “Dark” in Germany, an as-yet-untitled period series in Spain, a second season of “Club de Cuervos” from Mexico and another Mexican original series starring Kate del Castillo called “Ingobernable.” Plus, it is producing a Japanese anime series, “Perfect Bones.”Netflix executives on Monday's conference call said that they had no interest in bidding on several movie studios reportedly in play, including Viacom (VIAB) subsidiary Paramount and Starz (STRZA).“It’s been 15 years we’ve been public and 20 years existing, and we’ve done no M&A,” Hastings said. “So I think that probably speaks for itself.”Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said Netflix is building its own production capabilities.Netflix has been successful growing its content production organically, so it doesn’t make sense to “juice it with M&A,” Hastings said.Netflix is considering allowing customers in some markets with poor Internet infrastructure to download shows and movies for offline viewing.“We’ve been so focused on click-and-watch and the beauty and simplicity of streaming,” Hastings said. “But as we expand around the world, where we see an uneven set of networks, it’s something we should keep an open mind about.”But Netflix executives scoffed at the idea of offering live sports. They also said that virtual reality programming was not something the company is considering.VR for the consumer market likely will be focused on video game experiences for the foreseeable future, Hastings said.At least 10 analysts cut their price targets on Netflix stock in response to the company’s Q1 report.Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein lowered his price target on Netflix to 123 from 140 but reiterated his outperform rating on the stock.The company’s second-quarter guidance suggests slower-than-expected international subscriber growth, Helfstein said.“The magnitude of the global launch in Q1 (to 130 new countries) makes a hyperlocal content strategy impractical in the short term,” he said in a report. “As such, it appears near-term momentum will slow as Netflix decides which countries to focus on.”Pivotal Research Group analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak cut his price target to 145 from 155 but kept his buy rating.Netflix’s Q2 international guidance was well below expectations, he said. Wall Street analysts on average were looking for 2.8 million new international subscribers, vs. the 2 million that Netflix forecast.“We had frankly anticipated more pent-up demand in these international markets (even with an initially less appealing focus on English-language programming and international payments), and now it appears that in these new markets Netflix will need to first invest in new localized content/improved payment mechanisms to accelerate growth, which will take time,” Wlodarczak said in a report.FBR analyst Barton Crockett raised his price target to 104 from 100 and maintained his market perform rating. But he called the company’s international subscriber guidance “jarring.”

653,HD,"In times of increased market volatility, it pays to have two managers run slightly complementary investment strategies in one fund. You could say it’s just one more way to diversify.USAA Aggressive Growth Fund (USAUX) has been around since 1981. As the name suggest, this aggressive growth mutual fund invests in large-cap companies with a strong growth trajectory. The mutual fund focuses primarily on U.S. equities, but can also invest up to 20% in foreign stocks.The $1.2 billion fund charges a 0.88% fee and requires a minimum investment of $3,000. Top 10 holdings represent nearly 30% of the fund and include companies such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Visa (V), Facebook (FB), Home Depot (HD) and Celgene (CELG).The fund carries an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it has outperformed 95% off all other mutual funds in that period.The fund has returned an average 9.16%, 7.33% and 4.85% over the past three, five and 10 years. It is off 12.81% so far this year vs. declines of 13.03% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 9.17% for the S&P 500.While the fund’s advisor is USAA Asset Management, two subadvisors are actually making the day-to-day investment decisions for the fund: Wellington Management, led by  Paul Marrkand, and Winslow Capital Management, led by Clark Winslow. The fund's long-term allocation tends to remain around 50-50 for both managers, with slight deviations of a couple percent during major market swings.""It has two managers that approach investing in growth companies in a slightly different way,"" said Wasif Latif, head of global multi assets at USAA Investments. ""So, while investment results are not 100% complementary, they do have complementary features that over time offset each other to some degree from an excess return standpoint.""Winslow takes the path of a very aggressive growth manager, seeking out really high-growth companies and buying them up aggressively, he explained. ""Their style I would say is more typical of the aggressive growth space.""Wellington, on the other hand, even though working in the same universe of companies and using the same Russell 1000 Growth index as their benchmark, is ""not as aggressive (as Winslow) because their style and their process has an additional dimension of looking at the quality of the company and paying a little bit of attention to valuation.""Wellington selects growth companies while also looking at the stability of their earnings, their growth rate and valuation. ""What ends up happening is you have two managers that complement each other in a way that if the market is very strong, high momentum, really focused at nothing but growth ... then you should expect Winslow to do really well and Wellington to do OK and continue to match or try to keep up with the market.”On the flip side, a choppier environment, where growth begins to get questioned and high-growth companies don't get rewarded by the stock market, Wellington will do somewhat better than Winslow. Both companies use a bottom-up approach to select stocks and can hold the same names in their part of the portfolio.""When you have a skilled manager that can actively manage within their space, you should expect that over the long course of time, their performance will add value on its own,"" said Latif.The fund has an annual turnover rate of 55%, on the low side for growth funds, which typically hit 100%. But though the fund has fallen with the stock market, its manager haven't been sitting idle. In the period ended Dec. 31, the trimmed back on several positions, including Apple and Celgene. They're all more than 20% off their 52-week highs.

654,HD,"Six stocks in Friday's edition of IBD Stock Spotlight boast a Composite Rating of 99.Among these six -- which include gun maker Smith & Wesson (SWHC), China's TAL Education (XRS) and nutritionals firm Omega Protein (OME) -- Facebook (FB) likely possesses the largest impact on the stock market itself and the most exciting growth prospects for investors.As seen at the top of the Nasdaq composite's chart on IBD's ""What's The Market Trend?"" page (B9 in Monday's paper), Facebook is the fourth largest company by market value on the Nasdaq. Its $306 billion market cap is equivalent to nearly 4% of the entire exchange.Equally important, Facebook is the sort of once-in-a-generation company that has revolutionized business and the way people communicate. Truly great stock market winners are special that way. So, will Facebook at some point enter the pantheon of great stock market winners, a list that includes Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Microsoft (MSFT), Dell and Cisco Systems (CSCO)?What are Facebook's advantages? One is strong management. COO Sheryl Sandberg was a key player in developing the advertising business at Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) before joining Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's team. (For the sake of disclosure, this writer went to college with Sandberg.) Two, Facebook has succeeded in keeping its website the most attractive way for users to connect and share with others online.Three, acquisitions are producing value, such as its 2012 buy of Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock. Four, institutional investors are showing confidence in the company. As of the end of 2015, 3,054 mutual funds and hedge funds held shares in Facebook, up from 2,679 at the end of Q1 that year.Creative destruction runs at a fast tempo in the Internet field. That is, new competitors can come in and take away market share quickly. That's why the media has paid attention to new social media firms such as Snapchat of Venice Beach, Calif.

656,HD,"Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results early Thursday, but it continues to face declining sales overall and in key categories, and its guidance missed Wall Street estimates.Best Buy stock was up 2%, above 32, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, as investors cheered the announcement of a special cash dividend and higher quarterly dividend.Best Buy said it will pay a special dividend of 45 cents a share, or about $145 million, related to the net after-tax proceeds of certain legal settlements and asset disposals. The retailer also boosted its regular quarterly dividend by 22% to 28 cents a share.Plus, Best Buy announced a new $1 billion share-repurchase plan expected to be completed over the next two years.Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly said the company aims to be a “premium dividend payer,” with a non-GAAP dividend payout ratio between 35% to 45%.In its fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, the Richfield, Minn.-based company earned $1.53 a share excluding items on sales of $13.62 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Best Buy to earn $1.39 a share on sales of $13.61 billion. On a year-over-year basis, EPS rose 3% and sales fell 4%.Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Best Buy's earnings per share fell 5% to $1.39.Best Buy's same-store sales slipped 1.8% in Q4. But the company's e-commerce sales jumped nearly 14% to $1.95 billion, accounting for 15.6% of total U.S. revenue. In its online sales segment, Best Buy competes with industry powerhouse Amazon.com (AMZN).

657,HD,"Growth in health and wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by “significant declines” in mobile phones, tablets and digital cameras, Best Buy said in a press release.For the current quarter, Best Buy expects to earn 31 to 35 cents a share, vs. 37 cents a year earlier. The midpoint of 33 cents a share would represent a year-over-year decline of 11%. It sees sales falling 3% to $8.3 billion based on the midpoint of guidance.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were modeling for Best Buy to earn 38 cents a share on sales of $8.4 billion.Best Buy Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam said the retailer expects to see sales decline in the first half of the fiscal year, followed by growth in the back half. Best Buy is targeting flat domestic revenue for the full year. Appliances, home theater and connected home products are likely to be the top growth categories, she said.Best Buy said it will counter soft overall-sales growth in consumer electronics by focusing on market share gains and by making operational improvements to boost profits.On a conference call with analysts, Joly spoke about the product categories that will drive Best Buy sales. Household appliances, connected home products and large-screen ultra HD or 4K televisions are bright spots, he said.Virtual reality headsets are a new category that Best Buy is “very excited about,” Joly said.“This is an interesting category,” he said. “It will be small this year. It may help in the computing category with (sales of) higher-end computers because you’re going to need that computing power. But from a financial perspective, it’s going to be limited.”Three VR platforms are coming to market this year: Facebook’s (FB) Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation VR.

662,HD,"After a bloodbath in January and a near-miss in February, the market finally got it right in March. The S&P 500 advanced 6.78% last month, and U.S. diversified stock mutual funds tacked on 6.50% on average, according to Lipper Inc.It wasn't enough to pull stock mutual funds into the black for the entire first quarter -- they lost 0.39% as the S&P 500 gained 1.35%.""It was a tale of two halves in Q1,"" said Anthony Valeri, an investment strategist for LPL Financial, one of the largest independent broker-dealers in the U.S. and a top custodian for registered investment advisors, in summarizing the quarter's stock market news.In the first half of Q1, investors worried about U.S. interest rates rising, oil prices slumping and China's economy cramping. ""Their flat-out fear penalized stocks inordinately,"" Valeri said.In the second half, investors' fears eased. ""By mid-February, a lot of bad news was priced into stocks, and data started to get better,"" Valeri said. ""In mid-March the market got a tailwind from the Federal Reserve, which suggested it was likely to raise rates twice this year, not four times.""Click Here To View A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersWeekly jobless rolls fell. Retail sales for January were stronger than expected, with an upward revision for December. Even manufacturing data, a sore spot previously, improved in March. Housing data showed resilience. Did we leave anything out?""Oh, yeah, oil prices stabilized,"" Valeri said. ""That was big."" And with that, the U.S. dollar eased, helping exporters and stocks in general.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceLike wildcatters flocking to rich oil fields in boom times, investors poured into natural resources funds and commodities energy funds, driving them up 11.74% and 9.68% respectively in March.Commodities in general did well last month. Precious metals funds gained 6.82%, padding their overall Q1 gain to a big 42.21%, tops among sectors for the quarter.With commodities prominent among value-oriented mutual funds, midcap value funds were the top performing category among U.S. diversified fund groups in Q1. They gained 2.91%. Not far behind were equity income funds, with a 2.86% gain.Click Here To See A List Mutual Funds Quarterly LeadersTop U.S. diversified stock funds included $552 million Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity (GSXAX), whose 3.88% Q1 return topped 95% of its small-cap growth peers. With a management team including Ralph Bassett and Jason Kotik, it was also the eighth-best performing U.S. diversified stock fund overall in the year ended March 31.Foreign stock funds fared better than U.S. stock funds by losing less in Q1, just 0.02% on average.Taxable bond funds lost 2.63% in Q1. Tax-exempt bond funds gained 1.43%.""In the near term, there's good reason to think oil has stopped going down and the dollar has stopped going up,"" said Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ""If that's the case, the market could get better in the second half of the year.""But, Doll cautions, oil has never staged a sharp rally. ""Commodities in general and oil in particular have never made a V bottom,"" he said. ""After declines, they've often had multiyear periods before going up the other side (of a price formation).""And since late March, the per-barrel price of benchmark light sweet crude oil has pulled back slightly.Also, China's economic growth is still not expanding. ""China is consciously reorienting its economy away from huge dependence on exports and capital investments and toward a longer-term, sustainable economy based on consumption,"" Doll said.Amid global economic uncertainty, U.S. stocks appear likely to remain a safe-haven attraction for investors.The technology and financial sectors appeal the most to Doll. ""Financials are the cheapest cyclicals in the market,"" Doll said. ""They had a big bear market in the first six weeks of the year. Now they're back up.""SPDR Financial ETF (XLF) fell 17% through Feb. 11. It rallied 15% from there through March 31.And in a sluggish market, stock pickers should outperform index-huggers, Doll said.""To win (with investment returns) this year: The two or three times this year when there's blood in the street, buy some equities,"" Doll said. ""When things improve and other investors get complacent, let some go (to take profits).""Doll said he will keep some telecommunications stock in his portfolio. ""I want some defense in there,"" he said. Instead, why not utilities, which are also defensive and pay dividends? ""They're expensive now, and telecom is a better value.""Doll said he also has more appetite for consumer discretionary than staples. ""Discretionary has better valuations,"" he said. ""And staples tend to be more global, and therefore face more risk of currency headwinds.""Valeri has a similar view on some sectors. ""We're still focused on areas that benefit from further expansion,"" he said. ""That means more cyclical sectors like consumer discretionary and tech. We also have a more modest overweight to industrials.""The $1.2 billion Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary Portfolio’s (FSCPX) recent top holdings were Amazon (AMZN), followed by Home Depot (HD), Walt Disney (DIS) and Nike (NKE).He added, ""Health care is the one defensive sector that is a focus because earnings clarity is fairly good.""Allergan (AGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and United Healthcare (UNH) were recent top holdings of Vanguard Health Care Fund (VGHCX), which wields $46.9 billion in assets.Like Doll, Valeri is leaning away from utilities and consumer staples. Unlike Doll, he's also leaning away from telecom. ""Our expectation is for improving economic growth,"" he said. ""So those sectors won't necessarily benefit as much. Utilities and telecom are rate-sensitive, and we think rates will move gradually higher this year. So that's a headwind for those sectors. And their valuations are generally expensive.""Image by Shutterstock.

663,HD,"Aberdeen U.S. Small Cap Equity Fund (GSXAX) is on a roll. Through March 31, the now-$558 million portfolio was the eighth-best performing U.S. diversified stock fund in the prior 12 months with a 7.58% return, according to Morningstar Inc. And it was No. 1 among small-cap funds. The S&P 500 advanced a more modest 1.35% in that period.At the quarter's end, the fund ranked in the top 1% and 2% of its small-cap growth peers over the past three and five years, respectively.The fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Thirty-two-year-old Ralph Bassett and 47-year-old Jason Kotik, two of the fund's four managers, spoke with IBD from their offices in Philadelphia about how they invest.IBD: Describe key aspects of your research process.Kotik: We have concentrated positions of between 40 and 60 names. We start with meeting a company's management team. Some investors look at screens. We look at a company to understand its business model, to look at its historical margins and returns, the balance sheet, things like that. We build a list of questions for that management team.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe bigger difference (between us and other funds) is that, while we interview company management like other investors do, we take a three-to-five-year or longer approach to understanding businesses because we'll hold them a long time.Our turnover is 25% to 35% a year, the lower end of the range for most funds. Our approach is really about understanding management's discipline around their capital investments, understanding them and building a relationship with them.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceSo, in the future when things don't go as planned -- and there's always a time when things don't go as planned, always -- we know how they will react, based on their answers to our questions.That's really the most important part of understanding a business.IBD: You recently wrote that volatility can be an opportunity. Was the recent market volatility a buying opportunity?Bassett: In the back half of last year and the first month of this year, I would say there was more opportunity than we'd seen in a long time.We did find some companies of higher quality but linked to less predominant macro themes (than the ones that hurt the energy sector). Things unfairly got discounted around macro contagion and dollar strength. We take a long view and assume dollar strength will subside over time. So we found some good opportunities.IBD: What are some examples?Kotik: We found opportunities to take advantage of names we own. One example in Q4, we were able to top up Canadian Western Bank. When you think of western Canada, you think of oil and gas, the oil sands market. So you'd think their loans portfolio would be filled with damaged goods. But less than 3% of their loans are to oil companies. They had traded down to tangible book and to book value. We took advantage of the marketplace selling off energy stocks and Canadian stocks and anything related to the Canadian dollar, and we added to our position.IBD: What example would you provide, Ralph?Bassett: We initiated a position in WisdomTree Investments (WETF) in February at the depths of the market. Their business is focused on ETFs and specifically those that are bespoke in nature -- bespoke in the sense that they are the only solely-ETF-focused company that is public. They also have been very innovative and quick to market with products compared to their peers. Now they have a wide product menu, and that can capture shifts in client asset allocation over time.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Quarterly LeadersWe had grappled with their valuation for a while. Frankly, we watched it tumbled from 30 to 24 to roughly 10 -- then it got more intriguing. A lot of concerns about their product concentration and competitive forces were, in our minds, diminished.Secondly, they had net cash on their balance sheet and intended to keep it that way, so we weren't worried about financial risk.We will be slow and patient. This is an example of our process patience.IBD: What else besides the housing rebound is driving Gibraltar Industries (ROCK)?Kotik: It sold off in the down market, and we added to it. It's rebounded more than 40% off its bottom.Gibraltar has started to make a strong transition in its business model to diversify its end markets.Its new CEO (Frank Heard) came from Illinois Tools Works (ITW) and brought ITW's tenets of focusing on the parts of the business that provide higher profits.It's a building products company. It sells things like mailboxes to Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's Cos. (LOW). They have a large contract with the postal service for large-scale postal boxes. Apartment buildings need them because of ecommerce and the way consumers now buy products. Apartment managers can't figure out where to put all of this mail and packages. So Gibraltar came up with a plan for a new model.We own it because they use their capital extremely efficiently, and their cash flow is expanding. They're moving to a higher-margin mix of businesses.We look for company-specific drivers. Gibraltar benefits from the housing rebound. But we won't invest in companies that benefit just from volume and cyclical rebounds. We need a specific driver. For Gibraltar, it was about their transition to a more diversified business, driving higher quality profitability, rather than a focus on top-line growth.IBD: OK, what's the driver for Drew Industries (DW), a maker of components for recreational vehicles and manufactured homes?Kotik: The interest is that they've been adding dollar content on products to the RV and manufactured home industries. They've consistently improved their content dollars per vehicle.

What's the special catalyst? Start with RBC Bearings (ROLL), please.Bassett: They make highly specialized ball bearings, which range from pen-cap size to several feet. Those big ones go into huge industrial products and reactors.They focus on specialty areas where the ball bearings need to be designed into the product. That reduces competition, so they capture margin along the way. Their business is high-value-added, taking share in programs. They've thought about acquisitions but are being careful. Years down the road, there could be pressure on their aerospace business. We're mindful of the potential cyclicality.IBD: What about Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), an egg distributor?Bassett: They are slowly shifting away from the egg commodity part of their business. About one-quarter of their business is providing specialties like liquid eggs to McDonald's (MCD) and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN).They're increasing their organic eggs business. And a lot of customers want cage-free eggs. Few companies can afford to provide that. It takes capital for land and structures for organic eggs and cage-free eggs.So Cal-Maine not only picks up business, it consolidates as smaller farmers are forced out.IBD: What's the special driver for MarketAxess Holdings (MKTX), an electronic bond-trading exchange?Bassett: Previously, a lot trades went through large investment banks with huge inventory. But MarketAxess can do it cheaper in smaller quantities, so if someone wants to sell several bonds rather than huge round lots, MarketAxess offers cheaper transaction costs than larger brokerages.And they focus on a relative niche market: corporate credit, which is not as huge a market as the Treasury market that large investment banks focus on.But Bloomberg has also tapped into this market, and it's hard for MarketAxess to gain share vs. Bloomberg.IBD: What's the catalyst for Prestige Brands (PBH), which markets health care and house-cleaning products?Bassett: By and large, you've heard of their products: Comet, Luden's cough drops, Monistat. When they acquire a brand, they invest in it so they can maintain or gain share, then they harvest the added cash flow.They don't manufacture. They do more branding, marketing, distribution. They are outsource manufacturers.Look at Procter & Gamble (PG), which is shrinking its portfolio of products and is refocusing. Maybe Prestige can take advantage.IBD: How important are competitive moats for companies?Kotik: Over the long term, in this marketplace, success is not about high momentum. People care about valuation, and they should. This will differentiate us.

665,HD,"Planning to move into a new house or have your heart set on that long overdue kitchen or bath remodel? Either way, it’s going to be tough to avoid the products of Fortune Brands Home and Security (FBHS).With offerings in cabinets, plumbing, exterior doors, locks and safes, the 2011 spinoff from its eponymous former parent -- a company later renamed and absorbed by a Japanese firm -- has the home basics territory pretty well blanketed five years after staking its own claim. But no, Fortune doesn't sell blankets.Aided by the revival in new home sales and continuing strength in home remodeling and repair markets, Fortune has been on a roll. Last year's sales increased by 14% to $4.6 billion. Earnings rose to $1.88 a share from $1.64 in 2014. With special charges stripped, earnings totaled $2.07 a share.Executives have issued a rosy forecast for 2016, expecting sales to grow -- with a full year of revenue reflecting Fortune's 2015 acquisition of cabinet manufacturer Norcraft Companies -- by a healthy 10-12%.Kitchen and bath cabinets, along with plumbing products, are Fortune's biggest revenue producers. In last year’s fourth quarter, cabinets -- swelled by the Norcraft acquisition -- produced $608.1 million in sales. That was just under half of Fortune's $1.224 billion quarterly total.Plumbing, headlined by the Moen brand of faucets, contributed 29% of corporate sales. Security products, which include both the Master Lock and SentrySafe brands, chipped in just under 12%. Doors, featuring fiberglass and steel models by Therma-Tru, accounted for another 9%.Fortune is clearly a play on both new home construction and the repair and remodeling markets, all of which have rebounded from the housing scandals and meltdown of 2007-08. Last year, the home repair and remodel market grew by 5%, according to Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.Kermit Baker, project director for Remodeling Futures at the Harvard center, expects a comparable spending expansion this year.""We’re seeing mid single-digit growth -- around 5% -- through the remainder of 2016,"" he said.Already, the repair and remodeling market has rebounded to the prior peak levels of 2007, he noted. Replacement parts for the likes of roofing, siding and doors have been in recovery for some time.But now discretionary kitchen and bath remodeling, hit hard when the housing bubble burst, are starting to come back, Baker says.This is certainly good news for Fortune, which thrives on kitchen and bath replacements and additions.In cabinets, Fortune is especially strong in selling to Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW), which accounted for roughly 35% of the sector’s 2015 sales. The purchase of Norcraft in May 2015 strengthened its position among independent dealers.""There are higher margins in the dealer channel,"" noted Jim Barrett, analyst with C.L. King.The cabinet market peaked at $15 billion in 2005, according to Mike Wood, analyst with Macquarie Research. It pretty much collapsed after the housing bust, bottoming at $6.8 billion in 2011, he noted. But by last year, it had rebounded back to $10.2 billion.""We actually see cabinets as one of the fastest-growing verticals in building products,"" said Wood.Cabinets offer Fortune the broadest growth. But plumbing supplies bring the richest margins. While adjusted margins are 3.4% for cabinets, they’re 19.5% in plumbing, according to a recent research report by RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Wetenhall.Fortune’s plumbing business benefits from ""long-term commitments with new home builders,"" said Tim Wojs, analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co. Wojs added that plumbing ""can be a product that sells the home.""Moen faucets are the big seller but recently Fortune has promoted new offerings in a related line: garbage disposal units. One of the things Fortune has done well is expand related product categories, often by acquisition. Thus, for example, one buyout enabled Fortune to add bathroom vanities to its cabinet line.Analysts believe Fortune has the financial firepower to do more buyouts. Wojs estimates that Fortune will have $1 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. This, along with a relatively unleveraged balance sheet that can access new debt, will give the company a substantial war chest. Some of that can go into new deals.""The deal is the big swing factor for Fortune Brands,"" said Macquarie’s Wood. The big question is whether they can find complementary companies at an accretive price, said Wood. He notes also that some major Fortune shareholders would prefer a deal to share buybacks.""The shareholders would be disappointed with a huge share buyback as opposed to acquisition,"" he noted.One likely buyout sector, said Wojs, is plumbing. He sees an opportunity for some international expansion there. To this point, Fortune has been mostly focused on the U.S., with international sales accounting for just 15% of its revenues.For now, though, Fortune can ride rebounds in home construction and remodeling and enjoy the fruits of some well-executed recent expansions.Said C.L. King’s Barrett: ""It’s a company that has done a very effective job in capitalizing on the rebound in construction and remodeling as well identifying solid strategic acquisitions.""

666,HD,"HP Inc. (HPQ) is making a play for the premium notebook computer market long dominated by Apple (AAPL). At a luxury products conference in Versailles, France, on Tuesday, HP introduced its Spectre notebook, which it billed as the world’s thinnest laptop.Spectre’s aluminum chassis is as thin as a AAA-battery at just 10.4 millimeters. That compares with 13.1 mm for Apple’s MacBook.Spectre has a full HD 13.3-inch diagonal edge-to-edge display and Bang & Olufsen sound. It is powered by Intel (INTC) Core i5 or i7 processors, depending on the model.It will be available for preorder online on April 25 starting at $1,169.99. It is expected to be in Best Buy (BBY) stores on May 22 starting at $1,249.99.HP also announced limited edition versions of its Spectre notebooks from designers Tord Boontje and Jess Hannah.“The HP Spectre is the thinnest notebook in the world, and unlike the majority of other super thin PCs on the market, this laptop doesn't compromise power or features,” said Kevin Frost, HP vice president and general manager for consumer personal systems, in a statement.The Spectre notebook weighs 2.45 pounds and has high-gloss copper accents that give it a jewel-like finish. It boasts up to 9.5 hours of battery life per charge.Also Tuesday, HP refreshed its Envy line of notebooks with screen sizes of 15.6 and 17.3 inches. The 15.6-inch Envy starts at $679.99. The 17.3-inch Envy starts at $1,029.99.HP stock was down 1%, near 12, in midday trading on the stock market today. Shares touched a nearly three-year low of 8.91 on Feb. 11.On Monday, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich reiterated his neutral rating on HP stock with a price target of 11. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company faces near-term challenges in PCs and printers but has longer-term opportunities in copiers and 3D printers, he said.RELATED:HP Stock Slumps On Continued Weak PC, Printer Sales Outlook

668,HD,"As drugstore giant Walgreens (WBA) on Tuesday helps to ring in a new earnings season, ETF investors await more than its latest quarterly results.They're hoping for insights on the retailer's proposed merger with rival Rite Aid (RAD). Signs of progress could send Walgreens stock higher.Investors in exchange traded funds have a pressing question about the broader consumer discretionary sector, too. When this S&P 500 sector is expected to show earnings growth leadership in 2016, why is it lagging in the stock market?Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) is up 2% year to date through April 1. By comparison, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) jumped 16% in the same period.Yet in the recently concluded reporting season, the consumer discretionary sector posted an impressive 11.53% earnings-per-share growth over the year-ago quarter -- ahead of all S&P 500 sectors except telecommunications services.""This (discrepancy) may partly reflect the sector's outperformance in 2015,"" Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in a recent note.Indeed, that strong showing factored into Miracle Mile Advisors' decision to get out of the sector in the middle of 2015.After a strong run, consumer discretionary and retail stocks had looked fairly valued, said J.J. Feldman, portfolio manager at the Los Angeles firm, which manages roughly $500 million.Miracle Mile also expected defensively oriented sectors to hold up better if the market pulled back. The decision to tilt towards utilities and consumer staples paid off in 2016's volatile first quarter.XLY has rebounded nicely amid a broad stock rally in the last month, rising 4.4%. However, Feldman's still cautious about consumer discretionary and retail stock ETFs.""We're not looking to enter until it gets a little bit cheaper,"" said Feldman. ""It's a valuations call.""However, both recent economic data and recent policy moves are supportive of domestically oriented sectors, such as retail. These include job gains, emerging signs of wage growth and a Fed that's in no hurry to raise interest rates.""Consumers have money in their pockets to spend"" when mortgage and auto loan rates are low, said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks Investment Research.And in an earnings recession, the consumer discretionary sector is holding up fairly well. It's expected to see a 1.4% EPS decline in first-quarter earnings and a 2.5% decline in first-quarter revenues -- better than most S&P 500 sectors and subsectors, according to Zacks estimates.""The only concern I have is that consumers have not really been spending, despite low gas prices,"" Mishra added. What Americans have been willing to spend on is leisure and entertainment activities. That helps to explain the wide dispersion in the consumer discretionary sector.For example, Market Vectors Gaming (BJK) and SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) are up 7% year to date. XRT invests in companies that own and operate big-box general merchandise, drug, grocery, department, automotive, apparel, and specialty retail stores.Besides Walgreens and Rite Aid, XRT's 98 equal-weighted stock holdings include highly rated IBD stocks such as parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), discount retail store Five Below (FIVE) and beauty chain Ulta Beauty (ULTA). This ETF has a smaller-cap skew than XLY.Investors seeking to invest in this sector should look for stock holdings that benefit from rising consumer trends, such as online shopping and home improvement, Mishra advised.The two largest stock holdings in XLY and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary (VCR) are Amazon (AMZN) and Home Depot (HD). Amazon and Home Depot have soared 62% and 21% in the past year, respectively.Miracle Mile managers are more likely to invest in XLY than XRT when they decide to dive back into the consumer discretionary sector.""We tend to go towards more household, blue-chip names,"" Feldman said.

Dow futures steered more than 200 points above fair market value, up 1.3%. S&P 500 futures gained 1.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were ahead 1.9%.The stock market today took some early strength from oil prices, which perked back above $31 a barrel, up more than 5% as a broad range of factors — including potential eurozone stimulus, terrorist attacks on Libyan oil sites, and cold weather in Europe and the U.S. — lifted prices and appeared to scare some short sellers out of their positions.Economic news starts with a preliminary estimate on January manufacturing from researcher Markit at 9:45 a.m. ET.

"
715,HD,"Sales of $2 billion are a drop in the bucket -- if you’re IBM (IBM) or Cisco Systems (CSCO).That’s how much tech giant IBM drew in 2015 security revenue. Networking giant Cisco pulled in $1.75 billion in security revenue. But security sales accounted for just 2.4% and 3%, respectively, of those companies’ multibillion-dollar top lines.Both IBM and Cisco say their cybersecurity revenue rose 12% last year. The growth outstripped pure players Symantec (SYMC) and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP). And the total dollar sales for IBM and Cisco easily topped total revenue for leading security pure players Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Fortinet (FTNT) and FireEye (FEYE).Cybersecurity Ventures CEO Steve Morgan says it’s just the beginning of a series of “knockdown, dragout brawls"" among tech giants IBM, Cisco, Dell and others specifically in the security software-and-services arena in 2016.And companies like IBM and Cisco don't enter the ring with kid gloves. This bare-knuckle  donnybrook for cybersecurity superiority will be fought with well-padded M&A budgets. The steep decline in security software stocks of late, amid fears of slowing spending on enterprise software, only raises the stakes, making some buyout targets likely more affordable.Lower spending could hit security vendors, but there's no debate that cybersecurity needs have grown. Hackers stormed the digital bulwarks of Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), Sony (SNE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the Office of Personnel Management in 2013, 2014 and 2015. That drove a lot of what Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski calls “panic spending.”More than 60% of 137 chief information officers recently polled by Piper Jaffray had refreshed their security firewalls within the past 12 months. And firewall security ranked only No. 5 on a list of CIO priorities. Endpoint security, compliance, protecting Web applications, and internal-access management topped CIO priorities.These latter four segments will be hot M&A sectors this year, Nowinski says.“A lot of enterprises, in light of all the mega-breaches that occurred in 2014 and 2015, really beefed up and spent a lot on their network perimeters,” he told IBD. “After getting more comfortable with your perimeter (by beefing up firewalls) . . . you need to invest in technology that protects what the hackers are going after.”Symantec, Trend Micro and Intel (INTC)-owned McAfee lead the endpoint protection sector, according to Gartner. The market tracker says Imperva (IMPV) and F5 Networks (FFIV) top the Web-application firewall market, while CyberArk Software (CYBR) leads the internal-access management segment.Valuations skyrocketed in the hyperactive 2015 threat landscape, Nowinski says. Thus, last year wasn't one of big consolidation for cybersecurity.""Companies were trying to figure out what were the most strategic assets they needed to add to protect against the changing threat environment,"" he said. ""The threat environment was evolving very quickly and valuations were going through the roof with these mega-breaches.""Valuations, however, have plunged lately. IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was down nearly 40% as of Friday from its 2015 high achieved July 24 -- after the group plunged 7.4% on Friday. From the start of 2015 through July 24, the group had rocketed 33%.The group tacked on another 7.2% loss by the closing bell Monday, as techs tumbled on the heels of poorly received forecasts from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA), whose stocks sheared off after their quarterly reports last week. Cloud securer Qualys added to the pressure when, late Monday, the firm reported Q4 and 2015 sales that missed consensus views, and issued Q1 guidance that lagged Wall Street expectations.The mass high-tech selloff also plagued IBD’s 26-company Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which landed down 4% and 2.8% on Friday and Monday, respectively.Still, a lot of big dollars are up for grabs in cybersecurity, FBR analyst Daniel Ives says. He estimates that spending on next-generation security wares will jump 30% in 2016, though total IT spending is seen rising just 3%.Gartner estimates that IT security spending will soar from $75 billion-plus in 2015 to $101 billion in 2018. Research firm Markets and Markets sees the cybersecurity market hitting $170 billion by 2020.""It's such an enormous growth segment, in a very choppy environment,"" Ives told IBD. ""It's pent-up demand and it's the massive threat environment. . . . You look at the technology landscape and cybersecurity is a priority.""As nontraditional security firms jump on the cybersecurity bandwagon, no potential M&A is off limits, Cybersecurity Ventures' Morgan says.""If you look at the cybersecurity industry, there are not a lot of unicorns,"" he said. ""What we're seeing is (startups) will raise $10 million to $100 million . . . to ratchet up and get acquired by multimillion-dollar tech companies.""In January, FireEye stirred the M&A dust with a $200 million acquisition of cyberthreat intelligence firm iSight Partners, expanding its portfolio again after its $1 billion Mandiant acquisition in 2014.""That's where we're going to see the market,"" Morgan said. ""Any company that has successfully raised (venture capital) funding would be a takeover candidate.""Alan Kessler, CEO of privately held Vormetric, calls these ""tuck-in acquisitions.""""I think the pace of acquisitions is probably going to accelerate simply because of what's happening in the overall market demand for solutions,"" Kessler told IBD, ""but also the fact that some of the smaller players may have difficulty getting funding at a valuation that is appealing to their investors.""Vormetric falls into that ""tuck-in"" field. The encryption specialist is in the process of being acquired by Thales, a French company focused on ""creating a safer world,"" according to its website.Thales isn't a pure cybersecurity player but it touches 80% of online-processing payments, Kessler says. Vormetric will be threaded into Thales' data security group when the transaction closes, likely in late March.Kessler expects IBM and Cisco to continue adding new cybersecurity offerings to their portfolios. And the market recognizes that -- big tech firms know enterprise-level software, Enterprise Strategy Group analyst Jon Oltsik told IBD.""There's consolidation in the customers, the enterprise; they want to buy fewer tools from fewer vendors,"" Oltsik said. ""They want an integrated platform because what we've done in the past isn't working anymore.""And the efficiency of the technology has to be enterprise class, so that kind of speaks to the bigger vendors who know how to service the enterprise.""In the largest pure-tech merger ever, Dell last year agreed to acquire EMC for $67 billion in -- and thereby got its hands on EMC's RSA security business. In December, Dell confirmed rumors that it filed a $2 billion IPO for its SecureWorks business, which it acquired in 2011 for $612 million.""They single out cybersecurity and decide that's their spinoff?"" Morgan said. ""That says a lot about the market.""The pure players have done some tucking of their own. In 2015, Fortinet acquired Meru Networks for $44 million and Check Point spent $80 million on Lacoon Mobile Security.Also in 2015, Cisco followed up its $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013 by acquiring OpenDNS for $635 million. And Raytheon acquired Websense for $1.9 billion, to create privately held Forcepoint.Between 2014 and 2015, Microsoft (MSFT) -- which Oltsik calls a cybersecurity ""wild card"" -- spent $600 million to buy three Israeli cybersecurity firms.""You would not call Microsoft a cybersecurity company,"" Morgan says. ""But you're starting to see them get very active in cyber. IBM would be another interesting company.""In 2015, IBM's total sales fell 12%, to $81.7 billion, even as its cybersecurity sales rose 12% to $2 billion.""That's a lot (of growth) when you're counting in the billions,"" Morgan said. ""That's not on a lot of people's radar. That gets lost a little bit in the context of much bigger companies.""FireEye's iSight acquisition is the only confirmed M&A in the sector this year. But CyberArk stock surged in January on rumors that Check Point is seeking to acquire it. Culturally, it makes sense --  they're both Israeli firms, Ives says.Should Check Point and CyberArk merge, such a deal would be larger than a tuck-in, Morgan says. Although Check Point is much larger -- with a $13.5 billion market value to CyberArk's $1.3 billion -- both are credible performers, he said.""I'm not sure we'd call that a merger or an acquisition,"" he said. ""CyberArk and Check Point, if that were to happen, I think you're looking at two companies coming together and looking to move into a much larger position in the market.""Cisco, Oracle (ORCL), IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Symantec will stoke 2016 M&A, Ives says. He lists Qualys (QLYS), CyberArk, Fortinet, FireEye and Imperva on his takeover list. He says the timing is especially ripe for Symantec to make an acquisition.Symantec completed its Veritas sale to the Carlyle Group on Jan. 29,  saying it received $5.3 billion in after-tax proceeds from the deal. Symantec acquired data storage firm Veritas for $13.5 billion in 2005, a deal that many analysts questioned.Mountain View, Calif.-based Symantec struggled in 2015, when revenue fell 2.4% to $6.54 billion. Now, Symantec will apply the cash from the Veritas sale toward an acquisition that strengthens its position, Nowinski said.Oltsik sees platform plays taking out Resilient Systems, Phantom Cyber, Invotas or ServiceNow (NOW) as automation becomes an increasingly important piece of cybersecurity. Smaller firms like Malwarebytes and Code DX also could be swept into the M&A frenzy, Morgan says.""In a different tech sector, where there's not as much M&A activity, you have to be doing some very cutting-edge things to be an acquisition target,"" he said. ""Here, if you walk and talk and raise money in the cybersecurity space, you're a target.""

718,HD,"Stocks gapped up at the open Friday and were building on the gains in afternoon action. Low volume, though, suggested that funds weren't fully on board.The Nasdaq gripped a 1.4% gain, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 led with a 1.6% pop in the stock market today. Volume was running about 12% to 15% lower.Blue chips were mostly up. In the Dow, Home Depot (HD) posted a 2% advance in roughly average volume. Home Depot has sketched a double-bottom base with a buy point at 127.19.

Home Depot was holding about 1% above the buy point in afternoon trade.In the IBD 50, chipmaker Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) resolved recent doubts as it jumped almost 6% in heavy volume. The stock had been hesitant around a 41.42 double-bottom buy point.Hesitation around the buy point has been a trend recently, but a signal earlier this week flashed bullishness. The put-call volume ratio, a secondary indicator, closed at 1.21 Tuesday. Readings above 1.15 are sometimes associated with short-term market bottoms.The signal isn't instantaneous, which means that a short-term low could've been put in Thursday. The last similar reading came on Feb. 8. Three sessions after that, the Nasdaq marked a bottom. The indexes have been in a confirmed uptrend since the Feb. 17 follow-through.Secondary indicators are secondary for a reason -- they have a hit-and-miss history. However, the put-call volume ratio has been fairly accurate in the past couple of years.The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 2%. Comex gold fell 1%. Energy stocks were leading the market.

The big-cap bogey averaged an 11.23% advance.While the fund rotated from some smaller, fast-growing biotech and technology stocks in Q4 into better-established, more stable stocks, it has hardly abandoned growth. Holdings in the portfolio average an IBD Composite Rating of 72. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Top holdings with very strong Comp Ratings of at least 80 as of Dec. 31 included Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Home Depot (HD), Priceline (PCLN) and Nike (NKE).New buys with Comp Ratings of 90 or better included McDonald's (MCD), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Southwest (LUV) and MSCI (MSCI).Stocks poised to do well can be spotted deeper in the portfolio, too.

734,HD,"Many retailers, especially those largely dependent on brick-and-mortar stores for sales and profits, are suffering through a rough patch, but home improvement chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) should do just fine, analysts say.Home Depot will report third-quarter results Tuesday, followed by Lowe's on Wednesday. Both are expected to log double-digit profit growth on sales gains in the mid-single digits.The home improvement sector marches to its ""own drummer"" — the housing market — ""and should be less impacted by the recent retail malaise,"" said analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note.Private fixed-residential investment, viewed as a proxy for U.S. housing-related spending, was up 10.7% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth, he noted.Home Depot's earnings are seen rising 19% from a year ago to $1.32 per share on revenue of $2.18 billion, up 6%, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Lowe's is expected to earn 78 cents per share, up 32% from last year, on revenue of $1.43 billion, up 5%.While an unseasonably warm autumn can disrupt retail sales patterns, it might actually have benefited the two home improvement chains by extending the busy summer/fall selling season, he said.And he noted ""fairly positive"" commentary from vendors such as Sherwin-Williams (SHW), Fortune Brands (FBHS) and Whirlpool (WHR) during the third quarter.However, rural lifestyle chain Tractor Supply (TSCO) faced ""modest weather-related headwinds"" on heat-related products during the warmer-than-usual quarter. But overall, Tractor Supply benefited from the extended summer selling season, the analyst said.Shares of Home Depot, which tumbled 3% on Friday, closed up 0.7% on the stock market today. Lowe's finished 2.2% higher after losing 3.6% Friday.Home Depot and Lowe's both earn Composite Ratings from IBD of 82 out of a best-possible 99, based on metrics such as growth in earnings and stock, but that is down from the low 90s three months ago.Follow Marilyn Alva on Twitter @IBD_MAlva.

735,HD,"Like championship boxers, mutual fund managers who outperform for extended periods know how to roll with the market's punches and how to attack an opening.The portfolio managers of the $17.7 billion MainStay Large Cap Growth A Fund have demonstrated both skills recently, coping with the market's summer volatility and adding to their portfolio strategically.""We upgraded the portfolio as some great growth companies' prices corrected,"" said co-manager Justin Kelly of subadvisor Winslow Capital Management.The fund has generated an average annual return of 8.45% the past 10 years, vs. 7.35% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 7.38% for the S&P 500.This year going into Tuesday, the fund gained 4.88%. vs. 3.39% for its peers and 1.45% for the S&P 500. The fund carries an IBD 36-Month Performance Rating of A. The third-quarter stock market nose dive pulled down Regeneron (REGN) to what the MainStay managers saw as an attractive entry point.The fund invests in three types of growth stocks: those with long-term sustainable earnings growth, with quality cyclical earnings growth and in industries with rapid growth.The fund bought shares in Regeneron, which has the leading treatment for retinal eye disease and a compelling pipeline, including a new cholesterol drug, Kelly says.For investors who follow IBD's CAN SLIM method, the stock shows a 588.15 entry point.Regeneron has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, powerful on a scale of 1-99.More Health StocksIn Q3, the fund started a stake in Edwards Lifesciences (EW). Its products treat advanced cardiovascular disorders. Kelly cites Edwards' leadership in transcatheter heart valves. ""Their end market is bigger than most investors believe, which will propel earnings growth above what the Street expects,"" he said.The stock has an 89 Composite Rating and is trading a little above its 154.84 cup-with-handle entry.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is another health care name in which the fund began a position in Q3.Kelly likes the company's new lung cancer drug, Opdivo. The company's blood thinner Plavix is the world's second best selling drug.Also active in other sectors, the MainStay fund boosted its overweight in the consumer discretionary sector.The fund started a position in Under Armour (UA). Kelly says that the company continues to take market share in the growing athletic-leisurewear market.The stock advanced in Q3 but has trended lower since then, slipping beneath its 10- and 40-week moving averages.Dick's Sporting Goods' (DKS) weak Q3 hurt Under Armour, according to Piper Jaffray.Dick's also issued a weak outlook Tuesday. The stock market news helped send Under Armour down 5.6% that day.MainStay's managers — Kelly plus Clark Winslow and Patrick Burton — added to stakes in Amazon (AMZN) and Home Depot (HD) in Q3.Kelly likes Amazon Web Services, whose business is mushrooming, he says. Amazon, which has a 97 Comp Rating, is extended past its 549.88 buy point. After four quarters of earnings per share declines, Amazon's EPS rose 170% and 118% the past two stanzas.Home Depot, with an 88 Comp Rating, is about 7% above its 118.09 entry point. Benefiting from demand for home improvement, the company reported an 18% jump in EPS on Tuesday.

737,HD," Stocks rallied across much of the session Friday, as a strong November jobs report overpowered a sharp pullback in oil prices and many energy stocks.

Preliminary data showed those moves carrying in weak trade.The gains took back the losses from Thursday, triggered by a disappointing monetary policy decision from the European Central Bank.For the week, the results left the Nasdaq up 0.3%, while the S&P 500 was a fraction higher and back above its 200-day moving average.Before the open, the Labor Department's payroll report showed a bigger-than-expected jump in November payrolls, backing views that the economy is on an even and mending keel, appearing to clear the path for a Fed rate hike at the Dec. 15-16 meeting.The Dow ended Friday up 2.1%, unanimously positive. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) topped the index, each with 3% gains.Gold miner Newmont Mining (NEM) led the S&P 500, up more than 9%.

746,HD,"SolarEdge (SEDG) stock rocketed late Wednesday after the Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner reported fiscal Q2 sales and earnings that smashed Wall Street expectations, while guiding to Q3 estimates also well above the consensus model.In after-hours trading, SolarEdge stock lit up more than 12%. Shares rose 2.7%, to 27.43 in the regular session in the stock market today.For its fiscal Q2 ended Dec. 31, SolarEdge reported a record $124.8 million in sales and 44 cents earnings per share ex items, up 70% and 267%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.The consensus of 10 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had predicted $119.5 million and 36 cents, with the former in line with SolarEdge's earlier guidance for $118 million-$121 million. SolarEdge doesn't give EPS guidance.Current-quarter guidance for $121 million-$125 million in sales easily topped analyst views for $117.3 million.

The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average added 1.8% and 1.6%, respectively. Volume in the stock market today was running sharply faster than Wednesday's pace.Among blue chips in the Dow, all but one stock was up. Exxon Mobil (XOM) led the Dow with an almost 4% pop, in volume 85% above average. Home Depot (HD) was the only loser, off 1%.Exxon's 3.9% dividend and its place in the Dividend Aristocrats — a list of stocks that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years — could be attracting value-oriented buyers.Individual growth investors have had to step nimbly in this market. Wiser investors are probably mostly in cash. In the IBD 50, Hawaiian Holdings (HA) leapt 5%, but volume was only average. The airline stock gained 36% last year but is now 22% off its high.West Texas Intermediate crude oil jumped 3% and Brent nearly as much in the afternoon.Market watchers said that an improvement in China's oil imports helped.

761,HD,"New ad formats helped Alphabet (GOOGL) -owned video wing YouTube attract more ad revenue throughout last year, even as YouTube's share of the market is expected to recede as competitors led by Facebook (FB) muscle in to the segment, according to an eMarketer report released Wednesday.U.S. video ad revenue growth for YouTube in the U.S. will fall 6.2% in 2017, eMarketer estimates, and YouTube's share of the video ad market will slip. The decreases reflect growing competition as Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), Yahoo (YHOO), Vimeo and others push further into ad-supported video. YouTube, however, will remain No. 1, with a 17.7% share of the total U.S. video ad revenue pie in 2017, says the report.Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) were the biggest ad spenders on YouTube in 2015, the report said, citing Pixability, the YouTube ad-buying and video-marketing platform that examined how much the National Retail Federation's top-10 U.S. brands spent quarter by quarter on YouTube last year.Wal-Mart upped its spending from $600,000 in Q1 to $2.5 million in Q4, and spent $5.2 million for the year, according to the report. Target shelled out $57,000 in Q1, $1.8 million in Q4 and $2.8 million for the year, the report said.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) also increased its spending during the year, from $12,000 in Q1 to $88,000 in Q4, and a total of $151,000 for the year.In April, YouTube introduced Trueview, a video ad ""buy button"" that lets users buy items by clicking on a banner inside the ad. Trueview has boosted ad spending, says the report.But not every brand boosted their spending on YouTube last year, eMarketer found.Amazon.com (AMZN), Lowe's (LOW), The Home Depot (HD) and CVS (CVS) decreased their spending during the course of 2015. E-commerce king Amazon spent about $1.7 million on digital video advertising on YouTube in Q1, but just $162,000 in Q4, the report said.In U.S. digital advertising, Google's share is expected to dip nearly 5% to 36.6% in 2015, according to estimates from eMarketer. That follows a 3% drop to 38.4% in 2014.

763,HD,"When it comes to holiday wish lists, gift cards remain a top choice among consumers this season. That's music to the ears of prepaid card and payments company Blackhawk Network (HAWK).""Blackhawk is one of the big providers of gift cards and related services,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Investor's Business Daily. ""It helps content providers like retailers that want to sell outside their premises on grocery store shelves.""Blackhawk uses proprietary technology to offer a broad range of prepaid gift, telecom and debit cards, in physical and electronic forms, as well as related prepaid products and payment services. The company supports the management and distribution of these products in a number of different retail, digital and incentive channels.It sells to consumers through its retail distribution network, whether in stores or on websites. Blackhawk also provides services, software and prepaid products to business clients for loyalty, incentive and reward programs, using its own sales force, as well as third-party resellers.23 CountriesBlackhawk's retail distribution partners showcase gift cards on displays that Blackhawk manages. Outside the U.S., Blackhawk distributes to its non-U.S. partners in 23 countries via grocery stores and other retail channels.The company seems to be in the right place at the right time. Gift cards remained the most requested holiday gift by consumers in a November National Retail Federation survey. And a recent poll by Deloitte found redeemable cards are the No. 2 gift that shoppers plan to buy this holiday.Consumers showed just how popular gift cards are over the Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend. Stored Value Solutions reports sales of gift cards in the U.S. were up 4% year over year for the four days of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, double 2014's year-over-year gain of 2%.Blackhawk distributes merchant-branded prepaid, or ""closed-loop,"" cards for companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple's (AAPL) iTunes, Macy's (M), Starbucks (SBUX)and Best Buy (BBY), in addition to other prepaid products like telecom cards, open-loop gift cards that can be redeemed anywhere, and reloadable prepaid debit cards.The company isn't content with that, however. Blackhawk has bulked up with a steady flow of acquisitions, new businesses and expanded distribution. That's helped it gain traction in its traditional space and in the ""incentive"" gift card arena, where customers are rewarded for loyalty.New DivisionMany of the buyouts are part of a new division, Blackhawk Engagement Solutions, that was formed this year.""Our strategy since inception has been to connect great brands to consumers through a productive global network,"" Teri Llach, Blackhawk's chief marketing officer, told IBD. ""Motivating employees via a prepaid card or gift card is a logical expansion going from a retail presence, where we're connecting brands to consumers, to corporate incentives, where we're connecting employers to employees.""The incentives and rewards business has proven to be the fastest-growing segment for Blackhawk and is driving its rapid expansion, says Wedbush's Luria.""Their biggest business, which is closed-loop gift cards, has slowed down to maybe single-digit growth,"" Luria said. ""To generate growth, they've been making acquisitions of these corporate incentives and rewards companies.""Showing In NumbersIt's showing up in the numbers. In the third quarter, Blackhawk's adjusted earnings grew 52% to 35 cents a share. Adjusted revenue jumped 54% to $193.4 million.Its incentives and rewards segment's adjusted operating revenues soared 392% from a year earlier, primarily due to the acquisition of Parago and the purchase of Achievers, Chief Executive Bill Tauscher said in a recent press release. Meanwhile, its U.S. retail segment grew adjusted operating revenue 21% in the third quarter. The international retail segment posted adjusted operating revenue growth of 27%.Luria says the corporate incentives and rewards business is more of a year-round concern, while the company's core gift card segment is seasonal, with all of its business generated in the fourth quarter around the holidays. Luria expects the company to continue to make acquisitions since its core business is slowing down.Latest PurchaseBlackhawk's latest buy came last month with the purchase of Didix Gifting & Promotions.Based in the Netherlands, Didix issues and markets leisure-themed gifts and promotions using a prepaid card that can be redeemed for services at multiple leisure outlets, including regional retailers, restaurants, cinemas and spas. It develops gifting and promotional products and brands across the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium.Blackhawk's Llach says all of the company's acquisitions have been a ""significant driver of Blackhawk's earnings growth.""""We are in 23 countries, and we are looking at smart ways to expand where we see a market (opportunity),"" Llach said.Safeway SpinoffBlackhawk was spun off from privately held grocery giant Safeway in 2014. Safeway and other grocers such as Kroger (KR) are distribution partners.Other partners include Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Staples (SPLS) as well as online giants Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Blackhawk's full-year 2015 earnings to rise 31% to $2.31 a share. They see a 14% gain in 2016 and an 11% increase in 2017.""As long as they continue to make acquisitions, they will grow (at a rapid) rate,"" said Luria. ""At some point it will be harder to do. If they run out of balance-sheet ability (because of too much debt), it will be harder for them to borrow more money to make acquisitions.""Blackhawk is part of IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group. It leads the group with a 99 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

During CES it lifted 5% Wednesday and 4% Thursday on deals with General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) to do with smart mapping, and with the U.S. DOT for a Smart Cities project. But Mobileye dropped about 8% for the week, though not as much as its auto supplier industry group or the worse-off auto manufacturers group.Video streamer Netflix (NFLX) rose 3.2% today. It jumped more than 9% last Wednesday, on the day its CEO keynoted at CES. That day the company launched Netflix Global, bringing its Internet TV network to more than 130 new countries.Sony (SNE) got a 3% pop last Tuesday then gapped down, off almost 7% for the week, while the S&P 500 dropped about 6%. Sony stock rebounded by 1.6% today. At CES the company showed off Ultra HD 4K TVs and other products, from a Bluetooth lightbulb to a USB-ready turntable.Fitness watch maker Fitbit (FIT) dropped 27% last week and plummeted 12.4% today to 18.85. The $200 Fitbit Blaze watch that it introduced at CES disappointed, with Baird analyst William Power suspecting that investors are concerned about competition from Apple (AAPL), while Under Armour (UA) and Fossil (FOSL) debuted fitness bands in the increasingly crowded fitness technology space. Fossil lifted 2.5% today, while Under Armour dropped 6.7% on a big Morgan Stanley price-target cutNot officially at CES, the biggest tech stock — Apple — fell about 8% for the week, during that wider stock market rout, amid worries about subdued iPhone sales. Apple stock lifted 1.6% today.Follow Donna Howell on Twitter @IBD_DHowell.RELATED: CES 2016: Car news electrifies, connects, drives show.

""Specifically, government sales data for CE/appliances has continued to weaken on both a one- and two-year basis, and the last time we saw multiple months of negative CE retail sales growth (before this current streak) was late 2013/early 2014, when Best Buy missed its holiday sales plan.""Even Costco (COST) couldn't buck the recent trend as its October consumer electronics sales turned negative, Ciccarelli said. He also noted that major retailers Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) had missed top-line projections recently.""When combined with Best Buy's historical volatility around the holidays (since Q4 accounts for 50%-60% of earnings) and our view that the company needs to post sustained comp improvement for the stock to re-rate higher, we believe a more cautious stance is prudent,"" Ciccarelli said.On the plus side, Best Buy has vastly improved its competitive positioning through price-matching Amazon.com (AMZN) and others, and forming in-store vendor partnerships with technology leaders such as Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, he said. These moves have helped Best Buy gain market share in consumer electronics retail.Best Buy is scheduled to report fiscal third quarter earnings before the market open on Thursday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to earn 35 cents a share, up 3% year over year, on sales of $8.83 billion, down 2%, in the October quarter.For the holiday sales quarter, analysts are modeling for Best Buy to earn $1.45 a share, down 2%, on sales of $13.90 billion, down 2%.Ultrahigh-definition, or 4K, television sets are likely to drive sales in the holiday season and through 2016, Ciccarelli said.

833,HD,"Amazon.com (AMZN) or other companies might counter IAC/InterActiveCorp's (IACI) hostile bid to buy consumer-reviews website Angie's List (ANGI), says Needham & Co.After the close Wednesday, IAC made an unsolicited offer to buy consumer-reviews website Angie's List for more than $500 million in cash, or $8.75 a share. Angie's List stock closed Wednesday's regular session at 7.92 and hasn't traded above 8.75 since October 2014.Angie's List stock was above the offer price Thursday, up 11% at 8.80 in early afternoon trading, after rising as high as 9.12.IAC stock was up a fraction in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 65.50.IAC wants to combine Angie's List with IAC's HomeAdvisor marketplace of home improvement professionals, a combination that would create a powerhouse in the local professional service industry, said Needham analyst Kerry Rice in an industry note Thursday.""We believe IACI's proposed purchase of ANGI makes strategic sense,"" said Rice. ""The scale of the two companies would enable the combined platform to operate much more profitably given the ability to remove redundant operating costs and leverage IAC's marketing prowess.""Rice, however, said ""we believe Angie's List may hold out for a higher purchase price, given that the deal is still a proposal"" that represents only a 10% premium to Wednesday's closing price.Rice said that ""while we are not expecting another bidder to come over the top of IAC, we think that the most likely other bidders that could potentially have an interest are Amazon.com, Groupon (GRPN), large home improvement retailers such as Home Depot (HD) or Lowes (LOW), or an international Internet company such as Rakuten (RKUNY).""IAC owns a number of media and Internet businesses, including search site About.com.IAC has indicated a willingness to consider a stock-for-stock transaction potentially giving existing Angie's List shareholders opportunity to enjoy the upside potential of the combined business, Rice says.If the deal goes through, said Rice, IAC gets ""a company with a solid membership and service provider base and brand"" with slightly higher profit margins than HomeAdvisor.Angie's List's Q3 revenue rose 7% year over year and its penny per-share profit marked its first profitable quarter in nearly three years, as memberships increased 9% year over year to 3.25 million.""Angie's has paying service providers of nearly 54,000 and a growing e-commerce offering,"" said Rice, who added that any ""revenue reacceleration is likely to take several quarters.""Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook .

It accelerated the move to chip-embedded cards in the U.S., which had lagged behind foreign money-card innovation.
"
875,HD,"Target wasn't the only big victim. Home Depot (HD), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Michaels (MIK), Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) Dairy Queen and others also have been badly compromised in the last two years.
"
876,HD,"Fighting cybercrime has become an endless war as hackers grow more sophisticated, but Wednesday is the last day of blame-sharing. Beginning Thursday, Oct. 1, more liability for money card fraud shifts to merchants and retailers if they don't use the tech to handle the new chip cards from Visa or its rivals.

How has the stock fared on a weekly closing basis? And do you see a potential new base forming?You want more tools. These can help. Check the RS Rating. This tool should apply to an income stock just as it does a high-adrenaline growth play.If your dividend stock has a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, it means your stock is in the top fifth of the U.S. market in terms of 12-month relative performance. Knowing that may help you keep the conviction necessary to hold on.In IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, a quarter of the 59 names show an RS Rating of 80 or higher. They include Hasbro (HAS) (93 RS), ConAgra Foods (CAG) (91 RS), Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) (90), Home Depot (HD) (87), Altria (MO) (84) and CME (CME) (80).It's also worthwhile comparing a stock's RS Rating with those of its industry peers. IBD Stock Checkup does that instantly for you. Home Depot ranks fourth among 18 stocks in the Retail/Wholesale-Building Products industry group. That's a strong showing. Analyze the moving averages. If your stock's 10-week and 40-week moving averages are rising, that's positive. It means the mid- and long-term price trends are up.Last week, many stocks punctured one or both support lines. Hasbro fell below the 40-week line briefly. But Coca-Cola Enterprises bounced off its 10-week average, revealing exceptional strength. As weeks pass, see if Hasbro can reclaim its 10-week line. A prolonged stay below this line signals weakness. Uptrend or downtrend? This is best checked on a weekly chart. Do you see a pattern of higher highs and higher lows over at least several months? CME has done so since April 2014 despite last week's brief plunge.

After the price hike was disclosed on the company's website, Netflix stock rallied, rising more than 6% in the stock market today to near 115 and finding support above its 50-day line.The streaming video service quietly revealed Thursday that it will increase the monthly fee for its standard subscription service by $1 to $9.99 for all new subscribers in the U.S., Canada and Latin America effective Nov. 8. Existing customers will have a grace period before their monthly rate goes up. Netflix boosted the price of its service in Europe by one euro in August.Wall Street analysts have long maintained that a price increase would be a good move for Netflix to bolster its finances as it invests in original content and international expansion.The $9.99-a-month plan offers unlimited high-definition streaming video to two screens at once. Netflix did not change the price of its two other streaming plans: $7.99 for standard-definition video on one screen at a time and $11.99 for up to four simultaneous streams of HD video and ultra HD video when available.Netflix's new standard plan is less than what HBO Now ($14.99) and Showtime ($10.99) charge for their Internet streaming video services. Hulu charges $7.99 for streaming with ads and $11.99 for ad-free streaming.Netflix is scheduled to report Q3 earnings after the market close Wednesday.RELATED:Netflix subscriber growth under microscope for Q3.

980,HD,"Santa Clara, Calif.-based Palo Alto Networks is one of the fastest growing of all the cybermilitia forces and claims to be the fastest growing in next-generation network firewall security.
"
981,HD,"It launched its first next-generation network firewall security product in 2007 and has since expanded to encompass advanced threats, endpoints and the cloud. Meanwhile, it keeps enhancing existing products and rolling out new ones.
"
982,HD,"Palo Alto competes with established names in network security such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Check Point Software (CHKP), Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Fortinet (FTNT).
"
983,HD,"Disrupting The Legacy Players
"
984,HD,"""We were a disruptive company,"" said Palo Alto Chief Marketing Officer Rene Bonvanie in an interview with IBD. Legacy players ""did not understand apps, new mobile devices and the cloud. So they couldn't make it safe (everywhere). Our technology makes the use of applications safe no matter where they live.""
"
985,HD,"Palo Alto's next-generation firewall platform is still core to the company's mission: to make it safe for people working in private or public enterprises to use any application from any kind of device.
"
986,HD,"The company has more than 26,000 customers worldwide and says that it's added at least 1,000 new ones every quarter for the last 15 quarters. It sells to private enterprises, governments and service providers.
"
987,HD,"In the last quarter, the U.S. government comprised 13% of its business, spread across civilian, intelligence and defense sectors. More than 10% came from service providers, with the rest largely enterprise accounts.
"
988,HD,"The problem with traditional firewall products was that they became obsolete over time as hackers found ways around them, Ho says.
"
989,HD,"Next-generation firewall solutions have more and better defenses, including analytics, intrusion prevention and anti-malware to thwart ""lots of different bad things that affect your computer,"" he said.
"
990,HD,"Legacy players are adapting, but it takes longer for big companies to change course than small ones. Meanwhile, Palo Alto is ""rapidly catching up"" to the leaders in network security, Cisco and Check Point, Bonvanie says.
"
991,HD,"""We are now the third-largest player in the enterprise security market after Cisco and Check Point,"" he said, adding that his firm's share is around 9%.
"
992,HD,"Palo Alto has been growing revenue more than 50% on average the last two years. In its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in July, revenue jumped 59% to $283.9 million, billings 69% to $393.6 million — both well above analysts' estimates.
"
993,HD,"Excluding items, it earned 28 cents per share in Q4, 3 cents above views, up from 11 cents last year.
"
994,HD,"Revenue is expected to slow some from a robust 50%-plus rate, but it's still seen growing in strong double-digit percentages. Palo Alto expects revenue to increase 46%- 48% in the current Q1, ending in October, to $280 million-$284 million. Analysts expect revenue for full fiscal 2016, ending next July, to increase 39% to $1.29 billion.

"
1001,HD,"Based on a recently published Nomura survey of 30 security professionals asked about their buying plans for this year and next, Palo Alto and rival FireEye (FEYE) could be expected to gain the most in spending dollars.
"
1002,HD,"The survey indicated that the No. 1 priority for security spending this year is for advanced persistent threat protection, which plays into Palo Alto's WildFire product. WildFire's customer base increased 140% by the fourth quarter vs. a year ago to more than 7,000.
"
1003,HD,"Endpoint protection — whether for a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, cash register, ATM or other computerized hardware — was the second priority. Target, for example, was attacked at the endpoint — through its cash registers.

"
1007,HD,"Endpoint security ""has become the Wild West of security,"" attracting startups with ""exotic technology,"" said Palo Alto's Bonvanie. ""Everybody has figured out that the original products are not very useful.""
"
1008,HD,"Palo Alto's large installed base of customers using its firewall products ""gives us a competitive advantage over the smaller guys"" in endpoint security, he said.
"
1009,HD,"Other endpoint security players include privately held Bit9 + Carbon Black, Invincea and Bromium.
"
1010,HD,"Symantec (SYMC) and McAfee dominate endpoint security. Nomura's survey of security professionals was ""generally negative"" for Symantec, Grieb noted in the survey report, ""with customer perception of the company and its road map continuing to deteriorate over the past 12 months.""

"
1030,HD,"Samsung had the phone-tablet market largely to itself for three years until last September, when Apple responded with the iPhone 6 Plus. Samsung's newest phablets feature 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED displays, compared with the 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD screen on Apple's iPhone 6 Plus.

1084,HD,"Following Cree's (CREE) announcement Thursday that it is voluntarily recalling its tube-shaped T8 fluorescent lamps, one analyst questions whether consumers will shy away from purchasing the LED lights.The North Carolina-based lighting manufacturer said the problem with the T8 LEDs stems from electrical resistance between a spring contact and the printed circuit board. The resistance can lead to electrical arcing, which can cause the light to overheat and melt, posing fire and burn hazards.The T8 LEDs are sold through distributors to commercial lighting customers, and exclusively at Home Depot (HD) for residential usage. Owners of those bulbs should disconnect them and contact Cree for a free replacement or a refund.Cree said its LED light is designed to replace fluorescent bulbs in common commercial and office fixtures. The company estimates the recall affects roughly 700,000 lights in the U.S. and 11,500 in Canada.It might well be just a one-time recall, but its impact could be more far-reaching, Summit Research Partners analyst Srini Sundararajan said in a research report Friday.""This might make consumers who need to be convinced to use LED-based lamps a little bit gun shy in making the change from traditional lamps,"" Sundararajan said. ""However, with good crisis management on the part of the company, any long-term impact can be minimized.""The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission website has posted a recall notice on the LED T8 fluorescent tubes.Cree provides contact information about the recall on its website .Cree stock was down 1% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 30.""We believe that these may have retailed for $22, which means that the impact of the recall and refund is likely to be around $15 million, only if strictly evaluated in terms of monetary impact,"" said Sundararajan, who reiterated his price target of 25 and hold rating on Cree stock.Cree announced last month that it will spin off its Power and Radio-Frequency Products subsidiary in an initial public offering. Cree said it submitted a draft registration statement to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO but didn't disclose how much it plans to raise from the IPO or how many shares it will sell or the price.Cree said that IPO would allow the company to focus on its LED and lighting businesses. The Power and RF division is Cree's smallest business unit. According to the SEC filing, Frank Plastina, a Cree board member, will be the interim executive vice president of the division, effective Monday, and will serve as CEO of the company after the IPO.RELATED:Acuity Brands Brightens With Commercial LED Light Use.

1085,HD,"Good news for GoPro (GPRO): The action camera market is likely to see growth in unit sales and revenue through at least 2019, according to Futuresource Consulting.The worldwide action camera market grew 44% in 2014, reaching 7.6 million units, with a retail value of $3.2 billion, Futuresource said in a report Friday.Unit sales rose 38% in North America last year, but the biggest growth was in the Asia Pacific region, up 114%.While the action camera market will see continued growth for at least the next five years, a number of factors, including lengthening replacement cycles, will cause growth to slow, Futuresource said.Consumer sales, mainly for extreme sports, have accounted for the vast majority of worldwide demand to date, but professional sales are set to accelerate, driven by TV production, law enforcement and security.Consumers represented 86% of action camera sales last year, with the rest coming from professional uses.GoPro dominates the action camera market today, but is seeing competition from the likes of Garmin (GRMN), Polaroid and Sony (SNE). Other companies such as Taser (TASR) and Digital Ally (DGLY) are targeting the adjacent market of wearable cameras for police and security officers.Another key trend is price polarization, with growing sales of low-end models costing less than $200 and high-end models such GoPro's $499 Hero 4 Black.""The action camera market has undergone a great deal of development over recent months,"" Futuresource analyst Arun Gill said. ""In particular, with 360-degree capture now available, we will see virtual reality applications emerge over the coming months, especially for sports broadcasting.""Futuresource sees the percentage of action cameras that can take 360-degree video growing from 1% this year to 14% by 2019.Last year, 95% of action cameras sold took high-definition video in at least 720p resolution. About 85% of action cameras shot HD video in 1080p. And half of cameras sold were capable of recording ultra high-definition, or 4K, video.RELATED:GoPro stock dives as company debuts waterproof camera.

Comparable-store sales are now seen up 4.1%-4.9% vs. previous guidance for 4%-4.6% growth.Shares climbed 2.6% to 122.80, hitting a new high, helped by a buyback authorization for an additional $3.9 billion in shares over the rest of the year, for a total of $7 billion for 2015. Rival Lowe's (LOW), which will report Q2 earnings early Wednesday, gained 0.7% Tuesday.Shares of homebuilders Lennar (LEN), D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Bros. (TOL) also rallied to multiyear highs.Prices, Households ReboundHome Depot's more upbeat guidance comes as a fresh batch of housing data point to an increasingly healthier market. Housing starts rose 10.1% vs. a year earlier to an annual rate of 1.21 million units, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, hitting the highest level since October 2007.Last month, the National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing homes in June reached the fastest pace in eight years, with the median price climbing 6.5% year over year to a record high of $236,400, above the prior peak set in July 2006.""Home prices continue to appreciate and household formation is slightly ahead of our prior plans,"" Home Depot CFO Carol Tome said in a conference call.After adjusting for data-breach expenses and the sale of its HD Supply (HDS) stake, Home Depot's Q2 earnings rose 12.5% to $1.71 per share, in line with consensus. Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 2 rose 4.3% to $24.8 billion, above views for $24.7 billion.Same-store sales increased 4.2% systemwide and 5.7% at U.S. stores.""We had a record number of transactions and the highest quarterly ticket going back to 2006,"" said CEO Craig Menear in the conference call.Interline Seen Adding BoostThough outdoor categories were pressured by weather issues in some parts of the U.S., Home Depot saw strength in maintenance and repair items, decorative lines, and professional products such as power tools and siding, among others.Meanwhile, Home Depot's pending acquisition of Interline Brands for $1.6 billion is expected to close in the third quarter. The deal will expand Home Depot's reach to professionals who repair and maintain multifamily, institutional and hospitality buildings, a change from the company's focus on products for the home.""Interline Brands can tap into an incremental consumer base that the company hadn't penetrated heavily in the past,"" said Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz. ""It's much more of a commercial business.""

1311,HD,"Now that its $650 million merger with cabinet manufacturer Norcraft is a done deal, Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) is looking for new acquisitions to build out its house of home products.It's big in cabinets, doors, faucets and security locks and safes.What's next on the company's to-do list?""We completed all the cabinet acquisitions we need; we're very well positioned there,"" Chief Financial Officer Lee Wyatt told IBD.Fortune Brands sells more than a dozen cabinet brands for kitchens and baths to thousands of small dealers as well as home center chains such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW). But its top faucet in North America, Moen, could use some company, Wyatt says.""The top 10% (in faucets) is luxury, the bottom 15% is private label. And 75% is everything in the middle, where Moen plays,"" he said.If Fortune Brands were, for instance, to add luxury faucets to its lineup, it could leverage its U.S. distribution channel and add a new brand to more than 1,000 of its Moen stores in China.""We're in talks with many potential targets,"" Wyatt said. ""Hopefully plumbing will be our next acquisition.""Fortune Brands is a lot of things, but one common theme is its acquisitive streak.A $1.1 Billion Spending SpreeSince it spun off from its consumer-brands namesake in 2011, leaving the Jim Beam liquor business with its former parent, now known as Beam Suntory, Fortune has spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions. It also spent $500 million on share buybacks and $200 million on dividends over that time.Robert Wetenhall, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, calls Fortune Brands a ""best in class"" home-products company, with brands that have leading market positions in all its four major categories: cabinets, plumbing, doors and personal security products.Beside Moen, it enjoys the leading share with MasterBrand cabinets, Therma-Tru entry doors and Master Lock padlocks.Moen has a 30% share of the faucet market in the U.S., followed by Masco (MAS), the maker of Delta faucets, with a share in the low 20% area, Wyatt says. Kohler is No. 3. In the more fragmented cabinet market, Fortune has a 20%-25% share, with Masco No. 2 and American Woodmark (AMWD) No. 3, Wyatt says.""In the cabinet industry, more than 50% of the market share comes from small local manufacturers,"" he said. ""We have multiple trade brands in cabinets, but brands are not as important as they are in plumbing. Many consumers don't recognize the (cabinet) brands.""Our real customer in the cabinet space is the kitchen designer who works in a dealer or home center,"" he continued. ""We don't advertise the brands as such. Roughly 6,000 small kitchen and bath dealers drive over 50% of the demand for cabinets. Home centers are the next biggest, about one-third of industry demand.""On the other hand, faucets and security products are marketed and advertised directly to consumers.Windows Out, Doors InFortune Brands said one reason it sold Simonton Windows last September was to focus ""more sharply"" on its Therma-Tru entry doors.Fortune Brands is well positioned to ride the ongoing recovery in new-home construction and home repairs and remodeling. Most of its business is in the U.S., but it also sells products in Canada, China (chiefly with Moen) and Europe (mainly with Master Lock).Residential building in China has slowed, but Wyatt says Moen stores have ""stayed strong"" as units in newly developed multifamily complexes are sold. Units aren't usually finished with plumbing fixtures.""As they sell out units, buyers come to our (Moen) stores. They could be coming to us for several years as units are sold.""In the U.S., Fortune Brands expects the U.S. housing market to return to a typical ""steady"" pace of 1.5 million home starts annually by 2018, including single- and multifamily units. That would be up from just 600,000 in 2011 and about 1.1 million this year.But an even bigger part of the market that Fortune Brands sells into is repair and remodeling, which accounts for about two-thirds of revenue. The company sees that market, which had been lagging in recent years, growing by 5% this year and then moving to a normal rate of 5% to 6% annual growth.""We've got a little more room to grow (in repair and remodeling),"" Wyatt said.Management expects U.S. home-product sales overall to see faster growth in the second half of the year than the first half, for full-year growth of 6% to 8%. But they expect the company to outperform the overall market. With Norcraft factored in, the company now sees 2015 net sales growth of 13% to 15%.In its Q2 report on July 22, Fortune Brands raised full-year earnings guidance on the low end, to $2.03-$2.10 from $2-$2.10 previously, including an expected 4-5 cents from Norcraft. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast earnings of $2.06, for an 18% year-over-year gain, and 22% next year. Revenue this year is seen by analysts rising 15% to $4.6 billion.Norcraft Spikes SalesThomson Reuters noted Q2 earnings of 59 cents beat consensus by 2 cents. The company reported second-quarter revenue up 13% to $1.17 billion. Cabinet sales jumped 18% to $550.9 million. Excluding the impact from Norcraft, which closed May 12, sales grew 8%.Norcraft increased Fortune Brand's presence in the dealer channel where, as analyst Kenneth Zener of KeyBanc Capital Markets noted, there is ""higher-end buyer demand.""Plumbing sales rose less, 5% to $358 million, but those products come with higher margins than cabinets.Growth in door sales slowed from a year-ago, but margin on earnings before interest and taxes improved to 12.9% from 8.8% last year.Security sales jumped 28% to $138.6 million, driven by the acquisition of Sentry Safe last year.Top Ratings Among MidcapsDespite Fortune Brands' share-price gains since its Q2 report, RBC Capital Markets says the company ""remains our best idea"" for midcap investors who combine tenets of growth and value investing.Barclays is ""overweight"" on the name due mainly to ""a strong management team and a portfolio of industry leading brands."" KeyBanc Capital is also ""overweight."" JPMorgan is neutral.Fortune Brands is highly scored by IBD, with a Composite Rating of 96 out of a best-possible 99. Masco, which broke out on July 28 after a strong earnings report, has a Composite Rating of 96.Acuity Brands (AYI), a lighting supplier, has a 99 rating. IBD's Building-Construction Products group is ranked No. 8 out of 197 industry groups tracked.

1312,HD,"The housing market is back. A closely watched sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) hit a high not seen since the heady days of the housing bubble.Homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and LGI Homes (LGIH) hit new highs, as did home improvement giant Home Depot (HD).The NAHB index rose 1 point in August to 61. Two subindexes, measuring current sales conditions and the next 6 months, were relatively unchanged at high levels: 66 and 70, respectively.The traffic index rose by 2 points. At 45, it's still below the neutral 50 mark — but traffic has been above that mark only briefly, and that was just before the bubble burst.If homebuilders are bullish, it's probably a signal that housing is in good shape. It could also be a good sign for the rest of the economy, since a humming housing market propels so much other activity, especially hiring.Horton shares rose 2% to a 9-year high Monday. LGI fell lightly after making an all-time high; Lennar (LEN) rose 3% and PulteGroup (PHM) 1%.Meanwhile, in the mobile software industry, GrubHub (GRUB) is facing pressure in online food delivery from rivals led by ride-summoning service Uber, which recently began highlighting its big push into food delivery with a new look on its app.Uber had buried the UberEats app at the bottom of its site. But starting last week, UberEats has appeared prominently next to Uber's car-summoning icon. It's the latest salvo in the app-based food delivery service wars, wrote Cowen & Co. analyst Kevin Kopelman in a research report on Monday.""We view this as a subtle but significant change recognizing food delivery as Uber's second major category ahead of a broader rollout,"" wrote Kopelman.Uber is hiring for its UberEats on-demand meal-delivery service in at least nine U.S. cities and could operate in as many as 15 cities in coming months, Kopelman says.""UberEATS remains small today in both geographic scope, food options and user adoption. However, Uber's recent moves signal some traction in markets where UberEATS has rolled out and point to aggressive expansion of food delivery as a core Uber service,"" Kopelman said.Uber is pioneering the ""ultrafast"" food category, offering a limited selection of prepared foods in thermal bags that couriers deliver within 10 minutes for a flat all-in delivery fee of $3 to $4.Competition from Uber and other companies that deliver food — which include Google (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — is pressuring GrubHub's order growth, which slowed to a 25% year-over-year gain in Q2 2015 from 33% in Q4 2014, wrote Kopelman. ""We note that new competitors, most notably Postmates, Yelp (YELP)-owned Eat24, DoorDash, Munchery, Caviar and UberEATS, are on track to capture 50% of U.S. industry growth in fiscal 2015 vs. 25% in 2014, and (excluding Uber) have raised $500 million year to date,"" Kopelman wrote.

Baker projects spending growth will probably get to the long-term trend of 5% until there's another downturn.Home-Price Gains Are PivotalThe single most important trend driving the Joint Center's forecast is recovering home prices, he says.""Seeing home prices recover is crucial to consumers having the confidence to undertake a remodeling,"" he said.Another driver, he adds, is the fact that homeowners who had deferred some projects during the downturn from 2008 to 2011 are now ""attacking the list of projects they put off.""Such projects include bath and kitchen remodels and room additions. Baker says these types of projects have seen the ""strongest recovery"" from the downturn and should continue to do so as the market continues to grow.The Joint Center's key metric for tracking the growth of improvement spending specifically on owner-occupied properties is the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA).The LIRA provides a short-term outlook of national homeowner improvement spending, estimating the annual rate of change in spending for the current quarter and prior three quarters. In Q3 that four-quarter moving total is forecast to reach $151.1 billion.The LIRA projects annual home-improvement spending growth of 2.8% in 2015 accelerating to 4% by the first quarter of 2016, says Joint Center research analyst Abbe Will.""Major drivers of this anticipated growth are the recent pick-up in home sales activity, sustained growth in retail sales of home improvement products and ongoing gains in house prices across much of the country,"" Will said.The biggest ""trigger"" for remodeling spending, says Baker, is the sale of a home, particularly an older one.Ken Fears, director of housing, finance and regional economics for the NAR, says there's a ""strong correlation"" between home sales and remodeling.""With an increase in home sales volumes, you're likely to see an increase in remodeling because people will have a source of funds from the sale to tap into to do the remodeling,"" he said.He expects remodeling trends to ""track the general trend"" for existing home sales.The NAR forecasts existing home sales will rise 6.6% this year, followed by a 4.1% gain in 2016.A Different ViewThe National Association of Home Builders calculates remodeling spending differently from how the Joint Center does it.NAHB senior economist Michael Neal says residential remodeling spending on owner-occupied properties fell by 24.3% from a year earlier in 2014 after it was hurt by harsh weather in the year's first half and kept falling in the second half.""However, because of the severity of the fall, the level of private residential improvement spending in 2015 will be below its level in 2014, by about 12%,"" Neal told IBD.""But beginning with the fourth quarter of 2015, private residential improvements spending will exceed its year-ago level, and year-over-year growth will continue into 2016 and 2017, by 13.2% and 3.1% respectively.""Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith says he expects to see a ""continued uptick"" in spending on larger-ticker home remodel projects such as kitchen and bath remodels.""I think we will see very strong same-store sales growth from the home improvement retailers,"" he told IBD.Keith notes that comments from both Home Depot and Lowe's Cos. (LOW) management indicate that sales volumes in certain categories such as lumber and concrete ""that are often utilized in larger-ticket projects are still well off their total previous highs in 2006 or 2007.""Large Projects Get UnderwayMorningstar analyst James Krapfel, who covers companies such as Masco and Mohawk, concurs that the mix of remodel and repair spending has ""shifted to more expensive projects, like full kitchen remodels, that tend to carry higher margins for the companies.""Daren Blomquist, vice president at property data tracker RealtyTrac, says due to rising home prices more people have equity in their homes than in the past. RealtyTrac research shows that people who have a mortgage and are ""equity rich,"" with at least 50% equity in their homes, have grown to 10.9 million this year, or about 20% of all homeowners with a mortgage, up from 9.9 million last year.""That puts more people in a good position to take out a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) and use (the funds) to remodel their homes,"" he told IBD. ""In the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015, we saw a jump in HELOCs as more people regained their equity and felt comfortable enough to leverage that equity.""Current low interest rates may well prompt homeowners to take out some form of financing sooner rather than later, says Andres Carbacho-Burgos, associate director at Moody's Analytics.""Interest rates are so low now on whichever form of financing you look at, people may think if they're going to improve their homes and have to borrow to do so for large projects, now is the time,"" he said. ""They may think 'if I wait two to three years to borrow to pay for this I may have to pay higher rates.'""

1442,HD,"Redbox parent Outerwall (OUTR) got a big boost in the first quarter from cost controls and higher movie rental prices at its kiosks. The Bellevue, Wash.-based company smashed Wall Street's expectations late Thursday with its March-quarter results. Outerwall earned $2.87 a share excluding items, up 126% year over year, on sales of $609 million, up 1.4%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Outerwall to earn $1.64 a share on sales of $593 million.""Outerwall's strong performance this quarter was the result of continued execution of our strategy of optimizing our core Redbox and Coinstar businesses, scaling ecoATM and improving operational efficiencies across the company,"" interim CEO Nora Denzel said in a statement.Outerwall stock jumped more than 12% in early trading Friday to a three-month high of 74.58, but in midday trading on the stock market today it was up 10%, near 74.Redbox rentals declineIn Q1, Outerwall's Redbox movie disc rental business accounted for 85% of company sales. The unit brought in $519.5 million, up 1.3%. Executives attributed the gain to price increases implemented in December.Redbox generated 173 million rentals in the first quarter, compared with 199 million rentals in the same quarter of 2014.Rentals were hurt by a weaker slate of movies, lower demand from price-sensitive customers and ongoing secular decline in the physical rental market, executives said. Top-performing movies last quarter included ""Fury"" and ""The Equalizer.""Net revenue per rental was $3, an increase of 42 cents, or 16.3%, from Q1 2014.Outerwall's Coinstar coin-redemption kiosks accounted for 11% of the company's revenue. Coinstar brought in $69 million, up 0.8%.Outerwall's ecoATM, which operates kiosks that purchase used smartphones and tablets, contributed $19.7 million in revenue, or 3% of total sales in Q1.Outerwall installed about 250 ecoATM kiosks during the quarter, bringing its total to 2,140 kiosks.The ecoATM business was negatively impacted last quarter by alternative device recycling options such as wireless carrier promotions, Outerwall said.For the full year, Outerwall expects to earn $7.99 a share from continuing operations on sales of $2.36 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance.It expects to reduce its Redbox kiosk count by 1,000 to 1,900 units and its Coinstar kiosk count by up to 100 units. Outerwall expects to add 600 to 1,000 ecoATM kiosks this year.Outerwall closed 1,720 underperforming Redbox kiosks in the March quarter, leaving it with 41,960 kiosks. It closed 120 Coinstar kiosks last quarter, giving it a total of 21,220 kiosks.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his outperform rating on Outerwall stock and raised his 12-month price target to 92 from 82.""Management appears committed to cost control, and we think that continued cost discipline may allow the company to report upside to the high end of its guidance for the year,"" he said in a report Friday.Low-cost movie rental optionOuterwall's core DVD and Blu-ray Disc rental business is declining as consumers shift to video-on-demand alternatives from cable companies and Internet services, Pachter said. But Redbox has the low-cost alternative.""The dramatic price differential between the average VOD ($4.99 for standard definition and $5.99 for HD, compared with $1.50/$2.00 per day, respectively, for Redbox rentals) all but guarantees that the price-conscious consumer will remain loyal to Redbox, despite the recent price increases (up from $1.20/$1.50 per day previously),"" Pachter said.But Pachter criticized Outerwall's newest core business, ecoATM.""EcoATM is taking a painfully long time to turn a profit, and appears to have limited potential,"" Pachter said. ""After first promising profitability in 2014 . . . it now appears increasingly unlikely that it will achieve breakeven on its ecoATM business in 2015. Revenue per kiosk appears to be shrinking each quarter, and ecoATM kiosks are operating at significantly lower gross margin than we originally anticipated.""As Outerwall continues to expand its ecoATM footprint, it also continues to add to its cost structure, making profitability even more elusive.""Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson maintained his overweight rating on Outerwall stock and raised his price target to 76 from 75.Redbox should benefit from a better slate of movies being released in the second quarter, Olson said in a research note Friday.""While there is no question that Redbox faces secular headwinds, we continue to believe that Redbox volume declines will prove to be more of a 'slow bleed' than a 'fall off a cliff,'"" Olson said.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves is more pessimistic. He rates Outerwall stock as underweight.""We continue to believe Outerwall is overvalued relative to the cumulative remaining cash flow from the business, but the high short interest, high ownership by non-active managers, and significant current buybacks are likely to sustain the shares for the foreseeable future,"" Hargreaves said.

1466,HD,"Telecom services and TV makers increasingly are offering Netflix (NFLX) service as a promotional tool, providing a boost for the streaming video leader.""As wired and wireless broadband providers fight for share, Netflix's inexpensive ($8 a month) streaming service could become one of the standard promotional tools, like HBO, Showtime and Starz free trials for pay-TV promos,"" UBS Securities analyst Doug Mitchelson said in a research report late Tuesday.Mitchelson reiterated his buy rating on Netflix stock and raised his price target to 143 from 116. Netflix stock, though, was down 1.5% to near 122 in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. Shares hit an all-time high of 129.29 on Aug. 5.T-Mobile (TMUS) recently launched a promotion for its U.S. wireless service that included one free year of Netflix, Mitchelson said. Plus, broadband Internet providers in international markets such as Australia are bundling Netflix service with their offerings, he said.TV makers Samsung and LG Electronics have offered six months to a year of free Netflix ultra HD video service with their UHD smart TVs, he noted.""In the highly competitive market for consumer electronics and communication services, companies have used a wide variety of promotional tools to grab attention and attract new customers, including discounted initial pricing, cash back or gift cards, free tablet computers, and more recently free Netflix subscriptions,"" Mitchelson said. ""A year of Netflix is a $100-$140 promotion depending on the plan in the U.S., and is roughly in line with the value of other promotional offers (e.g., $100-$200 gift cards), suggesting a wireless carrier or triple-play provider should be indifferent toward offering Netflix, at least from a financial perspective.""It makes sense to offer Netflix with broadband Internet service since Netflix is a key facilitator of broadband consumption, he said.As Netflix continues to take up a larger portion of TV viewing time, pay-TV providers might feel compelled to bundle Netflix service with their offerings, Mitchelson said. But since pay-TV services like cable and satellite operators view Netflix as a competitor, that could be challenging, he said.Mitchelson raised his price target on Netflix because he says the company will boost earnings once it completes its global rollout by the end of next year.Netflix shares ""look very expensive near term given international launch losses hampering margins, yet the long-term global streaming opportunity is extraordinary, in our view, and margins should ramp aggressively post-2016,"" he said.RELATED:Netflix gets pair of price target hikes.

"
1497,HD,"We know that you feel bad with your student leaving for college. Giving your loved one a nice tech gift will make everybody feel a bit better about the separation. Here are some ideas:
"
1498,HD," If your student plays guitar, it makes sense that he or she would want to take it to school. But a high-quality guitar can cost hundreds of dollars or more. And a dorm room exposes that valuable item to theft or damage.So consider the $90 California Classic guitar from Blucora (BCOR)-owned Monoprice, a company better known for its low-cost electronics and cables.Our review unit, a Stratocaster-style model, has three pickups, and is nicely finished with smooth frets and a very playable string height. It even comes with a light gig bag for carrying the guitar around.With the right amp settings it sounds really good, and was a pleasure to play. At this price, your student can drag the California Classic to the beach or elsewhere without being afraid it will get damaged, lost or stolen. Unless they are asleep, darkness isn't students' best friend. A good flashlight is a useful and thoughtful back-to-school gift. You don't have to spend as much as the $120 Bayco NightStick NSR-9940XL we tested. But if you do shell out the big bucks, your student will have a rechargeable flashlight that can throw a bright beam of light almost the length of a football field.The tough metal NSR-9940XL also has a separate spotlight (useful if an emergency light is needed), a magnetic base and several power levels, including a strobe that serves as an emergency beacon. Bayco has less expensive (and less bright) models if you think the NSR-9940XL is overkill. Keeping track of chargers and cables for smartphones and tablets is a chore. The STM Cable Wrap provides an attractive roll-up case to store all of these items in a single place. The $25 soft case has a zippered interior pocket for loose items, and is available at select stores and online. If you're sending your student back to school with a new computer, or even a new laptop, a new monitor is great to add to your gift list. It doesn't have to be expensive, but even in a crowded dorm room a large display will be appreciated, especially when your student is staring at the screen for hours.Acer's K242HL bid is reasonably priced at about $140. For that price, your student gets a display with a 24-inch diagonal, 1920 x 1080 (full HD) resolution, and three connection ports: VGA, DVI, and the HDMI port found on most of the current laptops and PCs and even some tablets.The widescreen 16:1 aspect ratio correctly displays most of today's movies and videos, and with the large screen (and setting a larger font size), work on a word processor or spreadsheet document causes less eyestrain. And when your student has finished for the day with his or her studies, the K242HL bid is nice for watching a YouTube video or playing a game. One thing about dorm rooms is certain: There will never be enough electric outlets. A power strip is one solution. A better solution is the $39 Panamax Power360, from Nortek (NTK).The Power360 plugs into a standard AC outlet and provides six surge-protected outlets (three on the front, three more underneath the device) as well as two USB charging ports, one on each side of the extended outlet. An LED indicator on the front shows voltage, protection status and that the AC outlet the device is plugged into is correctly wired. If your student is in an engineering or arts program, there's no better gift than a 3D printer. The Ultimaker 2 Go is somewhat expensive at $1,450, but it's one of the best 3D printers we've tested.The 2 Go is the smallest and least expensive model in the Ultimaker series, with a 4.72 x 4.72 x 4.53 inch build volume, and is designed to use inexpensive biodegradable PLA plastic filament. The printer itself is compact, measuring at about 10 x 10 x 11.5 inches, so it should fit even in a crowded dorm room.We found it very easy to set the printer up, and the display on the front of the printer walked us through the necessary steps.The front panel of the printer has a slot for an SD Card (supplied), which has several test prints on it.Ultimaker also provides a download link to its Cura software, which lets students create their own designs or modify ones that they've found online at sites such as Thingiverse or Youmagine.Cura is easy to use and it's popular even among users of other vendors' 3D printers.The Ultimaker 2 Go uses PLA filament that is available from the vendor or from many sources on the Web, so there's no worrying about proprietary and expensive cartridges.

1499,HD,"Dads, grads and America's 239th birthday weren't enough for June to bloom, as retailers had another so-so month with consumers finding other outlets for pocket change.The numbers indicate that consumers are shifting their spending away from traditional retail shops and in favor of shelling out for technology such as smartphones and tablets by Apple (AAPL), Samsung and other makers, as well as dining, entertainment and car purchases.June same-store sales missed forecasts, coming in down 0.2% from a year ago, after a 0.6% year-over-year gain in May and a 0.9% decline in April, according to a tally of 11 chains by The Retail Economist, a Tucson, Ariz.-based economic forecasting firm. Michael Niemira, chief economist there, had in May forecast that June same-store sales would likely rise in the range of 1% to 2%.June's A WallflowerTypically, June acts as a lull between Mother's Day shopping in May and when back-to-school sales ramp up in late July and early August. ""June is sort of a transitionary month,"" said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, who called the numbers ""lackluster.""Warm weather and a falling unemployment rate haven't been enough to muster consistent growth in the retailers still providing monthly sales statistics.""The long-term impact that the Great Recession has had has definitely tempered spending,"" Perkins told IBD. ""Wage increases have been very small during the recovery. The retailers are still waiting for the consumer to show up.""One of those retailers, Costco (COST), was hurt by the strong dollar and fallen gasoline prices as its overall June showing of a 1% decline missed the consensus of a 0.1% decline. It was Costco's sixth miss during the past seven months.Gasoline prices have rebounded to a degree since last year's 50% collapse in crude oil prices, but they're still below where prices were a year earlier. Excluding gasoline, the Issaquah, Wash.-based warehouse club notched a 6% gain, ahead of views forecasting a 5.2% gain, indicating Costco's underlying domestic business is strong.Gap's (GPS) same-store sales fell a worse-than-expected 1% in June. Analysts had forecast a decline of 0.7%. June sales at its Old Navy unit grew a disappointing 1%, less than the 2.3% consensus. Banana Republic did better than expected, growing sales 1%, vs. the 0.2% decline forecast.

1502,HD,"Special Report: CES 2016 Tech Show NewsLAS VEGAS — People love to pamper their pets with toys, treats — and, now, tech.Exhibitors at the annual CES trade show this week showed off a bunch of tech products for Fido and Fluffy, ranging from pet game consoles to video conferencing systems.Anser Innovation of Burnsville, Minn., showed off PetChatz, a two-way video conferencing system for dogs and cats and their owners. PetChatz is described as a ""greet and treat"" videophone that allows pet owners to interact with their furry loved ones remotely over the Internet.And with the PawCall accessory, a pet can step on a paw-sized button on the floor to initiate a two-way video call with its owner. Stepping on the pad dispenses a treat and sends a text message to the owner that their pet wants to communicate.The wall-mounted PetChatz HD costs $380, and the PawCall accessory costs $100.Lisa Lavin, chief executive of Anser Innovation, said the device is as much for the owner's state of mind as the pets' well-being.""It alleviates separation anxiety and gives pets a little attention during the day,"" Lavin said.A similar product, Petcube, also lets owners see, talk to and play with their pets remotely.""People miss their pets while they're away,"" said Christopher Madeiras, senior vice president of worldwide sales for San Francisco-based Petcube. ""It's a nice break from the day to check in on them.""The $199 Petcube also has a built-in laser pointer for owners to play with their pets.Speaking of games, CleverPet has designed a game console for dogs. The device has blinking lights on paw pads for dogs to press. If the pets successfully follow the pattern, they earn a treat.The $299 device is a memory game that gets more challenging when dogs do well and easier when they can't keep up, said Philip Meier, ""clever product officer"" at San Diego-based CleverPet.But sometimes pets simply will not be confined. For those times when your dog or cat escapes from the yard, Austria-based Tractive, has a solution.Tractive pet wearables have built in GPS and cellular wireless for tracking down your missing pets. The device pairs with a smartphone app.The device costs $129 with a monthly service fee of about $5. A new version of the tracker, Tractive 2, is due out in Q2. It will be smaller and lighter and cost $179.Tractive also sells an activity tracker for pets that costs $99.Many people have no problem lavishing tech products on their pets, said Wolfgang Reisinger, chief financial officer of Tractive.""They're like our own kids,"" he said.

1543,HD,"Arthur Blank earned most of his $2.3 billion fortune as co-founder of Home Depot (HD), notes Forbes. Recently, he signed the Giving Pledge, started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, to deliver much of his money to charity. Also, his Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation has donated $300 million to causes from childhood education to teaching teens leadership skills.After he stepped down as Home Depot's co-chairman in 2001, Blank bought the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons and helped it go from never having two consecutive winning seasons to having five in a row — capped by reaching the 2012 NFC title game.Still, the siren of retailing beckoned. While continuing as head cheerleader of the Falcons, he's now chairman of the privately held PGA Tour Superstore golf chain, with 24 locations and plans to double them in the next four years.""We're using the same philosophy that drove Home Depot's success and revolutionized the home improvement industry,"" Blank, 72, told IBD. ""We want to dominate each market with the variety of products at value prices, incredible services because of the size of our stores, and the ability to attract the best associates to provide a high level of service that keeps the customers coming back because they love the experience.""Blank was born in Queens, N.Y. His father, a pharmacist, started a wholesale business selling to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes. But Dad died of a heart attack when Arthur was 15, so his mother, with no experience, took over the company. Arthur and his brother helped out when they could.Accounted ForBlank attended Babson College near Boston, graduating with a bachelor's degree in accounting in 1963. He took a job with Arthur Young & Co. in New York, where he learned management consulting over the next four years. He was about to be promoted but decided to return to the family business, which his mother sold to retail conglomerate Daylin in 1968.Two years later he became chief financial officer of the Daylin unit Elliott's Drug Stores/Stripe Discount Stores. Rising to president in 1972, he moved to its Griffin, Ga., offices. When Daylin sold the stores in 1974, he accepted an offer that shifted his life into hypergear.The call came from a business associate, Bernie Marcus, to become controller at another division, the Handy Dan home improvement chain. While there, Blank and Marcus dreamed of opening a warehouse-size home improvement outlet that would turn America into a land of do-it-yourselfers. After being fired in a corporate power struggle, they had their chance.Some friends and a banker bought into the vision, taking advantage of J.C. Penney's (JCP) eagerness to lease two failing specialty stores in Atlanta.""We wanted to have stores twice the size, with inventories three times larger and prices 25% lower than customers were used to, with service they had never experienced,"" said Blank. ""We were willing to hire the best people, pay them what they were worth and train them well.""They opened the first Home Depot in June 1979 and opened another location by the end of the year, but lost nearly $1 million on $7 million in sales.By the end of 1980, they had opened a fourth store and made a profit of $856,000, with their first two stores together grossing an unheard-of $25 million annually.""Deep down, we believed in the theme of the movie 'Field of Dreams,' that if we built it, they would come,"" said Blank. ""We were willing to stay the course on our business model, but a lot of people in retail are risk-averse. Even when they later copied many of our practices, they couldn't emulate our culture.""Blank and Marcus wrote in ""Built From Scratch,"" published in 1999, ""Our values are not platitudes that are dead on arrival on a lobby wall plaque."" They included: Empowering associates with an entrepreneurial spirit. Doing whatever it takes to build customer loyalty. Doing the right thing, not just doing things right. Supporting communities.Blank doesn't see a conflict between the last point and maximizing long-term shareholder return.He notes that during his time running Home Depot, it donated $113 million to communities, with associates contributing many hours of personal volunteer time.Meanwhile, HD went public in September 1981 and has rocketed 300,000% in the stock market since.Blank was president and Marcus CEO until 1997. Then Blank took over as chief executive before passing the baton to Robert Nardelli in December 2000.Blank continued as chairman until May 2001, with annual sales reaching $45.7 billion and Home Depot outlets hitting 1,134.The company keeps bulging, with 2,200 locations and 2014 revenue of $84.4 billion.""If you can make an associate think of work less as a job and more as fulfilling an aspiration, feeling they belong to a company that cares about the customers beyond how much access to their wallets we get today, then they'll be happier and feel the company is worthy of their commitment,"" Blank said.Football RushAfter agreeing to buy the Falcons in December 2001, Blank began surveying fans and getting expert opinions on what needed to change. He moved the training camp to a state-of-the-art facility, helped recruit players his coaches wanted, lowered ticket prices, expanded parking, upgraded halftime entertainment, hired new staff and partnered with the city and state to open a new stadium in 2017.The Falcons won their division in 2004, 2010 and 2012, and most games sell out now. When the team faltered in the past two seasons, Blank went through the same process of re-examining everything to find ways to improve. Now he's optimistic about the upcoming season, which for Atlanta kicks off at home against the Philadelphia Eagles on a Monday night, Sept. 14.Before buying the team, Blank recalls, ""I had breakfast with Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots ... and he told me that the emotional highs and lows are more intense than in traditional business. You develop close relationships with the staff, coaches and players so that you feel like you're on the field with them.""Blank is all about sports now. He's bringing a new Major League Soccer franchise to the new stadium in Atlanta and hopes that it'll be the site for a future World Cup.On the golf front, in 2005 he opened the first PGA Tour Superstore — the exclusive partner of the Professional Golfers' Association for retailing outside of golf courses and airports. Three years later, he hired his chief marketing officer from Home Depot and the Falcons, Dick Sullivan, to be CEO of the parent company, Golf & Tennis Pro Shop of Roswell, Ga.In The SwingBlank is high on his venture: ""We have 40,000 to 50,000 square feet in most of our 24 locations, so we can put in more practice hitting bays, bigger putting greens, more state-of-the-art swing simulators and in-house club making and repair facilities.""We have the largest selection of equipment and clothing, and offer more teaching professionals, and expect to grow not just our business, but the industry. While competitors are closing stores, we expect to double in four years.""A former competitor, PGA Tour Superstore Chief Marketing Officer Matt Corey, grasps Blank's way. ""When I was at Golfsmith, we were always afraid that PGA Tour Superstore would open up near one of our stores,"" he said. ""We knew customers loved them because they were the Disney World of golf, with all these unique features. But I was fortunate enough to learn directly from Arthur and Dick while I was at Home Depot, and I knew the real difference was the culture. No one is on commission here, and by doing the right thing for the customer day in and day out, instead of going for the immediate sale, we build really strong long-term customer loyalty.""After a quarter-century working alongside Blank, Dick Sullivan appreciates what makes him an outstanding leader: ""He motivates people to attain goals they never thought they could achieve, listening to associates, suppliers and customers and putting people first. He has an insatiable drive for growth while focusing on real progress to build a brand, the ability to manage the details while being a visionary. It's an awe-inspiring combination I've never seen in anyone else that makes him one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time.""Blank has been married twice, has six children and recently became engaged. He's learned the importance of work-life balance, and his 10,000-acre Mountain Sky Guest Ranch in Emigrant, Mont., is both a business and a place to relax.

"
1553,HD,"What follows are five key takeaways from Netflix's Q2 report.
"
1554,HD,"1. Subscriber growth is critical
"
1555,HD,"Netflix is foregoing short-term profits to rapidly expand its subscriber base. It plans to be in 200 countries worldwide by the end of 2016, vs. more than 50 today.
"
1556,HD,"In Q2, Netflix added a net 3.28 million new streaming subscribers, including 2.37 million in foreign markets and 900,000 in the U.S. The company's forecast at the start of the quarter was for 2.5 million new adds.

1559,HD,"Netflix plans to launch its service in Japan this quarter and in Spain, Portugal and Italy next quarter.
"
1560,HD,"""The barriers to compete with Netflix are growing with each passing quarter as it scales, and Q2 results and Q3 guidance reinforce that view,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne said in a report. ""Netflix's continued investment in content, in distribution, in partner marketing, and in its user interface are paying off in member growth and operating leverage.""
"
1561,HD,"But Netflix's financials will continue to take a hit as it invests in its global rollout.
"
1562,HD,"Earnings per share have fallen on a year-over-year basis for three straight quarters and sales growth has decelerated over the same period.
"
1563,HD,"Dougherty analyst Steven Frankel has a cautious outlook on Netflix given its heavy spending.
"
1564,HD,"""We don't doubt Netflix's ability to keep competition at bay as it cranks up its original content engine and races into new markets,"" Frankel said. ""However, the path to respectable profitability remains hard to determine. Until we have better visibility on that score or see a material pullback in the stock, we are maintaining our neutral rating.""
"
1565,HD,"2. Original content driving subscriber gains
"
1566,HD,"Netflix executives credit the company's original and exclusive content for driving subscriber growth and retention.
"
1567,HD,"Netflix's Q2 outperformance was fueled by the first seasons of original shows ""Marvel's Daredevil,"" ""Sense8,"" ""Dragons: Race to the Edge"" and ""Grace and Frankie,"" as well as season three of ""Orange Is the New Black.""
"
1568,HD,"""We are going to continue to grow our content spend on original programming, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of our total spending, because it's been working,"" Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on a conference call with analysts.

"
1571,HD,"3. Netflix getting more revenue per subscriber
"
1572,HD,"Netflix said its U.S. revenue got a boost from more subscribers moving to higher-priced service tiers such as those offering more simultaneous streams and high-definition video.
"
1573,HD,"U.S. revenue growth was fueled by a 5% year-over-year increase in the average selling price due to the uptake of Netflix's two-stream high-definition plan, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said.
"
1574,HD,"Hastings said the company has no plans to increase its prices, which start at $7.99 a month for a standard-definition one-stream plan.
"
1575,HD,"""It is incredibly affordable, and that's part of what's propelling our growth,"" Hastings said on the conference call. ""We also want to motivate people to be able to move up to the two-stream and the high-def, and also the ultra-high def plan.""

1578,HD,"""Over the next decade, we'll be able to have more and more content and add more value, and then to be able to price that appropriately,"" he said.

"

1583,HD,"""How we do in the first year in a new market is not that determinant of the long term,"" Hastings said. Brazil was ""pretty weak in the first year and now it's a rocket ship,"" he said. Every country is a learning experience, he said.

1601,HD,"The annual CES consumer technology trade show, which officially kicks off on Wednesday in Las Vegas, will see self-driving cars, virtual reality, wearables, drones and hoverboards making headlines.Attendance at CES, originally named the Consumer Electronics Show (and still called that by many), for the first time will be capped, at about 176,000, over its four-day run. It will feature more than 3,600 exhibitors blanketing over 2.4 million net square feet, according to the Consumer Technology Association, which runs the show.CTA pegged last year's attendance at 176,676, with about 3,600 exhibitors using some 2.2 million net square feet. The show's attendance first topped 100,000 in 2000, and exhibition space first topped 1.5 million square feet in 2005. It's by far the largest U.S. tech trade show.This year's show boasts keynote speeches from Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich, General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra and IBM (IBM) CEO Ginni Rometty, among others.Cars Star And China ArrivesAutomakers will have a huge presence at CES 2016, as they tout electric cars, collision-avoidance and other safety systems, connected cars and autonomous vehicles.In addition to GM, Ford Motor (F), Kia Motors, Toyota Motor (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) will be holding events at the show. Also, companies developing technologies for self-driving cars will be presenting at CES, including Bosch, Valeo and Mobileye (MBLY).Plus, intelligent electric-car startup Faraday Future will unveil its first concept car at a pre-show event.Several car companies got a jump on the show with announcements Monday.GM announced a long-term strategic alliance with ride-sharing operator Lyft to create a network of on-demand autonomous vehicles. Lyft rival Uber also is working on self-driving car technology.Car companies also are adding more Internet connectivity and smart entertainment systems to future vehicles.Ford said Monday it will add Apple (AAPL) CarPlay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Android Auto, along with 4G LTE connectivity, to millions of new vehicles.Toyota said it is accelerating its connected car technology initiatives, including building a Toyota Big Data Center. Toyota also entered a pact with Ford and Livio to start an industry framework using Livio's SmartDeviceLink as the open-source platform for smartphone apps and car connectivity.CES 2016 will see a changing of the guard as Chinese consumer electronics firms rise in stature and once-prominent Japanese companies fade.CTA lists more than 1,200 exhibitors from China, with Changhong, Haier, Hisense, Huawei, TCL and ZTE among the largest. In fact, a third of the exhibitors at this year's show are China-based.Meanwhile, Japanese electronics firms like Panasonic and Sony (SNE) have shrunk their presence at the show, and Sharp and Toshiba are no long exhibiting in the central hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center.""Make no mistake — the Chinese have arrived,"" Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin said in a pre-CES blog post. ""They plan to disrupt the traditional CE players as much as possible and take market share away from them fast.""Wearables And DronesLast year's breakout stars at CES were wearables and drones. Both of those categories will have a larger presence this year.Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News, said she is ""blown away"" by the number of companies showing wearable devices at the show. These gadgets are moving away from simple fitness apps like tracking heart rate and steps taken to measuring everything from body aches to the wearer's emotional state.The wearables market leader, Fitbit (FIT), is expected to unveil several new fitness bands with new sensors for measuring such things as skin temperature and heart rate variability. Fitbit also might take on Garmin (GRMN) with a running watch, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a pre-CES research note.In drones, a host of new competitors will join market leaders DJI and Parrot with their own flying cameras at the show. GoPro's (GPRO) highly anticipated Karma is not expected to be among them, though.Intel said Monday that it is buying German drone maker Ascending Technologies for an undisclosed price, Re/code reported.Consumers showed a great deal of interest in drones this holiday shopping season, but Creative Strategies analyst Tim Bajarin is skeptical about longer-term prospects for the category.The mainstream use case for drones is ""questionable,"" he told IBD. ""You can clearly add a new dimension to your picture-taking if you know what you're doing.""However, the appeal of taking selfies from the air might be limited, he said. Plus, government restrictions on where you can fly drones threaten to keep the devices ""pretty grounded.""What's Hot For CES 2016?Among the products likely to capture the attention of the media at CES 2016 are virtual reality and augmented reality headsets, the first ultra-high-definition Blu-ray Disc players, self-driving cars, hoverboards and other personal transportation devices.With the planned launches of three VR headsets in early 2016, virtual reality will be a big topic at CES. The VR goggles include Facebook's (FB) Oculus Rift, Sony's PlayStation VR and the HTC-Valve joint venture HTC Vive.Facebook: Your VR Is ReadyOculus announced Monday that it will begin taking pre-orders for its Rift VR goggles on Wednesday. It did not reveal pricing for the headset or say when the device will ship. The goggles will come bundled with video games ""Lucky's Tale"" by Playful and ""Eve: Valkyrie"" from CCP.Many companies at CES will be showing off cameras for taking 360-degree video for playing on those headsets. Video game makers and entertainment companies will be there to tout content for VR goggles. Still others are making peripherals for VR gaming such as gloves and controllers.""The big buzz heading into CES 2016 is around 'rolling out the red carpet' for virtual reality products/headsets/software,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in his CES preview research note.""After years of development, the tech world will be getting its first glimpse of the highly anticipated virtual reality systems set to hit the consumer market in first-half 2016,"" he said.Bajarin expects virtual reality will be a big deal. ""It really represents the next big step in immersive computing,"" he said.But Costello isn't sold on VR for applications beyond gaming.""Wearing goggles and watching TV is not what people want to do. We had that problem with 3D TV,"" she said.The latest television displays are always a highlight at CES. This year, with 4K Ultra HD TVs hitting mainstream prices, attention is shifting to a technology called HDR or high dynamic range. HDR offers a better contrast ratio and more accurate color, for a more realistic picture.Consumer electronics vendors and Hollywood studios will be at CES to promote the first Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc players. They hope that Ultra HD Blu-ray Discs can revitalize the packaged media business by providing a better picture than you can get from streaming, Costello said.Skateboard Meets SegwayOne product likely to make the blooper reels for TV journalists at CES are so-called hoverboards. The self-balancing two-wheeled boards for personal transportation were a hit over the holiday season. But the devices gained notoriety for defects that caused some to catch fire. There also have been many videos posted online of people falling off the boards and injuring themselves.The category will need quality-control improvements to remain popular, Bajarin said.""I do think there is value to them once you get the kinks out of them,"" he said. ""You're going to see some exceptional new hoverboards at the show.""

1602,HD,"Given the market's volatility and descent into a correction, few leading stocks are holding above their buy points following recent breakouts. But Blackhawk Network (HAWK) is doing just that, though it has also faced some downward pressure. The stock is in buy range from a 45.88 cup-with-handle buy point cleared Nov. 23. Volume on that day was below average and didn't pick up until two sessions later, when the stock marked a new high. It rose as much as 5.5% from the entry before easing.Shares undercut the buy point intraday twice last week, but they closed above the entry on both days, a sign of support. The stock remains above the buy point and in buy range — though keep in mind that all purchases are riskier now with the market in correction.Blackhawk ran into some trouble after an early October breakout past a 46.23 buy point. It climbed above the entry for three consecutive sessions but closed below it each time, before pulling back to form the latest cup-with-handle pattern. Its Relative Strength line is in new high ground, a bullish sign and a rarity in the current market environment.An Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B and up-down volume ratio of 1.3, higher than the neutral 1.0 level, point to recent demand for shares. Shareholders as of the third quarter included highly regarded mutual funds CGM Focus FundC and Fidelity Contrafund . The number of funds owning shares has steadily increased the past eight quarters, from 124 in Q3 2013 to 334 in the latest Q3.The Pleasanton, Calif.-based company came public in April 2013, after being spun off by supermarket chain Safeway. The stock has more than doubled in price from its $23 a share offering and is up about 20% for the year, well ahead of the Nasdaq's 4% year-to-date gain.Blackhawk provides prepaid gift cards, as well as related prepaid products and payment services. Its gift cards are sold in grocery chains, malls and other venues. It also makes gift cards for major retailers, including Amazon (AMZN), Best Buy (BBY), Home Depot (HD) and Starbucks (SBUX). Gift cards were the No. 1 requested holiday gift by consumers, according to a November National Retail Federation survey.Blackhawk has been growing via acquisitions.

1619,HD,"Special Report: Income Investing 2016Dividends can yield a steady stream of income for investors. Leading fund managers have used game plans focused on buying select dividend-paying stocks to boost total returns and drive outperformance.T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund and Columbia Dividend Income Fund have been among the top mutual funds for dividend investors over the last decade. Here are some insights from the managers who have executed successful dividend investment strategies.T. Rowe Dividend GrowthTom Huber has beaten large blend funds tracked by Morningstar by an annual average of 136 basis points over the last 10 years as manager of the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund.He points out that dividends can prove to be a substantial portion of investors' total returns. ""Over time, dividends have made up 40% to 50% of total returns,"" Huber said. ""It gets lost a little bit when markets are strong and compounding at double-digit rates, but if you look back over history, dividends have been an important source of returns for investors.""For income investors, Huber emphasizes the importance of buying stocks of companies that have been able to increase their dividends over time. ""A track record of dividend growth is a good sign of a quality business, financial health and durability,"" he said. ""In addition to offering investors a growing stream of income, dividend-paying stocks also tend to be less volatile and offer some downside protection.""Dividend Growth is designed to reward patient investors. ""There are market environments where our strategy does better and environments when it is going to lag,"" Huber said. ""In big up markets, dividend stocks tend to be a bit out of favor, but when growth moderates and the market corrects, they tend to hold up better.""Dividend Growth sticks with many of its bets for the long haul. ""We have a relatively low turnover,"" Huber said of the mutual fund's 19% turnover ratio. ""We want to own these companies over time and benefit from the compounding effect of earnings, cash flow and dividend growth.""In comparing Dividend Growth to a generic growth fund, Huber points out the low turnover can be advantageous for tax purposes. ""The percentage distribution between dividends and capital gains will likely vary between the two (funds), but tax rates on the two are similar,"" he said. ""Our fund has a turnover rate that runs between 10% and 30%, which is much lower than peers and helps limit taxable events.""The fund's top holding, Danaher (DHR), has been a mainstay in the Dividend Growth portfolio for much of Huber's tenure. ""It yields less than a percent but does raise its dividend nicely every year,"" he said. ""It's a diversified industrial company of better-than-average businesses, characterized by higher-than-average margins and free cash flow conversion.""Pfizer (PFE) is Huber's No. 2 holding. ""The company has been growing its dividend at about a 10% rate over the last five years,"" he said. ""Pfizer has an underappreciated pipeline. It's not an expensive stock and has a yield over 3%.""Huber sees General Electric (GE) shareholders benefiting from the company divesting much of its financial services unit. ""You end up with an industrial earnings stream which is much less volatile than it had been previously,"" he said of the fund's No. 3 holding. ""It will be a higher-quality, more durable mix of businesses, and in the meantime you collect a dividend yield of 3%.""Columbia Dividend IncomeColumbia Dividend Income Fund is co-managed by Scott Davis, Michael Barclay and Peter Santoro. It has topped large value funds tracked by Morningstar by an average of 186 basis points for the past 10 years.To achieve this outperformance, the trio thoroughly assesses the long-term business prospects of a dividend-paying company before buying. ""When we look at stocks, we do not look at the dividend first,"" Davis said. ""We look at a company's corporate structure and its ability to generate cash from operations. To sustain a dividend, you need to have a healthy company that can afford to pay it.""Davis emphasizes that the fund's dividend investment strategy does not get caught up in chasing yield. ""It's not just about focusing on the highest-yielding stocks,"" Davis said. ""It really has to do with the sustainability of a dividend and a company's ability to grow the dividend.""Barclay notes that the fund's portfolio provides ample downside protection. ""One of the hallmarks of our product is that it keeps investors from getting hit hard when the stock market goes down,"" he said. ""By doing that, clients stay engaged and are still in the fund when the market turns around and goes back up.""Cash Flow GeneratorsAs of Sept. 30, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) were the top two holdings. ""Not only do Microsoft and Apple have superior free cash flow generation, but they are actually growing,"" Barclay said. ""When you can find a company that is growing its top line and producing strong free cash flow because of strong operating margins, that's a formula for good growth and sustainability of the dividend.""The fund's top consumer cyclical holding is Home Depot (HD). ""We continue to see home improvement projects gaining consumer wallet share,"" Santoro said. ""Home Depot has done a great job of anticipating consumer needs. They have also been good stewards of capital and have been raising cash flow expectations.""The portfolio has held a position in Exxon Mobil (XOM) since 2003. ""Exxon has probably the best balance sheet in the whole industry,"" Santoro said. ""It pays a dividend of almost 4% and is incredibly secure.""

1661,HD,"GPS device maker Garmin International (GRMN) upped its game in the action camera market vs. category leader GoPro on Monday by debuting its next generation of HD sports cameras.Garmin announced the Virb X and Virb XE action cameras, which will be available this summer for $300 and $400, respectively. The main difference between the two models is that the XE has higher-resolution video and faster frame rates. GoPro cameras are priced at $130 to $500.Compared with Garmin's first-generation product, the new cameras are smaller, have better video quality and a new form factor, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a research note Monday. The new Virb cameras lack a preview screen, but have Bluetooth audio connectivity for wireless headsets and microphones.Unlike GoPro (GPRO) cameras, Garmin's Virb cameras have built-in sensors (GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope) and can connect to other Garmin products (such as a heart-rate monitor and sports watch) to allow for performance tracking. Data such as velocity, elevation and heart rate can be overlaid onto action videos of skiing, biking, skydiving and other activities.""If there's one thing missing on the new action cameras, it's 4K recording,"" Anderson said. ""We believe Garmin upgraded to an Ambarella (AMBA) chip for the new Virb cameras, but it's not the Ambarella A9, which is used in GoPro's high-end line-up. We would expect the exclusion of 4K recording to lead to a certain amount of criticism.""Garmin likely made a trade-off to save on battery life, Anderson said. Garmin chose to include sensors rather than allow for 4K ultra HD video, he said. Garmin and GoPro cameras have comparable battery life of about two hours.By contrast, GoPro excludes such sensors from its devices because it believes that sensor data can be captured from a smartphone paired with a GoPro.Overall, the new Garmin action cameras are ""good, but not great,"" Anderson said. ""We believe Garmin is including very little revenue from the Virb in 2015 revenue guidance, so if it gains popularity, that would be upside to the model.""Anderson rates Garmin stock as a buy with a price target of 60. Garmin stock was flat Monday, closing just under 47.Meanwhile, GoPro on Monday announced a new product that should help it expand into the broadcast market. It unveiled HeroCast, a wireless HD micro transmitter. Developed with Vislink, the HeroCast transmitter allows professional broadcasters to air live HD video from GoPro cameras attached to athletes. HeroCast costs $7,500.GoPro stock fell more than 2% Monday.RELATED:GoPro needs 'video-editing software breakthrough'.

Palo Alto and CyberArk got positive mentions in an Oppenheimer analyst note late Tuesday. CyberArk rose 4% intraday, Palo Alto 0.2% and Qualys 0.2%.That means their shares outperform 99% of all stocks in the market as measured by fundamental and technical factors.

1891,HD,"Stratasys (SSYS) was downgraded by several analysts after the 3D printer maker late Monday gave preliminary fourth-quarter earnings and a 2015 outlook that fell far short of expectations.Stratasys followed up with a conference call with analysts Tuesday morning.""We were absolutely stunned by Stratasys' preliminary announcement and 2015 guidance press release,"" wrote Troy Jensen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, in a research note.Stratasys stock fell 28% to close at 57.36 Tuesday, a two-year low. Rival 3D Systems (DDD) fell 5% to 28.62. 3D Systems stock is down about 70% in the past 13 months.Stratasys expects to report Q4 earnings per share minus items of 45 cents to 51 cents, well below the analyst consensus estimate of 73 cents. It expects revenue of $214.7 million to $216.7 million, whereas the consensus was $230.5 million, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS, slashed his price target on Stratasys to 55 from 125.""We don't see a quick recovery for the stock,"" Milunovich wrote.Bobby Burleson, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, lowered his price target to 100 from 120, but maintained a buy rating.For 2015, Stratasys estimates total revenue of $940 million to $960 million. The analyst consensus was for revenue of $1 billion. The company projects EPS of $2.07 to $2.24, whereas analysts had modeled $2.91.The lowered guidance was driven by lower-than-expected Q4 growth of just 7% for MakerBot, the company's consumer-oriented 3D printer line. The shortfall was blamed on difficulties faced with the introduction and ramp-up of new MakerBot products and the development of a new distribution model.MakerBot Challenges""We believe the MakerBot weakness was primarily due to quality problems with extruder heads, scaling challenges, change in distribution and a maturing of the business,"" wrote Jensen, who downgraded Stratasys to neutral from overweight.Stratasys executives also announced a nontax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $100 million to $110 million to be applied to the fourth quarter, related to the MakerBot unit.Stratasys acquired MakerBot in a stock deal valued at $403 million that closed on Aug. 15, 2013.Stratasys says two key challenges affected MakerBot in Q4. One involved ""reliability issues"" related to certain components that contributed to higher warranty costs.The second issue relates to a rapidly evolving distribution model. In the latter part of 2014, MakerBot engaged national retailers, including Staples (SPLS), Home Depot (HD), Sam's Club and Dell, to reach new audiences.""We are confident in our evolving distribution model, but given the nature and scope of these new partnerships in comparison with MakerBot's traditional distribution model, predictable sales patterns and reorder rates have yet to be established,"" said Shane Glenn, Stratasys vice president of investor relations, in Tuesday's conference call.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter: @IBD_BDeagon.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 2014 ruled that Aereo's TV-over-Internet service violated TV broadcasters' copyrights. TiVo in August rolled out a legal DVR for over-the-air (OTA) television broadcasts. The DVR requires users to own an in-home digital HD antenna.TiVo executives were upbeat on the prospects for OTA devices on the company earnings call. TiVo last week signed a deal to supply a set-top box with combined broadband-OTA capabilities to rural telecom service provider Frontier Communications (FTR). The set-top box is intended for cord cutters — consumers with high-speed Internet service who substitute online video for traditional pay TV.For its fiscal Q4 ended Jan. 31, TiVo said it earned 7 cents per share, up from a penny profit in the year-earlier period. Service and technology revenue rose 9% to $91.7 million. Analysts had modeled EPS of 4 cents on revenue of $89 million. The company forecast fiscal Q1 service and technology revenue of $91 million at the midpoint of its range, in line with consensus estimates.""It was another strong quarter for TiVo, with continued strength coming from the (cable TV) business, where management sees significant upside to current penetration levels across its North American deployments,"" said Brian Fitzgerald, a Jefferies analyst, in a research report.In fiscal 2015, TiVo repurchased $346 million of its stock, reducing basic shares outstanding by about 20%.IBD's Telecom-Cable/Satellite Equipment group ranks just No. 123 out of 197 industry groups.

2114,HD,"LAS VEGAS — For ultrahigh-definition television to really take off, the industry is going to need a lot of exciting UHD or 4K content that takes advantage of what the super-sharp new displays can show.But fear not, Hollywood studios and content distributors say more 4K movies and TV shows are on the way, including Ultra HD Blu-ray Discs likely by the end of the year. Currently, Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are leading the charge by offering 4K versions of their original shows on their subscription streaming video services.UHD TV is on the verge of breaking through to the mainstream, as consumers upgrade their big-screen sets to the better picture quality. UHD has four times the resolution of today's standard HD video.Victor Matsuda, global promotions chair for the Blu-ray Disc Association, said the group expects an Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc standard to be locked down by midyear. Then consumer electronics companies and movie studios will begin using the standard in UHD products.""It would not surprise me to see some of the first products by the end of the year,"" Matsuda said during a panel discussion at the International CES on Tuesday.Meanwhile, a coalition of Hollywood studios, consumer electronics firms and content distributors has formed the UHD Alliance to establish standards for 4K video.Founding members of the UHD Alliance include DirecTV (DTV), Dolby (DLB), LG Electronics, Netflix, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Sony (SNE), Walt Disney (DIS), Twentieth Century Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Entertainment.Philip Goswitz, senior vice president at DirecTV, said establishing standards was his company's main motivation for joining the alliance. All parties offering 4K video products need to agree on quality standards to ensure a consistent experience for viewers. That includes standards for upcoming enhancements like high-data rate video.Movies tend to be among the first types of content to move to new resolution standards. But sports programming is what really moves consumers to adopt higher-definition standards, Goswitz said. ESPN parent Disney is a member of the new alliance.DirecTV is launching two new satellites to provide additional capacity for 4K channels, Goswitz said. One recently launched satellite is now operational and the other is going up in May, he said.Streaming video platform company Roku is ready for the 4K revolution, says Steve Shannon, Roku senior vice president of content and services.""We think 4K is a streaming platform,"" Shannon told IBD on Wednesday. ""If you look at the cable (TV) infrastructure, they're not going to be able to hop on 4K right away,"" because their set-top boxes will need to be updated.At CES, Roku announced plans to support 4K Ultra HD streaming in future Roku set-top boxes and streaming sticks. It also has prepared a reference design for 4K smart TVs for license to TV makers. Chinese TV manufacturer TCL has signed on as a customer for the 4K smart TV software.In addition, Roku is working with Netflix to provide 4K video for streaming on the Roku platform.Roku, which is widely expected to be one of the big IPOs in 2015, offers more than 2,000 streaming channels through its devices and supported televisions.

""The fact is that the private sector can't do this alone, either. It's government that often has the latest information on these new threats. We're going to have to be smart and efficient and focus on what each sector does best, and work together.""The president signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for the government to share classified information with companies.The summit and order reflect the urgency that the White House is giving the issue. On Tuesday, it created the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center to streamline and sort cyberthreats collected by various intelligence agencies.Apple's Cook Still SteamedApple CEO Tim Cook agreed that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. But he criticized government violations and touted encryption, something intelligence officials have objected to.""History has shown us that sacrificing our right to privacy can have dire consequences,"" Cook said. ""We shouldn't have to trade our security for the convenience of having all this information at our fingertips.""The summit comes after a year in which companies such as Anthem (ANTM), Home Depot (HD), Target (TGT) and Sony (SNE) have suffered costly and embarrassing breaches.Sharing For SecurityObama lauded efforts underway by network security firms such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and Symantec (SYMC) to share information by forming the Cyber Threat Alliance.Palo Alto CEO Mark McLaughlin said in a panel discussion that the alliance is an example of how rivals can work together.""The more we're sharing, the less chance that these attacks will be successful, while dramatically increasing the costs (for cybercriminals),"" he said.Obama called for Congress to pass legislation that gives liability protection to companies that share information and helps streamline the way companies alert customers of breaches.Attendee Muddu Sudhakar, CEO of Palo Alto, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup Caspida, told IBD that he supports such legislation, possibly with tax incentives to encourage businesses to proactively share.""The question is how are we going to make this happen?"" he said.Obama said he chose to hold the event in the heart of Silicon Valley, where much of the innovation in next-generation cybersecurity tools is taking place.CEOs of some Silicon Valley companies such as Google (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) chose not to attend, reflecting strained government-industry ties over surveillance exposed by ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.Cyberattacks have benefited security companies such as FireEye (FEYE), CyberArk (CYBR) and Qualys (QLYS), which all reported strong results this week.

Revenue is seen rising 11% to $639.4 million.If those results hold up, they would mark the seventh time in the last eight quarters that Acuity has logged double-digit sales and profit gains.Acuity makes lighting products for the industrial, commercial and residential markets. Its brands include Lithonia Lighting, Holophane and Gotham. It sells its products directly as well as through retailers like Home Depot (HD).Like other lighting suppliers, including Koninklijke Philips (PHG) and Eaton (ETN) subsidiary Cooper Industries, Acuity has focused much of its recent attention on developing digital lighting systems tied to the Internet of Things.But most of the current industry growth comes from adoption of light-emitting diode (LED) solutions, analysts say.In a recent note initiating coverage on Acuity at an ""outperform"" rating, analyst Ryan Merkel of William Blair said that the lighting industry ""is early in the secular transition to next-generation LED lighting systems, and Acuity is the only North American pure play.""""We believe LED technology has just entered the adoption phase of the S-curve, and Acuity's LED growth could be sustained at 50%-plus annually,"" Merkel added.Factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock price gains, Acuity gets an IBD Composite Rating of 93, which places it fourth in IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous group behind CaesarStone Sdot-Yam (CSTE), Apogee Enterprises (APOG) and Boise Cascade (BCC).

2154,HD,"""It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting.""So said Jesse Livermore in the classic ""Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.""IBD founder Bill O'Neil can also relate. One of his most successful investments was Syntex, the developer of the birth-control pill, in the 1960s. But he didn't make money by simply trading it. He made money by sitting as well.Make no mistake, though. It's not easy being patient with a big winner. Fact is, few investors capitalized fully on Home Depot's (HD) 20-fold move in less than two years from its IPO in September 1981.And how many investors held on to Cisco Systems (CSCO) when it soared more than 80,000% between October 1990 and March 2000? Not many.Remember that stock you bought last year? You took a 20% profit, only to see the stock rise another 150% from where you sold it.You're not alone. After a few stinging losses, or due to fear of the future, it's human nature to nail down a quick gain to get your confidence back.The process of learning how to buy a growth stock is hard enough. Handling it after you buy is even harder. Here are some tips to help you learn how to hold better. Be early. A breakout generally has the best chance of working in the early stages of a bull market — not the latter stages. This is an important point, and it's certainly relevant to today's market.Five-plus years into a bull market, recent breakouts have been a mixed bag at best. Expect a pullback. Sometimes, volatility hits a stock after a breakout and the breakout falls apart. Other times, a breakout shows great promise, but sellers come into the stock and it erases a double-digit gain. In both cases, cutting losses or selling to nail down a gain is smart even if the stock eventually turns into a big winner.Keep watching the stock. It may offer a second chance to buy it back. If it becomes a winner, give it room to run. Don't fear major corrections. Emerging leaders with outstanding fundamentals tend to do the best in the early stages of a new bull market. The strong bull markets that started in March 2003 and March 2009 came after extremely sharp pullbacks for the major averages. Both bear-market declines flushed sellers out — so much so that it wasn't hard for stocks to gain traction after both uptrends were confirmed with follow-through days.After a 19% pullback for the Nasdaq in April to July 2010 that flushed a lot of sellers out, the Nasdaq soared 3% in higher volume on Sept. 1 (please see a daily chart), confirming a new uptrend.On Nov. 24, Cerner (CERN) cleared a cup-with-handle pattern with a buy point of 44.54 (adjusted for a 2-for-1 split). In this case, it was an easy winner to hold. A big market shakeout earlier in the year helped.Some volatility hit the champion in electronic medical records management in the second half of 2011. A 53% gain from the buy point temporarily shrank to 21%. Some investors might have decided to take profits, but those with conviction in the stock could afford to sit through the selling. They could also have added shares as the stock broke again in February 2012.

Earlier, it touched a fresh 14-1/2-year high. The S&P 500 climbed 0.5% to an all-time high. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a 0.2% gain due to weakness in Home Depot (HD), which reported earnings earlier in the session. Volume was still running mixed in the stock market today . NYSE trade was tracking higher, but Nasdaq volume was running lower from Monday's pace.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for early elections to seek approval for his economic policies. Japan has fallen into a recession, which some economists blame on Abe's tax hikes.Among leading U.S. stocks, Actavis (ACT) rallied 7% to an all-time high. It's now 15% past a 229.50 buy point from a flat base. On Monday, the drugmaker announced that it would buy Botox maker Allergan (AGN) for about $66 billion in cash and stock. Citigroup raised Actavis' price target to 310 from 250 Tuesday.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), which lost out on the deal to buy Allergan, climbed 4% to a near eight-month high.

2315,HD,"Retailers overcame a sluggish Black Friday as a brighter jobs picture and lower gas prices put consumers in more of a buying mood in December and heading into the final stretch.
"
2316,HD,"Steep early promotions led to a disappointing Thanksgiving weekend. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) and other online rivals continue to take a bigger slice of a limited retail pie.Still, retailers are on track to deliver the best holiday season in three years.Michael Niemira, principal of The Retail Economist, is sticking to his forecast for combined November-December sales growth of 2.9% after a Scrooge-like 0.9% increase last year. That's based on Census Bureau's GAFO (general merchandise, apparel, furniture and other, including electronics and sporting goods), and would be the best gain since 2011.""The key difference this holiday vs. last year and the last few years is the stronger economy, which is the underpinning for holiday spending,"" Niemira said.Mobile Still ActiveTop gift items were consumer electronics, especially mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, says Marshal Cohen, NPD Group's chief industry analyst. Home decor products, small appliances and activewear were also big winners, he says.Bill Martin, founder of ShopperTrak sees retailers on track to show a 3.8% gain in GAFO sales for November and December.""That's a pretty good number,"" he told IBD.November retail sales rose 5.4%, fueled by an ""early push"" that helped offset an underperforming Thanksgiving weekend, says Martin. It took until the week before Christmas for consumers to get ""ramped up again, which is going on right now.""Sales on the last pre-Christmas Saturday likely rose 0.5% above last year to about $9.16 billion, according to Martin's preliminary tally. That would just top Black Friday's sales of roughly $9.1 billion, making Super Saturday the No. 1 shopping day for the first time in 10 years.Thomson Reuters analysts see December same-store sales rising 4%, up from 2013's 3.5%.""That suggests shoppers hit the malls this month,"" said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research, via email.Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, says it was a ""decent holiday, fueled by a good jobs picture and significantly lower gas prices.""But apparel was ""soft"" due to a lack of fashion and as consumers focused spending on other areas, such as home furnishings, electronics and accessories.Best Buy (BBY), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) were among retailers with good holiday sales, he says.Thomson Reuters analysts forecast the home improvement segment will be the big winner in the November-to-January quarter with a 5.3% same-store sales rise, followed by footwear at 4.6% and jewelry at 4.1%.""The season shows that the consumer is alive and kicking a lot harder than you would think,"" adds Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors. ""You really got a good feel of what 5% GDP (growth) meant for retailers during this holiday.""Consumers were buying the priciest items at stores such as Best Buy, J.C. Penney (JCP) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Sozzi said. At Best Buy they snapped up GoPro (GPRO) action cameras and the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.Expensive lightweight jackets and hoodies from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UA) were also hot, says Sozzi.Cohen says the season turned out OK. ""Retailers had an early start, a lull (later) that was expected, and a strong finish through Christmas (Eve),"" he said. ""Now they have the gift cards, the returns and exchanges. There's still more revenue to come for retailers.""Retailers Didn't 'Panic'Retailers did a ""very good job"" all year managing inventory, including doorbusters, Cohen said. Except for mall-based apparel chains, they mostly stuck to their planned holiday promotions, a good sign for profit margins.""They weren't in a panic mode,"" Cohen said.Perkins estimates holiday online sales — from pure play e-tailers to brick-and-mortar stores — rose 15%, with traditional chains' online business up 10% to 15%.He says traditional stores such as Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) are getting a ""handle on"" ecommerce with features like ordering online and in-store pickup.""They're doing a better job of capturing online sales and not just feeding them to Amazon.""

2421,HD,"LifeLock, a provider of identity theft protection services, is poised for continued growth on the heels of recently released pricing packages and a new online application that could help it reach a younger audience.Concerns about cybersecurity are intensifying in the wake of data breaches at Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and elsewhere, and are likely to keep motivating more people and companies to pursue the kinds of protections that LifeLock (LOCK) sells, says Mike Matousek, a trader at U.S. Global Investors.""A good motivator sometimes for people to invest is fear, and (LifeLock) has good solutions to quell people's fear,"" Matousek told IBD. ""People are worried; they don't know what's lurking .. . so more people looking for protection is a probably going to be a driver"" of continued sales growth for LifeLock.The Tempe, Ariz.-based company recently reported third-quarter net income of $5.7 million. Excluding special costs, it produced earnings per share of 16 cents on revenue of $123 million, up from 12 cents per share on sales of $96 million a year earlier.For the fourth quarter, company executives projected EPS of 26 cents to 27 cents on revenue ranging from $127 million to $129 million. In the final quarter of 2013, LifeLock produced EPS of 22 cents on sales of $102 million.Improved Security At A PriceLifeLock in July starting selling new premium levels of security packages to its then 3.4 million customers. LifeLock did not respond to an interview request, but CEO Todd Davis said on the company's earnings conference call in October that initial reaction to the new offerings was ""solid.""He said that the company's consumer segment powered revenue growth, with such sales in the third quarter up 31% from a year earlier. The segment accounted for 94% of LifeLock's business and the enterprise segment the rest.The company, Davis said, added roughly 264,000 new customers in the quarter. More than 40% signed up for one of the premium offerings, helping to bolster revenue.""We are still optimizing the messaging and rolling the new offerings through the channel. But we're quite pleased with the performance so far,"" Davis said.The newer offerings include personalized activity alerts on credit card, checking and savings account transactions.LifeLock Advantage alerts customers about unusual transactions by text or email for $19.99 a month. LifeLock Ultimate Plus, at $29.99 per month, provides financial alerts and messages customers on their brokerage and retirement accounts. These protections are triggered when withdrawals, purchases or balance transfers exceed pre-set personalized limits.With each level up in protection packages, customers also get greater levels of insurance on stolen wallets and cash. The Ultimate Plus package provides coverage up to $1,000 and $300 for lost cash.A more basic package, LifeLock Standard, continues to sell for $9.99 per month. It warns consumers of signs that a criminal may be trying to open a new financial account with the customer's name and Social Security Number. The higher levels also provide this service.""(We) are seeing about 1 million transactions a week coming through these consumer offerings,"" Davis said.He added that LifeLock is beta-testing a new privacy-monitoring service that the company hopes will connect it to more potential customers. LifeLock Privacy Monitor helps consumers find their personal information on people-search websites and in Internet-based advertising companies' databases. Clients can then opt out of or remove their information from those databases, he said.""The amount of data collected today is exploding as consumers increasingly live their lives online, and consumers are looking for a solution to help them take back control of their personal information and protect their identity,"" Davis said on the earnings call. ""This beta offering is currently free for consumers and will be used as a tool to drive traffic and engagement with LifeLock as we look to enhance and extend our leadership in the identity theft protection marketplace.""Going MobileAdditionally, this fall, LifeLock relaunched its mobile wallet application for major mobile app stores,Apple's (AAPL) App Store and Google's (GOOGL) Android app store Google Play, as another way to reach prospective and potentially younger customers. It provides free services such as digital copies of payment and identification cards for access on smartphones, and the ability to reach LifeLock's paid services.""The technology piece is important, but you have to think of this more as a channel to new subscribers,"" Sterne Agee analyst Robert Breza said in an interview.He says that the typical LifeLock customer has been over 50 years of age with a substantial amount of wealth to protect. But the world is changing quickly thanks to mobile technology, giving LifeLock opportunities to tap into a younger and broader realm of customers.""So it is about trying to appeal to that person who is 30 or maybe 35 years old, who is more technically savvy and who is putting everything into his or her phone"" and wants protection on that front, he said.The relaunch of the wallet app also confirmed to Wall Street that LifeLock could swiftly correct a substantial mistake that dogged it earlier this year. In May, a few months after the company paid nearly $43 million to acquire mobile wallet specialist Lemon — the initial source of the app — LifeLock removed the app from online stores after learning that it did not fully comply with payment card industry security standards.""They obviously had a tough lesson to learn,"" Breza said.LifeLock's management proved that it could learn quickly, he says, by updating the product for full compliance and re-launching the app in October, ahead of the year-end relaunch that some analysts had anticipated.""The management team is very sound,"" he added.Breza said that LifeLock is not trying to own the ""digital wallet"" space — which is populated by tech and finance giants — but can carve out a niche and ride the important mobile wave by partnering with the likes of Visa (V) or Apple and its Apple Pay.""It's about where the world is going,"" Breza said.LifeLock stock, recently trading around $17 per share, is up only about 8% so far this year. But it has risen about 25% over the past three months and is riding momentum that many on Wall Street think it could sustain into 2015.LifeLock gets a Composite Rating of 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD, taking into account factors such as earnings and stock-price growth.It has the second-highest Composite Rating in its industry group after Envestnet (ENV), a provider of investment technology for financial advisers, which gets a 99. The Financial Services-Specialty industry group, where both reside, is ranked No. 37 in performance among 197 that IBD tracks.Of eight analysts who cover LifeLock, Thomson Reuters reports three have a buy rating, two a strong buy and one a hold. The consensus average price target is 21.Given the company's growth trajectory, ""the stock is absolutely cheap,"" Breza said.

"
2450,HD,"The $1.8 billion Putnam Investors Fund is an old geezer. Its Dec. 1, 1925, inception date makes it the industry's second oldest stock fund.
"
2451,HD,"But it's acting like a spry spring chicken lately.
"
2452,HD,"Since Jerry Sullivan took over in mid-2008, the fund's average annual gain is 10.84% through Sept. 30. It tops the S&P 500's 10.02%. And it beats 91% of large-cap blend funds tracked by Morningstar.
"
2453,HD,"In the same-length period prior to Sullivan's taking charge, the fund's 5.32% average annual gain lagged the S&P 500 and 88% of its large-cap blend peers.
"
2454,HD,"Sullivan credits his outperformance to an appetite for both growth and value stocks. Also, he targets three types of stocks: ones he's followed for years, those pushed up and down by smart money, and special situations. And he focuses on valuation.
"
2455,HD,"In addition, he applies lessons learned from his mentor and former boss, former Fidelity Investments superstar Peter Lynch, who ran the now-$16.7 billion Magellan Fund when it sat atop the fund world with strong performance and rapid growth.
"
2456,HD,"Putnam Investors Fund assets peaked at $16.2 billion in August 2000 and shrank to a low of $1.2 billion by September 2011. Assets have been rising since then.
"
2457,HD,"Sullivan, who is 54 years old, spoke with IBD from his office in Boston's financial district about how he invests.
"
2458,HD,"IBD: Is it OK if I mention that you have a distinct Brooklyn accent?
"
2459,HD,"Sullivan: I was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Long Island. My dad grew up a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. I grew up a New York Mets fan because the Dodgers had just moved to L.A. We hate the Yankees. I would relish your mentioning my accent.
"
2460,HD,"IBD: You have a flexible style, right? You invest in both growth and value stocks.
"
2461,HD,"Sullivan: I'm the core manager here at Putnam. Investors Fund is a mix of value and growth. So is my Multi-Cap Core Fund (with $109 million in assets), which is four years old. It's the same style, but even more flexible, because it can go up and down the market-cap spectrum. Investors Fund must have at least 75% of its securities in large caps. Multi-Cap cannot have more than 75% in any one category — large, mid or small cap. Stylewise, they're the same.
"
2462,HD,"IBD: And what are the three types of stocks that Investors Fund buys?
"
2463,HD,"Sullivan: I call the first bucket my legacy stocks. They're large caps that I researched earlier in my career or even recently. It was in-depth research. Then I gave each one three minutes of research every week for five, 10, 30 years. I refined my understanding of what factors move each stock up or down. That helps me understand when to make a move. It's my most boring bucket but the most important to me.
"
2464,HD,"The second bucket has to do with smart money. The main factor is insider buying. I follow that closely and have for many years.
"
2465,HD,"In the early to mid-1980s, when I worked for Peter Lynch, it was the No. 1 factor that he deferred to when looking for the right timing to buy a stock.
"
2466,HD,"IBD: What was your role at Fidelity?
"
2467,HD,"Sullivan: In 1985, I was doing research on European chemical stocks like BASF, Imperial Chemical and (Holland's) Akzo Nobel. Big stocks. It was important for Magellan to look for big, liquid stocks.
"
2468,HD,"It was also much harder to follow insider transactions. You had to check SEC filings on paper. And they could be six to eight weeks old. The rules were looser about when insiders had to file.
"
2469,HD,"Sarbanes-Oxley moved it to a 48-hour rule. And now you can watch the information flow in on the Internet in real time.
"
2470,HD,"It doesn't tell me what to buy, but it gives me ideas.
"
2471,HD,"The third bucket is special situations. One of the most common are follow-on stock offerings. They used to be called secondary offerings. It might be filed at 4 o'clock on a typical day. XYZ company is doing a follow-on. And you've got 45 minutes to decide if you want to play it or not. They'd file at 4:15 and close their books at 5 p.m.
"
2472,HD,"IBD: What's a recent one you did?
"
2473,HD,"Sullivan: The latest was HD Supply (HDS), which was part of Home Depot (HD). (Former CEO) Bob Nardelli started building a distributor of big equipment. They IPO'd it after he left. I bought on the IPO, and they did a secondary offering. I put in offers below the asking price.
"
2474,HD,"IBD: How often does that work?
"
2475,HD,"Sullivan: CDW (CDW) is a technology distributor. They sell to midsize companies that don't have big IT departments. They went public last year. Please specify that I still own it but I sold a lot of it.
"
2476,HD,"I was maybe the first institutional investor to meet with them. They were never fast-growing. The underwriter was asking 22, maybe 24. I said, ""I want to buy a lot at 18."" The underwriter said, ""Maybe you missed the (detail) that we're selling at 24."" I said, ""No, I didn't miss it. I like it at 18, not 24."" At 18 it was trading at 12 times earnings. At 18 times earnings it's not warranted.
"
2477,HD,"Anyway, they went on a road show, had difficulty getting an audience because a lot of guys thought it was overpriced. After two weeks, they came back and said 18 would work. I said, ""OK, but now I only want it at 17."" They went public at 17. Since then, they've met their meager expectations. As they did, they grabbed a larger audience (of investors). The stock has slowly migrated to 30-ish. That's a great special situation.
"
2478,HD,"IBD: You like to buy stocks on price weakness. Give me an example, please.
"
2479,HD,"Sullivan: Buying on weakness was an old Peter Lynch rule.
"
2480,HD,"I bought Southwest Airlines (LUV) two, 2-1/2 years ago, when it was (trading around 8 or 9).
"
2481,HD,"The rest of the airlines were doing well. They charge for everything. But Southwest didn't, so it got depressed. It was selling below the replacement costs of all their airplanes. I figured it had to climb. And they could always start charging (for individual services like baggage). I loaded up as much as I could. It's gone to around 34.
"
2482,HD,"IBD: You've added to your Apple (AAPL) stake. Why?
"
2483,HD,"Sullivan: I started buying Apple again in the June quarter. It had pulled back from its highs. I took it to my biggest position.
"
2484,HD,"A year and a half or two years ago, both Apple and Google (GOOGL) went to 700. Then they separated. Apple pulled back. Google shot up. When everyone fell in love with Google, I used it as a source of funds. Apple had hair on it because it hadn't come out with anything new. Now it's coming through again. But it's not expensive on earnings. It's a quasi-value name with meaningful growth.
"
2485,HD,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is trending up again. Did investors decide this biotech was oversold?
"
2486,HD,"Sullivan: This was one of several large biotechs that I started positioning in more than three years ago. They looked like value names with growth. Now their pipelines are still meaningful. They've got good top- and bottom-line growth. Big pharmaceutical firms don't have that. And on a P-E-to-growth basis, it's still attractive. It's been stronger since the (Q1) sell-off than some biotechs like Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead (GILD). I added to Celgene during the weakness (earlier in) the year.
"
2487,HD,"IBD: Facebook (FB) has had a nice run-up since mid-2013. Is it still attractive?
"
2488,HD,"Sullivan: I'm underweight now. (My weighting is) less than 50 basis points. It's had a good move. It's the place where the eyeballs are. They were slow to get their mobile application to work. But they've done that. It's still a growth story. But it's trading at 40 times next year's (estimated) earnings, so at this point I'm neutral. I don't want to (make my position) bigger unless the stock pulls back.
"
2489,HD,"IBD: What's your thesis for CBRE Group (CBG)?
"
2490,HD,"Sullivan: They're a play on a commercial real estate rebound. They're not expensive.
"
2491,HD,"They're big brokers, maybe the biggest. They manage big office buildings. It's been a dead area, but it's coming back. Nonresidential construction is coming back, and occupancy rates are getting better. We've got them earning $1.70 (per share) this year and $1.80 next year. They're not a fancy name. They're a bit of a sleeper.
"
2492,HD,"IBD: Gilead's earnings per share growth has exploded. Is Sovaldi, its hepatitis C treatment, the entire story?
"
2493,HD,"Sullivan: The real attraction is more than that. They've got drugs for liver and heart disease. And a good platform for AIDS. But the real nice thing is that this stock is inexpensive on earnings. They're expected to earn $8 a share this year and $9.50 next year.
"
2494,HD,"That's very attractive: 11-1/2 times next year's earnings on a company growing in the teens. And we're fans of their whole pipeline.
"
2495,HD,"IBD: Is Spirit Airlines' (SAVE) driver its no-frills approach?
"
2496,HD,"Sullivan: Yes, their no-frills approach is their key.
"
2497,HD,"The interesting thing is that they're not targeted as competition by larger airlines, which is important. It avoids a price war.
"
2498,HD,"The larger airlines see them as an ultralow-cost carrier. When they go into a new market, they actually expand the market. Big competitors see that. They get people to fly who don't normally: college students, people on tight budgets, people who don't mind flying at midnight, people who don't mind being charged for extra bags or maybe overhead compartments.
"
2499,HD,"When will the airlines go after each other to get market share? They're not doing it now. The old managements (that engaged in price wars) have disappeared. Airline bankruptcies are fresh in (airlines managers') heads.
"
2500,HD,"IBD: Where is railcar-maker Trinity Industries (TRN) in its economic cycle?
"
2501,HD,"Sullivan: Its cycle still continues to work. We're only halfway through.
"
2502,HD,"They make all kinds of railroad cars. One of the most interesting on margin is cars that carry sand for fracking. The typical well takes 75 to 80 rail cars of this stuff.

Riley analyst Sameet Sinha said.Akamai is the No. 2 company by market cap after Equinix (EQIX) in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 50 out of 197 groups. The next largest players are three highly rated firms: F5 Networks (FFIV), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI).Akamai's Media Delivery Solutions category posted a revenue increase of 22% for the third quarter. More double-digit growth lies ahead as people increasingly weave online activities into their daily routines, Benson says.Akamai's global network of servers stores copies of online content in order to expedite delivery to its clients' customers. Those end users experience relatively few video streaming interruptions and faster downloads because Akamai's services effectively route them around Internet congestion, Benson says. Akamai also provides a range of software updates such as the routine upgrades issued for products like Apple's (AAPL) iPads.""We believe it will continue,"" Benson said, referring to the robust demand for Akamai's media services. The business, he added, ""has been a nice growth accelerant for the company.""At the same time, as corporate clients of myriad stripes — from online retailers to banking companies — capitalize on cloud-based service and handle more customer transactions online, they want higher levels of security to guard against hackers and data breaches.Headlines about breaches at banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and retailers like Home Depot (HD) have called attention to the need for cybersecurity and lifted demand for Akamai's services, Benson says.What Akamai provides in this regard are firewalls for Web applications and added layers of protection around clients' data centers. The company, he says, detects breaches at the edge of its network, ""far from customers' data centers. ... (and) we thwart the attacks.""Akamai's Performance and Security Solutions segment generated 29% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter.Benson says that Akamai does about 70% of its business in the U.S., but he added that its international operations, in Asia and Europe, are growing at a faster rate. He cites strong demand for its services in Japan, Korea and Singapore.Sinha says that Akamai should benefit from solid demand as its clients recognize that they must defend against security threats and as end users demand high-level online video, gaming and social media.""They have major tailwinds at their back,"" Sinha said.Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says that gaming and social media should continue to boost Akamai. ""Clearly, we're seeing acceleration in media delivery,"" he said. ""That's really where they have outperformed this year.""He expects growth on those fronts to build into long-term trends. ""That's the bull case for this story,"" Synesael said.Tough FieldAll of that noted, Akamai's story is not free of headwinds.The company has formidable competition that includes Limelight Networks (LLNW), Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Verizon Communications (VZ).It could also lose some ground with one of its most prominent clients, Apple, Synesael says. Apple, which accounts for 6% of Akamai's revenue by Synesael's estimation, is building its own internal content delivery network.""The concern is, are they going to shift more in-house in 2015?"" Synesael said of Apple, adding that other Akamai clients could make similar moves.After reporting third-quarter results, Akamai executives conceded to analysts that because the firm's media business is based on traffic volumes, its growth from one quarter to the next could be bumpy, given that gaming and software releases, as well as the adoption of new social media and video platform upgrades, tend to vary.But over the course of several coming quarters, Benson expects that favorable tech trends will continue to advance in Akamai's favor.""We are not opportunity constrained,"" he said.

"
2506,HD,"Often, it's not how well you do, it's how well you do relative to expectations. The same applies to earnings reports. A company that crushes earnings estimates often enjoys a big stock gain, as a surprise Wall Street sets a higher valuation. It also suggests the company has a stronger growth trajectory that bodes well for long-term share price gains.IBD's Screen of the Day is Estimate Beaters. These are highly rated companies with the biggest earnings per share outperformance in the latest quarter. Today's screen includes three security-related companies.CyberArk Software (CYBR) is one of several cybersecurity firms benefitting from companies' recognition that online security is a priority, not a luxury. That follows high-profile breaches from Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).The Newton, Mass.-based company claims to be able to deal with threats proactively, before they become major threats.CyberArk beat EPS estimates by 1,900% in its first earnings report as a public company. CyberArk had a successful IPO in late September.The stock rose 27% on Nov. 13 on the powerful 73% earnings gain and upbeat outlook. Shares continued to rise to a peak of 47.01 on Nov. 24. But CyberArk got two valuation-based downgrades on Nov. 25, sending shares down more than 9% that day. The stock has continued to fall, losing 7.2% on the stock market Monday as it starts to fill in the gap from the post-earnings share spike.Vasco Data Security (VDSI) makes software and hardware that boost protect mobile applications, verify transactions, manage identities and secure cloud-based data. Like CyberArk and other cybersecurity stocks such as Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Vasco Data is benefiting from increased spending on web security to defend against ever-more sophisticated hacks.Vasco Data crushed Wall Street forecasts by 180% in the latest quarter, with EPS growth of 167%. The stock, like the Nasdaq composite, hit a record high on Nov. 28. Shares drifted sideways until Monday, when they fell 6.3%.Taser International (TASR) offers security for the real world, most notably with its non-lethal stun guns. It's enjoyed increasing orders to police departments. Taser topped EPS estimates by 56% in the last quarter, with actual earnings growth of 40%.Now Taser sees a chance to expand its business with wearable cameras for law enforcement, in an effort to get a clear picture of police-suspect incidents, especially in officer-involved fatalities. Recent unrest of two such fatalities, along with other claims of excessive force, have helped make cop cameras a higher priority. President Obama last week called for funding to help local police departments buy wearable cameras. That's sent shares of Taser, Digital Ally (DGLY) and video processing chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA) sharply higher in recent weeks.Taser shares hit a fresh high on Friday, but fell 6% Monday on an analyst downgrade, seeing little ""upside"" given the sharp run-up. (Digital Ally lost 9.2% on Monday. Ambarella, which also supplies chips for GoPro (GPRO) action cameras lost 6.7% as it fell for a third straight session following better-than-expected earnings.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

2509,HD,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
2510,HD,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
2511,HD,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
2512,HD,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
2513,HD,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
2514,HD,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
2515,HD,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
2516,HD,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
2517,HD,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
2518,HD,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
2519,HD,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
2520,HD,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
2521,HD,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
2522,HD,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
2523,HD,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
2524,HD,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
2525,HD,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
2526,HD,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
2527,HD,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
2528,HD,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
2529,HD,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
2530,HD,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
2531,HD,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
2532,HD,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
2533,HD,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
2534,HD,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
2535,HD,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
2536,HD,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
2537,HD,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
2538,HD,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
2539,HD,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
2540,HD,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
2541,HD,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
2542,HD,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
2543,HD,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
2544,HD,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
2545,HD,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
2546,HD,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
2547,HD,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
2548,HD,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
2549,HD,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
2550,HD,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
2551,HD,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
2552,HD,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
2553,HD,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
2554,HD,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
2555,HD,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
2556,HD,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
2557,HD,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
2558,HD,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
2559,HD,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
2560,HD,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
2561,HD,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
2562,HD,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
2563,HD,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
2564,HD,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
2565,HD,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
2566,HD,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
2567,HD,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
2568,HD,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
2569,HD,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
2570,HD,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
2571,HD,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
2572,HD,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
2573,HD,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"
2574,HD,"And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.
"
2575,HD,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500.

Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.

2576,HD,"Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) is the best way to play the recovery in construction markets, according to a recent analyst's initiation report on the highly-rated paint and coatings maker and distributor.In the report, RBC Capital Markets analyst Arun Viswanathanan notes that more than 70% of Sherwin-Williams' sales are tied to U.S. construction.""We expect its industry-leading growth, margins and cash flow generation to continue to expand as construction markets improve due to (the) high correlation between architectural coatings volumes and existing home sales,"" noted Viswanathanan, who rates Sherwin-Williams an outperform.He calls the company the ""pre-eminent"" coatings stock. He expects it will continue to deliver at least 7% sales growth and 15% to 25% earnings per share growth, or around 1.5 times higher than the industry's, in the coming years due to its dominance of the contractor and national accounts channels and its ""high degree of operating leverage.""The maker of several brands, such as its namesake and Dutch Boy, sells its Sherwin-Williams branded products exclusively through a chain of company-operated stores and facilities, while its other brands are sold through mass merchandisers, hardware stores and other distributors.""SHW's 'controlled distribution model' or vast network of dedicated paint stores supports the strongest sales and earnings growth amongst the coatings companies,"" Viswanathanan noted.He estimates 2014 third-quarter earnings will come in at $3.23 a share vs. consensus analyst expectations for $3.20. He anticipates earnings of $8.77 a share for all of 2014 vs. consensus estimate of $8.69. And he expects full-year 2015 earnings of $11 a share, compared with the consensus estimate of $10.62.In a separate initiation report, he rates Valspar (VAL) a sector perform. Valspar makes paints, varnishes and stains for the consumer market. He notes that Valspar is performing well in paints and coatings.However, he adds: ""Its premium brands require greater promotional spending at Lowe's Cos. (LOW) and other retailers.""We are also looking for a stronger recovery in global industrial production for meaningful upside earnings surprises.""Sherwin-Williams is part of IBD's Chemicals-Paints industry group. It has the group's highest Composite rating, 95 out of a possible 99. Valspar follows with a Composite rating of 90.In the Retail/Wholesale Building Products group, Lowe's has a CR of 89, second to rival Home Depot's (HD) 97.

""The fundamental technical reasons wells need fracture conductivity have not changed.""On Monday, Sterne Agee analyst Stephen Gengaro downgraded Carbo to neutral from buy and slashed his price target to 88 from 154.""While we believe new technologies will benefit CRR in 2015+, we are moving to the sidelines in the near term,"" he wrote.But Gengaro is still bullish on new Carbo ceramic proppants like Kryptosphere-HD, which could be used in deep wells.The Chemicals-Specialty group is ranked No. 50 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks. Carbo has a 36 Composite Rating out of a possible 99. IBD's Composite Rating rates stocks in five areas, with extra weight on earnings and stock price strength.

""The company's next-generation firewall has a sustainable technology advantage and sufficient runway to capture 20% of the $11 billion network security market, up from 5% today.""Palo Alto Networks stock was down about 2% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 97.Palo Alto Networks shares are up 73% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the market (up 9%) and its peers (up 9%), with sales up 51% year-over-year in fiscal 2014 that ended in July, Choi said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast 37% growth in fiscal 2015.""However, a number of our reseller contacts are forecasting 50% growth for fiscal 2015 and suggesting bigger deals in the pipeline,"" Choi said.Along with its firewalls, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company offers a subscription model of selling value-added features at a time when there are more high-profile cyber threats and additional demand for cybersecurity products, Choi said.FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives, in a separate research report Monday, said his firm's survey in recent weeks indicates security spending is poised to grow 18% year-over-year in 2014, vs. its prior forecast of 16% to 17% year-over-year.""(That) points to a potentially strong second half of 2014, with healthy momentum heading into 2015,"" Ives said. ""We believe incremental strength is coming from the major security upgrade cycle at enterprises worldwide, which is driving demand for advanced security solutions at a faster pace than we had initially expected, as sophisticated threats (such as the Home Depot (HD) data breach) are catalyzing IT departments to bulk up legacy firewall defenses.""""We are also encouraged by recent data points in the field that indicate growing pipelines and deal flow at security leaders such as Palo Alto Networks, FireEye (FEYE), Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Proofpoint (PFPT) given their strong next-generation security offerings and as larger projects appear to be getting funded,"" Ives said.""Companies with roots outside of traditional security software such as Verint (VRNT) and Splunk (SPLK) are also capitalizing on the rising tide of security spending with differentiated technologies, such as big data analytics, a trend we think will play an increasingly larger role around cybersecurity as hackers bypass traditional defenses and monitoring enterprise data movement/activity becomes another necessary layer of security over the coming years,"" Ives said.In a conference call on Sept. 9 announcing fiscal Q4 earnings, Palo Alto Networks CEO Mark McLaughlin said the company boosted its customer count to more than 19,000 from 13,500 at the beginning of the fiscal year. McLaughlin said its customer base is highly diversified and includes 75 of the Fortune 100 companies and 850 of the Global 2000 companies.Palo Alto Networks reported Q4 revenue grew 59% year-over-year to $178 million, with Q4 billings up 64% in the quarter to $233 million.RELATED:Palo Alto Networks Gets Bevy Of Price Target Hikes.

But it was still up,"" Chen said.After a slowing in homebuilding and construction activity in the first quarter due partly to harsh weather, activity should grow stronger, she says.She cites the recent improvement in the job market, which should help the housing market.Chen expects home sales to be stronger by the year's end, helping boost remodeling spending.The National Association of Homebuilders' Remodeling Market Index for the second quarter, released Thursday, portends a nice pickup in remodeling spending.The index rose 3 points from the previous quarter to 56, regaining the momentum built in 2013.An index above 50 indicates that more remodelers report a rise in market activity compared with the prior quarter.""The recent improvement in the job market has helped restore remodelers' confidence after a dip in the first quarter that was probably in part weather-related,"" NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe said in a statement. ""As homeowners feel more secure about their economic situation, they become more willing to undertake remodeling projects — especially larger, discretionary projects.""The NAHB sees a 3.8% increase in residential remodeling spending in 2014 vs. the meager 0.6% gain in 2013. It projects a 2.4% rise in 2015.New construction activity is also set to improve, watchers say, which is another good sign for the remodeling market.Home sales and construction can have a positive impact on remodeling because many sellers do projects in order to improve the marketability of their homes, and many buyers do remodeling projects after they move in.Bad weather dampened new construction in the first quarter, says Stephen Melman, the NAHB's economic service director. But the forecast for the third and fourth quarters is much better.The NAHB forecasts that all types of housing starts, including single family and multifamily, will rise 11.9% to 1.040 million in 2014. If so, it would be the first time starts rose above 1 million in several years, Melman told IBD.A 10.7% increase in single-family starts is predicted for 2014, followed by a 37.8% gain in 2015 amid an improved job market and pent-up demand.""We're on the right track in new construction in the second half of 2014, with really good momentum,"" Melman said.Home Sales UpRecent key housing data bode well for remodeling spending. In June, existing-home sales rose 2.6% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.04 million, according to the National Association of Realtors.Sales are at the highest pace since October 2013, but still 2.3% below the 5.16-million-unit level a year ago.Housing fundamentals are at least moving in the right direction, says Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.""Inventories are at their highest level in over a year, and price gains have slowed to much more welcoming levels in many parts of the country,"" he said. ""This bodes well for rising home sales in the upcoming months as consumers are provided with more choices.""Meanwhile, rising home values constitute a key driver of remodeling spending.Prices are rising more slowly than a year ago, but a short supply of homes for sale — particularly in the West — is putting upward pressure on prices, Yun says.The median existing-home price for June was 4.3% above a year ago, according to the NAR. This marked the 28th straight month of an annual gain.""Home prices are improving and people are realizing that the home is an appreciating asset they need to preserve and invest in,"" Melman said. ""With new products (such as energy-efficient windows) and home prices increasing, people may be more likely to go ahead and pull the trigger on remodeling projects they had in their back pocket for five years.""Not everybody will be in a position to do that. Melman points to data suggesting that educational debt such as college loans are ""putting a damper on new construction and remodeling.""He says the majority of the people who have this debt are already in their homes and may want to put off remodeling until they pay off that debt.In addition, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Bradley Thomas said certain housing indicators are ""sending mixed signals.""The most important metric for the segment of retail he covers is housing turnover, which consists of new- plus existing-home sales in a month.After a string of double-digit year-over-year gains in 2012 and 2013, trends started to slow, with seven straight months where seasonally adjusted housing turnover has been negative.""For retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Pier 1 Imports (PIR) and La-Z-Boy (LZB), these are metrics that are concerning,"" Thomas said. ""The good news is that comparisons will start to get a little easier in a few months.""

2808,HD,"Several analysts on Friday boosted the target price for specialty chipmaker Ambarella, and the stock touched a new high after the company late Thursday gave Q3 guidance that exceeded Wall Street expectations.Ambarella (AMBA) CFO George Laplante said in a conference call with analysts Thursday that the company expects Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share of 49 cents to 56 cents and revenue of $60 million to $64 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 37 cents and and $51.7 million.Deutsche Bank on Friday raised its price target on Ambarella stock to 35 from 27. Ascendiant Capital Markets raised its target to 42 from 37, while Topeka Capital Markets raised its target to 43 from 33.Ambarella stock was up nearly 4% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 37.Earlier, Ambarella stock, which has been on the IBD 50 for months, touched an all-time high of 39.16.Ambarella supplies chips for high-definition cameras used in such fields as sports, security and drone flights.Laplante told analysts that Q3 earnings projections partly hinge on expected strong sales in consumer products, ""including the automobile in certain regions, home security and quadcopters.""""I think sports cameras normally build for the holiday season,"" Laplante said. ""So I think it's across multiple markets. Our wearable sports camera and IP (Internet protocol) security markets, both professional and consumer, are expected to increase both sequentially and year over year. The automobile market revenues reflect increases in Korea and China, partially offset by softness in the Russian market.""Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang said that sales growth ""continues across all geographic regions,"" but added, ""the strongest growth was in China.""He also said, ""During the second quarter, many of our leading professional IP camera customers began volume commercial shipping of the 4K (new resolution standard for digital cinema and computer graphics) or ultra-HD cameras that were announced at ISC West 2014 Security Exposition in April.""""I think the 4K video has become more popular, and we believe over time all of our markets will move to 4K,"" Wang said.In the wearable sports camera market, Ambarella's Q2 sales were driven by market leader GoPro (GPRO), ""with its highly successful white, silver and black Hero 3-Plus"" camera models, Wang said.""We believe this (sports camera) market will continue to grow as consumers discover more applications for hands-free cameras beyond just action sports,"" Wang said. ""In the unmanned aerial vehicle or quadcopter market, manufacturers are increasingly offering integrated high-definition cameras as aerial video recording becomes a killer app for these products.""Ambarella expects to continue selling current products to another key customer, Dropcam, Wang said. Google's (GOOGL) Nest Labs said in June that it would acquire Dropcam for $555 million.""We are talking to the Nest management as well as the Dropcam management on the new product line and the new map, and hopefully we can develop a new product line in the future with them,"" Wang said.Dropcam and GoPro cameras remain on Amazon.com's (AMZN) list of its top five bestselling products, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said in a research note Tuesday. He said that roughly 25% of Ambarella's revenue comes from GoPro, which made its IPO in June at 24 and peaked above 57 on Wednesday.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Ambarellareportedhttp://news.investors.com/technology/090414-716123-ambarella-q2-eps-jumps-beats-expectations.htm Q2 EPS ex items of 37 cents for the three months ending July 31, up 42%, on $47 million in revenue, up 24.6%, beating views.GoPro stock was up nearly 5% in midday trading Friday, near 55.50.

2832,HD,"Digital Ally's (DGLY) stock soared Thursday after the camera maker's contract with the Michigan state police was expanded with an order valued at more than $1.1 million.The contract now includes Digital Ally's DVM-800 in-car video system, which the state recently tested and evaluated before it decided to ink the deal, and VuLink, which connects the in-car and body-worn video streams.Shares for the company vaulted more than 25% on the stock market today, adding to a massive rally that has seen the stock more than quadruple in two weeks after inquiries about its body cameras rose following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.""Many of our current and potential customers are evaluating our new DVM-800 in-car-video system and FirstVU HD body-worn cameras, together with the patented VuLink interconnectivity device,"" said CEO Stanton Ross in a statement Thursday.""The test results have been positive, and we believe a majority of customers that have undertaken such test and evaluation programs will select our total package, which addresses the need for secure video and audio evidence from many different viewpoints as incidents in the field unfold.""Digital Ally has worked with Michigan's state police force for several years, and the latest contract addition puts its total value at $6.5 million.Taser (TASR), which also produces body cameras for law enforcement, has seen a more modest stock rally since the Ferguson shooting, but a JPMorgan Chase analyst said last week that Taser is well positioned because it already has ties with many law enforcement agencies with its stun guns.

2835,HD,"Retailers are expecting sunnier sales ahead, but winter's gloom hasn't fully retreated, a new report says.Retail Metrics early Thursday issued an upbeat report on the retail segment, noting that retailers are coming off their strongest monthly comparisons on a year-over-year basis in almost three years. Brown Shoe (BWS), Macy's (M) and others all recently indicated improving trends in April.Macy's, for example, said that warm weather helped boost April sales. ""We see this as a good sign moving forward into the second quarter,"" the retailer said.Based on the strong April showing, the Street is forecasting a strong 3.4% May same-store sales gain, Retail Metrics said.But just last week, Retail Metrics noted that Home Depot (HD), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and other major retailers all missed first-quarter earnings estimates. The market tracker had heard from 61 retailers, and just 38% had recorded positive surprises, while 48% reported earnings worse than expected.But after a brutal winter across much of the nation, the warmer weather drove demand for spring-related merchandise, ""while brightening consumers' moods during the month"" of April, Retail Metrics President Ken Perkins said.""Things have finally started to heat up a bit for retailers,"" Perkins said in the latest report Thursday.Despite big improvement, however, earnings guidance for retailers is still skewed more negative than usual, he says.In addition to nice weather, retailers boosted promotions to clear out winter merchandise and make way for spring and summer goods.Macy's was up 1% in Thursday afternoon trading on the stock market today.Brown Shoes was down 3% after closing 11% higher Wednesday on strong Q1 earnings. Home Depot edged up fractionally and Dick's Sporting Goods was roughly unchanged.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar

"
2854,HD,"In 1978 Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank were hardware executives with no jobs but a big idea.
"
2855,HD,"The two men had been fired from a hardware chain owned by Daylin Inc., a retailer being steered out of bankruptcy by the late turnaround specialist Sanford Sigoloff. But they had something else in mind that turned out to be bigger and better. Marcus and Blank joined with investment banker Ken Langone and merchandising guru Pat Farrah to pursue a vision of a one-stop home-improvement store for the do-it-yourselfer. On June 22, 1979, they opened their first two Home Depot (HD) stores in Atlanta.
"
2856,HD,"What followed was nothing less than a revolution in the home-improvement market, as Home Depot rolled out mega-stores stocking thousands of plumbing, paint, electrical and other products. Home Depot grew to become the sixth-largest retailer in the world, with 2,262 stores and nearly $79 billion in annual revenue in its latest fiscal year. And it became one of the great stocks of the past 30 years.
"
2857,HD,"Home Depot stock, which was already up sharply from its IPO a few years earlier, surged 36,074% from its August 1985 low to its all-time high just last month.
"
2858,HD,"Unfilled Niche
"
2859,HD,"""I'd like to say we were geniuses, but we weren't,"" Marcus told IBD in a 1998 interview in which he described the company's inception. ""People came in and were hungry for (do-it-yourself) information. Arthur and I looked at each other and said, 'Here's a niche we can fill.'""
"
2860,HD,"Home Depot's retailing innovation was built on three pillars.
"
2861,HD,"With the stores' enormous product selection, homeowners no longer had to shop at the hardware store, the paint shop, appliance centers, nurseries and other specialty retailers to complete a project. A single Home Depot had all that and a lumber yard.
"
2862,HD,"The first stores sprawled across some 60,000 square feet each, resembling warehouses more than typical stores. Each Home Depot stocked 25,000 products, much more than the average hardware store at that time. To create the impression of fuller stores, the company stacked empty boxes as high as it could.
"
2863,HD,"Today, the average Home Depot store weighs in at 105,000 square feet and some 35,000 products.
"
2864,HD,"Size wasn't the only difference. Home Depot went after the do-it-yourself market, helping customers do their home-improvement projects with a sales staff that could share knowledge about plumbing, painting and other skills. Eventually, it started offering how-to clinics for customers. The supersize stores also caught on with contractors.
"
2865,HD,"Good Timing
"
2866,HD,"Value pricing added a third major element to the company's strategy and gave Home Depot an unmatched advantage.
"
2867,HD,"Marcus and Blank were in the right place at the right time. In the 1980s, the baby-boom generation was moving into its prime homebuying years. Relatively high home prices raised demand for fixer-uppers. And finding dependable and affordable contractors frustrated many homeowners.
"
2868,HD,"Some rivals could figure out how to do two of the three planks of Home Depot's strategy but not all three, says Craig Menear, president of Home Depot's U.S. retail operations and a 17-year company veteran.
"
2869,HD,"The company has become the largest home-improvement chain in the world. It is also the fifth-largest retailer in the U.S., according to the National Retail Federation's U.S. sales ranking for 2013. NRF puts Home Depot as number six in the world.
"
2870,HD,"From its base in Atlanta, Home Depot started expanding in the Sunbelt states and then to the Northeast in the late 1980s.
"
2871,HD,"The company's international expansion started in Canada with the acquisition of Aikenhead's home-improvement centers in 1994. In 2001, it acquired Total HOME, gaining a presence in Mexico. Today, Home Depot has 286 stores in those countries.
"
2872,HD,"One of its most significant acquisitions came in 2006, when it bought Hughes Supply for $3.2 billion. The deal gave Home Depot a construction-materials supplier, which the company used to expand sales to professional contractors.
"
2873,HD,"Success spawned imitators and other new competitors. When Menear started with Home Depot in 1997, the company was facing competition from Lowe's (LOW), which has its own brand of big-box home-improvement stores.
"
2874,HD,"""We pretty much stayed with our strategy,"" Menear said. One difference was that Home Depot had a heavier focus on professional contractors.
"
2875,HD,"As a stock, Home Depot has had five major advances in its history. The first went from its first day of trading in 1981 to September 1983, when shares soared about 1,800%.
"
2876,HD,"The second climb of 300% was from August 1985 to August 1987.
"
2877,HD,"The third — and best — was from the low in the 1987 stock market crash through 1992. Home Depot shareholders grew about 2,760% richer in that span. Annual earnings surged 211%, 82%, 31%, 42% and 42% in the 1987-91 growth spurt.
"
2878,HD,"The 1980s and 1990s were decades of huge growth for the company. Home Depot was posting solid earnings and expanding its market share thanks to ""the twin engines of low costs and a boom in home improvement,"" an IBD story in April 1991 noted. Manufacturers supplied the chain directly, which helped Home Depot keep costs down.
"
2879,HD,"The fourth great stock surge was from late 1995 to the market top in 2000. That was a 760% boom.
"
2880,HD,"The fifth big rise has come since the 2009 market low; Home Depot stock has surged about 350%.
"
2881,HD,"Oddly, the stock did not track the housing boom of the 2000s. The stock just got dragged along with the bear market of 2000-03. Shares plummeted more than 70% from the April 2000 peak to a bottom in January 2003. By comparison, the Case-Shiller 20-city home-price index climbed 33% from the second quarter of 2000 to the fourth quarter of 2002.
"
2882,HD,"From a 2003 low to November 2004, Home Depot shares more than doubled. The stock, however, peaked long before the housing boom did. The Case-Shiller index topped in the second quarter of 2006, after more than doubling from Q2 of 2000.
"
2883,HD,"Management took some heat. In January 2007, CEO Robert Nardelli resigned with a controversial $210 million severance package. Nardelli, critics said, came to Home Depot from General Electric (GE) with too little knowledge of the retail business, and his GE-style strategies didn't translate well to Home Depot. He was replaced by Frank Blake, another ex-GE executive as well as a former U.S. deputy energy secretary who had joined Home Depot in 2002. Blake remains at the helm today.
"
2884,HD,"A strategic shift led the company to shed its wholesale business and refocus on retail, Menear says. Those businesses were sold to a team of private equity groups in 2007 for $10.3 billion. Those investors took the company public last year — what is now HD Supply (HDS).
"
2885,HD,"Home Depot earnings declined from 2007 to 2010, when the housing market saw a huge contraction. Profits started growing again in 2011. In August of that year, the stock began the major advance that continues today, ahead of the recovery in real estate values that began in 2012.
"
2886,HD,"A few years ago, another significant change in strategy occurred when the company realized online shopping was growing.
"
2887,HD,"""We recognized at that time that there were several things we needed to do,"" Menear said. That included working closer with suppliers and steering customers at stores to find more merchandise at Homedepot.com. The company's e-commerce has expanded to 600,000 products, about 17 times more than the average store's. Online sales surged more than 50% last year and account for about 3.5% of total revenue.
"
2888,HD,"The baby boomers who helped Home Depot grow in its early decades have grown older, which has resulted in another shift in strategy, from do-it-yourself to the do-it-for-me business.
"
2889,HD,"""You have a portion of the population who is saying, 'Hey, you know what ... maybe I'm at the age where I no longer want to do it myself; I want somebody to do it for me,'"" said Menear.
"
2890,HD,"That has led to a relatively new growth focus on the installation business.
"
2891,HD,"""We also are working on product that's simpler, easier to use, that makes the project go faster — and you can build it with more confidence, for younger customers,"" he added.In 1978 Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank were hardware executives with no jobs but a big idea.The two men had been fired from a hardware chain owned by Daylin Inc., a retailer being steered out of bankruptcy by the late turnaround specialist Sanford Sigoloff.

"
2910,HD,"The stars have aligned in favor of a warm economic climate for home remodeling.An improved jobs picture, rising home values and calls for a pickup in economic growth are among the confidence boosters experts see driving bright prospects for remodeling spending this year.""The macroeconomic environment is positive for remodeling,"" said Celia Chen, a senior director covering the housing industry for Moody's Analytics.""Job growth is accelerating, and that means more households will have the means to do a remodel,"" Chen told IBD via by email. ""Mortgage rates are low, even though they have increased, and rising home values will also give more households the means to spend on remodeling.""Tight inventories of ""desirable"" homes for sale, she adds, may also cause some homeowners to decide to stay put and improve the homes they live in rather than move to another house.Coming Up With The MoneyChen expects job gains to run at an average of 250,000 per month in this year's second half compared with 200,000 per month in 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.She sees real gross domestic product growth rising to 2.6% in 2014 vs. 1.9% in 2013.Rising home values constitute a key driver of remodeling spending.So much so that Frank Blake, CEO of home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD), cited rising home prices as a company growth booster, on a May 20 conference call.""Home price appreciation is one of the important drivers of our business, as homeowners get more comfortable that ... they'll be able to recoup that investment,"" Blake said.""That's a big tailwind for us, and we've seen continued home price appreciation even during some softening of other housing indicators.""Strong year-over-year home price growth continued in most metro areas in the first quarter, though with rises smaller than the prior quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors.The national median price for existing single-family homes was $191,600 in the 2014 first quarter, up 8.6% from a year earlier. That compares with a 10.1% rise in the median price in the fourth quarter.Median price growth moderated in April, according to a NAR report out May 22. The median existing-home price for all housing types for the month reached $201,700, a 5.2% rise from a year earlier. That was less of the increase seen in the first quarter, according to the NAR's latest data.""Current price data suggest a trend of slower growth, which bodes well for preserving favorable affordability conditions in much of the country,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a press release. He forecasts home prices will rise 6.4% from a year earlier this year and 4.2% in 2015.The continuing home-price rise is a ""good sign for remodeling,"" said Abbe Will, a research analyst for Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. ""Homeowners just feel better about investing in their homes when the value is improving. It's hard to justify when prices are declining if it's a discretionary project like for the kitchen or bathroom.""How Homeowners DecideA survey by Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith released April 25 found that homeowners' remodeling decisions are influenced by home price appreciation, he told IBD. Specifically, 53% of those polled said that if their home is increasing in value it raises the likelihood they'll embark on a remodeling project.""I think it is a key driver,"" said Keith. ""It's not necessarily the rate of appreciation (that's meaningful). It's more the general confidence that homeowners have that home prices are actually increasing.""Another macro driver of remodeling is access to credit, says Chen.Mortgage rates hit new 2014 lows in a Freddie Mac (FMCC) survey this week. The 30-year fixed-rate loan averaged 4.12%, but that's up from 3.81% a year earlier. Freddie Mac forecasts the 30-year mortgage to rise and end 2014 around 4.6%.""Although conditions are generally positive, rising mortgage interest rates have made remodeling a little more expensive than last year,"" said Chen.Tapping Home EquityChen said lending remains tight but has ""loosened a little bit, at least for home equity installment loans."" At the end of 2013, about 65% of home equity installment loan originations were for households with a 700 plus credit score vs. 71% in the fourth quarter of 2012.In a survey by Keith out April 11, HELOCs made the biggest jump as a method of payment to fund sizable projects, with 14% of those polled planning to use a HELOC to finance part of large-ticket projects, up from 9% in previous surveys.""We are not ready to conclude that HELOCs will start to grow in the near future, but as home values have continued to improve and more people again have equity in their homes, it seems more likely that more homeowners will start to utilize HELOCs to fund remodeling projects in the future,"" Keith wrote. ""If this occurs it could be a nice driver to future remodeling spending.""A hefty 63% of respondents who intended to do a big-ticket project planned on using cash savings to pay for some of the costs, says Keith. Some 39% of those polled by Keith planned on using a credit card.Chen says remodel spending this year is up from last year. After accounting for inflation, investment in residential improvements rose 3% from a year earlier in the 2014 first quarter, she says, citing Bureau of Economic Analysis data.The latest Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity, released by Harvard's Joint Center in April, shows the outlook for home remodeling spending as ""very strong,"" says Will. The LIRA shows a 9.4% increase in annual spending on home improvement in 2014 from a year earlier. That would compare with a 4% annual rise in 2013, she adds, citing Census Bureau figures.

"
2929,HD,"Harsh weather during the fourth quarter could weigh on results at home improvement retailers Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), both of which are scheduled to report Q4 earnings in the coming week.No. 1 Home Depot, due to report before the open Tuesday, is expected to log its first quarterly revenue decline in years. The Atlanta-based company is also expected to report a single-digit EPS gain after years of double-digit increases.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters look for Home Depot to post earnings of 71 cents a share, up 7% from the prior year. That would end a run of five straight quarters of 23% or better EPS growth for the Atlanta-based company. Revenue is seen falling 2% to $17.9 billion.Estimates are a little brighter for No. 2 Lowe's, which reports before the open Wednesday. Analysts expect earnings of 31 cents a share, a gain of 19% from the previous year. Revenue should come in at $11.7 billion, up 6% from a year earlier.If those numbers hold up, Lowe's will have produced three straight quarters of revenue and earnings growth for the first time since 2012.Wall Street will keep a close eye on the performances to get a gauge of how the U.S. construction market is doing, as both companies rely heavily on construction growth for business.On that front, both retailers have gotten a boost from recovering housing, though Home Depot has had a better go of it.While Home Depot has delivered consistent double-digit earnings and single-digit sales growth the past couple of years, Lowe's has reported flat or lower earnings three times since the April 2012 quarter. The Mooresville, N.C.-based company has also posted lower or flat sales growth three times since then.During last year's fiscal third quarter, Lowe's earnings came in slightly below views while sales were slightly above views. Home Depot easily beat Q3 expectations on sales and earnings.Fourth-quarter results are likely to take a hit from a slowdown in homebuilding.According to data released last week by the Commerce Department, new-home starts in January fell 16% from the previous month and 2% from the prior year. That came on top of a monthly decline in December as well.Cold, snowy weather in many parts of the country likely played a part in the slowdown.Also last week, the National Association of Home Builders said sentiment among builders fell sharply in February. The NAR's monthly sentiment index declined to 46 from 56, the biggest drop in the survey's history, which dates to 1985.A reading of 50 separates positive and negative sentiment. It was the first time since May that the index fell below 50.Home Depot has an IBD Composite Rating of 52 and an EPS rating of 92. Its shares set a record high of 82.57 in early January but have fallen about 6% since then.Lowe's has an IBD Composite Rating of 40 and an EPS Rating of 85. Its shares are down about 10% since setting a record high of 52.08 in mid-November.

Only 34% stated that the size of the home value increase impacts their home improvement activity.""All-in, we view this as a positive sign for home improvement spending in the next 12 months,"" Keith said.""Home prices appear poised to rise for several years,"" he wrote.While the Case-Shiller 10-City index has been flat sequentially the last four months, the January increase was still up 13.5% year-over-year, he wrote.He expects year-over-year price appreciation to slow this year, but notes that the index is still 20% off its 2006 peak and around 8% short of its 27-year trend line.That means it could grow at a 5% annual rate for four-and-a-half years ""before getting back to the peak,"" he projects. ""Keeping pressure on housing prices is the tight supply of homes,"" he said.The tight supply, he adds, ""will keep home prices on the rise for the foreseeable future.""

2995,HD,"Ultra high-definition TVs, wearable computers and sensors, and consumer 3D printers are among the products expected to make waves next week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.Officially known as the International CES, it is expected to attract 150,000 attendees, more than 3,200 exhibitors and take up 1.9 million net square feet of exhibit space.The annual show officially runs Tuesday through Friday, but pre-show events start Sunday.Keynote speakers at the 2014 CES include Audi Chairman Rupert Stadler, Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich, Sony (SNE) CEO Kazuo Hirai, Cisco Systems (CSCO) CEO John Chambers and Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Marissa Mayer.The latest big-screen televisions are always a draw at CES. This year, the focus will be on Ultra HD, or 4K, TVs that have four times the resolution of today's HD sets.""The tech industry got us all to upgrade to HD TVs. Now they want to make us move to super HD, 4K televisions,"" Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, told IBD.4K TV For $1,000Ultra HD televisions have been at CES the past two years, but were prohibitively expensive.This year, manufacturers will debut more reasonably priced 4K TVs. At least one vendor will show off a $1,000 Ultra HD TV, but most will have sets in the $2,500 to $3,500 range, he says.Today, 4K sets go for $3,500 to $12,000, Bajarin says.The consumer electronics industry is positioning Ultra HD as an evolution of TV, just as HD was, says Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News.The industry's last attempt to spark an upgrade cycle for television was 3D TV, but that failed.The current lack of 4K content for Ultra HD TVs is a problem, Costello says. Sony and Samsung are offering home media servers with Ultra HD content.But Blu-ray Disc backers have yet to announce a standard for delivering 4K on packaged media.""The big question for Ultra HD is whether anyone will announce an Ultra HD streaming service at the show,"" Costello said. Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) have announced general plans to stream their original shows in 4K video.LG, Samsung and perhaps others will be showing off curved-screen TVs at CES this year. LG will display a 105-inch curved-screen set that is ""stunning,"" Bajarin said. Samsung reportedly will have a similar TV at the show.""They're trying to deliver on the concept of a true cinematic experience,"" Bajarin said. TV makers also want to show that they can be innovative with design.One problem with curved-screen TVs is that you can't hang them on the wall, Costello says.Ultra HD and curved-screen TVs are likely to help brick-and-mortar retailers such as Best Buy (BBY) because consumers will want to check them out in person.""It helps the (consumer electronics) industry when people go to stores,"" she said.Another major trend at CES will be wearable devices for fitness, health monitoring and computing.Digital health applications for wearables are seen as a growth market. ""The aging baby boomer population has gotten health conscious after all the years of abusing their bodies,"" Bajarin said.Fitness Makes A RunNike's (NKE) FuelBand, Jawbone's Up and Fitbit are a few of the better-known wearable fitness products on the market. These products are designed to get you moving and track your progress day after day. Dozens more will be shown at the upcoming CES.Other wearable devices are for health monitoring — checking such things as blood pressure and blood glucose levels. Some will have a fashion component with sensors embedded into clothing.Wearable computing devices such as smartwatches and headsets will make a splash at the show too. They include smartwatches that wirelessly connect with your smartphone to display alerts and other information. Google's (GOOG) Google Glass headset has inspired imitators. Epson and Vuzix will be among those showing augmented reality headsets.Last year, 3D printers from 3D Systems (DDD) and MakerBot, now a unit of Stratasys (SSYS), made a big impression at CES. They're back along with competitors, including makers of low-cost printers.Two 3D printers costing $499 will be shown at CES, Bajarin says. At that price, they're likely to appeal to mainstream hobbyists.Other printers at CES will target the professional and high-end consumer markets with systems in the $999 to $1,299 range, he says.Other products likely to make headlines at CES are self-driving cars, connected cars, Bluetooth speakers and home automation technologies.

3019,HD,"Wearable camera makers Taser International (TASR) and Digital Ally (DGLY) are getting a close-up viewing by investors and analysts as their share prices took off this week.Digital Ally shares soared 90% on Tuesday as inquiries about its FirstVU HD Body Camera rose amid the civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo. The jump came even though the company hadn't reported any new orders.On Wednesday, Digital Ally did issue a report saying inquiries from law enforcement agencies increased dramatically this week, pushing its shares up as much as 25% midday.But some observers said its stock was in a bubble.TheStreet.com, for example, noted increased interest in its cameras but said it put a sell rating on Digital Ally.""This is driven by multiple weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover,"" the analyst said.Digital Ally reversed hard and fell 18% by the end of trading on Wednesday.Phoenix-like, it rose 35% by early afternoon Thursday before easing.Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase analyst Paul Coster said he thinks Taser is well positioned to gain in the on-officer video market because it has developed ties with many law enforcement agencies with its electronic control devices.Some 16,000 of the 18,000 police departments in the U.S. are Taser stun gun customers. Large departments such as Las Vegas and New Orleans have also adopted its Evidence.com evidence collection and storage system. Taser has paired data from its on-body cameras with its Evidence.com program.In a recent report, Coster cited data showing police agencies that have tried or deployed on-officer cameras like those sold by Digital Ally and Taser saw a 59% reduction in ""use of force"" by officers, and a 93% drop in litigation expenses.Taser shares were up 1.6% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, Thursday.Elsewhere in the Security/Safety products group, top U.S. gun makers Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith & Wesson Holding (SWHC) were up less than 1% and down 1%, respectively.Gunmakers as a group have been going through a slow period. Sales generally increase after an incident such as the Newtown, Conn., massacre in December 2012 and fall off in the months afterward.Some people buy firearms for self-defense purposes.

3021,HD,"Retail sales grew at the fastest pace in 18 months during March, suggesting that consumers and the economy may be finally emerging from winter hibernation.
"
3022,HD,"Sales rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1% from February, the Commerce Department said, more than the 0.7% expected. It was the strongest month-to-month gain since September 2012.
"
3023,HD,"Auto sales, which rose 3.1%, helped propel sales overall. But even with auto sales stripped out, the resulting 0.7% increase was the best since February 2013. Most sectors saw a rise, and February data were revised up strongly.
"
3024,HD,"Retail sales figures can be volatile from month to month but have been trending higher the past few years. Economists watch the data closely, as consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.
"
3025,HD,"Other recent economic data offer convincing reasons for the March bump. Aggregate wages rose 0.7%, the Labor Department said earlier in the month. Gasoline prices fell, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, giving consumers a little extra discretionary money. Stocks and home values both rose, contributing to a wealth effect, he says.

3027,HD,"Debating Winter's Impact
"
3028,HD,"After two months of harsh winter weather, says National Retail Federation chief economist Jack Kleinhenz, those consumers were releasing some pent-up demand when they went shopping in March.
"
3029,HD,"""Improving economic conditions and consumer confidence should push consumers to return to spending habits this spring,"" he said in a statement. ""We remain optimistic that retail sales will continue their positive march this spring.""
"
3030,HD,"With the winter in the rearview mirror, a combination of factors bode well for the economy in 2014. Hoffman thinks the second quarter will compensate for the weakness in the first, and the second half will mark a ""break out of the 2% zone that we've been in for years.""
"
3031,HD,"Some economists disagree on how much the weather has impacted the economy. Hoffman thinks that weather as an explanation for sluggish activity in January and February ""hits the nail on the head"" and that the thaw in March proves it.
"
3032,HD,"Jeffrey Rosen, chief economist for Briefing.com, is more skeptical. Internet sales — a category that the weather is not likely to influence — rose 1.7% on the month in March, he noted. ""I've always been in the camp that says winter was overblown,"" Rosen said.
"
3033,HD,"Rosen thinks that wage growth accounts for most of the sales gains. The length of the workweek and hours worked rose, the latter to a multiyear high. It means that businesses will need to step up hiring and boost hours and wages more than they have in the past few years. 
"
3034,HD,"""We've had low growth and businesses at record high profits, suggesting they can run lean,"" he said. ""But in the end, consumers can only buy if they have income growth.""
"
3035,HD,"But other economists believe that sluggishness in the winter will result in pent-up demand being pushed forward into 2014.
"
3036,HD,"Sal Guatieri, senior economist with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients that the March data bring expectations of spending growth from a 2.0% gain in Q1 to ""a complete recovery"" in Q2, setting up an annualized 3 1/2% increase in 2014. That will help boost GDP, Guatieri noted.

3037,HD,"Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that the rosy March data were received with relief. ""It's a story we all hoped would be in the numbers,"" he said.
"
3038,HD,"""We knew that weather depressed January and held back February, and we were looking for that rebound in last week's chain-store sales numbers. But the weak weather-induced chain-store sales numbers didn't make the case as strongly and as convincingly as the retail sales did today.""
"
3039,HD,"He says the Commerce Department report showed nice gains in retail sales in several store categories, such as general merchandise, clothing and building materials.
"
3040,HD,"Sales at general-merchandise stores, which include giants such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), increased 1.9%, while building-materials and garden-supply stores, such as Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), rose 1.8%.
"
3041,HD,"Another housing-related category, home-furnishings stores, posted a 1% gain. It was likely good news for retailers such as Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), Restoration Hardware Holdings (RH) and Williams-Sonoma (WSM).
"
3042,HD,"Sales at clothing and accessories stores, which include giant apparel retailer Gap (GPS) and women's clothier Ann (ANN), rose 1% in pent-up demand from the prior two months.
"
3043,HD,"The Discount Dilemma
"
3044,HD,"Two big-ticket consumer questions remain. Auto sales bounced back nicely in March, to an annualized 16.4 million pace, the fastest in more than seven years. But automakers had to offer deep discounts to entice consumers in March. Still, most economists think that while the pace will ease a bit, it will stay strong, since the average age of cars on the road remains high. Hoffman expects sales of 16 million in 2014.
"
3045,HD,"The housing market is another question. Rosen said that the combination of higher interest rates and higher home prices is ""concerning"" in its impact on demand. Declining sales mean less demand for construction and less price appreciation for current homeowners. It also hits retail sales, since homebuying tends to lead to increased demand for home furnishings, building materials and electronics.
"
3046,HD,"Still, the March pop in retail spending jibes with other brightening economic data. Consumer sentiment rose to a nine-month high last week. Producer prices also rose faster than expected in March, a positive sign of more demand in the economy.
"
3047,HD,"Even mortgage-purchase applications rose 3.0% in the week ended April 4, the third straight week of gains and a possible sign that winter's grip on the housing market may be easing. Homebuying is ""the most weather-sensitive of all,"" Hoffman said.

"
3068,HD,"July, according to Archie Comics. He'll go out good, saving someone. Which is swell.But is this really necessary in a soiled age of cynicism, non-heroes and non-role models, lying leaders and downright criminals? It's already hard enough being a parent with all the unwholesome temptations at hand. Must we inevitably give up every enduring symbol of hope and good and fun for a one-month publicity splash?Comics are a business, of course. They need hype and plot twists. Chances are we would not be writing this tribute if the fictitious Archie was still helping old ladies cross the street in Riverdale on his way to share a soda -- KRAAK! -- with Veronica, Betty, Reggie and Jughead.On one level, comics are just comics, a momentary entertainment and pastime. Archetype teen Archie caught in the timeless struggle between blonde and brunette.But on another level comics are an ongoing cultural backdrop that unites, instructs and reflects generations with common stories and characters experiencing what readers have experienced -- or wish to. The continuing popularity of heroic movies speaks to this contemporary need, even a hunger for inspiration.Witness the cheers when Marvel's Captain America observes, I just need to do what's right. Not a bad popcorn lesson in a political era when so many public figures just do whatever they can get away with.Archie's looming, ill-timed passing got us thinking about the ongoing lives of other comic characters. And how we could ruin them too. Whatever happened to Dick Tracy, for instance?Turns out, Detective Tracy is in a seniors home outside Kalamazoo.His wrist-radio was the precursor of cellphones.

3069,HD,"Lumber Liquidators (LL) debuted in 2007 — a tough year for IPOs.The company also took on a challenging piece of the flooring trade, going up against national retailers such Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), as well as smaller flooring providers long established in their local markets.But a gutted economy and toppled housing market weakened many local players, putting market share up for grabs. High-end consumers recovered rapidly; homeowners looked for remodeling solutions beyond the confines of the national retailers' catalogs.Lumber launched its winning run in March 2012. From its initial breakout at 22.95 through the end of that year, shares rose 130%. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 18, 2013, the stock added 127%.Investors trying to hop aboard at the start of 2013 found the early going a bit rough.Shares formed a shallow cup with handle in November through January. The handle gave a 57.34 buy point during the second week in January. The market was in a confirmed uptrend. Lumber's fundamental vital signs were in order. The stock broke out in heavy trade on Jan. 24.Easy as pie.Shares made slow progress for about a month, rising 14%, then dived in heavy volume to test support at their 10-week moving average. The pullback stopped 6% below the initial buy point, but didn't trigger the 8% loss sell rule.With a loss after six weeks, investors might have sold the stock to roll the capital into stronger performers. After all, a breakout gain that reaches 10% or more should generally not be allowed to turn into a loss.But on Feb. 26, the stock regained support in heavy trade. It remained in buying range for several sessions, offering a chance to get back on board. IBD highlighted it in boldface in both the NYSE Stocks On The Move and Timesaver Tables on Jan. 31.In the next four weeks, Lumber Liquidators climbed 25% above its initial buy point. The stock's third rebound from 10-week support was the clincher. It soared 23% in the week ended April 26, giving investors a cushion to ride out the final leg of the run.The uptrend took a hit Sept. 27 on news that federal investigators had raided the company's offices, investigating alleged import violations. The rally broke decisively Nov. 22, when a short-seller questioned links between gross margin performance and the alleged illegal imports. Such drops gave a signal to take profits.

3119,HD,"Although some in the media toss Home Depot (HD) into the same bag as housing stocks, the retail-sector stock isn't a perfect fit there.The last major peak in housing stocks (July 2005) didn't coincide with the Retail/Wholesale-Building Products' peak (March 2006). Recently, the homebuilder stocks suffered a five-month skid, while Home Depot and its industry group advanced — as did the major stock indexes.For investors, this means your focus should be on the price and volume action of the stock market and of Home Depot itself (and its fundamentals).Home Depot's earnings picture is strong. Quarterly EPS advanced 23%, 34%, 28% and most recently 23%. Revenue grew 5%, 14%, 7% and 9%. The 7% sales growth in fiscal Q1 ended in April is somewhat misleading. The year-ago quarter had an extra week. Adjusted for that, sales growth would've been 9%.The Street expects fiscal 2014 ending in January to deliver 20% earnings growth on a 5% revenue pop. In fiscal 2015, earnings are expected to grow 18% on 4.6% revenue growth. Recent revisions have been upward.Ideally, an investor would like to see stronger revenue growth. The company last delivered a double-digit percentage in annual revenue growth in fiscal 2006.After-tax margin has risen on a year-ago basis for at least 15 consecutive quarters.The quarterly dividend is 39 cents a share, a more than 50% increase over the past two years. The annualized payout is 2.1% vs. 2.49% for the S&P 500.The chart should give investors some pause. The stock is working on a double-bottom base, according to MarketSmith's pattern-recognition technology. The potential entry is 81.33 unless the stock adds a handle, which could be near.A significant drawback is that Home Depot's pattern is fourth stage.Although funds lightened their overall stake by 3% in Q2, Fidelity Contrafund increased its position 38%.

They might get bored easily. They often daydream and tend to have powerful spikes in energy.Life in a classroom or a cubicle can be a drag for the ADD/ADHD sort. If those with ADD/ADHD stay sharp, though, they can have extraordinary careers.Count among those with ADD/ADHD Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Kinko's (FDX) founder Paul Orfalea and David Neeleman, who launched JetBlue (JBLU).""There seems to be a consistently higher level of creativity, a higher level of intelligence among people with ADD,"" said Kevin Ross Emery, author of  ""Managing the Gift Of Your ADD/HD Child.""The world has long benefited from great leaders who, Emery says, exhibited ADD/ADHD characteristics. Try composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and car pioneer Henry Ford. ""I look at this as a gift, that, yes, has some challenges,"" Emery told IBD.Avoid this mistake: using ADD/ADHD as an excuse not to pursue dreams.""Once we relate to it as disabled, we become disabled,"" Emery said. ""We find excuses not to do things. It's easy to become lazy.""Do you have ADD/ADHD? Excel by working in a different way:• Take breathers. ""If you need to do something that is going to take a long period of time or intense concentration, start by breaking it up into smaller pieces,"" Emery said.Exercise — even a stroll around the department or block — helps.Or dig into a completely different project for a half-hour, then return to the original task.• Book it. ""By setting short, 20- to 40-minute appointments with myself to make calls, write 600-word articles or finish reports for my growth-consulting work, I'm able to get much more done,"" said Mark Faust, an executive consultant and author of ""Growth or Bust!""He was diagnosed with ADD as an adult but learned how to harness its creative benefits on the job. ""Both ADD and ADHD can be transformed into a strength,"" he said.• Move and groove. Swimming, running, walking, rowing or other repetitive physical activities can up your focus, Emery finds. He calls them moving meditations. ""You are engaging your body, but your mind goes to another place,"" he said.• Feed your brain. ""ADHD can be debilitating if you are on a bad diet,"" Emery cautioned.To still your mind and body, he recommends cutting back on caffeine, alcohol and sugar. • Find the finish line. Due dates help Faust stay on task when he's tempted to go off-track. ""Because of a deadline, I was able to write 90% of my 50,000-word book in two weeks,"" he said.• Mark it down. Checklists, notebooks and sticky notes help people with ADD/ADHD remember details and finish each step so they can accomplish their tasks.""They have so much going on in their heads that it needs to be organized,"" Emery said. ""Both ADD individuals and the people around them must learn to put things in writing.""Managers with ADD/ADHD employees and those who live with them should remember to write a list of the steps involved in accomplishing an important task the first time.""Put it on something that they have a habit of checking,"" Emery added, ""such as their computer screen, the refrigerator or the television.""

3236,HD,"Reading up on the Babylonians or the Sumerians will likely not do much for your trading, but studying stock market history can.No, you can't go back in time and buy Apple (AAPL) or Cisco Systems (CSCO) or America Online (AOL) when they just started their big price runs, but you don't need to. Studying the historical price and volume action of big monster winners, as well as the major market indexes, can train you on what to look for the next time around.Going back and studying what worked well in the past can prepare you for the future. It can give you insight into the next round of potential market leaders. Like old winners of the past, new leaders will also show the best fundamentals in the form of outstanding earnings, sales, profit margins and return on equity. They will feature the hottest products and services that are changing lives.What has worked in the stock market in the past is the foundation of the CAN SLIM investment methodology. IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil developed the system by studying the general market action and the biggest individual winners going back more than 100 years.""In the stock market, history repeats itself. This is because human nature doesn't change,"" O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""Stocks have carved out the same patterns that have been the launching pad to big moves year after year. Regardless of whether it was 10, 20, 50 or 100 years ago, the same patterns keep repeating. Cups, cup-with-handles, flat bases, double-bottoms, high-tight flags and others continue to take shape because of the basic human emotions of hope, fear and greed.Home Depot (HD) was a huge winner in the early 1980s. The home improvement giant came about after Bernard Marcus and Arthur Blank were laid off from the Handy Dan chain. Unlike rival hardware outlets, Home Depot's stores were huge and stocked much more merchandise. They offered well-trained staff and held ""how to"" clinics.Home Depot went public in October of 1981, but didn't complete its first base until March of 1982 (1). It broke out from a shallow seven-week cup in the week ended March 19, 1982, and gained 26% by late March before consolidating gains. It broke out at a time when the general market was still in a downtrend. But the market turned in August, and Home Depot gained 952% in 14 months.

""I also enclose a $10 Starbucks gift card.""Lynch likes to stay accessible to his far-flung workforce. After working at retail giants Wal-Mart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD), Lynch has learned the importance of staying close to his team even if they operate thousands of miles apart.While Lynch's cards solidify personal bonds with his managers, they sometimes serve a secondary purpose. If a manager's store is performing particularly well, Lynch may praise the superior results.Lynch became the company's CEO in January 2012. Soon after, he launched a one-week training program for store managers.""I learned this at Wal-Mart,"" said Lynch, 47. ""Sam Walton did this really well. Sam believed in pushing down information and sharing it with the troops at every store.""At these annual ""Lumber Liquidators University"" retreats, Lynch and other senior executives update store managers on the firm's one- and five-year strategic plan. He also allows time for managers to mingle with peers so that they can share ideas and best practices that benefit the entire store network.To motivate the group, Lynch instructs everyone to join hands and participate in what he calls ""quirky cheers"" that build camaraderie. He sets five goals for the coming year (relating to sales, gross margins, etc.) and, as each goal flashes on a big screen, the managers shout their intention to fulfill it.""I learned at Wal-Mart that when you directly ask someone to commit to something in public as part of a team, they're not going to let the team down,"" he said. ""And if the CEO talks with confidence that you believe the team will hit all its goals, the team believes too.""Lynch lists the goals on a sheet of paper and asks every manager to sign it. Then he frames it on his office wall for the year, periodically sending copies to his managers to remind them to stay focused on reaching the goals.This way, everyone keeps their eye on the ball.

3254,HD,"When IBD revamped its Income Investor column several months back, it introduced three screens aimed at successful dividend investing. They are the backbone of the column.Most of the companies covered in this daily column (today on Page B9) are selected from the three screens. The screens seek stocks with solid and growing dividends, extremely stable annual earnings, and other characteristics needed to maintain a regular flow of dividends. Relatively few stocks make these stringent lists.Don't look for fast earnings growth or superb share-price performance in this feature; dividend returns take precedent in the Income Investor.Here's a guide to the screens and how to make best use of them.Of the three screens, the broadest screen is the Dividend Leaders. Some of America's best-recognized companies have been appearing on this list, thanks to their histories of dependable dividends. Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) recently showed up in this screen.Utility Leaders, the second screen, follow basically the same selection criteria. Traditionally, utilities have been a haven for income-focused investors. These companies tend to have little growth, but their steady and reliable revenue streams make them ideal dividend providers.That steady nature also gives utilities relative safety when the general market falls on hard times and growth stocks are getting trampled.REIT Leaders looks at another traditional fort for income investors. Real estate investment trusts are companies created under a law that lets them avoid paying corporate taxes as long as they pass on their profits to shareholders. They use dividends to pass on those profits, making REITs one of the surest bets for income portfolios.Like utilities, many REITs have steady revenue streams. For example, they may own specialized buildings for medical or technology companies and obtain regular lease proceeds. Or, they might own apartment complexes, securing a wealth of rent payments.Slow economic conditions can hurt those businesses, but they tend to be less volatile than most other businesses.Of the four data columns on each list, the most important are the annualized dividend yield and the dividend growth rate. By studying those numbers and comparing them, investors can gauge which companies they can research further.Use the weekly charts and the story on the page to learn fundamental and technical details.

Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume tracking close to Monday's levels.Major averages continue to hold near highs despite six distribution days for the Nasdaq and five for the S&P 500.A distribution day involves a sizable loss in rising volume. Such action points to institutional selling.In the stock market today, Home Depot (HD) rose 1.5%. Earlier today, the home improvement retailer reported profit of 95 cents a share, up 28% from a year ago. Sales rose 7% to $19.47 billion.

3257,HD,"Wouldn't it be great to find just one or two stocks that could help you retire, finance a child's education or pay for a new roof?Finding a stock like Google (GOOG), Home Depot (HD) or Microsoft (MSFT) in the early stages of their big runs can help you accomplish those goals. What feature in IBD can help your search?A very good place to start is the IBD 50, a computer-generated list of top growth stocks.These are not pure momentum stocks. They're selected based on key fundamental criteria such as earnings and sales growth and the quality of price performance. The list appears in the B section of IBD every Monday and Wednesday and includes a column of commentary. In IBD Leaderboard, the IBD 50 is updated every day.The IBD 50 saves you time because it does the screening for you. Every Monday, IBD also highlights two stocks from the IBD 50 in the form of mini columns. They discuss each stock's fundamentals, the company's business and its competitive strengths.Each mini column is accompanied by a chart, which includes long-term annual earnings growth and other statistics that provide clues to a stock's potential. Often, the stocks either are working on bases or are near buy points. Find a brief chart analysis at the bottom of the chart. Learning how to analyze charts helps you become a better investor.Web.com (WWWW), a provider of website publishing and e-commerce services for small and midsize businesses, was featured in an IBD 50 mini on Feb. 19. The chart that went with the story showed that Web.com sported a 91 Composite Rating and a 97 Earnings Per Share Rating, just shy of the best-possible 99.The chart analysis said it was near a possible 19.21 buy point of a long base. Instead of immediately clearing that buy point, Web.com went on to form a flat base with an 18.57 entry. It broke out on May 3 in huge volume. At the time, its Composite and Earnings Per Share remained strong at 91 and 96 respectively.From the breakout, Web.com ran up its 10-week line, hitting a high of 33.70 on Oct. 4, good for an 81% gain in just five months. Shortly after, the stock crashed through its 50-day line in heavy volume and now appears to be working on a new base.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) has done well since it appeared in an IBD 50 mini column Jan. 7. Not long after, on Jan. 31, it crossed resistance at about 36 in the week ended Jan. 18 and has since risen along with its 10-week line. It's up 33% so far and hasn't yet triggered any major sell signals.Don't buy a stock just because it's in the IBD 50. Make sure to scrutinize the stocks to make sure they conform to IBD's fundamental and technical characteristics as they cross buy points in sound bases. Also, make sure the market is in a confirmed uptrend before buying.

3272,HD,"The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of a number of major Retail sector operators – Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) – and the sector as a whole. To keep the chart from becoming too unwieldy and ‘busy’, I kept the S&P 500 index out of it.For reference, the large-cap index is up +2.7% in the year-to-date period, lagging the Retail Sector’s +7.9% gain.As you can see in this chart, the Retail sector has done better than the S&P 500 index, with Macy’s and Amazon really standing out and Wal-Mart the weakest of the four stocks.Macy’s shrinking footprint notwithstanding, it represents the department store space in this comparison chart, with Wal-Mart and Home Depot standing in for the big box discount and home-improvement spaces, respectively.Macy’s long-standing troubles are far from over, but the company appears to be executing well in an otherwise tough environment. The stock’s strong year-to-date performance, almost the same as Amazon’s performance, is more a function of how low expectations had fallen for this department store leader rather than the discovery of a new formula that can help it compete better. That said, market participants appear to be moving away from the overly pessimistic narrative that didn’t see any role for Macy’s and its peers in Retail’s future.  Wal-Mart shares have been struggling since late-January 2018, with the market appearing unwilling to give it the flexibility and space that it routinely allows Amazon. Wal-Mart is investing in its business, both in the brick-and-mortar assets as well as the digital side, and these investments tend to come at the expense of margins and profitability. The company’s Q1 results were decent, but the positive same-store sales growth and impressive ecommerce sales failed to impress skeptical investors focused on more evidence of margin pressures. The market likely also believes that the company overpaid for its India venture through the Flipkart purchase. All in all, the company has a good strategy in place to effectively compete with Amazon in the long run. But no one should be under any illusion about how long and expensive the struggle will be.   Home Depot’s mixed quarterly report can be legitimately chalked up to the weather. But the stock’s year-to-date underperformance likely has more to do with the market’s skepticism about the outlook for the housing space as a whole which has been dealing with low housing inventory and rising mortgage rates.    Retail Sector Scorecard We now have Q1 results from 89.5% of the retailers in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up +21.1% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues, with 73.5% beating EPS estimates and 67.7% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the sector’s Q1 results in a historical context.The comparison charts above show that while growth (both earnings as well as revenues) is tracking notably above historical periods, the proportion of positive surprises is in line with previous quarters.With respect to growth, Amazon’s blockbuster numbers, particularly on the revenues front, have a big role in the sector’s very strong growth pace. Amazon’s Q1 earnings increased +125% on +42.9% higher revenues, with the net dollar increase in the online retailer’s revenues an impressive $15.3 billion.The comparison charts below try to look at the sector’s growth picture with and without the Amazon contribution.As you can see in the right-hand chart above, Q1 growth is still tracking above historical periods, but the growth rate is a lot lower on an ex-Amazon basis.  Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard (as of Friday, May 25th)For the S&P 500 index as a whole, we now have Q1 results from 485 index members. Total earnings for the 485 index members that have reported results already are up +24.3% from the same period last year on +8.6% higher revenues, with 77.1% beating EPS estimates and 74.4% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.3%. Please note that we have 75 companies on deck to report quarterly results this week, including 9 S&P 500 members.To put these results in a historical context, the charts below compare the results thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 485 index members in other recent periods.Earnings and revenue growth rate and the proportion of positive EPS surprises is tracking above what we have been seeing from the same group of 485 index members. But revenue surprises are tracking modestly below the preceding earnings season, but remain above historical periods.What’s Happening to 2018 Q2 Estimates?The chart below plots the evolution of earnings growth expectations for the current period. As you can see, there has been no incremental improvement in the earnings outlook relative to what was expected ahead of the start of this earnings season.A big part of the positive revisions we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season reflected the direct impact of the tax law changes, which was obviously a one-off development. Had all positive revisions been a result of tax law changes, we would have seen only EPS estimates go up, with no changes to revenue estimates. But that wasn’t the case, as revenue estimates had gone up as well, which raised our hopes that the aggregate revisions trend had finally turned positive after many years being in the other direction.Disappointingly, we are not seeing that with estimates for Q2 to the same extent, as the above chart shows. In other words, while the growth picture coming out of this earnings season is very impressive, there is not much improvement in expectations for the current and coming quarters. The recent uptrend in the exchange value of the U.S. dollar and questions about global growth will likely serve as incremental negatives for folks like us monitoring the aggregate revisions trend.This flat aggregate revisions trend notwithstanding, June quarter estimates have actually modestly ticked down for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors and gone up for 7 sectors. The sectors enjoying positive revisions in the aggregate include Technology, Energy, Medical, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Business Services, and Retail.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

3273,HD,"Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings and sales lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This marks the company’s second consecutive bottom-line miss. Nevertheless, the company’s top and bottom line depicted year-over-year improvement in the quarterly results.In the first quarter, unfavorable weather conditions in several regions led to delayed spring season sales, which dented the company’s outdoor categories performance. Nonetheless, the company gained from solid indoor category performance and consistent sales growth to Pro customers. That said let’s take a closer look at the quarterly performance and management expectations for fiscal 2018.Q1 PerformanceNotably, this home improvement retailer’s quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share, fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22 cents. Nevertheless, the bottom line increased 15.5% from $1.03 in the year-ago quarter, following a decline of 14% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Lowe's Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Lowe's Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lowe's Companies, Inc. QuoteFurther, net sales of $17.36 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.44 billion. Nevertheless, the top line rose 3% year over year after posting improvement of 1.8%, 6.5%, 6.8% and 10.7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Comparable sales (comps) inched up 0.6% in the quarter under review, following an increase of 4.1%, 5.7%, 4.5% and 1.9% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. Comps for the U.S. business climbed 0.5% after increasing 4.7%, 5.1%, 4.6% and 2% in the preceding quarters, respectively.Moving on, gross profit increased 3.7% year over year to $6,012 million and gross profit margin expanded roughly 23 basis points (bps) to 34.6%. However, operating income declined close to 6% during the quarter, thanks to higher SG&A expenses.Other Financial AspectsLowe’s, which competes with The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,565 million, long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $14,948 million and shareholders’ equity of $5,745 million. Cash flow from operations amounted to $3,429 million in the quarter under review.In the reported quarter, the company kept its promise of returning surplus cash to stockholders as it repurchased shares worth $750 million and distributed $340 million as dividends.OutlookThe company is on track with efforts to improve inventory levels, conversion rates, gross margin along with strategies to enhance consumers’ experience.That said, for fiscal 2018, management projects total sales growth of approximately 5%, up from the prior estimate of a rise of 4%. The top line is expected to gain 1% from the company’s adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standard. Further, comps for fiscal 2018 are expected to rise about 3.5%.Additionally, Lowe’s envisions operating margin to decline approximately 40 bps in the fiscal. Earnings are anticipated in the band of $5.40-$5.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings is currently pegged at $5.46, which falls within management’s expectations.Moreover, the company intends to open 10 home improvement and hardware stores in fiscal 2018. As of May 4, 2018, the company operated 2,154 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceLowe’s currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

3274,HD,"We have read much about the transition in the retail space, where companies, adhering to the new norms of omni-channel trade, are likely to play the winning stroke. Customer shopping patterns have undergone drastic changes as they now prefer to shop from the comfort of their homes and have the product delivered to the doorsteps instead of hopping from store to store. To counter this change, retailers are finding new ways to market their products, to which The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is no exception.In fact, Home Depot is among the few retailers that have mostly succeeded in its initiatives. The company is gaining from its relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity. This has helped Home Depot to tackle competition from e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) after the latter expanded into the company’s core gardening business.Home Depot Sharpening the EdgeBuilding Interconnected CapabilitiesIn response to the evolving retail environment, where digital and physical stores operate together, Home Depot has been building its interconnected capabilities. The company is making great strides by enhancing its digital assets for a more seamless experience for the customers. It implemented a new e-commerce platform, enhanced search and mobile functionalities, speedy checkout and expanded chat functionality to improve customer engagement.The company’s investments in interconnected shopping experience are paying off, which is evident from improved customer satisfaction scores, better conversion and increased sales. Notably, online sales grew nearly 20% in first-quarter fiscal 2018, driven by improved online traffic. This reflects that the company’s interconnected retail strategy is well received by customers.Pro Customer Sales Outpacing DIY SalesHome Depot has been gaining from its focus on Professional Customers or Pro Customers. The company has undertaken several strides, including the acquisition of Compact Power Equipment, which significantly improved portfolio service offerings for its Pro customers. Additionally, the company invested in Interline Brands, and maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) products, which are generating impressive results.Notably, investments that are meant to extend relationships with Pro customers are resulting in increased engagement, which is translating to higher spend by customers. Further, the combination of enhanced associate tools in the store and expanded delivery capabilities are gaining traction with the Pros. For instance, the company’s new two-hour and four-hour delivery window options, with same-day car and van delivery in select markets, have been extremely successful. This aided the company to witness double-digit delivered sales growth in the fiscal first quarter.Wrapping UpA reflection of the company’s endeavors was quite visible in its solid past performances. The company has been reporting strong financial figures since 2008, with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. Incidentally, both top and bottom lines grew year over year in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Though a slow start to spring led to lower-than-expected sales, the company retained its five-year-long trend of positive earnings surprises.The company continues to witness strength in all lines of business in the first few weeks of May. Consequently, the company provided an optimistic view for fiscal 2018. It expects sales growth of nearly 6.7%, accompanied by 5% increase in comps. Further, the company estimates earnings per share to be up nearly 28% to $9.31.Further, the company is on track to reach its long-term financial targets in fiscal 2020. The company anticipates total sales of $115-$120 billion, with compounded annual sales growth of nearly 4.5-6%. Operating margin is expected to be 14.4-15, with annual average capital spending of about 2.5% of sales. The company expects a return on invested capital to be more than 40%. Alongside achieving these targets, the company plans to accelerate investments in the next three years to enhance customer experience and shareholder value.These factors have collectively helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to surge 21.5% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 19.3% growth.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

Total earnings for these Retail sector companies that have reported results are up +22.1% from the same period last year on +10.1% higher revenues, with 72.7% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the sector’s Q1 results in a historical context.Please note that the Zacks Retail sector includes the online vendors and restaurant players in addition to ‘traditional’ brick-and-mortar players.The comparison charts above show that while growth (both earnings as well as revenues) is tracking notably above historical periods, the proportion of positive EPS surprises is in-line with historical periods and revenue surprises are tracking below the 4-quarter average (but above the 12-quarter average).With respect to growth, Amazon’s blockbuster numbers, particularly on the revenues front, has a big role in the very strong growth picture at this stage. Amazon’s Q1 earnings increased +125% on +42.9% higher revenues, with the net dollar increase in the online retailer’s revenues an impressive $15.3 billion.The comparison charts below try to look at the sector’s growth picture with and without the Amazon contribution.The right-hand chart that compares the sector’s Q1 earnings and revenue growth on an ex-Amazon basis shows that growth still compares favorably with other periods even without the online giant’s considerable contribution.Weak Revisions TrendWhile growth in Q1 has been very strong, analysts have been hesitant to raise their estimates for Q2. The fact is that aggregate expectations for the quarter have barely budged since the quarter got underway, as the chart below shows.This revisions trend is in contrast to the very positive revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw at the start of the year was directly tied to the impact of tax cuts. But the estimated trend had been moving favorably since the second half of 2017 and we expected some of that to show up in estimates for Q2. This didn’t happen, as the above chart shows.There is not much change to estimates for the second half of the year either, as the chart below shows.Expectations Beyond Q1The chart below contrasts the Q1 earnings growth rate with what was actually achieved in the last 5 quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.As you can see, the growth picture remains very strong, even though it is expected to decelerate in the coming quarters from Q1’s lofty level. The worrying part isn’t the seeming deceleration, but the underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 and beyond. This lack of positive revisions coupled with ongoing strength in the U.S. dollar and questions about the global economy likely provide sufficient grounds for the market’s less-than-enthusiastic reaction to Q1 results.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

3278,HD,"With a Chinese-American “trade war” averted for now — although many, like Zacks Exec VP Kevin Matras, have long argued we were never going to wind up in one anyway — market indexes have breathed easier, with the Dow up nearly 300 points to close above 25K from the first time since all-time highs were being scaled early this year. In fact, all major indexes closed in the green yesterday, and look to build modestly on those levels in today’s pre-market.Specifically, China has agreed to lower its tariff on imported U.S. autos from 25% to 15%, and this followed concessions made by President Trump that lifts a trade ban to Chinese telecom giant ZTE.

Though this large group of small-cap stocks only accounts for not even 10% of publicly traded domestic market cap, many analysts look at trades into small-caps as a “risk-on” environment, which naturally supports bullish market sentiment, and may key another leg up on the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500.In company-specific news, J.C.

"
3281,HD,"Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23. In the preceding quarter, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 15.9%. This home improvement retailer failed to beat the consensus mark in the trailing four quarters, the average being a negative 4.9%.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?After registering an earnings decline of 14% in the final quarter of fiscal 2017, Lowe's Companies is expected to record year-over-year growth of more than 18% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.22 compared with $1.03 reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $17,457 million, up 3.6% year over year.Factors at PlayAn improving job scenario, housing market recovery and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well for Lowe’s. Moreover, the company’s focus on strengthening its relationship with Pro customers is encouraging.Lowe's Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Lowe's Companies, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Lowe's Companies, Inc. QuoteThe buyout of Maintenance Supply Headquarters is enhancing the company’s relationship with Pro customers. Further, Lowe’s has refurbished its pro-service business website, LowesForPros.com, in order to cater to the needs of its Pro customers. The company’s Canadian and Mexican businesses has been doing pretty well. Meanwhile, the buyout of RONA has been fortifying the company’s position in the Canadian market.Lowe's Canada entered into a strategic partnership with Solar Brokers Canada to provide solar energy installation services to homeowners under Lowe's Solar banner. Of late, the company has been focusing on maintenance, repair and operations products, evident from its acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and also the earlier buyout of Central Wholesalers.In fact, the reflection of these endeavors is quite evident from a 4.1% rise in fourth-quarter comparable sales (comps), following an increase of 5.7%, 4.5% and 1.9% recorded in the third, second and first quarter, respectively.Undoubtedly, the above discussion makes us optimistic about Lowe’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. However, threats emerging from cannibalization and stiff competition cannot be ignored. Also, we observed that the company’s gross margin has been under pressure for quite some time now. Moreover, higher SG&A expenses may act as a headwind too. Evidently, Lowe's gross margin in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, declined a respective 64, 23, 28 and 70 basis points to 34.4%, 34.2%, 34.1% and 33.7%.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has witnessed a downward revision of roughly 5.7% in the past 30 days. Estimates have been trending down lately ahead of first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release, as analysts polled by Zacks also remain apprehensive about unfavorable weather that might result in lower spring seasonal spending, and in turn could hurt the company's top line.We note that Home Depot’s (HD  -  Free Report) top line for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were short of consensus mark mainly due to softness in the spring season categories as the weather across the United States was colder than normal. The extreme winter weather in the quarter negatively impacted its garden categories, which usually represent 15-20% of sales in the first quarter.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Lowe's is not likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock doesn’t have the right combination of two ingredients — a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

3283,HD,"The Dow snapped a record streak of wins to traverse a turbulent week. Trade-war related concerns continued to weigh on investors with President Trump expressing doubts over the success of upcoming negotiations with China. Additionally, the spike in 10-year Treasury yield also spooked markets, sparking off fresh inflationary concerns. Such fears were also stoked by encouraging retail sales numbers.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.4% on last Friday, marking its seventh straight session of gains. This was the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since Nov. 8, 2017. Notably, healthcare stocks were down initially following the news that President Trump unveiled his new healthcare plan.However, the broad market recovered later after the announcement was not followed up by stringent measures. Low inflation data and weak dollar also boosted investors’ confidence in equities.The index gained 2.3% over last week. This was the blue-chip index’s largest weekly gain since March. Energy and tech stocks were major drivers of the U.S. stock markets. Oil prices first rallied on last Wednesday in the wake of United States’ decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal. This increase fueled a rally in energy stocks once again.Meanwhile, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares jumped after celebrity investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) announced that it had bought 70 million shares of Apple in the first quarter.

President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that he was considering relaxing stringent sanctions that have been imposed on Chinese tech giant ZTE Corp. last month.The index lost 0.8% on Tuesday after the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note hit a seven-year high. This, in turn, occurred after retail sales increased over two consecutive months, raising inflationary fears. Moreover, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad commented that trade tensions between the United States and China were far from over.The index gained 0.3% on Wednesday reversing previous day’s broad-based decline. In particular, retail stocks gained on strong sales data of April and Macy’s Inc.’s (M  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings report. Moreover, Russell 2000, the benchmark index for small-cap stocks hits an all-time high. Overall, most stocks closed in the green as investors appeared to ignore concerns regarding rising yield on the U.S. government bonds and geopolitical tensions.The index lost 0.2% on Thursday after President Trump commented that trade talks between the United States and China may not be successful. Trump stated: “Will that be successful? I tend to doubt it,” ahead of the second round of trade talks between the two countries. Meanwhile, a decline in technology shares negated gains made by energy stocks.Components Moving the Index The Home Depot, Inc.

3284,HD,"We’ve begun the final leg of Q4 earnings season ahead of the initial opening bell of the new holiday-shortened week, with prominent retailers taking center stage. For the past several quarters, we’ve seen healthy quarterly figures from most sectors in the market, but it’s only been fairly recently that retailers have been able to join the party.As a result, where in the past we’d seen the Retail sector give back quarterly gains overall, these days we may see an acceleration on already strong Q4 totals. This week begins the process of retailers posting earnings, and we do so with Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), which posted differing results and are being treated much differently in pre-market trading.Home Depot posted a 7-cent beat tp $1.69 per share on revenues of $23.88 billion, which surpassed the Zacks consensus estimate of $23.66 billion. This marks a 17.4% upswing in earnings from the year-ago quarter, and 7.5% growth on the top-line. It’s also the 6th straight revenue beat, while Home Depot continues its remarkable string of 5 straight years beating earnings estimates.Further, earnings guidance for full-year 2018 looks for 28% earnings growth, as home restoration projects and general construction business improve. Shares of Home Depot have climbed 3% in today’s pre-market on the news. For more on HD’s earnings, click here.Walmart, however, missed earnings estimates by 3 cents per share to $1.33. This is still 2.3% higher than year-ago earnings, and quarterly sales of $136.3 billion topped the $135 billion we expected from the world’s largest big-box retailer.But guidance was weaker than expected for full-year 2018, and this has helped WMT shares sell off 7.5% in early trading today, following the earnings release. Net sales growth in its International markets grew 6.7%, nearly double that of U.S. growth. Yet 3/4 on Walmart’s business remains in the U.S. For more on WMT’s earnings, click here.

3285,HD,"Tuesday, May 15, 2018Futures are trading down ahead of the opening bell this morning, both prior to and immediately following both April Retail Sales numbers and the May Empire State report, both of which came in better than anticipated. Actually, Retail Sales on the headline was in-line with estimates at +0.3%, but revisions to March were ratcheted up from 0.6% to 0.8%. Empire State reached 20.1, higher than the 15 estimated and the 15.8 last month.As it turns out, 3s were wild for today’s Retail Sales: headline was 0.3%, but so was ex-autos, as well as ex-autos & gas. It’s these kind of numbers, should they prove consistent over time, that will help overall GDP reach that (psychologically) coveted 3% rate in Q2; right now, early indications are that Q2 GDP will be at least 3% — up 0.7% or more from the seasonally slow Q1.Even better, the Control read was at 0.4%, and the last take was moved up from 0.4% to 0.5%. Non-store retail (internet sales) grew notably at 0.6% last month. These are indeed the sorts of numbers those interested in seeing domestic growth evidence can be proud of. They are also continuing to allow that the Fed will crank up interest rates another quarter-point, to 1.75-2.00% — the first time we will have seen 2% rates since well before the Great Recession a decade ago.We’re getting more earnings reports, mostly from the retailers these days, but results are relatively sporadic compared the the deluge we’d been experiencing over the past few weeks. Tomorrow morning we will hear from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), but for today we’ve got Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) results to parse through.Home Depot, ahead of its report, is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with a Style Score (Value - Momentum - Growth) of A. The company posted a mixed Q1 picture, beating estimates on the bottom line while missing on the top. Earnings of $2.08 per share surpassed the $2.06 expected, and up 24.6% year over year. Revenues of $24.95 billion slipped beneath the $25.20 billion analysts had been looking for, on overall comps up 4%.The company expects business to pick up modestly for the the rest of the year, and guidance is up from Q1 results accordingly — in-line with what analysts had already been expecting. However, shares are trading down in today’s pre-market on the mixed headline results.

3286,HD,"The earnings and revenue growth pace emerging from the Q1 earnings season has been very strong. But estimates for Q2 and beyond haven’t moved much. In fact, estimates for Q2 have modestly come down since early March.This underwhelming revisions trend for Q2 is in sharp contrast to the very positive revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q1 earnings season. A big part of the positive revisions we saw in January and February this year was due to the tax cuts that directly helped estimates higher for Q1 and the following quarters. It appeared at the time that lower taxes weren’t the only reason pushing estimates higher and we saw proof of that in positive revisions to revenue estimates. But we haven’t seen any such positive revisions to Q2 estimates.This lack of positive revisions to estimates for Q2 and beyond is therefore a net negative and likely a contributing factor to the market’s unenthusiastic reaction to the Q1 earnings season. In other words, there is no incremental improvement in the earnings picture that can push stocks higher.Including this morning’s earnings report from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and others, we now have Q1 results from 457 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these 457 index members are up +24.5% from the same period last year on +8.9% higher revenues, with 77.5% beating EPS estimates and 74.6% beating revenue estimates.The earnings focus in the coming days will be on the Retail sector, with traditional operators like Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and others coming out with quarter results. For the 20 retailers in the S&P 500 index, out of 38 total, that have reported Q1 results already, total earnings are up +24.8% on +13.6% higher revenues, with 70% beating EPS estimates and 60% beating revenue estimates.The chart below contrasts earnings growth expectations for the next three quarters, with actual results for Q1 and the preceding 5 quarters.As you can see, the growth picture is expected to remain strong in the current and coming quarters as well, but the Q1 growth pace will likely turn out to be the high point for the year.For more details about the Q1 earnings season, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>> A Critical Look at the Q1 Earnings SeasonMore Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3290,HD,"Prologis Inc.'s (PLD  -  Free Report) build-to-suit activity has remained solid in the year so far, with the company completing 16 such development projects in the first half. These projects included over 6.2 million square feet of area and involved total expected investment (TEI) of around $475 million on a Prologis-share basis.The projects, which are located within the United States as well as abroad, are made for customers like Amazon.com Inc.

3292,HD,"Key foreign bank earnings that are scheduled for release next week will likely to provide a better understanding of the sector’s near-term prospects. At present, the central short-term concern for foreign banks will be one-time U.S. tax charges, which may adversely affect their full-year profits. However, a lower U.S. corporate tax rate is expected to favor profitability in the long run.Barring this short-term concern, an uptick in this year’s global economic growth, projected by the World Bank, should infuse further momentum in the foreign banking space, which ended 2017 with a solid recovery after being a laggard for a long time. Particularly, the recovery witnessed by banks in advanced nations, fueled by an accommodative monetary policy and fiscal stimulus of the central banks, could be self-reinforcing in the quarters ahead.

This implies that the industry has upside potential for the near future.The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/B ratio – the best multiple for valuing banks because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next – of 1.6, which is below the S&P 500’s average of 3.73. Hence, it might be a good idea not to abstain from stocks belonging to this industry.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 1.08 HSBC is undervalued than the S&P 500 and the industry. However, though Royal Bank of Canadais also undervalued compared to the S&P 500, with a P/B ratio of 2.25, it is pricier than both the industry and HSBC.Dividend YieldHSBC’s dividend yield over the last year is 3.81%, higher than the broader industry’s figure of 2.6%. With a dividend yield of 3.52%, Royal Bank of Canada shareholders earn a slightly lower dividend yield than HSBC.Return on Assets (ROA)Return on assets (ROA) is one of the key financial ratios for banks as they rely heavily on their assets to create revenues. A positive ROA indicates that the company has reported gains from its assets for the period in question. Coming to Royal Bank of Canada and HSBC, ROA for the trailing 12-months (TTM) is 0.95% and 0.32%, respectively. Royal Bank of Canada has a higher ROA than not only HSBC, but also the industry, which has ROA of 0.52%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Royal Bank of Canada has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of 3.7%. On the contrary, with a negative average earnings surprise of 21.1%, HSBC loses this round to its rivalWhen considering Earnings ESP, both foreign banks have an ESP value of 0.00%. At the same time, Royal Bank of Canada’s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 2.7% over the last 60 days, while the same metric for HSBC has remained unchanged. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that HSBC holds an edge over Royal Bank of Canada when considering price performance, dividend yield and valuation ratios. However, when considering return on assets, Royal Bank of Canada holds an edge over HSBC.Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Royal Bank of Canada is clearly the better stock. In this respect, it is evident that Royal Bank of Canada holds a slight edge over HSBC ahead of their earnings releases next week.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3293,HD,"The markets bounced back strong from last week’s sell-off, and despite renewed concerns about the possibility of rising inflation, investors jumped back into stocks—causing Wall Street’s major indexes to regain some much of the losses suffered during the recent correction.And whatever the case may be with inflation, we know that an improved global economy and impressive Q4 earnings results should help the broader market move higher for now. The latest earnings season is nearing its completion, and among the 362 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% year-over-year on 9% higher revenues.With that said, a number of marquee reports remain to be released, and these newer results could help set the tone as inflation fears begin to creep back into the market.Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected most-important reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of February 19!1.       Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)Discount supermarket behemoth Walmart is scheduled to release its latest quarterly report before the market opens on Feb. 20. This stock tends to serve as a bellwether for the consumer economy, so investors will definitely want to pay close attention to its results. Shares of WMT have gained about 7% over the past 12 weeks.WMT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect the company to report earnings of $1.36 per share and revenues of $135.04 billion, which would represent growth of 4.6% and 3.1%, respectively. The key to any potential surprise will be Walmart’s continued e-commerce growth, with an emphasis on margin expansion in this segment. 2.       The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report)Home improvement retailer Home Depot is slated to report its latest quarterly results before the opening bell on Feb. 20. With a strong economy and housing market throughout the country, logic would imply that Home Depot could be ready to post an impressive report, but the exact details will be revelatory regardless. Share of HD have gained 8% within the past 12 weeks.HD is holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) heading into its report date. According to our latest consensus estimates, the company is projected to post earnings of $1.62 per share and revenues of $23.67 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 12.5% and 6.6%, respectively. 3.       Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report)Hewlett Packard Enterprise is slated to release its latest earnings report after the bell on Feb. 22. Things have been relatively up and down for HPE since its split from the former Hewlett-Packard Company in late-2015. Still, the company is coming off two-straight earnings beats, and a recent spin-off could help improve margins.Nevertheless, HPE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). According to our latest consensus estimates, HPE is poised to post earnings of 23 cents per share and revenues of $7.03 billion. During the third-quarter of fiscal 2017, the company sold its Software business to British firm Micro Focus, so the most important year-over-year comparison for investors to keep an eye on will be in the net margin category. Want more analysis from this author?

3294,HD,"A glimpse of Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has plunged roughly 11% in the past three months in line with the industry. We also note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 and $6.12 for fiscal 2018 and 2019 has declined by 33 cents and 54 cents, respectively, in the past 60 days. So what is behind the dismal show in the bourses? Why analysts polled by Zacks are skeptical about the company’s performance? Are the initiatives undertaken by management enough to revive the stock?What Hurt the Stock?Lowe’s stock took a sharp U-turn after the company missed fourth-quarter earnings and provided soft fiscal 2018 view. The company’s earnings of 74 cents per share fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents. Further, the company expects fiscal 2018 earnings in the band of $5.40-$5.50 per share, which was significantly below the analyst expectations. As mentioned above, estimates have been witnessing downward revisions.Lowe’s faces stiff competition from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and other home supply retailers on attributes such as price and quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortments and customer service. This may weigh on the company’s upcoming results. We noted that in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, gross margin had contracted 25, 40, 10 and 43 basis points, respectively. In the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, margin declined  a respective 64, 23, 28 and 70 basis points to 34.4%, 34.2%, 34.1% and 33.7%. Management Looking Into Every Nook and CornerWe believe improving job scenario, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well for Lowe’s. The company’s Canadian and Mexican businesses has been performing quite well. The buyout of RONA is reinforcing its position in the Canadian market.Lowe's Canada entered into a strategic partnership with Solar Brokers Canada to provide solar energy installation services to homeowners under Lowe's Solar banner. Of late, the company has been focusing on maintenance, repair and operations products, evident from its acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and also the earlier buyout of Central Wholesalers.Further, Lowe’s has refurbished its pro-service business website, LowesForPros.com, in order to cater to the needs of its Pro-customers. The company’s efforts to focus on Pro customers is yielding results, which is quite evident from the fact that Pro growth rate in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has outpaced do-it-yourself.The company is streamlining store portfolio, which along with its strategy of enhancing customer shopping experience and merchandising transformation, is likely to generate incremental sales. We noted that comparable sales (comps) rose 4.1% in the fourth quarter, following an increase of 5.7%, 4.5% and 1.9% recorded in the third, second and first quarter, respectively. Management projects total sales growth of approximately 4%, with comps increase of about 3.5% for fiscal 2018.We believe that these initiatives are likely to bolster Lowe’s performance and provide cushion to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.2 Key Picks in the Retail SpaceFastenal Company (FAST  -  Free Report) has a long-term earnings growth rate of 14% and carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tailored Brands (TLRD  -  Free Report) delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 50.9% in the trailing four quarters.

3296,HD,"Shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) opened lower on Tuesday after the company reported its first quarter financial results. But while the home improvement retailer might have disappointed some investors, its performance, outlook, and current valuation are actually rather attractive.Home Depot reported adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, which marked a roughly 24.5% climb from the year-ago period and also topped our Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. The opposite end of the income statement is what left some investors nervous about Home Depot. The company’s Q1 revenues fell short of our $25.20 billion estimate, but did pop by 4.4% to reach $24.95 billion.Clearly, a top line miss isn’t a good thing for Home Depot. With that said, if we dive a little deeper investors will see that there is a lot to be pleased with when evaluating Home Depot stock at the moment.Quick Q1 DetailsDespite the fact that Home Depot posted lower-than-expected quarterly revenues, the company’s same-store sales were encouraging. The retailer’s comp sales jumped 4.2%, while U.S. comps popped 3.9%. Both of those are relatively solid for a company of Home Depot’s size and age. Investors did likely compare Home Depot’s comp growth to the year-ago period when the company’s same-store sales climbed 5.5%, with U.S. stores up 6%.There is however a somewhat obvious reason for this year-over-year decline that was out of Home Depot’s control.The weather throughout most of North America—where a large chunk of its roughly 2,200 retail stores are located—has been rough, which means spring-based home improvement shopping was subdued. “We are pleased by the strength of our business despite a slow start to the spring selling season,” CEO Craig Menear said in a company statement.OutlookHome Depot now expects fiscal 2018 revenues will surge by roughly 6.7%, which is almost directly in line with our current estimate that calls for full-year sales of $107.62 billion. This marks a significant increase from the 4.6% full-year sales growth Home Depot projected in the prior-year period.Meanwhile, the company projects its comp sales will climb by approximately 5%, which also tops Home Depot’s 2017 full-year same-store sales guidance in the year-ago quarter. Both of these estimates help underscore the fact that Home Depot’s first quarter ticket sales popped 5.8%, helping offset a 1.3% decline in overall customer transactions.The Atlanta-based company also reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance that calls a 28% surge to touch $9.31 per share.Price Movement & ValuationInvestors also need to take a look at Home Depot’s recent price movement as well as its current valuation picture to help understand if the stock might be worth considering despite some Q1-based skepticism. Before Tuesday’s dip, shares of Home Depot were up roughly 19% over the last year, topping the S&P 500’s 13.8% climb. HD’s gains look even better compared to its peer group’s 9.1% decline—this group features both Lowe's (LOW  -  Free Report) and Fastenal (FAST  -  Free Report). Investors should also note that Home Depot has crushed the S&P 500 over the last five years, up 145% compared to the index’s 68% climb.Moving on, Home Depot is currently trading at 19.8X forward 12-months earnings estimates. Over the last year, HD has traded as high as 23.5X and as low as 18X. Coming into Tuesday, Home Depot was trading at a roughly 16% discount compared to where it stood in the middle of January.Home Depot stock has traded at a premium compared to its industry’s average during the last year. The home improvement power’s stock is also currently trading a premium against Lowe’s—which is trading at 15.3X.With that said, Home Depot has consistently traded at a premium compared to its largest direct competitor since May 2015. Therefore, investors clearly have reasons to value Home Depot’s future earnings over Lowe’s over the last few years.Bottom LineHome Depot might have fallen just a bit short of top-line estimates in the first quarter. But its growth was still solid and its 2018 outlook compares favorably against the same period last year. The company’s bottom line is also expected to expand at a healthy rate in 2018. Furthermore, HD’s current valuation appears to be fair, if not attractive.Clearly, Home Depot stock is certainly worth considering, especially after its stock price dipped following its Q1 earnings release.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3297,HD,"Futures are trading down ahead of the opening bell this morning, both prior to and immediately following both April Retail Sales numbers and the May Empire State report, both of which came in better than anticipated. Actually, Retail Sales on the headline was in-line with estimates at +0.3%, but revisions to March were ratcheted up from 0.6% to 0.8%. Empire State reached 20.1, higher than the 15 estimated and the 15.8 last month.As it turns out, 3s were wild for today’s Retail Sales: headline was 0.3%, but so was ex-autos, as well as ex-autos & gas. It’s these kind of numbers, should they prove consistent over time, that will help overall GDP reach that (psychologically) coveted 3% rate in Q2; right now, early indications are that Q2 GDP will be at least 3% — up 0.7% or more from the seasonally slow Q1.Even better, the Control read was at 0.4%, and the last take was moved up from 0.4% to 0.5%. Non-store retail (internet sales) grew notably at 0.6% last month. These are indeed the sorts of numbers those interested in seeing domestic growth evidence can be proud of. They are also continuing to allow that the Fed will crank up interest rates another quarter-point, to 1.75-2.00% — the first time we will have seen 2% rates since well before the Great Recession a decade ago.We’re getting more earnings reports, mostly from the retailers these days, but results are relatively sporadic compared the the deluge we’d been experiencing over the past few weeks. Tomorrow morning we will hear from Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), but for today we’ve got Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) results to parse through.Home Depot, ahead of its report, is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with a Style Score (Value - Momentum - Growth) of A. The company posted a mixed Q1 picture, beating estimates on the bottom line while missing on the top. Earnings of $2.08 per share surpassed the $2.06 expected, and up 24.6% year over year. Revenues of $24.95 billion slipped beneath the $25.20 billion analysts had been looking for, on overall comps up 4%.The company expects business to pick up modestly for the the rest of the year, and guidance is up from Q1 results accordingly — in-line with what analysts had already been expecting. However, shares are trading down in today’s pre-market on the mixed headline results. For more on HD’s earnings, click here.

3299,HD,"U.S. economic growth was revised up from the previous estimate. The biggest gain in three years in consumer spending drove the expansion (read: ETFs to Buy as Trade War Fears Abate).Into the HeadlinesGDP increased 2.9% in the last quarter of 2017 compared with the previously reported 2.5%, per the Commerce Department. Although it surpassed the 2.7% reading expected by a Reuters poll, it marked a slight decline from 3.2% reported in the previous quarter.  Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. GDP, grew at its fastest pace in three years, increasing 4% in the final quarter of 2017 compared with 2.2% expansion in the previous quarter. However, imports were a drag, as it grew at an upwardly revised rate of 14.1% compared with the previously reported 14.0%, the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2010.There are signs that GDP slowed further in Q1 2018, as investors take cues from retail sales data. Retail sales declined 0.1% in February against expectations of a gain of 0.3% after a 0.1% drop in the prior month and December. This was the first time since April 2012 that retail sales declined for three consecutive months (read: US Retail Sales Fall for 3 Straight Months: ETFs in Focus).Despite the weakness in retail sales, some analysts bet on economic growth reaching Trump’s 3% target in 2018 on the $1.5 trillion tax reform and increase in government spending. Government spending increased 3% in the quarter compared with previously reported 2.9%, the highest since the second quarter of 2015.What’s the Fed Going to Do?The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 25 basis points in Powell’s first meeting as chairman. The new benchmark funds rate was increased to a target of 1.5% to 1.75%. Although the Fed kept its forecast of two more hikes in 2018, it is too early to comment on what turn the U.S. economy might take in the rest of the calendar year.“Tax cuts and stronger government spending will boost average GDP growth to 2.9 percent in 2018,” per a Reuters article citing Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “We forecast this environment will lead the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year,” he added.Let us now discuss a few ETFs poised to benefit from the recent strength in economic fundamentals.Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to consumer discretionary stocks and tracks the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index. Strength in consumer spending is expected to drive stocks in this sector higher. It has AUM of $13.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Amazon.com Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report), Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) and Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) with 20.5%, 7.3% and 5.5% allocation, respectively.

3301,HD,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 7.1% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HD due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Home Depot's Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Sales LagHome Depot reported solid earnings growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018, continuing with its five-year-long trend of beating earnings estimates. However, sales missed estimates after a positive surprise in the preceding six quarters.The company posted fiscal first-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share, which escalated 24.6% from $1.67 recorded in the year-ago quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.06.Results gained from strength in the company’s core business despite a slow start to spring season. The company’s relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Further, the company continued to reap benefits of a steady housing-market recovery and strong customer demand.Quarterly DetailsNet sales grew 4.4% to $24,947 million from $23,887 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25,202 million. The company's overall comparable-store sales (comps) increased 4.2% while comps in the United States grew 3.9%.During the reported quarter, comps benefited from 5.8% increase in average ticket, offset by 1.3% decline in customer transactions. Moreover, sales per square-feet rose 4.5%.Gross profit margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 34.5%. In dollar terms, gross profit improved 5.7% to $8,617 million from $8,154 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales.Operating income increased 1% to $3,381 million while operating margin contracted 40 bps from the year-ago quarter to 13.6%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHome Depot ended first-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $3,599 million, long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $24,244 million and shareholders' equity of $1,687 million. In the fiscal first quarter, the company generated $3,981 million of net cash from operations.OutlookGoing into the fiscal second quarter, the company continues to witness strength in all lines of business in the first few weeks of May. This robust momentum, along with a favorable housing market and macroeconomic backdrop, led the company to retain its earnings and sales forecast for fiscal 2018.Including the impacts of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, which pertains to revenue recognition, Home Depot expects sales growth of nearly 6.7% in fiscal 2018, accompanied by 5% increase in comps. Further, the company estimates earnings per share for fiscal 2018 to be up nearly 28% to $9.31.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

3302,HD,"The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Feb 20, before the opening bell. In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.7%.Moreover, the company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record for five years now. For the trailing four quarters, the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Home Depot will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.62 per share, up 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has moved down in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $23.7 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.5%.Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the Retail-Wholesale sector in the last six months. The company’s shares have increased 22.3%, while the sector grew 16.9%. This solid growth comes on the back of a spectacular surprise history and growth strategies, including an interconnected strategy and a focus on Pro customers.Factors at PlayImproving job scenario, housing market recovery, merchandising initiatives and post-hurricane activities, along with efforts to enhance omnichannel capabilities, have played an instrumental role in boosting Home Depot’s stock performance. Further, the company’s strong earnings trends and robust outlook bode well.Home Depot has been reporting strong financial figures since 2008, with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. Notably, third-quarter fiscal 2017 marked the company’s fifth consecutive sales beat with earnings maintaining its five-year trend of positive surprises. Consequently, management raised its fiscal 2017 guidance.  The company anticipates earnings per share to be up nearly 14% to $7.36 in fiscal 2017, reflecting an increase from the previous guidance of 13% growth to $7.29.Moreover, the company’s comparable store sales (comps) trend has been encouraging as it has surpassed the Zacks comps estimate for over two years now. In the most recent quarter, the company’s comps improved 7.9%, surpassing the Zacks estimate of 5.6%. Comps growth was aided by robust average ticket, which also topped the Zacks Consensus mark. For the fourth-quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for an average ticket is pegged at 62.Additionally, the company has been displaying solid growth across all regions, both in stores and online. Further, Pro category sales continue to outperform, driven by constant efforts to enrich customers’ experiences. Also, the company has been revamping itself by concentrating on square-footage growth and maximizing productivity from its existing store base. These iterations indicate that the company is poised for another solid quarter ahead.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot currently has an Earnings ESP of -2.36%. However, it carries a Zacks Rank #2. Though the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of EPS, a negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Lowe’s Companies Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Aaron’s Inc. (AAN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.81% and a Zacks Rank #2.Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.92% and a Zacks Rank #2.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017.Zacks has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

3303,HD,"Robust earnings history, focus on Pro Customers, strength in core business and a disciplined capital strategy have been the key pillars of success for The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report). In fact, the company has to its credit a five-year long trend of beating earnings estimates, which continued in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, sales topped estimates for the sixth straight quarter.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 20.1% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.9%. Further, the stock has an impressive Growth Score of A with long-term earnings growth rate of 13.2%, which instills confidence among investors. Initiatives UndertakenAtlanta-based Home Depot remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities through its digital assets upgrade for providing its customers with a more seamless experience. Meanwhile, the company has been benefiting from its solid focus on Pro Customers. Notably, the recently acquired Compact Power Equipment marked another step toward enhancing its portfolio of service offerings for its Pro customers. Notably, sales from this category improved double-digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Recently, management has reaffirmed its long-term financial targets, to be achieved in fiscal 2020 while updated the return on invested capital target to reflect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 impacts. It continues to anticipate total sales in the range of $115-$120 billion with compounded annual sales growth of nearly 4.5-6%. It now projects a return on invested capital to be more than 40%, reflecting the impact of the new tax reform. Management also plans to accelerate investments in the next three years to boost customer experience and shareholder value.Will These Initiatives Lift Margins Higher?Though Home Depot has been posting sturdy results for a long time, the company’s gross margin looks a little stretched. Last quarter, gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) year over year due to impacts from lower margin hurricane-related sales. Prior to this, the company’s gross margin deteriorated 12 bps in the third quarter, 6 bps in the second, and 10 bps each in first-quarter fiscal 2017 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2016.For fiscal 2018, management expects gross margin of nearly 34%, almost flat with fiscal 2017. Excluding the 53rd week, the company expects gross margin to decline nearly 7 bps. This is mainly due to assumptions of a tightened transportation market and higher fuel costs.Well, we expect the decline in margins to be temporary, which will be offset by the company’s robust strategies and continue to augment its business.Want Top-Ranked Stocks in the Same Industry?

However, for the time being he will continue as the chairman, president and CEO of the company until a competent successor is found.There is no denying of the fact that the company has scaled new heights and emerged as a leading home improvement retailer under his leadership. In the past 10 years, the stock has surged 293.9%.However, in the recent past the company has not been able to extract benefit from improving job scenario and gradual recovery in the housing market.

Of late, Lowe’s has been focusing on maintenance, repair and operations products which is evident from its acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters and also the earlier buyout of Central Wholesalers.

3306,HD,"The likelihood of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve at the conclusion of its June 12-13 FOMC meeting is pretty high. The Fed funds rate is expected to tick up 25 basis points, with another hike or two anticipated this year. The possibility is backed by low unemployment, wage growth and rise in headline inflation.With the Fed set to raise rates, we expect financials, technology, home improvement suppliers and even gold to benefit.Outlook for June HikeA blowout jobs report in May has raised the odds of a June rate hike. Around 223,000 new positions were created last month, which drove jobless rate down to levels around 50 years ago. The number of job openings now exceeds the number of job seekers for the first time since 2000.In such a tight labor market, corporates have to raise wages to restrict other companies from poaching their workers. By the way, hourly pay went up 8 cents or 0.3% to $28.92 an hour last month. In the last 12 months, wages rose to 2.7% after remaining at 2.6% for three months at a stretch.Higher pay means that the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses is going to go up soon. Higher inflation, in turn, leads to increased interest rates. Minutes from the Fed’s May 2 meeting had already shown that most of the policymakers have agreed that a strong economic outlook warranted a rate hike “soon.”The U.S. economy is firing on all fronts, with consumer spending rebounding, business investments remaining firm and net exports showing solid strength. Thus, the annualized growth rate in the second quarter is expected at around 4%.Fed to Stick With Gradual Rate HikesTraders in the federal funds futures market are now pricing in a 94% chance of a quarter-point rate increase this month. That’s no surprise, given the encouraging economic outlook.Fed is also sticking to gradual rate hikes this year. After all, concerns over trade disputes and strains in emerging markets remain. The median estimates from economists see two more hikes this year, which matches the Fed’s own projections back in March, per a recent Bloomberg survey.Financials to Win BigWith an overwhelming majority of observers seeing an imminent rate hike with more to follow this year, financials stands to gain. Banks are definitely the go-to rate trade. Higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Insurers, by the way, derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins.An increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments, which also bodes well for brokerage firms and asset managers.Technology & Home Improvement Stand to GainOther than the broader financial sector, technology firms stand to gain from a rate hike. Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting stronger day by day and that could easily boost the bottom lines of smartphone makers like Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report).Rising rates may also compel would-be home buyers to stop searching for houses and instead look for improving their existing ones. Thus, home improvement majors Lowe’s Cos. (LOW  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) stand to gain.Rising Rates Don’t Affect GoldThere is a popular belief that a rise in interest rates makes bonds more alluring and thus money flows out of gold. But, a long-term trend shows that interest rates and gold prices don’t have such a negative correlation. Such a correlation over the past half century has been only 28%, which is not significant.And why not? The price of gold is not a function of interest rates. It is more of a function of supply and demand in the long term. Rising rates, in fact, at times turns out to be bullish for gold as it is simply bearish for stocks like utilities and home construction, to name a few.5 Solid PicksGiven the aforesaid positives, we have selected five solid stocks from these areas that boast a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).National Bank Holdings Corporation (NBHC  -  Free Report) is a bank holding company operating full-service banking centers located in Colorado and the greater Kansas City region.

3307,HD,"The financial sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. After President Donald Trump passed the tax reform last year, analysts are highly optimistic about the financial sector’s performance owing to recent trends in the sector (read: 4 Top Ranked Financials ETFs for Your Portfolio).The Fed hiked interest rates by 25 basis points for the sixth time since it started going on an upward trajectory in December 2015. Higher interest rates are known to be a positive for the financial sector and strong job growth may drive consumer spending higher. Moreover, the tech sector is another sector every investor flocks to during periods of rising rates, owing to their low debt commitments. Cause for AppealPer data released by the Labor Department, the U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, the most since July 2016. Moreover, the jobless rate remained at 4.1%, a 17-year low. In the most recent FOMC meet, the committee of central bankers led by Jerome Powell increased the 2018 GDP forecast for the U.S. economy to 2.7% from 2.5% in December.Moving on to interest rates, The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 25 basis points in Powell’s first meeting as chairman. The new benchmark funds rate was increased to a target of 1.5% to 1.75%. ""The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,"" the committee said in its post-meeting statement, inviting speculation of a steeper path in rate hikes going forward in 2019 and 2020. Rate hikes are particularly positive for financial stocks, as it leads to an increase in the prime rates, at which banks lend to customers.Moving on to discretionary stocks, these are cyclical and an improving employment scenario makes consumers more likely to spend beyond the necessities. As a result, consumer-discretionary stocks might see a rise, as strong job growth drives consumer confidence higher. Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence increased to 130.8 in February compared with downwardly revised 124.3 in the prior month, the highest since November 2000.Coming to technology funds, low debt requirements to finance expenses might help the tech sector outperform the others. Developments in the virtual reality and artificial intelligence space have given a boost to this sector. Although the recent Facebook debacle and slower acquisitions have weighed on the tech sector, continued strength in global spending might prove positive for stocks in this sector (read: Are FB & EU Casting Cloud Over Silicon Valley and These ETFs?).Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.

3311,HD,"The financial sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. With President Donald Trump passing the tax reform as law, analysts are highly optimistic about the financial sector’s performance. Moreover, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation.Higher interest rates are known to be a positive for the financial sector and strong job growth may drive consumer spending higher. Moreover, the tech sector is another sector every investor flocks to during periods of rising rates, owing to their low debt commitments. Cause for AppealPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. As a result, investors are betting on the Fed to adopt an aggressive rate hike stance and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). Rate hikes are particularly positive for financial stocks, as it leads to an increase in the prime rates, at which banks lend to customers.Moving on to discretionary stocks, these are cyclical and an improving employment scenario makes consumers more likely to spend beyond the necessities. As a result, consumer-discretionary stocks might see a rise, as strong job growth drives consumer confidence higher. Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence increased to 125.4 in January compared with 122.1 in the prior month. It surpassed economists’ expectations of 123.1.Coming to technology funds, low debt requirements to finance expenses might cause the tech sector to outperform other sectors. The developments in the virtual reality and artificial intelligence space have given a boost to this sector. Moreover, stronger global spending has made stocks in this sector rally.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.

3315,HD,"Timing a Fed rate hike is no doubt tricky. But if you ask the market participants, they are almost certain that Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve will increase its benchmark rate by 0.25%, at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21. They further anticipate the Fed to continue their hawkish stance this year, on the back of a healthy labor market and steady rise in inflation.With the Fed set to raise rates for the first time this year, expect financials, technology and home improvement suppliers to benefit. Home builders and utility players, on the other hand, could lose from the Fed’s rate decision.Fed Set to Hike Rates for the First Time in 2018At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting, the Fed will issue a rate decision. Market pundits consider a quarter-percentage point rate hike a near-certainty. The futures market is already indicating 100% chance of a rate hike, culminating into the sixth rate increase since December 2015. Market participants also widely expect the Fed to project four rate hikes this year. So far, a maximum of three rate hikes are expected for the year.But why we are expecting a hawkish Fed? This is because the current economic backdrop paints a rosy picture, especially, when you consider steady rise in wages, record low unemployment rate and upbeat consumer confidence levels. The Trump administration, in the meantime, has decided to add extra stimulus in the form of tax cuts and deregulations.Perhaps the even more crucial factor for the Fed to hike rates is hotter-than-expected signs of inflation. Recent signs indicate that inflation is tilting toward the central bank’s 2% annual target. Needless to say, the near-term inflation expectations have climbed this month to the highest level in three years. Thus, the Fed is likely to reiterate its January’s statement that inflation “will move up this year.”Winners & Losers in a Rising Rate EnvironmentWith an overwhelming majority of observers seeing an imminent rate hike with more to follow this year, certain sectors stand to gain, while some will suffer.Winners: Asset-Sensitive BanksBanks are definitely the go-to rate trade. As a general rule, higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.National banks like the Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) are very much rate-sensitive and have consistently seen earnings jump from a quarter-point rate hike. In the year-to-date period, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) generated steady returns of 4.2% on increasing expectations of a rate hike this month.Winners: InsurersVery few companies are rooting for a rate hike as much as those from the insurance industry. And why not? The relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear and straightforward, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth.Insurers derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should also benefit from a higher rate environment.As of the last filing, the top three holdings of the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE), Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR  -  Free Report), XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group, Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) have soared 44.6%, 58.1% and 18.2%, respectively, so far this year on rate hike expectations.Winners: Asset ManagersBrokerage firms and asset managers advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Notably, a wealth management firm like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) has said time and again that each quarter point increase in rates generally adds to interest revenue, much of which flows directly to pre-tax profits.Winners: Technology & Home ImprovementOther than the broader financial sector, technology firms also stand to gain from a rate hike. Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting stronger day by day. And a stronger economy could easily boost the bottom lines of smartphone makers like Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Samsung.Rising rates may also compel would-be home buyers to stop searching for new houses and instead look for improving their existing ones. Sesha Dhanyamraju, CEO of Digital Risk added that “remodelers and home-improvement suppliers benefit from a rising-rate scenario.” Thus, home improvement majors Lowe’s Cos. (L  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) stand to gain the most.Losers: Home ConstructionBut, with the Fed expected to hike rates, the average American will bear the brunt of higher borrowing costs. This is surely a dampener to real estate activities.James Cassel, chairman and co-founder of the investment banking firm Cassel Salpeter in Miami added that if rate hike happens, losers might include “construction-related businesses, like homebuilders.”Losers: UtilitiesInvesting in utilities won’t be a good idea in a rising interest rate scenario. Utilities are capital intensive business and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements. Hence, these companies have high level of debt loads. Low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits.But higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level, for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio, impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.The industry’s bellwether ETF, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), has yielded a negative return of 4.9% in the year-to-date period on rate hike concerns.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

3316,HD,"Markets ended higher on Friday following better than expected readings for industrial output which hit its highest level in the last four months. However, all the major benchmarks posted weekly declines on Friday. Investors braced for higher volatility due to Friday being a quadruple-witching day. Meanwhile, news surfaced that Trump will soon fire his national security advisor H.R. McMaster.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.3% to close at 24,946.51. The S&P 500 gained 0.2% to close at 2,752.01. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,481.99, increasing 0.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 0.6% to close at 16.69. A total of 9.54 billion shares were traded on Friday, considerably higher than the last 20-session average of 7.25 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.01-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.48-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.U.S. Industrial Production Hits 4-Month HighPer the latest report from Federal Reserve, industrial production in the United States surged 1.1% in February, comfortably surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.3% for the period. This marked its highest reading since October 2017.Such a feat was achieved on the back of renewed strength in manufacturing, construction and energy sectors. The gains also offset a slump in utility output. Manufacturing output rose 1.2% last month, its highest increase since October. Further, strength in oil and gas extraction boosted mining output by 4.3%.Utility output declined 4.7% due to temperatures becoming warmer than usual. Meanwhile, auto-production gained 3.9% and the output of construction equipment increased 2.3%. Such factors were also pivotal in boosting overall industrial production in the last month. Release of the industrial output data boosted broad based gains for the overall market on Friday.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow amassed almost 73 points to end the session in positive territory. Gains for the blue-chip index were buoyed by an increase in shares of Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), which gained 1.9% and 0.5%, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 added almost 5 points to also finish in the green. Gains for the broader index were rather broad-based. Of the 11 segments of the S&P 500, nine ended in the positive territory, with energy shares leading the advancers. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) surged almost 1% on Friday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq added 0.25 point to close in the green on the back of broad-based gains.The day was also the quadruple witching day and marked by concurrent expirations of standardized contracts such as stock-index futures, stock-index options, single-stock futures and stock options and led to an increase in volatility. However, price movement was rather subdued and did not lead to major losses. In fact, the day saw over 9.5 billion shares being exchanged, marking the biggest daily volume witnessed since Feb 9 and the fifth highest so far in 2018.Investors also kept a keen eye for Federal Reserve’s monetary-policy meeting scheduled for next week. The CME Fed Watch Tool has predicted that the odds of a rate hike by 0.25 percentage points on Mar 21 are around 94.4%.McMaster Next in Trump’s Line of FireLate Thursday, news surfaced that Trump was planning to fire National Security Adviser Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. According to reports, he has conveyed his decision to chief of staff John Kelly. However, no source could confirm the exact timing of his ouster with some officials claiming that the event would soon happen, while the others stated that it might take months to happen. Such reports weighed on the markets.However, in a tweet late Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders negated such reports and stated that she had confirmed the same with Trump and that the President shared a “good working relationship” with McMaster and “there are no changes at the NSC.”Economic DataOn the economic data front, housing starts for the month of February came in at 1,236,000, below the consensus estimate of 1,292,000. On the other hand, building permits came in at 1,298,000, below the consensus estimate of 1,310,000.Meanwhile, University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index rose to 102 for the month of March to hit its highest level since 2004.Weekly RoundupFor the week, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq declined 1.5%, 1.2% and 1%, respectively. During this period, President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former CEO of Exxon Mobil Inc. (XOM  -  Free Report). Tillerson has been replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, while Pompeo’s position will be taken over by Gina Haspel, CIA’s deputy director.Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment. President Trump was expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly in the process.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEni Releases Growth-Friendly Strategic Plan for 2018-2021Eni SpA (E  -  Free Report) has released its strategic plan for 2018-2021, signifying a usual progression of the same executed in the previous years and intends to continue boosting all business value.

Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 26.1% on 14.9% revenue growth with 68.4% companies beating EPS estimates and 63.2% beating revenue estimates.While the proportion of positive earnings and revenue surprises are on the lower side, the pace of growth is tracking above the historical periods. As a result, retail ETFs SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) gained 2.4%, 4.4% and 3.1%, respectively, in the past month (read: US Retail Rise: ETFs in Focus).The focus has now shifted to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) that are expected to report this week. Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of these retailers. These have the potential to push the abovementioned ETFs upward or downward.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A Peek into the Earnings Lined UpHome Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on May 15. The stock has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.36%. The company saw negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter but delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 2.88%. The stock has a VGM Score of B.Macy’s has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.50%, indicating a reasonable chance of beating estimates this quarter. The stock witnessed positive earnings estimate revision of four cents for the to-be-reported quarter in the past seven days. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends for Macy’s. Additionally, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.28% in the last four quarters and has a VGM Score of A. The company is expected to report before the opening bell on May 16 (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Nordstrom, which will likely report earnings on May 17 after the closing bell, has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +10.32%. Though the stock is expected to post year-over-year earnings decline of 2.33%, it delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 16.81%. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days and has a VGM Score of A. Wal-Mart is scheduled to report on May 17 before market open. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.77%. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 1.50% in the last four quarters and has seen positive earnings estimate revision by a penny over the past month for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, it has a VGM Score of A.ConclusionWhile the sector has an unfavorable Zacks Rank in the bottom 44%, some earnings surprises are in the cards. Most retailers witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions. So, the space will continue to see smooth trading in the days ahead (read: Q1 GDP Growth Beats Estimates: ETFs to Buy).In particular, retail ETFs could stand out well as the funds can easily counter shocks from some of the industry’s biggest components, given their exposure to a number of firms in various types of industries like specialty retail, hypermarkets, drug stores, food retail, Internet retail and many others. Further, the ETFs mentioned above have favorable ranks. Notably, XRT has a Zacks ETF Rank #1, PMR has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 and RTH has a Zacks ETF Rank #3.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?

3318,HD,"We start a new trading week being given something of a breather: no major economic data is scheduled for release, no speeches from any members of the Federal Open Market Committee regarding interest rate policy, and even Q1 earnings season has entered its cyclical cooling phase (big Retail, small Tech and small Pharma companies mostly yet to report). We will be seeing earnings results from Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), among others this week, but for now we can enjoy the relative silence.That’s not to suggest things are silent elsewhere around the globe; indeed, we’re seeing geopolitical struggles among idealist lines (Socialism, fascism, etc.) the world over. There is also Middle East tension spilling over into deadly armed conflict, most newsworthy this weekend between Israel and Palestinians on the Gaza Strip. And whenever we see this general region begin to boil over, we can expect oil and gas prices to spike. Yet the U.S. economy is robust, the dollar is strong, and the stock markets have gained steadiness — witness the Dow’s current 7-day string of gains.In fact, our current market reminds of nothing so much as the 1980s. A charismatic Republican in the White House slashing taxes and making broad moves in foreign policy, the U.S. providing clear economic leadership among advanced and advancing countries both, GDP estimates once again breaking north of 3%, and more deregulation coming to the banking and energy industries. Yet a plague of domestic drug addiction, growing incidents of gun violence, and socio-economic turmoil in Latin America (Nicaragua and El Salvador in the ‘80s, Venezuela today) illustrate the other side of this 80s coin.However, spiking oil prices in the Middle East will have less of an impact here at home compared to 30-35 years ago, at which time we were much more reliant on those oil-rich countries, before fracking turned the U.S. once again into one of the top — if not the top (soon) — oil and gas producer in the world. Though then and now we saw strong GDP growth and low unemployment, back in the 80s we were still ratcheting down from extremely high interest rate levels, and these days we’re only seeing incremental shifts upward from historically low levels.Also, in the 80s, Tech was still a high-growth industry, not yet fully realizing its economic potential. College students studied programming and entered the field straight out of school; these days, Tech is rich, mature and having its issues finding enough new employees with the proper skillsets to continue their growth trajectories, especially with a dampening of current U.S. immigration policy in play. Further, back in the MTV era, China was merely an economic plot-point for American industries to potentially address; today China owns tons of U.S. debt, supplies most of our cheap goods and is in danger of entering a trade war with the U.S.So for all the similarities, we are also in a unique place currently. The best thing about history is that it’s there to be studied — if we can learn from the mistakes we made back in the 80s (consider things like the market crash of ’87), we can move forward even more strongly than we did then, more strongly than we are at present. Market futures 20 minutes before the open are modestly in the green; no major headlines are anticipated to shift market participants’ attitude at this hour.

3319,HD,"The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is all set to strengthen its tech background by adding more than 1,000 employees to the technology team in 2018. This is surely going to give its peers, including Lowe’s Companies Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) and the nation’s largest online retailer, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), a tough fight. Home Depot is among the few leading brick-and-mortar retailers that are making headway in the tech world to support its hold in the industry. This $207.3-billion company grew sales to a remarkable $101 billion in 2017, leaving behind arch-rival Lowe’s sales of just $68.6 billion for the year.The home improvement biggie showed tremendous potential, with shares rising more than 21% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.6% and the S&P 500 index’s 15.2% upside. Furthermore, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s might is evident from returns of 143.5% garnered in the last five years. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Much of this growth can be attributed to the company’s efforts to create a balance between the physical and digital world by building interconnected capabilities.Home Depot’s announcement to boost the tech team by more than 1,000 hires in 2018 is its biggest hiring plan so far, well supporting its $11.1-billion three-year strategic investment plan, declared in December 2017. The addition of new members will bolster the company’s already strong tech team by more than a third. It currently employs nearly 2,800 technology staff. These new hires will be mostly placed in technology centers in Atlanta, Austin and Dallas, with Atlanta attracting a larger share of the hiring. The hiring roles will mainly comprise software engineering, user experience design, network engineering and product management.This hiring plan is likely to kick start the company’s strategic investment plan that focuses on enhancing in-store and online customer experiences, improving the supply chain and speeding up deliveries while ensuring efficient workforce management. Key targets under the plan include generating total sales of $115-120 through 2020, with a compounded annual sales growth rate of 4.5-6%; operating margin of 14.4-15%; annual average capital spending of about 2.5% of sales and return on invested capital of more than 40%. This will help Home Depot to retain its leading position in the hardware segment by enhancing customer experience and shareholder value.Driven by its efforts to remain tech-savvy, Home Depot was recently named as one of Fast Company's 50 Most Innovative Companies. The company effectively uses technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, big data, machine learning, and voice and visual recognition capabilities, which enabled it to augment the shopper’s experiences.Well, Home Depot is not the only retailer, trying to fend off Amazon’s dominance. Competitor Lowe’s is right behind with the strategy of streamlining stores portfolio. This, along with its strategy of enhancing customer shopping experience and merchandising transformation, is likely to generate incremental sales. Further, Lowe’s refurbished its pro-service business website, LowesForPros.com, to cater to the needs of its Pro-customers. Additionally, its efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities, along with strategic acquisitions, bode well.Though Lowe’s has been trying varied strategies to mend its business, Home Depot somehow has an edge over the latter due to its focus on information technology. In fact, even though Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT  -  Free Report) price-matching and discounts strategies are helping it compete head-to-head with Amazon, this has little offense to Home Depot’s solid market positioning, both online and offline.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3320,HD,"Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) is opening its largest shop ever with the new Reserve Roastery in Shanghai, on Dec 5, in a bid to counter sluggish U.S. sales. Starbucks is testing its upscale and super-sized cafe concept in its fastest-growing market of China.The 30,000-square-feet store has more than 100 beverages on the menu, and allows customers to participate in the first AR (augmented reality) experience from Starbucks. This is the second-ever Starbucks Roastery while its first was opened in Seattle in 2014. The coffee chain giant also has plans to bring this Roastery concept to New York in 2018 and another to Chicago in 2019.Expansion in ChinaThe Starbucks brand is gaining popularity across Asia with increasing investments in Asian markets. Particularly, China is the fastest-growing market for Starbucks. Management believes that China and the Asia-Pacific region will drive more meaningful business growth over the next five years supported by rapid unit expansion, wider brand awareness, and increased usage of digital/mobile/loyalty platforms. Starbucks currently (as of Oct 1, 2017) operates 7,479 stores across China-Asia-Pacific or CAP. The company remains on track to have roughly 11,000 locations in CAP (600 in China alone) in fiscal 2018.Revenues from the CAP region, accounting for 14% of Starbucks’ revenues for fiscal 2017, were up 10% in fiscal 2017. Same-store sales grew 8% in China during the last-reported quarter (its strongest in nine quarters), compared with 2% globally.Even in July 2017, the company announced its plans of acquiring the remaining 50% share of its East China business from Uni-President Enterprises Corporation and President Chain Store Corporation. The deal, which is the largest acquisition made by Starbucks to date, is valued at $1.3 billion.Following the deal, the company will own 1,300 stores in three Chinese provinces. The transaction, which is slated to close by early calendar year 2018, is expected to add $1 billion to the top line in the first year and see a breakeven to slightly accretive earnings in the first year. Importantly, the company believes that joining its China business will lead to acceleration in its East China business.Starbucks' business in China is growing rapidly due to innovative store designs, local product innovations and the success of the My Starbucks Rewards program. Beyond China, the company is facilitating growth in countries like Japan, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. Starbucks expects to triple its profits in the CAP and Europe, Middle East and Africa business over the next five years.Increasing revenues in the Americas segment (accounting for 70% of total revenues) have been a big challenge for Starbucks for the last few quarters. The company has been experiencing tepid comps growth in the United States for quite a while now amid persistent decline in the country’s restaurant sales. Starbucks reported only 3% comps growth in fiscal 2017 against 6% in the year-ago period in the Americas segment.Evidently, the company’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Restaurant Industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has returned 5.8% while its industry has gained 13.5%.Nonetheless, increased investments in the company’s fastest growing market, successful innovations, best-in-class loyalty program and digital offerings will likely help this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company to offset the soft sales trend in the United States.Stocks Worth a LookA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (ARCO  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and RH (RH  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Arcos Dorados is expected to register 16.2% EPS growth this year.Current-year earnings for Home Depot are expected to grow 14.2%.RH’s current-year earnings are projected to grow 130.2%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3321,HD,"Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) is progressing well with the integration of Family Dollar, which is contributing significantly to the company’s results. Also, it has been benefiting from its strategic initiatives and store expansion program. Evidently, the company posted robust third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, following which management raised its outlook for the year.Shares of Dollar Tree have gained 6.9% since it reported third-quarter results on Nov 21. So far this year, the stock has rallied 37.8%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.4%. Also, it has a VGM Score of B with a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.1%. In fact, the solid quarterly results and raised outlook have increased optimism among analysts. This is quite apparent from the uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Positive Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has moved up 5 cents to $1.85 and 15 cents to $4.81, respectively, in the past 30 days. Also, for fiscal 2018, the estimate has moved north by 17 cents to $5.21. This resulted from Dollar Tree’s spectacular performance in the fiscal third quarter, which also marked the company’s second straight earnings and sales beat. The company posted quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share that improved 40.3% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of 90 cents. Additionally, comparable store sales (comps) for the third quarter increased 3.2% in constant-currency driven by improved customer count and average ticket. Including the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, comps improved 3.3%. Notably, this marks the 39th straight time of comps growth. (Read: Dollar Tree Stock Jumps on Q3 Earnings Beat, View Up)For 2017, management now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $4.64-$4.73 per share compared with $4.44-$4.60, projected earlier. Also, Dollar Tree provided a solid outlook and anticipates earnings in the band of $1.80-$1.89 per share for the fourth quarter.Growth CatalystsDollar Tree’s long-term growth strategy remains intact. We believe that the company is progressing well with its growth initiatives, which include store expansion strategies, enhancement of store productivity, creating new store formats, tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve its patrons better. Further, we remain confident that the company will continue to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix, rolling out freezers/coolers at stores along with multi-price point expansion to boost top-line performance.Meanwhile, Dollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements. The company also leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets, which enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. Apparently, in the third quarter, the company opened 169 outlets.Bottom LineOptimistic analysts’ view along with the company's robust growth strategies makes this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a favorable pick for investors.Three More Stocks That Witnessed Favorable Estimate Revisions LatelyThe fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 consensus mark for Hibbett Sports, Inc.

3322,HD,"Welcome to the ninth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business of Major League Soccer ahead of Saturday’s championship matchup between the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC.The MLS has grown in both size and stature in recent years. Just last week, the MLS announced four cities—Cincinnati, Detroit, Nashville, and Sacramento—as finalists for two new expansion franchises, with a whopping $150 million price tag attached.On top of that, the league’s TV ratings and attendance numbers have climbed in 2017. Team valuations also continue to rise, as notable owners from the NFL and NBA, such as Robert Kraft and Paul Allen, help inspire other billionaires to get in on the growth of MLS.The league’s TV partners—Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), Univision, and others—broadcasted more games than ever before, many in new primetime spots on flagship channels.Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is firmly committed to MLS and growing the sport of soccer in the U.S. The German sportswear giant keeps on pouring money into the league through jersey deals and youth development.MLS is also a corporate sponsors dream, given the ability to advertise directly on team jerseys. This is something Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (ALK  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and many others have embraced. Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) are also all current MLS partners and sponsors.Still, despite all of these positive signs and real growth, many people around the U.S. question the current and long-term viability of the relatively young MLS.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

3323,HD,"Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected fourth quarter results Tuesday on the back of a strong U.S. housing market. This has some investors looking promisingly towards fellow industry giant Lowe’s (LOW), which is set to report its Q4 earnings next week.Earlier this week, Home Depot posted adjusted earnings of $1.69 per share, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62 and marked a strong year-over-year surge. The Atlanta-based company’s Q4 revenues also topped estimates, thanks in part to a 7.5% jump in comparable-store sales (also read: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Keeps Earnings Beat Trend in Q4, Guides FY18).The industry bellwether’s strong performance could signal that Lowe’s is also due to post solid fourth quarter results. But how likely is the company to outperform? Let’s take a closer look.Lowe’s is expected to see its quarterly earnings gain 2.33% to hit $0.88 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s full-year EPS figure is projected to climb by more than 13% to reach $4.52 per share. Yet these projections do not provide investors with enough information to gauge if Lowe’s is on track to surpass these estimates.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Lowe’s is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 1.03%. This means earnings estimates have been higher directly ahead of Lowe’s Q4 report date, so investors should consider this stock as one with strong prospects to beat earnings next weekInvestors should note that Lowe’s topped earnings estimates last quarter by nearly 3%. Lowe’s is set to report its fourth-quarter and full fiscal year earnings before the opening bell on Wednesday, Feb. 28.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3324,HD,"Delta Apparel, Inc. (DLA  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 5, after the closing bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this lifestyle basics and branded active wear apparel designer and marketer will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be reported quarter. The company has delivered a negative earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 79.8%Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents for the first quarter has been stable over the last 30 days. However, the estimate reflects an improvement of 25% from a loss of 8 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $78 million for the impending quarter, down 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Influencing the QuarterDelta Apparel has been struggling with declines at brick-and-mortar stores for a while. Further, the company’s Branded segment has been witnessing lower sales for the last few quarters, primarily due to the sale of its Junkfood Clothing business. Additionally, general market softness, customer bankruptcies, several weather disruptions along with a challenging retail backdrop has been hurting the company’s performance and overall profitability.As a result, the company’s shares have declined 12.1% in the past three months against the industry’s growth of 21.2%. Nevertheless, management stated that it began fiscal 2018 on a solid note when it recently reported preliminary first-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The company projects overall net sales in the band of $88-$90 million, up 3-5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the revenues from the divestiture of Junkfood business, it depicts growth of 16-18%.Notably, the quarter witnessed double-digit year-over-year sales increase and robust execution across each of its businesses despite it being the seasonally slowest quarter. The improvement was driven by enhanced distribution and improved product offerings as well as gain in market share. Also, the latest Salt Life and Soffe retail outlets opened in the quarter aided results via brand-building and consumer awareness opportunities. Markedly, the solid sales results keeps management encouraged about delivering pre-tax profit in the first quarter, as against a loss reported in the same period last year.So, let’s wait and see whether these strategic endeavors are reflected in the upcoming results and provide cushion to the stock.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Delta Apparel is likely to beat earnings estimates in the first quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Delta Apparel has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 6 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

3326,HD,"U.S. economy has been on rally mode since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the Trump administration.Economic Scenario and Tax ReformUnited States’ GDP grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared with 3.2% in the previous quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the economy to register a growth rate of 3% in the final three months of 2017. However, U.S. retail sales grew 4.2% in 2017 compared with 3.2% in 2016, showing signs of a strengthening economy (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).     Moreover, Trump’s tax reform is expected to significantly benefit U.S. companies. Financials are expected to be among the major winners from the tax reform, as companies with a high effective tax rate are expected to have a significantly lower tax bill.Large-cap companies will be able to repatriate a significant portion of overseas earnings at a lower tax rate. For the sake of argument, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) announced its plans of bringing most of the $252.3 billion offshore cash back to the United States, following Trump’s tax reform. The repatriation is expected to generate a one-time tax payment of $38 billion (read: Profit From Apple's Big Plans With These ETF).Consumer Sentiment and InfrastructureComing to consumer sentiment, Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence increased to 125.4 in January compared with 122.1 in the prior month. It surpassed economists’ expectations of 123.1.Per a CNBC article, citing a statement by Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board, ""Expectations improved, though consumers were somewhat ambivalent about their income prospects over the coming months, perhaps the result of some uncertainty regarding the impact of the tax plan,"" adding, ""Consumers remain quite confident that the solid pace of growth seen in late 2017 will continue into 2018"".Moving on to infrastructure, Trump addressed the need to rebuild America’s troubling infrastructure by a bipartisan agreement between the two parties. In his State of the Union Speech, Trump said, “I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs.”Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to financial stocks in the U.S. equity markets.It has AUM of $34.8 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year.

3327,HD,"The onset of the holiday season this year seems to have ushered confidence in retailers, who had been reeling under a tough environment characterized by increased competition from online retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and lower footfall.  The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Monikerless Sunday and Cyber Monday, marked a good start to a promising holiday season.The spending data from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday indicates that the U.S. retail industry is ready to shed all worries and embrace a profitable holiday season this year. Data from the nation’s largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) revealed that more than 174 million Americans shopped in-stores and online during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, leaving behind its estimate to engage 164 million shoppers.Further, the trade group estimates that Americans spent an average of about $335.47 during the five-day period, with about $250.78 or 75% spent for buying gifts. Among the shoppers, older Millennials aged between 25 and 34 years turned out to be the biggest spenders this year, spending nearly $419.52 on an average.Omni-Channel Retail Is InApart from improving optimism for the holiday season, the five-day shopping fest clearly reflected that omni-channel has become the order of the day and retailers’ investments toward providing a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores, has paid off big time. The long weekend attracted more than 64 million shoppers to make purchases both online and in-stores. Additionally, there were shoppers who chose to buy only at stores or only online. Notably, the weekend saw more than 58 million people shop only online, while over 51 million people chose to shop only in stores.NRF revealed that the omni-channel shoppers spent $82 more on average compared with the people shopping only online. Furthermore, average spending of these shoppers was $49 more than people shopping only in stores.Top Shopping Days – In Store & OnlineThe two top days for in-store shopping this year were Black Friday and Small Business Saturday, when 77 million and 55 million shoppers, respectively, stepped out of their homes to take advantage of the big deals.Meanwhile, online shopping was most popular on Cyber Monday with more than 81 million shoppers using their computers, smart phones and tablets to shop. This popular online shopping day raked in online sales of a record $6.59 million, as per Adobe Analytics. Reflecting a $1 billion (or 16.8%) growth from last year, this day marked the largest online shopping day in U.S. history.Another popular online shopping day, as surveyed by NRF, was Black Friday with more than 66 million shoppers turning to online deals on this day.Further, shopping through mobile devices was the most prominent trend during this year’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period, as nearly 63% of customers used their smart phones to make buying decisions while 29% used it to actually buy goods.The BeneficiariesNotably, the long weekend had all favorable factors from a pleasant weather to low unemployment rate and improved consumer confidence that encouraged shoppers get going with their shopping lists, in preparation for Christmas. The most popular items on sale during the weekend were televisions, laptops, toys and gaming consoles. Driven by the huge discounts and promotions, retailers witnessed a splurge in traffic and online conversion trends, which is likely to make up for an otherwise tough year.Further, this five-day shopping fest saw trends reverse for some retailers, particularly department stores, which bore the brunt of a tough retailing environment. Notably, department stores were at the top of this season’s top shopping destinations attracting 43% shoppers. This was followed by online retailers (42%), electronic stores (32%), clothing and accessories stores (31%) and discount stores (31%).The Black Friday event witnessed some big sales coming from Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), which aired many lucrative offers shoppers couldn’t resist. Much of this is also attributed to the fact that shoppers have lately realized the importance of in-store purchases for large items for their homes. We believe this trend is surely going to benefit Best Buy this holiday season and into 2018.Another stock that is ready to make it big this holiday season, knocking down competition from online giant — Amazon, is Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report). Apart from offering car loading services for groceries, Wal-Mart is pushing hard to compete with Amazon on price and service grounds.The success of Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales not only set the cash registers ringing, it also led the retail stocks trade higher. This was particularly true for Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Best Buy and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), that witnessed 4.5%, 1.4%, 1.8% and 1.4%, respectively, after a blockbuster Cyber Monday on Nov 27.This gives all the reasons to be optimistic about the performance of retailers this holiday season. At this juncture, it would be wise to invest in stocks that promise returns this season. Out of the stocks mentioned above, Wal-Mart and Home Depot carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Amazon, Target, Macy’s and Best Buy carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Holiday Sales ProjectionOverall, NRF projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.Moreover, Deloitte projects holiday season sales to go up as much as 4.5%, while e-commerce sales are envisioned to improve 18-21%.Bottom LineThe start to the 2017 holiday season certainly looks promising. However, it remains to be seen if this momentum is sustained until the Christmas bells ring and how many retail bellwethers can really take the competition to Amazon.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

3329,HD,"Central Garden & Pet Company (CENT  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 7, after the closing bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading lawn & garden and pet supplies’ producer and marketer will be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the to-be reported quarter. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 20% after 12 straight quarters of earnings beat.Central Garden & Pet Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Central Garden & Pet Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Central Garden & Pet Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Estimates & Stock Performance In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter has inched up by a penny to 15 cents, in the last 30 days. Also, the estimate reflects year-over-year growth of 25% from 12 cents in the prior-year quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $434.3 million for the impending quarter, up nearly 3.5% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the consensus estimates for net sales at the Pet and the Garden segments are currently pegged at $315 million and $116 million, respectively. In the year-ago period, the company registered net sales of $304 million and $115.5 million for the Pet and the Garden segments, respectively.The company forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Per the Earnings Preview  dated Jan 26, the sector’s earnings are expected to decline 1.4% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 while revenues are likely to be up 3.6%.In the past six months, shares of Central Garden & Pet have gained 22.8% against the industry’s decline of 9.1%.Factors Influencing 1Q18Organic growth, value accretive acquisitions and divestment of non-strategic assets have been the major strengths for Central Garden & Pet. Management is also revamping both the Pet and the Garden segments and aims to have a balanced approach that encompasses improvement in revenues through operational efficiency and cost reduction. Further, it intends to launch several products that appeal to customers as well as upgrade customer service.These initiatives are likely to boost the company’s top line and overall profitability. Evidently, the company’s Pet segment recorded ninth successive quarter of organic sales growth in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. This came on the back of robust performance at the dog & cat businesses. Additionally, Central Garden & Pet’s diversified portfolio of brands and effective inventory management are expected to drive growth.Nevertheless, seasonality of garden business and cautious approach by customers toward discretionary spending remain concerns.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Central Garden & Pet is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Central Garden & Pet has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 15 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:PVH Corp. (PVH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.98% and a Zacks Rank of 3.The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.29% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3331,HD,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is amongst those companies who regularly enhance its shareholders’ value via dividend payouts and share buybacks. Additionally, the company has been consistently increasing dividend rate every year since 2001. Keeping up with the trend, Colgate increased quarterly dividend by 5% to 42 cents from the previous payout of 40 cents per share. Effective second-quarter 2018, this will bring the company’s annualized dividend to $1.68 per share. The new dividend will be paid on May 15, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Apr 20.On Jan 11, 2018, Colgate declared its first-quarter cash dividend of 40 cents per share, paid on Feb 15.In fact, the company has to its credit a robust history of rewarding shareholders with regular quarterly dividend payouts since 1895. Since then, Colgate has paid dividends every quarter, even amid economic crises like the Great Depression of the 1930s, stagflation in the 1970s and the recession of 2008.However, following the latest dividend hike not much movement was noticed in the company’s share price yesterday. In the past three months, the stock has lost 4.8%, narrower than the industry’s decline of 8.8%.Notably, dividend hikes not only enhance shareholders’ return but raise the market value of the stock as well. In fact, through these dividend increases companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling it. Now, it remains to be seen whether this recent hike will help Colgate in regaining the lost momentum.Prior to the current dividend hike, management had raised quarterly dividend by 3% to 40 cents per share versus 39 cents, in March 2017. Apart from highlighting commitment toward creating shareholder value, regular dividend payments and increments, reflect the company’s potential to enhance earnings and cash flow generation capabilities. Evidently, in 2017, the company returned about $2.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which marked a year-over-year increase of nearly 3%. Also, this leading manufacturer of consumer products generated $3,054 million of cash from operations in and deployed $553 million toward capital expenditures the same time period.Apart from Colgate, companies like Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) remain keen on rewarding shareholders through share repurchases and regular dividend payments. Recently, these companies have also declared dividend hikes.Archer Daniels raised its dividend by 4.7% to 33.5 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 13, 2018. Home Depot declared a 15.7% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.03 per share, payable on Mar 22.

3332,HD,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) may be next on Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) buyout list. This is what Loup Venture co-founder Gene Munster predicts, per media reports. The forecast made by the famous tech analyst is enough to shake the retail industry, which has certainly been facing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns.Munster highlighted that given “shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count” Target remains a perfect choice for Amazon. Munster added that if the acquisition takes place, Amazon may have to shell out $41 billion, which reflects a premium of approximately 15% to Target’s current value. Shares of Target were up 3.7% during the trading session yesterday.If the prediction comes true, this would be Amazon’s second major buyout after Whole Foods, in its quest to become a dominant player in the retail industry. With the acquisition Amazon’s store count would jump to roughly 2,300, including Whole Foods’ approximately 470 stores but will still be lower than Wal-Mart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) mammoth count of more than 11,600 stores. Industry experts believe that the amalgamation between online marketplace and physical stores could bring a massive change in the retail industry going forward.In fact, retail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar. The scenario has drastically changed with the advancement of technology and digital transformation that are playing key roles. Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another. Nevertheless, this transition has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target is no exception to the trend.Well only time will tell, whether Amazon acquires Target. But for now the latter has undertaken strategic endeavors to fast adapt to the ultra-competitive retail environment.How is Target Adapting to the Changing Retail Picture?No wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. We believe that initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores, bode well. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. We observed that comparable digital channel sales surged 24% during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and added 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales.This general merchandise retailer recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Wal-Mart and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) are also using Google's voice-activated shopping platform. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Certainly, Target is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further.

3333,HD,"Though the U.S. stock market has had a spectacular run in 2017 on strong global economic growth and optimism related to President Trump’s pro-business policies, stock trading has been tight in the shortened-holiday week due to low volumes. However, several events led to major positive or negative movements in some corners of the market. Here are a few of the developments:Market MoversThe tech sector has been in the news this week, owing to recent developments relating to Apple’s latest product, the iPhone X. Reports of weaker iPhone X demand led to a sell-off in shares of Apple and its suppliers, driving the tech sector lower. Per a Reuters article citing Taiwan’s Economic Daily’s report, Apple is expected to slash its forecast sales of its flagship phone in the current quarter to 30 million units from the previous estimate of 50 million units.The S&P 500 Technology sub-sector nosedived as a result. Moreover, various market analyses predict that the tech sector will not benefit as much as expected earlier from President Donald Trump’s tax reform that was passed into law last week.Another major sector that was in news was the retail sector. The retail sector saw holiday sales jump to a six-year high. U.S. retail holiday sales increased 4.9% year over year in the Nov 1-Dec 24 period, compared with 3.7% last year. Moving on to the online sales space, Amazon saw a blockbuster season. Moreover, per a Reuters’ report, the online retail behemoth is in talks with authorities to expand into Saudi Arabia, which led to a rally in the company’s share price (read: Holiday Sales At 6-Year High: Best Consumer ETFs & Stocks).Moving on to the energy sector, crude oil prices have been rallying owing to a set of events. Crude breached $60 a barrel this week, the highest since June 2015. This was primarily helped by an extension in supply cuts into late 2018 by OPEC and an explosion in a crude pipeline in Libya. Moreover, per the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. commercial crude inventories decreased by 4.6 million barrels in the week ended Dec 22 compared with a Wall Street Journal analysis predicting a decline of 3.7 million barrels.On the industrial metal side, strength in commodity prices led to a rally in U.S. equities. Copper prices rallied to a near four-year high on Dec 27, 2017, driven by strong import demand from China. Imports of refined copper increased 19% year over year in November to 329,168 tons.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the U.S. technology sector.

3334,HD,"The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has been gaining from robust earnings trend, disciplined capital allocation, growth of pro-category, steady housing market recovery and strong consumer demand. This has helped the company’s stock surge 41.5% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 35.6% growth.  Additionally, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock boasts a VGM Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4%. Let’s delve into the other factors which are driving the stock.Robust Earnings Trend & Outlook Drive EstimatesThe company’s both top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017. While sales marked fifth straight beat, earnings retained its five-year long trend of positive surprises. Results gained from strength in the company’s core business, continued focus on introducing innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity. Further, the company continued to reap the benefits of a steady housing market recovery and strong customer demand.Backed by solid year-to-date performance, strength of its core business and estimated gains from hurricane recovery activities, the company raised fiscal 2017 sales and earnings guidance. Consequently, the company’s estimates witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 moved up by 1 cent each to $1.62 and $7.37, respectively.Merchandising Efforts & Focus on Pro-CustomersHome Depot is gaining from consistent focus on improving customer experience and solid execution, retaining its leading position in the home improvement industry. The company has been revamping itself by concentrating on square footage growth and maximizing productivity from its existing stores. Further, the company remains focused on developing merchandising tools and increasing investment in e-commerce to boost the top line and enhance market share.The company has also been gaining from its focus on Professional Customers or Pro-Customers and has undertaken several strides in this regard, like the acquisition of Compact Power Equipment. Prior to this, the company invested in Interline brands and maintenance, repair and operations products, which are generating impressive results.Building Interconnected CapabilitiesIn response to the changing customer preferences, Home Depot has been building its interconnected capabilities to establish sync between physical and digital stores. For this, the company redesigned its website with enhanced features for better search and faster checkout, upgraded mobile app, and addition of the estimated time of arrival feature.Further, the company improved fulfillment options by launching its customer order management system and the Buy Online Deliver From Store capability. These initiatives led online sales to improve nearly 19% in third-quarter fiscal 2017, representing 6.2% of total sales. We believe that these initiatives will drive the company’s top- and bottom-line growth in the long run.Deterrents on Home Depot’s Growth TrajectoryDespite such positives, Home Depot continues to be plagued by strained gross margin over the past few quarters. While hurricane-related activities aided comps growth, gross margins on such sales were significantly below the company’s average. Evidently, the company’s gross margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Prior to this, the company’s gross margin declined 6 bps in the preceding quarter, and 10 bps each in first-quarter fiscal 2017 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2016. Moreover, management expects gross margin to decline about 12 bps from last year in fiscal 2017.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

3335,HD,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) sunk 1% on Wednesday morning after one of the e-commerce power’s longest-serving executives left the company to a take a roll at Airbnb. However, Amazon shares have since rebounded after reports surfaced that it invested in another home electronics startup and will offer steep discounts on its Prime membership to select customers.Top Exec Out The former VP of Amazon Prime, Greg Greeley, who helped create the business and was also involved in integrating Whole Foods, announced recently that he was set to move on to pursue a new challenge. Vacation rental super startup Airbnb just introduced Greeley as the new president of its “Home” business.Greely joined Amazon just a few years after the company went public and has been an integral part of one of its biggest consume-facing business operations.Smart Thermostat Amazon, through its Amazon Alexa Fund, was reportedly part of the $62 million series C round of funding for smart thermostat brand Ecobee, according to a CNBC report. The startup already comes with built-in Amazon Alexa voices services.Ecobee’s software also allows its devices to work with systems from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), IFTTT, Google  and Samsung. The products, which vary in price, can cost up to $250 and are currently sold on Amazon and in stores at Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report), and Apple.The news comes roughly a week after Amazon announced its purchase of connected doorbell company, Ring—for a reported $1 billion. Amazon’s latest investment also comes after the company decided that it would no longer sell some products from Google’s Nest smart home division.Lower Prime Prices Amazon will now offer customers who receive Medicaid the option to purchase a Prime membership at a discounted rate of $5.99 a month, a discount from the company’s new $12.99 rate. Amazon’s discount plan comes after the company rolled out discounted pricing for customers who hold a valid Electronic Benefits Transfer card.Amazon plans to grab more customers through discounted pricing. However, the company also noted that it hopes to give more people access to additional “aspects of the digital economy — some conveniences and benefits — that I think a lot of us take for granted,” Amazon executive Aaron Perrine told Recode.If widely adopted, Amazon could expand the reach of its hugely popular e-commerce business and delivery services and further encroach on Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) by grabbing more lower-income customers.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

3336,HD,"After three consecutive days of gains, benchmarks finished in the red on Tuesday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments renewed concerns over increase in the pace of rate hikes. Powell in his speech to Congress indicated that the U.S. economy is strengthening and signaled that the key rate might be increased at a gradual pace. However, investors fretted that the central bank’s move to stop the economy from overheating might lead to not just three but even four more rate increases this year. How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 1.2%, or 300.96 points, to close at 25,410.03. The S&P 500 fell 1.3% to close at 2,744.28. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,330.35, losing 1.2%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 17.7% to close at 18.59. A total of 7.4 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, considerably lower than the last 20-session average of 8.3 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Markets Stumbles as Rate Hike Fears LoomIn his first appearance on Capitol Hill, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell presented an encouraging picture of the U.S economy. Powell expressed confidence that the coming few years will be “good years for the economy”. After all, Americans are willing to spend more and business houses have ramped up their investments, helping to boost productivity.Consequently, traders predicted that an upbeat economy will fuel inflation further and prompt the Fed to step in and hike rates at a faster pace.  Many of them are already predicting the Fed will increase rates four times instead of three. According to data from the CME Group, odds of four rate hikes by year-end rose to 33% on Tuesday from about 20% on Monday.For the time being, Powell maintained that the Fed would keep to its plan of hiking rates three times this year. But, he did mention that “we’ve seen some data that will in my case add some confidence to my view that inflation is moving up to target”.Following a three-day long rally, all the key U.S. indexes declined as investors remained wary of an increase in the pace of rate hikes. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their worst daily performance in percentage terms since Feb 8. The Dow registered a slump of more than 300 points. For the S&P 500 index, all the 11 sectors finished in the red, with the real estate and consumer discretionary sectors emerging as the biggest drags on the S&P 500.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) fell 2.14%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Some of its key holdings, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and American Tower Corporation (REIT) (AMT  -  Free Report) fell 3.2% and 1.4%, respectively.Additionally, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) decreased 2.12%, which was the worst performing sector in the S&P 500. Its key components like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) declined 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Both the retailers have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

TransUnion delivered an impressive average positive surprise of 10.3% in the trailing four quarters, beating estimates in each.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayTransUnion’s attractive business model with diversified revenue streams, significant operating leverage, low-capital requirements, and strong and stable cash flow have produced consistent operating results in the recent times.During the quarter, the acquisition of Factor Trust — one of the fastest growing companies specializing in the field of alternative credit data, analytics and risk scoring information — was a strategic move by TransUnion. We anticipate the buyout to have a favorable impact on the company’s results.Top-Line ExpansionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for TransUnion’s fourth-quarter revenues is $488 million, higher than reported revenues of $436 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenues are expected across all the segments of the company.The U.S. Information Services segment — the largest revenue-generating segment of the company — is expected to generate $297 million, higher than the reported figure of $268 million in the prior-year quarter.Also, the International and Consumer Interactive segments are expected to generate revenues of $97 million and $105 million, respectively, up from $86 million and $97 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Higher consumer awareness of the risks of identity theft propelled by a greater frequency of cyber-attacks are driving demand in TransUnion’s Consumer Interactive segment.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that TransUnion is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

3338,HD,"Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that are likely to offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 14.Here are seven of the 14 stocks that made it through the screen:MSCI Inc.

In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 cents.Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with a positive earnings surprise of 14.3%. However, it remains to be seen if Thomson Reuters will be able to keep its earnings surprise streak alive this time.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors Influencing Q4Thomson Reuters continues to benefit from greater operating leverage and is likely to record higher revenues and margins in the quarter on the back of its simplification initiatives. Management remains optimistic about the company’s future performance, given its constant endeavors to implement core strategies and achieve financial goals. We believe that its cost-containment efforts, share buyback plan and impressive performance of the underlying subscription revenues bode well.The company’s core subscription businesses continue to perform well and it is encouraging to see its Financial & Risk business — the largest revenue generating segment — reporting strong revenue growth. The company has been working to achieve its earnings target for 2017. It also intends to keep improving its free cash flow per share.Thomson Reuters expects its underlying fundamentals to improve in the last quarter of 2017. The company also expects to benefit from its integrated technology system that takes structured and unstructured information and turns it into a structured taxonomy with a focus on the financial services industry.

Shares of Apple also weighed on the broader markets. Nasdaq suffered broad based losses and declined 23.7 points to end in the red.U.S. Crude Futures Hit 2 ½ -Year HighEnergy stocks rallied on Tuesday after the U.S. Crude futures rose 2.6% to close at $59.97 a barrel for first time since June 2015.

3343,HD,"Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) seems to be gaining from its strategic acquisitions, solid focus on Pro-Customers and robust shareholder-friendly moves. Additionally, a decent job scenario, buoyant consumer confidence, gradual recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives are driving the stock further. Analysts believe that the latest tax reform as well as blissful holiday season may also benefit the stock.Impressively, shares of Lowe's have hit a 52-week high of $89.33 on Dec 19, though it closed a tad lower at $88.86. In fact, in the past one month, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 10.2%, outperforming the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry’s growth of 8.2% that ranks in the top 29% of the Zacks categorized industries (74 out of 256). Also, we are encouraged by the company’s VGM Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 14.7%.Lowe's Canadian business has been performing quite well. The buyout of RONA is likely to further augment its position in the Canadian market. Lowe's Canada entered into a strategic partnership with Solar Brokers Canada to provide solar energy installation services to homeowners under Lowe's Solar banner.

In an effort to strengthen its relationship with pro customers, management has concluded the acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters — the distributor of maintenance, repair and operations products.

3344,HD,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc.’s(WSM  -  Free Report) strong brand portfolio along with focus on innovation and transformation has been the principle growth driving factor.However, investments in e-commerce and supply chain continue to weigh on operating margins, thereby posing a concern.Recently, this multi-channel specialty retailer of premium quality home products announced third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings also increased 7.7% from the year-ago level.Net revenues of $1,299 million were slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,293 million and were up 4.3% year over year. However, net revenues reflect an estimated $7-million impact of lost sales associated with the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Key Growth DriversWilliams-Sonoma is one of the largest e-commerce retailers in the United States.  The e-commerce segment generates around 53% of revenues and has been consistently posting strong results. In fact, in the first nine months of 2017, this segment reported net revenues of $1.9 billion, up 4.2% from the year-ago level. The company’s investments in merchandising of its brands, efficient catalog circulations and digital marketing help drive e-commerce revenues.In addition to focused investment in its e-commerce segment, Williams-Sonoma continuously innovates to keep up with the changing preferences of consumers.The company is currently in the midst of a transformation drive to address the slowdown in traffic and to gain more customers. In fact, the company managed to drive third-quarter traffic by reworking on its marketing strategy, focusing more on digital marketing and investing in store remodeling.ConcernsThe specialty e-commerce and retail businesses are highly competitive. Williams-Sonoma competes with other retailers that market lines of merchandise similar to it. The substantial sales growth in the e-commerce industry in the last decade has encouraged the entry of competitors and new business models as well. Increased competition might dent Williams-Sonoma’s sales and operating results.Moreover, although Williams-Sonoma derives substantial revenues from efficient catalog circulation and digital marketing, it is affected by costs associated with continued investments in e-commerce. Further, supply chain investments are denting the company’s operating margins. In fact, for the first nine months of 2017, the company’s operating margin was 7.1%, down 20 basis points (bps) year over year.Also, the company has been reporting soft comparable brand revenues for quite some time now. The rate of increase in comparable brand revenues has contracted significantly from 8.8% in 2013 and 7.1% in 2014 to 3.7% in 2015 and 0.7% in 2016. In the third quarter of 2017, the company’s West Elm and Pottery Barn comparable brand revenues compared unfavorably with the prior quarter.Meanwhile, shares of Williams-Sonoma have underperformed its industry on a year-to-date basis. The company’s shares have lost 4.4% as against the industry’s gain of 2.6%. Estimates for the current fiscal quarter and year have also moved down 3% and 1.4%, respectively, over the past two months.Nevertheless, strategic initiatives, innovative marketing techniques, focus on innovation and retail optimization are key growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector are Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (BECN  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and RH (RH  -  Free Report).Beacon Roofing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The company’s current-year earnings are expected to increase 19.6%.Current-year earnings for Home Depot are expected to grow 14.1%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).RH carries a Zacks Rank #2. Its current-year earnings are projected to grow 119.3%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3345,HD,"U.S. equity markets are going through a rough patch. There is a lot of political uncertainty as markets predict the odds of the timely passing of President Donald Trump’s tax reform bill. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing (read: 5 Ways to Play Growing Dividends With ETFs).Trump’s ImpactThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, uncertainty over the tax reform has pushed markets lower. Per Washington Post reports, Senate Republican leaders are weighing the impact of a one-year delay in reforms.Although the House approved their version of the bill, there are significant differences in the bill from the Senate’s version. Markets are therefore worried that this could create hindrance in the timely passing of the legislation (read: House Passes Tax Bill: Likely ETF Winners & Losers).Trump aims to cut down on stringent regulations to improve ease of doing business. He especially targets to cut a lot out of the Dodd Frank Act as he thinks it restricts business growth. However, there has been no major development in the space and markets are worried about his ability to pass his promised legislation.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. Although the North Korean supreme has been relatively silent over the past few weeks, there has been other developments in the global markets that has been concerning investors.Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman looked at tightening his grip on power by ordering a crackdown with arrests of royals, ministers and investors. Moreover, Houthi forces in Yemen fired a missile toward Riyadh’s international airport. The missile was intercepted midway and debris landed near the airport.“We see this as an act of war,” the Saudi foreign minister, Adel Jubair, told CNN. Saudi Arabia accused Iran of providing necessary support to the rebels. Increased geopolitical risks have led to an increase in the price of oil and investors’ appeal for safety.In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends, while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

3346,HD,"Investors following the growth or value strategy are always on the lookout for stocks that are poised to see strong growth and are available at a discount. Growth at a reasonable price or GARP investing is a strategy that takes care of these criteria.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is the one of the world's largest home improvement retailers. The company has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 3.87% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

3347,HD,"Traditional retailers have faced a very challenging environment this year due to rising consumer preference for shopping online. Most retail stocks were hammered earlier this year, while Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) shares soared almost 60% year to date, as shopping moved online.Some analysts believe that retail stocks were beaten down too much and we have seen a nice rebound in retailer stocks of late.Further, a strong start to the holiday shopping season boosted optimism for these stocks. Some stores saw strong customer traffic on Black Friday but overall Thanksgiving and Black Friday traffic fell 4% year over year.On the other hand, online sales surged 16.8% year over year to reach a new record of $6.59 billion on Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Insights. Mobile sales hit $2 billion for the first time.Amazon is the biggest beneficiary of this trend, as it accounts for almost 25% of all online sales.At the same time, many other retailers have also invested significantly in their e-commerce operations, which is paying off now.It remains to be seen which retailers would be able survive the Amazon onslaught over the longer-term, but it seems that in the short-term, some of the retail stocks and ETFs may continue to do well. The three most popular ETFs in the space offer very different exposure to retail stocks.Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) that seeks to capitalize on the changing retail landscape, invests in companies that derive significant (70% of more) portion of their revenue from online and virtual sales. This fund is up about 42% this year.On the other hand, the most popular ETF in the retail space—the SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) is down 1.5% year to date, even though it has rebounded nicely and is up more than 11% in the past one month. It is an equal weighted ETFs, which means higher exposure to smaller companies than its market cap weighted peers.Another popular Retail ETF--VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) holds 25 largest US retailers and weights them according to their market cap. Almost 20% of its assets are invested in Amazon. Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) are its other top holdings.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

3348,HD,"Fred’s Inc.  delivered a dismal performance in third-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein both the top and bottom line declined year on year and lagged estimates.Consequently, shares of the company fell 18.7% on Dec 6, post earnings release. Along with disappointing quarterly results, investors’ optimism was marred by the cancellation of quarterly cash dividends.Despite Fred’s efforts to boost traffic, the company has been posting soft sales due to store closures. On account of such headwinds, shares of the company plunged 63.5% in the past six months against the industry’s rally of 12%.Q3 HighlightsThe discount retailer witnessed adjusted quarterly loss of 42 cents per share, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents. Bottom-line results also compared unfavorably with the prior-year quarter’s loss of 27 cents. Including non-recurring and asset impairment costs, quarterly loss was $1.38.Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fred's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fred's, Inc. QuoteQuarterly net sales declined 4.5% year over year to $493.6 million and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $500.5 million. The downturn was mainly due to the closure of 39 underperforming outlets earlier this fiscal.Comps fell 0.8% in the quarter, owing to a negative impact of 36 basis points (bps) stemming from the sale of low productive discontinued inventory. However, the decline was narrower than a 3.8% dip witnessed in the year-ago quarter.The company’s gross profit declined 14.9% year over year to $94.6 million, primarily due to lower sales and increased promotional activity to drive store traffic. Further, gross margin contracted 230 basis points to 19.2% thanks to shift in shipments timing of high margin seasonal products and increased sales of low margin tobacco products and specialty drugs.Fred’s adjusted operating loss (or EBITDA) was $38.8 million in the reported quarter, wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of $32 million. During the quarter, management successfully reduced selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses by 7% to $133.4 million, driven by stringent expense control efforts and store closures.Meanwhile, the company continues to witness flat comp scripts at Retail Pharmacy, on a 90-day year-to-date basis. Also, growth has been in generic dispensing rate owing to the company’s shift to profitable generic prescriptions. In order to improve segments performance, Fred’s has been expanding flu shots capacity along with aggressive inventory management and marketing initiatives.In Specialty Pharmacy business, management continued to build momentum through investing in sales team, therapy diversification and technology.In Front Store operations, management witnessed improved sales trends in tobacco, cosmetics and beer businesses.Financial UpdateFred’s ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 million, long-term portion of indebtedness of $168.1 million and shareholders' equity of $218.3 million.In a separate release, the company also declared the cancellation of dividend to facilitate retention of free cash flow.

The reformed program allows buyback of 3.8 million of the company’s outstanding Class A shares.Store UpdateFred’s currently operates 600 pharmacy and general merchandise stores.

3349,HD,"With President Donald Trump closer to his major legislative move — the biggest tax overhaul in decades — investors have started chasing dividend growth stocks. This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies’ profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn benefit stocks having a history of dividend growth year over year.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 13 stocks that fit the bill:Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated (JLL  -  Free Report): This Illinois-based full-service real estate firm provides management services, corporate and financial services and investment management services to corporations and other real estate owners, users and investors worldwide.

3352,HD,"The Dow traversed a tense week, suffering losses on two consecutive days after a key component cut its dividend significantly. Adding to the index’s woes were lingering concerns over the Trump administration’s ability to push through its much vaunted tax cuts. Ultimately, the Dow rebounded on the penultimate trading day of the week, buoyed once again by encouraging earnings numbers.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow lost 39.73 points to end in the red last Friday. Market watchers speculated about the likely outcome of a delay in tax reforms, proposed last Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee. Shares of Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) declined 1.6% and 1.3%, respectively, and weighed heavily on the Dow. However, shares of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) advanced 2.1% and pared some of the losses for the blue-chip index.The index declined 0.5% over last week, snapping its eight-week winning streak. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans. Although investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cuts may be delayed, markets curtailed part of the declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a Bill to reframe tax reforms.Meanwhile, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) market value jumped over $900 billion for the first time ever. Finally, benchmarks touched new highs last Monday following news of a possible merger between Broadcom and Qualcomm, marking the 26th trading day when an all-time high was achieved by all the three key U.S. indexes in 2017. This is the highest number of record highs achieved in a single year.The Dow This WeekThe index gained a little less than 0.1% on Monday. While tax woes continued to worry investors, gains were capped further after shares of General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) plummeted to a five-year low after releasing weak EPS guidance for 2018. However, gains for The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) boosted the markets.Meanwhile, investors closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. Speaking in Manila Trump commented that he would make an important announcement regarding trade on Wednesday in Washington.The index shed 30.23 points on Tuesday to end in negative territory. Shares of General Electric declined for the second straight day, by 5.9%, to hit its lowest levels since 2011.Moreover, oil prices declined after the International Energy Agency slashed its global crude-demand forecasts. This factor also weighed on the broader markets. Further, lingering tax-reform woes also dampened investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Warren commented that the Republican tax plan would eventually lead to an economic slowdown.The index declined 0.6% on Wednesday after energy shares tanked following a decline in oil prices. This also marked the Dow’s worst one-day drop since Sep 5.Additionally, worries centered on a possible delay in tax reforms also led the markets lower. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee announced major amendments to its version of the tax bill. The proposal abolishes the individual mandate of Obamacare and increases the child tax credit.The Dow rebounded from two days of losses on Thursday, gaining more than 187 points or 0.8%. Strong earnings performances from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) helped propel the index higher. Shares of Wal-Mart and Cisco gained 10.9% and 5.2%, respectively. Additionally, the House passed the Republican-led tax legislation, boosting investor sentiment further.Components Moving the Index General Electric’s shares were down over 4.5% in mid-morning trading on Nov 13 after the company announced that it had slashed its dividend in half, as well as other strategic business decisions. GE has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).The dividend cut marks only GE’s second since the Great Depression, and the company said shareholders’ payout will now be 12 cents a share, down from 24 cents a share; the cut will become effective in December. GE’s only other dividend cut was back during the Great Recession in 2009.GE also unveiled annual profit projections that were well below Wall Street expectations. The company said that 2018 will be a “reset” year, and anticipates profit in the range of $1 and $1.07 per share; analysts were expected $1.15 per share. Additionally, GE is expecting weak free cash flow of roughly $7 billion, about half the company’s normal level. (Read: General Electric Shares are Falling Today: Here's Why)The Home Depot Inc.

3353,HD,"Fossil Group, Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) has been struggling with traditional watch segment in the past few quarters, thanks to consumers’ shift toward tech-savvy products. The company has been making investments to augment connected wearables portfolio, in order to meet the increasing demand for digitally advanced gadgets. Let’s look into some of the factors that have been affecting the performance of the company and see if its growth initiatives can revive performance.Dismal Business Segments Weigh Upon StockDuring the third quarter of 2017, Fossil Group’s net sales declined 6.7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to a 2.7% fall in watches portfolio. The downside stemmed from disappointing traditional watch performance. Management noted that increased competition and rising demand for tech-savvy watches has led to soft sales in the company’s traditional watches segment. Moreover, the company expects headwinds in this category to persist in the periods ahead.Further, Fossil Group’s Jewelry and Leather businesses have been unfavorable for quite some time. During the third quarter, jewelry and leather business sales fell 20.8% and 18.9%, respectively. Both categories have displayed unimpressive performance on account of unfavorable consumer response. Persistent softness across these categories has caused Fossil Group’s shares to plunge 77.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 25.9%.  Bleak Gross Margin & Outlook Dent EstimatesRecently, Fossil Group has been investing highly in promotional activities, for driving sales of traditional watches and newly-launched products in connected wearables. Consequently, higher promotional expenditures have taken a toll on the company’s gross margin, which has been declining since the past year.All these factors compelled management to slash 2017 adjusted earnings and sales view. The company expects a loss of 45 cents to earnings of 10 cents from the earlier view of earnings of 35 cents to $1.15. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 fell from estimated earnings of 68 cents to a loss of 22 cents in the past 30 days. Further, the company anticipates net sales for the year to decline in the range of 8.5-10.5%, wider than the previously range of 4.5-8.5%.Growth Prospects From Wearables Segment Nevertheless, the company is eyeing considerable growth opportunities in connected wearables segment and has been adding several products to enrich the category’s portfolio. Wearables represented more than 10% of Fossil Group’s sales in the third quarter, which nearly doubled from the year-ago quarter and also marked a sequential improvement. Considering the favorable consumer response and impressive performance from some key brands, management believes that wearables can play a key role in reviving Fossil Group’s performance in the upcoming quarters.Other initiatives to Revive Performance Fossil Group has been trying to reduce costs through its “New World Fossil” restructuring plan. The program aims to transform the company’s fuel efficiencies, improve margins and enhance overall operating structure of the business to drive profits. The company is on track with this program and expects to curtail product costs and reduce the expense structure by approximately $100 million (on a run-rate basis) this year.Also, the company’s renewed license agreement with Michael Kors and Emporio Armani through 2024 provides extensive opportunities for the expansion of watches and jewelry portfolio. Such agreements will also enable Fossil Group to explore other opportunities in the accessories category.We expect that such dedicated efforts will uplift this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s performance in the quarters ahead.Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

3355,HD,"Astute investors are always on the lookout for a plan that is likely to yield high returns regardless of market circumstances. Efficiency level, which measures a company’s capability to transform its available input into output, is often considered an important parameter used to gauge a company’s potential to rake in handsome returns.A company with a promising efficiency level is likely to deliver stellar returns as it is assumed to be positively correlated with its price performance.How to Measure Efficiency? We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns.Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company’s business health. While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales, a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition. This is where inventory turnover comes into play. It is the ratio of 12-month cost of goods sold (COGS) to a 4-quarter average inventory. Thus, a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS, while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory.Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company’s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit. Receivables turnover ratio or the “accounts receivable turnover ratio” or the “debtor’s turnover ratio” is calculated by dividing 12-month sales by four-quarter average receivables. While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers, a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low-quality customers or an inefficient credit policy.Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency. Asset utilization indicates a company’s potential to utilize its assets. It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4-quarter average of total assets. So, the higher the ratio, the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently. On the contrary, a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively.Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin. Operating profit margin, which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period, indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses. If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors, it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses.All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry. This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages.Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios, we have added a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable.Inventory Turnover, Receivables Turnover, Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average (Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers.)Zacks Rank better than or equal to #2 (Buy)(Only Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7,904 stocks to only 13. Here are five of the 13 stocks that passed the screen.The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) operates as a home improvement retailer. The company has a Zacks Rank #2.

Beacon Roofing has also outperformed the industry’s gain of 28.7% during the same time frame with respect to price performance.Favorable Rank & Style ScoreThe company currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Further, Beacon Roofing has an impressive VGM Score of A. In this, V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank 1, 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), offer the best investment opportunities.What Led to the 52-week High?Beacon Roofing’s shares have gained around 7.4% since it reported fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Nov 20. Its earnings increased around 6% year over year driven by strong sales growth within each of its three product lines — residential roofing, non-residential roofing and complementary products. It was further aided by strong organic sales trends across the majority of geographies. Net sales also climbed 9.8% year over year, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, Beacon Roofing opened one Greenfield branch in the fiscal fourth quarter, bringing the total number of branch openings to four in fiscal 2017. The company acquired 23 branches during the fiscal. Beacon Roofing continues to balance year-to-year branch opening strategy with potential acquisitions. In fiscal 2017, the company closed five acquisitions, with a cumulative sales run rate of more than $130 million of annual sales with 23 added branches.In addition to growth through acquisitions, the company also remains focused on attaining organic growth. Utilizing technology, the company continues to drive selling effectiveness through its CRM platform and has more than 1000 key employees utilizing this tool. Additionally, in fiscal 2017, the company introduced Beacon Pro+ — its innovative e-commerce portal that enables customers to order online from a catalog of over 50,000 products.During the fiscal fourth-quarter conference call, the company initiated the guidance for fiscal 2018. Total sales for the fiscal are projected in the range of $6.6-$6.9 billion, representing an expected growth of 51-58%. Further, adjusted EPS is likely to lie between $2.95 and $3.25. Improvement in earnings in fiscal 2018 will be driven by growth in core business of 15-20 cents and 20-25 cents contribution from Allied Building Products.Allied Building Acquisition to be a Growth DriverIn August 2017, Beacon Roofing has struck a deal to acquire CRH plc's (CRH  -  Free Report) U.S distribution business, Allied Building Products Corp. for $2.625 billion in cash. The acquisition remains on track to conclude in early January of fiscal 2018. The acquisition will make Beacon Roofing one of the largest public wholesale building materials distributors in North America.With projected revenues of roughly $7 billion from the combined company, it will be a 69% increase for Beacon Roofing's annual revenues from the current levels and add about 50-60 cents incremental to earnings per share in the first year. The combined company is anticipated to realize $110 million in run-rate synergies within two years of the closure of the deal.Upward Estimate RevisionsFurthermore, Beacon Roofing’s positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company’s potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead. Estimates for Beacon Roofing have moved up over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. The earnings estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up 17.6%, while that of fiscal 2019 moved up 30.4%.Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. Price and Consensus  Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.

3357,HD,"Williams-Sonoma, Inc. (WSM  -  Free Report) launched the Pottery Barn 3D Room View augmented reality (AR) app on iOS for iPhone and iPad to enhance customers’ virtual reality experience.

Again, customers can boost their virtual reality experience by scheduling a free design consultation with a Pottery Barn Design Crew expert, who can assist with the design process and offer customized suggestions.Williams-Sonoma is focused on enhancing customer experience through improved and innovative marketing techniques. Its digital marketing investments in 2016 were focused on improving online shopping experience, especially in mobile, and increasing online advertising spend across all brands.Meanwhile, Pottery Barn, the company’s largest brand, struggled in fiscal 2016 and early 2017. Although the brand’s comparable brand revenues are gradually gaining momentum with the company’s different effective initiatives, it is yet to show significant growth. Notably, Pottery Barn’s comparable brand revenues were down 0.3% in the last reported quarter compared with a decline of 4.6% in the prior-year quarter.Nevertheless, Williams-Sonoma is in the middle of a transformation drive to address the slowdown in traffic and to gain customers. The company has been reworking on its marketing strategy, emphasizing more on digital-targeted marketing and investing in store remodeling.Earlier this year, the company increased its digital advertising spend, which led to strong growth across all brands. In order to enhance customer experience, the company is using web tools that utilize augmented reality, creating videos on social media sites and making digital advertisements.In fact, the company’s shares have gained 6.3% till date compared with the Zacks Home Furnishings Industry’s growth of 3.7%.However, estimates for the current fiscal quarter and year have moved down 3% and 1.4%, respectively, over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ concern on the stock’s prospect.That said, strategic initiatives, innovative marketing techniques, focus on innovation and retail optimization are key growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector are Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.

3358,HD,"We saw a market sell-off in the Dow yesterday, due in part to an earnings miss for Walmart’s (WMT  -  Free Report) Q4 2018. Shares of the world’s biggest retailer sold off nearly 10% yesterday; the Dow 30 was down 1% overall.Though Walmart missed earnings estimates by 3 cents per share, the company beat on the top-line, and saw growth in comps (for the 14th straight quarter), and store traffic and storage were both up year over year. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company did lower the bottom end of its full-year guidance, but there is not much justification for a 10% sell-off in the shares, in our view.That is unless you consider that the gains Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) have made in the retail space — obviously, mostly online but now increasing its presence in the big-box space with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Three weeks ago, Amazon posted blowout Q4 results with a 143% positive earnings surprise, with net sales up 38% year over year. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also saw 19% online retail growth for full-year 2017.Basically, the question that arises here is: Does Amazon’s gain necessarily equate Walmart’s loss?Based on our current Zacks Ranks for both companies, we would argue that it does not. Walmart, despite its Q4 difficulties — which, by the way, many analysts had predicted — has continued to grow its online business even as Amazon has continued to power ahead. Walmart also seems to have plenty of faith in its CEO Doug McMillion, who recently celebrated his 4th anniversary as the head of the company. In short, those who understand Walmart best are those who tend to see the least problems with the company.We therefore see the current sell-off in WMT shares as somewhat of a buying opportunity. That said, we also have a slew of Zacks Rank #2 retail companies we cover at this time, including Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report), TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report). As we enter the thick of retail earnings season, we anticipate strength from the companies on our list yet to report.

3359,HD,"Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9, before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, this department store retailer reported positive earnings surprise of 6.7%. However, the company’s bottom-line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by an average of 19.9%. Let’s analyze the factors influencing the company’s performance.Factors at PlayMacy’s has announced a slew of measures revolving around stores closures, cost containment, real estate strategy as well as investment in omni-channel capabilities to enhance sales, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, management is developing e-commerce business, Macy’s Backstage off-price business along with expanding Bluemercury and online order fulfillment centers. In the recent past, the company announced the restructuring of its merchandising operations that includes combining of merchandising, planning and private brands divisions into one segment.These seem inevitable given the challenging retail landscape, aggressive pricing strategy, waning mall traffic and increased online competition that have been weighing on Macy’s performance. The company’s dwindling top and bottom-line results is the reflection of the same.A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 unveils that net sales declined 7.4%, 3.9%, 4.2% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, while earnings per share plunged 28.6%, 15.6%, 69.6% and 3.3% during the respective quarters. During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017 the scenario was no different, as net sales declined 7.5% and 5.4%, while earnings per share fell 40% and 11.1%, respectively. The company expects comp on an owned plus licensed basis to decline approximately 2.5% in the third quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks expect third-quarter revenue to be $5,325 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 5.4%. However, earnings are projected to improve roughly 12% to 19 cents from the year-ago period.Macy's Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Macy's Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Macy's Inc QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Suggest?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Macy’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

3360,HD,"Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 9. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the preceding quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.57 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of roughly 49%. We noted that our earnings estimate has been going up in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.2 billion, up about 19.1% from the year-ago quarter.Adidas AG Price and EPS Surprise Adidas AG Price and EPS Surprise | Adidas AG QuoteAdidas forms part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Consumer Discretionary sector’s earnings are expected to decline 1.2% year over year, while revenues are projected to grow 2.8%.Factors at PlayAdidas’ shares have surged 38.3% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 9%. The company has been buoyed by continued revenue growth at its Adidas brand, particularly in North America. In the last quarter, revenues at Adidas grew 21%, driven by double-digit growth in running category and strength in training category. Further, Reebok brand aided the top line, registering 5% growth, driven by strength in Reebok Classics. Further, e-commerce growth of 66% helped the stock.Together, these growth drivers along with the company’s constant product launches and strong marketing initiatives make us hopeful about the company’s prospects. However, management remained dissatisfied with its performance in Russia in the last quarter, which was hurt by the ongoing challenging consumer environment and additional store closures.For 2017, the company anticipates currency-neutral sales to advance in a range of 17-19% in 2017. It envisions net income from continuing operations to rise in a range of 26-28% to €1.360 - €1.390 billion. All said, let’s wait and see if Adidas can manage to put up another impressive show this time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Adidas is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Adidas currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

3362,HD,"Information technology services provider Gartner, Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 6. The company’s Research segment, which accounts for nearly 79% of total revenues, is likely to report higher revenues due to improved demand for its products. Whether this could result in higher earnings for the quarter remains to be seen.Top-Line ImprovementWith diligent execution of operational plans, Gartner has recorded double-digit growth in key metrics for more than a decade. In addition, this performance-driven firm has a strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet position. It has a vast, untapped market opportunity worth an estimated $61 billion. The acquisition of CEB, an industry leader in providing best practice and talent management insights, further reinforces Gartner’s market strength. The combination of its analyst-driven, syndicated research and advisory services with CEB’s expertise is likely to provide a comprehensive and differentiated suite of services portfolio across the globe.Gartner has a recurring revenue stream with 75% of its total revenues generated through subscription and long-term contracts. In addition, the company has a large and diverse addressable market with low customer concentration that mitigates operating risks. Operating in an industry with low barriers to entry, Gartner has an integrated research and consulting team designed to best serve client needs. This enables it to have a competitive advantage against its rivals. Leveraging its intellectual capital, Gartner creates and distributes proprietary research content as broadly as possible via published reports, interactive tools, facilitated peer networking, briefings, consulting and advisory services, and events. These facilitate a steady improvement in the company’s revenue stream.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Research segment’s revenues is currently pegged at $721 million, up from $479 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from the Event segment are expected to be $169 million compared with reported revenues of $136 million in the year-earlier quarter. However, revenues from the Consulting segment are anticipated to be marginally down to $86 million from $88 million generated in the year-ago quarter.Other Key FactorsGartner is relatively immune to the vagaries of the market due to secular growth of information technology spend and its increasing market penetration rate. However, some of its services are cyclically sensitive. In addition, revenues from the federal government business are exposed to lengthy approval times and other austerity measures, which often increase operating risks. These factors undermine the long-term growth potential of the company to some extent.Our proven model conclusively shows that Gartner is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it possesses the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +0.62%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Gartner, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Gartner, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Gartner, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Gartner has a Zacks Rank #2. This increases the predictive power of ESP and makes us reasonably confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Zendesk, Inc.

3363,HD,"While most sectors are on the last leg of the earnings season, the Retail-Wholesale sector has only seen a small handful report earnings as of yet. Investors are now focused on these upcoming reports as the sector will be in the spotlight for the next two weeks.Per the latest Earnings Trends report about 34.2% of the S&P 500 companies in the sector have reported their results, wherein 84.6% beat earnings estimates and 76.9% surpassed revenue estimates. While earnings rose 9.4% year over year, revenues climbed 15.7%. We believe that the favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration bode well for the sector.Retail Sector Holds the Baton – Why?The retail sector hogs all the attention with the advent of the holiday season. It is time to lift your spirits by adding potential winners to your portfolio with stocks that are likely to trump all odds and stand out with great earnings surprises. A rational investment can fetch you higher returns with the ensuing stock price appreciation.We are entering the festive season with Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Cyber Monday and of course Christmas lined up to take you on a holiday shopping spree. Competition will certainly be tough, be it at the brick-and-mortar stores or online portals, the retailers need to be hawk-eyed.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improving employment scenario, and a lift in the economic activity post hurricanes are enough to boost consumer sentiment. We noticed that Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — reached its highest level in almost 17 years in the month of October. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economic activity, surged 1% in September, recording its biggest monthly increase in almost eight years. The rise in spending was led by robust sales of autos and other durable items. All these sound favorable for retailers.5 Likely Winners for the SeasonAs retailers are gearing up for the season, you can also fine tune your portfolio in the same fashion to include stocks that are likely to outpace estimates. This leads to the obvious question of how to find the potential winners? Given the numerous stocks in the sector the Zacks methodology could offer some relief. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zumiez Inc. , which is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Dec 7, is a solid bet with a long-term earnings growth rate of 18%.

Moreover, according to the latest Earnings Trends report, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 8.6% and 5.3%, respectively, in this reporting cycle.As of Jan 24, 2018, about 15.4% of the S&P 500 companies in the Retail sector have reported their results, wherein 66.7% companies delivered an earnings beat, while 100% surpassed revenue estimates. Earnings of these companies rose 9.3%, revenues surged 10.5%.Sector Holds the BatonFavorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector. Analysts pointed that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improved employment picture, rising consumer confidence and modest inflation are enough to trigger consumer spending.  Notably, consumer spending increased at a rate of 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the Commerce Department’s latest data.Higher spending clearly indicates that the holiday season turned out to be a blissful one for retailers as consumers continued to fill their shopping carts. The festive season showcased a stellar performance since the recession of 2008. Per National Retail Federation, sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) during the November/December period increased 5.5% to $691.9 billion, surpassing its own projection of a 3.6-4% rise. Online shopping, which is included in the results, surged 11.5%.Another reason why the sector grabbed investors’ attention is the latest tax reform that has resulted in lowering the corporate tax rate to as much as 21%, and retailers will be the beneficiary of the same. Analysts believe that a lower tax burden is likely to allow the retailers to channelize the surplus money to best possible options. They may go for a dividend hike, or reduce debt load, or create a corpus to fund acquisitions, or invest in enhancing omni-channel capabilities, new product launches and any other innovations.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonAll said, we used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this earnings season.

3367,HD,"Retail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar presence. The scenario has drastically changed with the advancement of technology and digital transformation that are playing key roles in changing consumer shopping pattern. Nevertheless, this transition has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is no exception to the trend.Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another. Retail bellwethers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) are aggressively making headway by tapping customers’ evolving shopping patterns. No wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem.Target Sharpening the EdgeFocus on Private-Label BrandsTarget has undertaken several strategic initiatives to boost performance. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop its online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. The company plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids, and Wellness categories that are performing well.Management is focusing on key departments, such as Apparel, Beauty, Electronics and Food and Beverage. In the recent past, the company has unveiled some private label brands such as Cloud Island, Cat & Jack, A New Day, Goodfellow & Co., Project 62, JoyLab and others. Target had earlier informed that it plans to infuse $7 billion of capital over a period of three years to merge digital and physical shopping, open small format stores and fulfillment centers, revamp stores and bring in new merchandise.Restock Program & Other Customer Friendly EndeavorsThis general merchandise retailer rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. The company also launched curbside pickup program at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars.Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction. To capitalize on digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Wal-Mart and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) are also using Google's voice-activated shopping platform. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Flexible Format StoresTarget continues to lay emphasis on developing flexible format stores to penetrate deep into urban areas. This type of stores generally has higher sales productivity. Management had earlier informed that Target is opening 32 small format stores in fiscal 2017 with plans to open 35 new outlets in fiscal 2018. The company plans to operate over 130 small-format outlets nationwide by the end of fiscal 2019. It remodeled 110 stores in fiscal 2017, including 37 in the third quarter. The company plans to remodel 325 in fiscal 2018, 350 in fiscal 2019 and 325 in fiscal 2020.Wrapping UpA reflection of the company’s endeavors was quite visible in the strong holiday season sales. Comparable sales rose 3.4% in the combined November/December period buoyed by healthy store comps, robust traffic and sturdy digital sales. The solid holiday numbers allowed management to lift the view.This Minneapolis, MN-based company now projects fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $1.30-$1.40 compared with the prior range of $1.05-$1.25. For the fiscal year, management now forecasts adjusted earnings between $4.64 and $4.74 per share, up from the previous guidance of $4.40-$4.60.Further, Target now envisions comparable sales to increase approximately 3.4% during the fourth quarter with full year expected to be just over 1%. Taking into account the 53rd week, Target anticipates total sales to increase more than 9% in the final quarter.Certainly, Target is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and help overcome impediments, thus positioning it well for 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

3372,HD,"Regular day trading Monday fought back from pre-market declines to finish slightly in the green, as softness in Asian markets look to be providing a gentle headwind on Western markets again this morning. Futures are again in the red, as forecasts for China’s economy expect it to slow in Q4. This is somewhat offset by better-than-expected GDP in Germany: +0.8% from the +0.6% analysts were looking for, on slightly stronger exports and capital investments.The main piece of econ data here at home this morning is the monthly Producer Price Index (PPI), which came in hotter than we were expecting for October: +0.4% versus the +0.1% consensus, with the ex-food & energy read also at 0.4% (+0.2% was expected). The headline also matched September’s 0.4%; year over year we see +2.8% — the best year-over-year PPI read since 2011.These numbers help illustrate the continued slow seep of inflation into the economy, as well as the fact that hurricane effects continue to roll off the data. It’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out later, that will help the Fed solidify its rate increase plans for its December FOMC meeting (or not). The CPI not only gives a good indication of inflation metrics month by month, but also gives insight into consumers’ coping mechanisms with higher (or lower) prices.Q3 Earnings RundownZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) posted a typical positive earnings surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: earnings of $1.84 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $25.03 billion easily surpassed the $24.52 billion we had been looking for. This is at least the fifth straight earnings beat for Home Depot, whose trailing 4-quarter average was +3.8%.Home Depot also upped its full-year guidance from estimates, and expect comps to be up 6.5% year over year. The company said the balance of hurricane affects created a net loss of $51 million in the quarter, but things appear to be looking up for Home Depot for the year as a whole.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed report this morning, meeting the $1.00 per share expected while sales reached $8.76 billion, beneath the $8.88 billion the Zacks consensus anticipated. Hurricanes — including dozens of stores on the devastated island of Puerto Rico — and warmer weather hit the discount retailer in the quarter. Forecasts for fiscal 2018 (January end) are also beneath estimates.Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report) shares are rocketing up 18% in today’s pre-market following a big beat on the bottom line: $1.43 per share versus a $1.22 consensus estimate. Sales of $2.18 billion came in slightly under the $2.21 billion expected. This marks the first earnings beat for AAP in the last 4 quarters, and the stock had been down more than 50% year to date before this morning’s bid-up.DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) is selling off following its earnings release before the opening bell, even after beating estimates on its top and bottom lines: 30 cents per share outperformed the 26 cents expected, and revenues $1.94 billion surpassed the $1.89 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, reports of pressured margins suggest the company will underperform expectations, perhaps by as much as 20% in 2018. Shares are down 4% ahead of the opening bell.Finally, private investment firm Roark Capital has offered to buy Buffalo Wild Wings  for $150 per share this morning, sending shares surging more than 26% in today’s pre-market. This follows BWLD’s strong Q3 report from a couple weeks ago, when the stock also surged more than 20%; year-to-date, however, the specialty food and drink establishment was down 24%. This morning’s news looks to finally swing Buffalo Wild Wings into the black for calendar 2017.

3373,HD,"Tapestry, Inc. (TPR  -  Free Report), which was formerly known as Coach, Inc., is expected to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 7. In the trailing four quarters, this designer and marketer of fine accessories and gifts as well as house of lifestyle brands, has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.9%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 2%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Tapestry surpasses earnings estimate in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Let’s delve deep and find out the factors impacting the results.How are Estimates Shaping Up?After registering an increase of 11% in the bottom line, Tapestry is likely to witness a year-over-year decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 36 cents compared with 45 cents posted in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable in the past 30 days.Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues of $1,302 million up from $1,038 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in the top line may come as a big relief for investors, as the company’s net sales have declined 1.8% and 4% in the fourth and third quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.Factors at Play Sluggish mall traffic, increased online competition and aggressive pricing strategy are headwinds plaguing the industry, and Tapestry is not immune to it. These along with Kate Spade integration-related costs are likely to hurt the margins and consequently the bottom line.Nevertheless, Tapestry looks much more disciplined in its approach to adapt to the changing retail landscape. The company is undergoing a brand transformation and introducing modern luxury concept stores in key markets. The acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade are being viewed as a significant step in efforts toward becoming a multi-brand company. Moreover, management has undertaken transformation initiatives revolving around product, stores and marketing, which are likely to have a favorable impact in the quarter to be reported.Tapestry also registered positive comps at its North American segment for the fifth consecutive quarter and sees growth prospects in China, Japan and Europe.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Tapestry is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Tapestry carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.65%. This makes us reasonably confident that bottom line is likely to outperform the estimate.Other Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Home Depot, Inc.

3375,HD,"The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has been witnessing solid momentum, having outpaced the industry and the S&P 500 in the past six months. Improving job scenario, housing market recovery, merchandising initiatives and post hurricane activities along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities have played an instrumental role in the company’s success.The stock has surged 39.3% in six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 37.7% and S&P 500’s increase of 13.7%. Further, a VGM Score of B and long-term earnings growth rate of 14.6% highlight this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock’s inherent potential.What’s Pushing Home Depot’s Shares Higher?Home Depot has been implementing several initiatives to drive long-term growth. It remains keen on building the interconnected capabilities and improved fulfillment options by launching its customer order management system and the buy online deliver from store capability. Further, the company is gaining from consistent focus on improving customer experience, solid execution and consistent housing market recovery.Also, the company has been revamping itself by concentrating on square footage growth and maximizing productivity from its existing store base. Management has implemented significant changes in its store operations to make them simpler and more customer-friendly. We believe these initiatives will induce more traffic to its stores and boost Home Depot’s performance.Meanwhile, Home Depot has undertaken several initiatives to deliver growth with regard to pro-customers. Evidently, the Compact Power Equipment buyout marked another step toward improving portfolio service offerings for its pro customers and is likely to contribute to the company’s gross margin in fiscal 2017. Additionally, the company’s disciplined capital allocation strategy aids it to make strategic business investments and shareholder-friendly moves.Home Depot has been reporting strong financial figures since 2008 with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. This robust trend continued in third-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked fifth consecutive sales beat with earnings maintaining its five-year trend of positive surprises. Consequently, management raised its fiscal 2017 guidance and anticipates earnings per share to be up nearly 14% to $7.36 in fiscal 2017, up from the previous guidance of 13% growth to $7.29.Furthermore, analysts are growing bullish on the stock as apparent from the rise in the company’s earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.39 for fiscal 2017 and $9.06 for fiscal 2019 has moved north 2 cents and 66 cents, respectively, in the last 30 days.

Of late, this home improvement company has been one of the most talked about stocks in the Wall Street thanks to D.E. Shaw, an activist investor, who built an active stake in this Mooresville, NC-based company.

Lowe's, which competes with Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), continues to project total sales growth of approximately 5% with comps increase of about 3.5% during fiscal 2017.Stock Looks Attractive From Valuation PerspectiveA brief glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that Lowe's has enough room to run.

The stock also looks attractive with respect to a price-to-book (P/E) multiple of 14.7x compared with industry’s 28.4x. A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. Lowe's holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.5 lower than 11.7 for the industry.We noted that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has surged 41% in a year.

3378,HD,"The Consumer Discretionary sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Robust consumer demand and appealing trends in the U.S. economy seem to be driving the sector. Cause for Appeal Consumer spending accounts for more than 70% of U.S. economic output. Consumer spending increased 0.6% in November compared with 0.2% in the prior month, per data released by the Commerce Department. Spending topped forecasts of 0.5% in a Bloomberg survey.  Coming to employment, Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 148,000 jobs in December. Although this was below the 190,000 number expected by economists, unemployment rate stood at 4.1% in December, the lowest level since the year 2000. GDP increased 3.2% year over year in the third quarter of 2017 compared with 3.1% in the second quarter. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law. As a result, Fed members increased their expectations for 2018 GDP growth from 2.1% to 2.5%. Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to consumer discretionary stocks and tracks the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $13.6 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year.

3379,HD,"The Building Products – Retail industry has portrayed a bull run in a year’s time as evident from its surge of 37.9%, outperforming the S&P 500 index’s growth of 23.9%. Impressively, the industry ranks in the top 14% (36 out of 256) of the Zacks classified industries. In fact, the industry has been gaining from a buoyant U.S. economy.Some of the companies that have been gaining from this industry’s uptrend are The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report), Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (BECN  -  Free Report) and Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (LL  -  Free Report). Apparently, Home Depot and Lowe's have scaled a 52-week high on Jan 5. Furthermore, Lumber Liquidators, Home Depot and Beacon Roofing have outpaced the industry with the rally of 107.8%, 43.3% and 45.6%, respectively, in a year. Although Lowe's has underperformed the industry with its gain of 33.3% but definitely has potential to grow more.Out of these stocks, Beacon Roofing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Lumber Liquidators has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while both Home Depot and Lowe's carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Furthermore, some analysts believe that the broader Retail/Wholesale sector, of which the Building Products – Retail industry forms part of, is likely to gain from the recent Republican tax cuts. The sector is currently placed at the top 19% (3 out of 16) of the Zacks classified sectors.Here, we are to focus on the fundamentals and solid strategies of the two leading players of this industry — Home Depot and Lowe's.Home DepotShares of Home Depot scaled a 52-week high of $192.54 on Friday, closing slightly lower at $192.50. The company looks good on the back of its robust earnings trend, disciplined capital allocation strategy, focus on pro-customers and steady housing market recovery. Interestingly, this world’s largest home improvement retailer has retained its five-year long trend of positive earnings surprises.In fact, Home Depot has been benefiting from strength in its core business, relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity. Additionally, management has been implementing several initiatives to drive growth. Evidently, it remains focused on developing merchandising tools and increasing investment in e-commerce to boost top-line growth and enhance market share.Although Home Depot has been posting solid financial results for a long time, the company’s gross margin looks troubled. In the last reported quarter, gross margin fell 10 basis points and is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect the decline to be temporary and recovering from the company’s solid growth strategies. Furthermore, a Growth Scoreof B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4%, highlight the stock’s growth potential.Lowe'sShares of Lowe's too hit a 52-week high of $94.80 on Jan 5, though it closed a tad lower at $94.74. We believe improving job scenario, housing market recovery, merchandising initiatives and post hurricane construction activities along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well for the company.Additionally, Lowe's seems to be benefiting from its strategic acquisitions. This is evident from the Orchard Supply Hardware Stores buyout, which is aiding comparable-store sales growth. Also, the acquisition of Maintenance Supply Headquarters is strengthening relationship with pro customers. Meanwhile, the company's Canadian business has been performing quite well. The RONA buyout is likely to further augment its position in the Canadian market.However, Lowe's has been struggling with soft gross margins for the last few quarters. Apparently, in the first, second and third quarter of fiscal 2017 gross margin declined 64, 23 and 28 basis points to 34.4%, 34.2% and 34.1%, respectively.Nevertheless, Lowe's VGM Score of A with a long-term earnings growth rate of 14.7% buoys optimism in the stock.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

3380,HD,"Shares of leading home furnishings company, RH (RH  -  Free Report) have rallied more than 200% so far this year, breezing past the Zacks Home Furnishings industry’s gain of only 2.6%. Also, the company has outperformed the industry in each of the 4-week, 12-week and 52-week time frames, justifying the stock’s Momentum Score of A.Also, earnings estimates have been rising over the past week, more prominently after the company raised the third quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance. This suggests that sentiments on RH are moving in the right direction and the company is poised to perform well in the quarters ahead.Notably, over the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings rose 10.3% to 96 cents. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 403.4%. Also, earnings estimates for the current year and next have inched up 4.9% and 12.9% respectively.This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Let us delve deeper into the factors that might help the stock maintain the bull run.Upbeat GuidanceRH’s adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $1.02 to $1.04 for the fiscal third quarter (68-80 cents expected earlier), despite a 5-cent or 1% negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. This reflects a substantial increase from the year-ago level of 20 cents. Net revenues for the quarter are likely to be about $592.5 million compared with the previous guidance of $575-$590 million. The updated guidance reflects an increase of 8% year over year despite an approximate 1% negative impact from the recent natural calamities. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues currently stands at $599.2 million, up 9.2% year over year.RH has also raised its fourth-quarter adjusted net income guidance to $37-$41 million from the earlier $33-$37 million. For fiscal 2017, the company lifted its net income guidance to $82-$87 million from the previous $70-$77 million. RH expects fiscal 2018 net revenues between $2.58 billion and $2.62 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $125-$145 million, and free cash flow of more than $240 million.Growth Initiatives StrongThe company’s efforts to redesign its supply chain network, rationalize product offerings and the Waterworks acquisition are expected to boost growth.RH closed its distribution facility in Los Angeles and has plans of shutting down its distribution center in Dallas by fiscal 2017-end. Overall, with the elimination of an estimated 1.75 million square feet of distribution space, RH will generate savings of approximately $15 million annually.Meanwhile, RH has completed around 90% of the redesign of its reverse logistics and Outlet business. The move is expected to generate cost savings and drive margin by $15 million to $20 million annually.The company expects margins to rise and costs to fall as it plans to reduce inventory and benefit from its new operating model. RH is optimistic about meeting its long-term goal of $4-$5 billion in North American revenues and industry-leading operating margins and returns on invested capital.Solid Value & GrowthInvestors are always on the lookout for stocks that are currently undervalued but have solid growth potential. With a Value Style Score of B and a Growth Style Score of A, RH serves as a good pick. RH currently has a trailing 12 month P/S ratio of 1.2, which is below the highs scaled over the past five years and the S&P 500 average of 3.3.Apart from these factors, we note that since RH’s products primarily focus on home furnishings so demand for its products is related to the performance of the broader housing market.  New residential construction in the United States increased more than expected in October 2017, reflecting strength in the housing industry.Positives like an improving economy, low unemployment levels, solid homebuilders’ confidence and a tight supply situation raise optimism about the housing industry’s performance in 2017. As such, demand for RH’s products is likely to rise as well, driving revenues.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the Retail-Wholesale sector are Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (BECN  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc. (ARCO  -  Free Report).Beacon Roofing carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3381,HD,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 30%.In fact, Dean Foods has missed our estimate for three consecutive quarters now, with an average negative surprise of 15.2% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise | Dean Foods Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Dean Foods will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 20 cents per share, reflecting a 44.9% year-over-year decline. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has been going down ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.97 billion, up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 12.3%, while the industry dropped 7.8%.Factors at PlayDean Foods’ performance remains challenged by rising competition and escalated raw milk costs. The company’s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Consequently, any rise in their prices will hurt margins.The company’s performance in the last reported quarter was largely dented by increased raw milk costs along with lower volumes. In second-quarter 2017, total volumes dipped 2.7% to 615 million gallons and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 626 million gallons. Moreover, the company is facing severe competition from other dairy products suppliers due consolidations in the retail grocery industry.The company expects these obstacles to persist throughout the rest of 2017, as reflected in management’s curtailed earnings guidance. Raw milk expenses are expected to inflate 8% sequentially, and 11% year over year in the third quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total milk volumes is 624 million gallons, lower than a volume of 651 million gallons in the prior-year quarter.While the aggressive cost-saving initiatives are anticipated to address the hurdles associated with unfavorable volumes and mix, these challenges are likely to be more intense in the second half of 2017. Consequently, adjusted earnings are envisioned in a range of 80-95 cents per share, much lower than the earlier forecast of $1.35-$1.55.Nonetheless, Dean Foods remains on track to speed up its commercial and cost productivity efforts, to enhance volumes and mix. This is evident from the company’s plans of expanding cost productivity program, which should aid in achieving additional savings of $40-$50 million annually.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dean Foods is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dean Foods has an Earnings ESP of +5.39% as the Most Accurate Estimate of 22 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents. However, this combined with the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.76% and a Zacks Rank #2.Inter Parfums, Inc. (IPAR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.56% and a Zacks Rank #2.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3382,HD,"Rayonier Inc. (RYN  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 pro forma net income per share of 19 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 5 cents. However, the bottom line came in below the prior-year quarter figure of 33 cents.Total sales for the quarter came in at $177.9 million, up 3.8% year over year. Also, the figure handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $150.8 million.Results reflect solid performance of Pacific Northwest and New Zealand Timber segments on account of higher harvest volumes and increase in sawtimber prices. However, performance in the Real Estate segment was disappointing primarily due to decline in the number of acres sold.Rayonier Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Rayonier Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Rayonier Inc. QuoteSegmental PerformanceDuring the reported quarter, pro forma operating income at the company’s Southern Timber segment rose to $11.5 million from $8.2 million recorded a year ago.The Pacific Northwest Timber posted pro forma operating income of $1.1 million against operating loss of $3.3 million incurred in third-quarter 2016.New Zealand Timber reported pro forma operating income of $19.3 million, significantly up from the prior-year quarter figure of $6.6 million.Real Estate’s pro forma operating income was $11.4 million, substantially below the year-ago figure of $43.1 million.Trading segment’s pro forma operating income was $1.1 million, up from the year-ago figure of $0.5 million.Lastly, pro forma operating loss at the Corporate and Other segment was $5.1 million compared with a loss of $4.2 million incurred in third-quarter 2016.LiquidityRayonier ended the quarter with $104.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from $85.9 million recorded at the end of fourth-quarter 2016. Total long-term debt was $1.03 billion, almost flat with the Dec 31, 2016 tally.Our ViewpointRayonier owns or leases around 2.7 million acres of timberlands in some of the most productive timber-growing regions. These timberlands are strategically located near the pulpwood consuming mills. Recent developments in the field of biogenetics and consistent cash flow bode well for Rayonier over the long run.However, the company faces competition from its substitutes and other market players in the timberland sector. Rayonier has to comply with strict regulatory requirements which are subject to frequent changes. This adversely affects its business. In the reported quarter, the company benefited from higher harvest volumes and stronger domestic and export markets.Currently, Rayonier carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3383,HD,"We issued an updated research report on Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (BECN  -  Free Report) on Nov 23.Beacon Roofing reported adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share for fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 that increased 6% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong sales growth within each of the three product lines — residential roofing, non-residential roofing and complementary products.Growth Across All Product CategoriesThe residential roofing product line posted its 14th consecutive quarter of sales growth and continues to be the company’s strongest performing sector. Complementary products grew 7.3% and are anticipated to be the strongest performing product in 2018 given conducive conditions. The company is focused to grow this category, both organically and through acquisitions. It is a very large and growing market, and one of the elements that is expected to fuel growth moving forward. Both commercial and residential roofing is anticipated to surge in fiscal 2018. Beacon Roofing is also expected to benefit from the rebuilding activity triggered by the two back-to-back hurricanes, Harvey and Irma.The company has initiated guidance for fiscal 2018. Total sales are projected in the range of $6.6-$6.9 billion, representing expected sales growth rate of 51-58%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be in the range of $560-$600 million and adjusted EPS to come in between $2.95 and $3.25. For comparison basis, Beacon Roofing’s adjusted earnings per share were at $2.68 in fiscal 2017.Estimates on the RiseFollowing the upbeat fourth quarter results and guidance, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved up 10% for fiscal 2018 and 22% for fiscal 2019, in the past seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is at $2.88 and for fiscal 2019 is at $3.55, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 32.17% and 23.14%, respectively.Pending Allied Products Acquisition to Be Game-ChangerBeacon Roofing has struck a deal to acquire CRH plc's (CRH  -  Free Report) U.S distribution business, Allied Building Products Corp. for $2.625 billion in cash. The buyout remains on track to close conclude in early January. The acquisition will catapult the company to one of the largest public wholesale building materials distributors in North America.Through the buyout, Beacon Roofing would mark its foray in local markets in the New York, New Jersey and Upper Midwest while expanding foothold in other key markets including Texas, Florida, Colorado and California. The buyout will add about 50-60 cents to earnings per share in the first year. The combined company is anticipated to realize $110 million in run-rate synergies within two years of the deal closure.Focus on Organic Growth and AcquisitionsBeacon Roofing opened one Greenfield branch in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number of branch openings to four in fiscal 2017. The company acquired 23 branched during the fiscal. It continues to balance year-to-year branch opening strategy with acquisitions. In fiscal 2017, the company closed five acquisitions with a cumulative sales run rate of more than $130 million of annual sales with 23 added branches. These buyouts are likely to improve geographic penetration and product portfolios across the United States.In addition to growth through acquisitions, the company also remains focused on attaining organic growth. In fiscal 2017, the company introduced Beacon Pro+, its innovative e-commerce portal that enables customers to order online from a catalog of over 50,000 products. It also gives customers 24/7 access to view real time pricing, review the status of orders, request and approve quotes, and pay their bills online. This will enhance customer productivity and sales.Re-Roofing Activity to Spur GrowthThe roofing distribution market in the United States and Canada represents approximately $26 billion in revenues. Residential roofing comprises roughly 60-65% of this market and the balance 35-40% is commercial. Almost 80-90% of roofing demand is driven by re-roofing activity while the balance stems from new construction. As homes age, new and re-roof demand are on the rise as homeowners are forced to replace or repair old, deteriorating roofs. Over the last decade, the median age of owner occupied housing has increased from 31 years to 37 years, according to U.S. Census data.This aging U.S. housing inventory in addition with more favorable trends in existing home sales, and deferred re-roofing amid the housing downturn reinforces a favorable supply/demand dynamic in the residential repair and remodel market in the coming years. Given that Beacon Roofing is the second largest distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials in the United States, it is poised to benefit from this growth. The company has outperformed the industry year to date. The shares have gained 28.8% while the industry registered an increase of 14.8%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBeacon Roofing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Other top-ranked stocks worth considering in the sector include Groupon, Inc. (GRPN  -  Free Report) and The Home Depot, Inc.

3384,HD,"Markets eked out gains on Monday to close slightly higher. While tax woes continued to worry investors, gains were capped further after shares of General Electric plummeted to a five year low after releasing weak EPS guidance for 2018. However, gains for Boeing and Mattel boosted the markets. Meanwhile, the investors closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. Speaking in Manila Trump commented that he would make an important announcement regarding trade on Wednesday in Washington.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased a little less than 0.1%, to close at 23,439.70. The S&P 500 Index (INX) gained 0.1% to close at 2,584.84. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,757.60, gaining 0.1%. A total of 6.2 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.7 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. The CBOE VIX increased 1.9% to close at 11.5.Tax Woes Keep Investors on TenterhooksLate last week, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Also, per House Republicans, the top individual tax rate would be 39.6%, whereas the Senate version puts the ceiling rate at 38.5%. Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans weighed on investor sentiment.The two versions of the tax Bill will be scrutinized and debated upon before reaching on a conclusion. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving, with some even speculating such a decision would only take place beyond Christmas. Such events dampened investor sentiment and capped gains for the markets.However, market analysts commented that major indexes are still trading at appreciably high levels. Such a run has been largely due to stupendous corporate earnings and a burgeoning U.S. economy.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow eked out meager gains, advancing 17.49 points to end in positive territory. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the Dow. The aero-giant’s shares gained 0.6% after it won a contract from Dubai airline Emirates for a provisional order of about 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. This deal is worth a sizeable $15.1 billion. BA possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) tanked 7.2% to hit a five year low after the company announced weaker-than-expected EPS guidance for 2018. For the next year, the electric giant expects EPS in the range of $1.00-$1.07, which is significantly lower than the 2017 guidance of $1.05-$1.10 a share. The company also reduced its dividend by 50% in a bid to focus more on health care, aviation and energy business segments. Such a decline in the shares of GE weighed both on the Dow and the S&P 500.The S&P 500 gained 0.1% to end in the green. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, eight ended in positive territory. Shares of Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) surged 20.7% after Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) approached the former for a potential takeover. Such gains for the toymaker boosted the S&P 500. However, gains for the benchmark was capped after shares of GE declined and weighed on the S&P 500.Meanwhile, Nasdaq also gained 0.1% to end in the green. The tech-heavy index was boosted by gains for the shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), which advanced 0.2%, 0.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Investors Have a Keen Eye on Trump’s Visit to AsiaMarket watchers closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. On his 13-day visit to the continent, Trump has given hints regarding a ‘major statement’ on trade that he is expected to make on Wednesday in Washington. Speaking in Manila at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, Trump also mentioned that that he would announce details regarding the meetings he had with supreme leaders of China, South Korea and ‘lots of other places’, refusing to divulge any further details about the announcement.Stocks That Made HeadlinesCenovus Sells Weyburn Assets to Whitecap ResourcesCenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery operation, Weyburn oil facility in Saskatchewan to Whitecap Resources Inc, based in western Canada.

3385,HD,"Tuesday, November 14, 2017Regular day trading Monday fought back from pre-market declines to finish slightly in the green, as softness in Asian markets look to be providing a gentle headwind on Western markets again this morning. Futures are again in the red, as forecasts for China’s economy expect it to slow in Q4. This is somewhat offset by better-than-expected GDP in Germany: +0.8% from the +0.6% analysts were looking for, on slightly stronger exports and capital investments.The main piece of econ data here at home this morning is the monthly Producer Price Index (PPI), which came in hotter than we were expecting for October: +0.4% versus the +0.1% consensus, with the ex-food & energy read also at 0.4% (+0.2% was expected). The headline also matched September’s 0.4%; year over year we see +2.8% — the best year-over-year PPI read since 2011.These numbers help illustrate the continued slow seep of inflation into the economy, as well as the fact that hurricane effects continue to roll off the data. It’s the Consumer Price Index (CPI), due out later, that will help the Fed solidify its rate increase plans for its December FOMC meeting (or not). The CPI not only gives a good indication of inflation metrics month by month, but also gives insight into consumers’ coping mechanisms with higher (or lower) prices.Q3 Earnings RundownZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) posted a typical positive earnings surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: earnings of $1.84 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $25.03 billion easily surpassed the $24.52 billion we had been looking for. This is at least the fifth straight earnings beat for Home Depot, whose trailing 4-quarter average was +3.8%.Home Depot also upped its full-year guidance from estimates, and expect comps to be up 6.5% year over year. The company said the balance of hurricane affects created a net loss of $51 million in the quarter, but things appear to be looking up for Home Depot for the year as a whole.Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) posted a mixed report this morning, meeting the $1.00 per share expected while sales reached $8.76 billion, beneath the $8.88 billion the Zacks consensus anticipated. Hurricanes — including dozens of stores on the devastated island of Puerto Rico — and warmer weather hit the discount retailer in the quarter. Forecasts for fiscal 2018 (January end) are also beneath estimates.Advance Auto Parts (AAP  -  Free Report) shares are rocketing up 18% in today’s pre-market following a big beat on the bottom line: $1.43 per share versus a $1.22 consensus estimate. Sales of $2.18 billion came in slightly under the $2.21 billion expected. This marks the first earnings beat for AAP in the last 4 quarters, and the stock had been down more than 50% year to date before this morning’s bid-up.DICK’S Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) is selling off following its earnings release before the opening bell, even after beating estimates on its top and bottom lines: 30 cents per share outperformed the 26 cents expected, and revenues $1.94 billion surpassed the $1.89 billion in the Zacks consensus. However, reports of pressured margins suggest the company will underperform expectations, perhaps by as much as 20% in 2018. Shares are down 4% ahead of the opening bell.Finally, private investment firm Roark Capital has offered to buy Buffalo Wild Wings  for $150 per share this morning, sending shares surging more than 26% in today’s pre-market. This follows BWLD’s strong Q3 report from a couple weeks ago, when the stock also surged more than 20%; year-to-date, however, the specialty food and drink establishment was down 24%. This morning’s news looks to finally swing Buffalo Wild Wings into the black for calendar 2017.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

3386,HD,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio – to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are five stocks that made it through the screen:CBRE Group Inc.  operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company.

3387,HD,"Shares of several of the investing social media world’s favorite stocks—including Energous (WATT  -  Free Report) and Longfin —moved higher on Wednesday morning. Check out why these companies, along with three others, had investors excited today!EnergousShares of Energous opened more than 80% higher today after the company said federal regulator approved its “WattUp” wireless charging device. The Mid Field transmitter is capable of sending power to electronic devices at a distance of up to three feet. Its approval marks the FCC’s first certification of power-at-a-distance technology.“Untethered, wire-free charging -- such as charging a fitness band even while wearing it -- is exactly what consumers have been waiting for. We are now in a position to move our consumer electronics, IoT and smart home customers forward at an accelerated pace,” Energous CEO Stephen R. Rizzone said in a press release.LongfinLongfin shares were up more than 8% through morning trading hours Wednesday. Last week, Longfin emerged as a cryptocurrency proxy stock after acquiring Ziddu.com, a blockchain company focused on micro lending and warehouse financing.Over the last several trading periods, we have seen stocks like LFIN respond to price movements in the major cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin has slipped more than 4% over the past 24 hours, while Ethereum has slumped about 1% and Litcoin has moved about 3.5% lower.Still, these cryptos have recovered from Friday’s massive sell-off, and Longfin’s subsequent rally could be a sign of renewed interest in crypto proxy plays.Blue ApronShares of struggling meal-kit delivery company Blue Apron (APRN  -  Free Report) gained about 3.6% in morning trading. While there is no clear news inspiring today’s trading, investors should note that the company’s post-IPO lockup period ended yesterday.Lockup expirations tend to send young stocks lower, as employees cash out of their personal holdings and flood the market with new shares. However, with APRN at such a low price level right now, it is possible that the lockup expiration did not inspire mass selling, causing a slight rebound.Advanced Micro Devices Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) shares popped over 2% in morning hours Wednesday, continuing their trend of unpredictability. Prior to today’s gains, AMD had lost nearly 6% over the previous four trading periods. The stock appears to be testing a new support line near $10 per share, having dipped below this level briefly over the last month. Today’s bounce appears to be a rebound from just below $10.50.XPO LogisticsShares of logistics services giant XPO Logistics (XPO  -  Free Report) moved more than 4.5% higher on Wednesday morning. The moves comes on the back of reports that Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) has held internal discussions about an acquisition bid for the company over the past several months.XPO has reportedly been targeted by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) as a potential partner for its furniture delivery push, so Home Depot’s interest could be centered on keeping the logistics company away from the e-commerce king.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3388,HD,"J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 10. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this department store retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well the company reported a wider-than-expected loss in the last quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise  J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Holding Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 43 cents, which is considerably worse than the year-ago period loss of 21 cents. In fact, this estimate has widened over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2,759 million, down 3.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayJ. C. Penney has been reeling under a tough retail landscape on account of stiff competition from online retailers and waning store traffic. Owing to these hurdles, the company has been witnessing soft comparable store sales (comps) for nearly a year now. While J.C. Penney is undertaking several strategic initiatives to draw traffic, we expect the retail landscape to remain challenged and hurt the company’s profits. Also, J.C. Penney’s store closures are likely to weigh upon its performance.Further, management recently provided an update on its third-quarter performance, wherein it also curtailed its outlook for fiscal 2017. Shares of J. C. Penney have lost 35.2% since the announcement, wherein the company stated that in an effort to clear “slow-moving” goods mostly in women’s apparel department, it increased markdowns in September and October. We believe that this remains a threat to the company’s margins.  Management also stated that following the liquidation of slow moving inventory, the company’s fund has increased. This will help to invest in fresh as well as trending merchandise categories.For third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company expects comps to inch up 0.6%-0.8%. However, cost of goods (excluding depreciation and amortization) is likely to escalate 300-320 basis points (bps) year over year. Consequently, the company expects adjusted loss for the third quarter to be in the range of 45-40 cents per share. This is much wider than the company’s loss of 21 cents per share reported in third-quarter fiscal 2016.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that J. C. Penneyis likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.J. C. Penney currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Notably, we caution against sell-rated (#5) stocks going into earnings announcement.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #2.

3389,HD,"Fossil Group Inc (FOSL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 7, after the market closes.The company’s earnings have surpassed estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 0.9%. However, earnings have declined on a year-over-year basis since the last eight quarters. The company has been struggling with lower sales of traditional watches and dismal performance of its leather and jewelry businesses.Owing to such headwinds, shares of Fossil Group have plunged 51.3% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 20.2%.Further, these hurdles are likely to impact the company’s third-quarter performance. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?                                                               The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at a loss of 12 cents, depicting a considerable deterioration from earnings of 42 cents in the prior-year quarter. Estimated loss of the period under review has however remained stable in the past 30 days. We note that on a non-GAAP basis, management projects bottom-line results to range between a loss of 26 cents and earnings of 7 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company expects loss in the range of 44-11 cents per share. .Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales for third quarter to decline 11.5% from the prior year to reach $653.2 million. The slump in top line lies within management’s projected decline of 8–14%. We note that the top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in eight out of the last 10 straight quarters and have also been registering year-over-year decline for quite some time.Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Fossil Group continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category across its key markets, owing to intensifying competition and evolving consumer preference toward connected wearables. The company has been striving hard for the revival of its watch category by adding new products under its smartwatches and connected wearable’s portfolio. However, the new launches are yet to yield significant revenues to offset the declines witnessed in sales of traditional watches.Additionally, low consumer response is expected to affect Fossil Group’s leather and jewelry businesses. Notably, the performance of these businesses has remained dismal during the first half of 2017.Further, in order to boost sales of its existing and newly launched products, Fossil Group has been investing highly in promotional activities, thereby increasing operating expenses. This trend is likely to persist for the third quarter as well. On a non-GAAP basis, management expects operating margin for the quarter under review in the range of a decline of 1.2% to an increase of 2%from the year-ago period. .What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Fossil is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although Fossil Group currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies which, according to our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.Zumiez Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +2.67% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1.

3390,HD,"The Consumer Discretionary sector, which covers major home furnishing companies, is likely to see a 1.7% drop in earnings this quarter compared to 4.7% growth last quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 2.9%, lower than last quarter’s 8.8%.This sector, which is ranked among the bottom 38% (10 out of 16) of all Zacks sectors, has been facing challenges like volatile commodity prices, changing consumer spending patterns and adverse currency fluctuations. Nevertheless, rising consumer confidence on the back of a steady housing sector is a major positive.Notably, home furnishing companies like Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) and Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc’s (LL  -  Free Report) have seen a rally in their shares post the hurricane mayhem. As home owners have faced damaged properties, rebuilding efforts have ramped up. This in turn has driven demand for home-improvement equipment and materials.However, the hurricanes might adversely affect results of such companies in the third quarter owing to disruptions in demand and supply chains. Nevertheless, increased demand of home improvement products will largely benefit these companies.All said, let’s see what awaits the following stocks that are queued up for third-quarter 2017 earnings release on Oct 26.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (LEG  -  Free Report) is exposed to substantial volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company’s key raw materials and the market for the same being cyclical in nature. Incidentally, the company’s bottom line has declined year over year for three straight quarters now, owing to inflation in raw material price. In the last quarter, earnings and EBIT fell 3% and 7.4% year over year, respectively, due to higher steel price.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 62 cents, which represents an 8.1% decline from the year-ago figure. Earnings estimates have been stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,010 million, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter.Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Leggett & Platt, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Leggett & Platt, Incorporated QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Leggett this quarter.

3393,HD,"Fossil Group Inc. (FOSL  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom line plummeted year over year but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s performance was negatively impacted by sluggish traditional watch business and persistent weakness in the leather and jewelry categories. Further, management slashed guidance for 2017 in response to the weak results, consequently impacting investor sentiment.Evidently, shares of Fossil Group declined 10.4% during after-hours trading on Nov 7. We note that Fossil Group has been delivering sluggish results for quite some time, which is reflected in its share price history. The company’s shares have plunged 74.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 28.5%.Q3 Earnings Adjusted earnings were 4 cents per share in the quarter which compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. However, the bottom line declined significantly from 48 cents reported in the year-ago period. The slump can be attributed to lower sales and margins.On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of 11 cents. We note that during the quarter, Fossil Group gained 2 cents from favorable foreign currency movements.Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fossil Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fossil Group, Inc. QuoteQuarter in Detail Net sales of $688.7 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $653.2 million. Though connected watches boosted sales, overall net sales declined 6.7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to sluggishness in the company's traditional watch portfolio. On a constant-currency basis, sales declined 8% during the quarter. Underlying weakness in the company’s leather and jewelry businesses also marred the top-line performance during the quarter. Global retail comps, including e-commerce, dropped 6% year over year, with softness across all categories and geographies.Gross profit tumbled 16.9% to $319.9 million. Gross margin contracted 580 basis points (bps) to 46.4% due to lower margins from connected products and increased product valuation charges. Lower retail margins stemming from greater promotional activity, unfavorable currency impacts and increased off-price sales also dragged the gross margin. These downsides were partly compensated by margin improvement owing to the New World Fossil initiative.For the third quarter, the company’s operating loss amounted to $0.5 million, as against the operating income of $31.2 million in the prior-year quarter. This can be attributed to lower sales and gross profit, despite lower operating expenses.Performance Based on Business Categories Category-wise, sales in the watches segment declined 2.7% (down 4% on constant-currency basis) to $551.9 million in the quarter. Fossil Group has been struggling with its watch category for quite some time now. Management noted that higher demand for tech-enabled watches has been denting traditional watch sales. Though the company has been expanding its smartwatches and wearable portfolio, these efforts are yet to revive results.Sales at Jewelry and leather businesses also went down 20.8% (down 23% on constant-currency basis) to $47.7 million and 18.9% (down 20% on constant-currency basis) to $75.7 million, respectively. Notably the sales of leather products have been unimpressive on account of unfavorable consumer response.Region-Wise Performance Region-wise, sales slumped 14.7% (down 15% on a constant currency basis) in Americas to $308.1 million owing to sales decline in the United States and sluggish performance of traditional watches. This was marginally offset by sales growth in connected watches. The region also witnessed weakness in the leather and jewelry businesses.Sales increased 1.6% in Europe (down 2% on a constant-currency basis) to $247.2 million. Sales in the region benefitted from fourth-quarter early deliveries. However, sales growth in the U.K was countered by decline in the Middle East.Net sales from Asia declined 0.1% (flat on a constant-currency basis) to $133.4 million. Sales growth was mainly witnessed in India and China, countered by dismal performance from all other regions.               Other UpdatesAt the end of the quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $166.9 million, long-term debt of $444.3 million and shareholders’ equity of $653 million.Since the prior-year quarter, the company has undertaken several store closures. At the end of the third quarter of 2017, the company’s total store count was 556 compared with 610 stores in the year-ago period.OutlookFor 2017, Fossil Group expects net sales to decline in the range of 8.5-10.5%, comparatively wider than the previously estimated decline of 4.5-8.5%. The company expects adjusted operating margin growth in the range of flat to up 1.3%. Further, it projects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of a loss of 45 cents to earnings of 10 cents. The revised guidance is considerably lower than the prior earnings estimation of 35 cents to $1.15.For fourth-quarter 2017, the company expects net sales to decrease in the range of 11-3.5%. Adjusted operating margin growth is anticipated in the range of 1.8-5.5%. Consequently, Fossil Group expects adjusted earnings in the range of 10-65 cents per share.Fossil Group continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category. However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company anticipates considerable growth opportunities in the connected wearables business and plans to continue investing in the same. It also remains on track with New World Fossil initiative which has been aiding cost reduction and inducing efficiency in its operations.Stocks to Consider Investors may consider other stocks from the same sector such as Burlington Stores, Inc.

3394,HD,"Retail is no more restricted to brick-&-mortar. The scenario has drastically changed with the advancement of technology and digital transformation that are playing key roles in changing consumer shopping pattern. Consumers now prefer to shop online from the comfort of their homes rather than hopping from one store to another. Nevertheless, this transition has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market products, and Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) is no exception to the trend.But before jumping on how Target is bracing itself for 2018 retail war, let’s analyze the changing retail scenario.Changing Retail EcosystemThe major disruption in the brick-&-mortar format or to say in a more sophisticated manner, the reason behind the today’s ultra-competitive retail environment is because of Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report). The e-commerce giant is aggressively making headway into retail space be it grocery, books, clothes and accessories or electronics, you name it and you have it. With its compelling pricing strategy and the buyout of Whole Foods, the online retail bellwether has caused a tectonic shift in the retail landscape. Moreover, through Prime membership program it is trying to build a loyal customer base and provide them lucrative deals, same-day delivery options and others.To tackle the growing Amazon dominance, Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) is striving hard to give itself a complete makeover by moving beyond brick-&-mortar and to resonate with customers’ evolving shopping patterns. This supermarket giant has long been undertaking aggressive efforts to facilitate shopping through miscellaneous channels.This is well-evident from its constant e-commerce initiatives — including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. Its Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business along with making shopping easier and faster. Further to fortify position in online grocery business, Wal-Mart acquired a delivery start-up Parcel, Inc., which specializes in same-day delivery.Target Sharpening the EdgeNo wonder Target is trying all means to rapidly adapt to the changes in the retail ecosystem. We believe that initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores, bode well. The company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers. We observed that comparable digital channel sales surged 24% during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and added 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales.This general merchandise retailer recently launched curbside pickup program, at 50 Twin Cities stores. This program gives customers an option to get ordered items without leaving the comfort of their cars. It has also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. Further, in order to improve supply chain and expand delivery capabilities, the company had acquired Grand Junction.To tap digital sales this holiday season, Target strengthened relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express, including voice-activated shopping. Wal-Mart and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) are also using Google's voice-activated shopping platform. Target has also made a concerted effort on the front of same-day delivery services by acquiring internet-based grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 million.Certainly, Target is leaving no stone unturned to attract consumers and attain incremental revenues. We believe that these strategies are likely to bolster the company’s performance and drive the stock further.

3395,HD,"The Home Depot, Inc.’s (HD  -  Free Report) five-year long trend of beating earnings estimates, robust growth strategies, solid focus on Pro Customers and a disciplined capital allocation strategy make it a safe pick for your portfolio.Driven by these attributes, shares of this world’s largest home improvement specialty retailer surged 34.8% in the past year. The stock has outperformed the industry’s gain of 27.2% and the broader Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 26%. In addition, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock boasts a VGM Score of A and a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.4%.Growth DriversHome Depot has been implementing several initiatives to drive growth. In response to the evolving retail environment, where digital and physical stores go hand in hand, the company remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities. In this direction, it has made great strides by redesigning its website with enhanced features for better search and faster checkout, upgraded mobile app, and addition of the estimated time of arrival feature. Further, the company continues to invest in fulfillment options to cater to customers’ demand through the launch of its customer order management system and the Buy Online Deliver From Store capability.Being a leading player in the highly-fragmented home improvement industry, Home Depot is gaining from consistent focus on improving customer experience, solid execution and consistent housing market recovery. The company has been revamping itself by concentrating on square footage growth and maximizing productivity from its existing store base. It recently acquired Compact Power Equipment that marked another step toward improving its portfolio service offerings for its Pro customers. It is likely to have a positive impact on gross margin in fiscal 2017.Meanwhile, a disciplined capital allocation strategy helps Home Depot to make investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns. Further, the company remains focused on developing merchandising tools and increasing investment in e-commerce to boost top-line growth and enhance market share.Home Depot’s five-year long trend of beating earnings estimates continued in third-quarter fiscal 2017 as well, with sales topping estimates for the fifth straight quarter. Results gained from strength in core business as well as relentless focus on affording innovative products, which enhanced interconnected customer experience and productivity. Steady housing market recovery and strong customer demand also remained tailwinds. Consequently, management raised its guidance and anticipates earnings per share to be up nearly 14% to $7.36 in fiscal 2017 compared with the previous guidance of 13% growth to $7.29.Concerns/WeaknessesThough Home Depot has been posting splendid results for a long time, the company’s gross margin looks troubled. Evidently, the company’s gross margin contracted 10 basis points year over year in third-quarter fiscal 2017 on lower sales due to hurricanes. While hurricane-related activities aided comps growth, gross margins on such sales were significantly below the company’s average. Unfortunately, this is likely to continue in the remainder of fiscal 2017. Moreover, competition from online retailers may impact performance. Bottom LineWe expect the decline in gross margins to be temporary. Gross margin is expected to benefit from the company’s solid growth strategies.Looking for Solid Retail Picks, Check TheseSome better-ranked stocks in the broader Retail sector include Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.

3398,HD,"Third quarter earnings season is winding down, but this week there are still over 250 companies expected to report earnings, with many of them being the big retailers.The retail sector has been one of the gloomiest groups on Wall Street. Many investors believe that they will ALL be Amazoned. But the department stores have already reported and it wasn’t too bad. Will the others follow suit?Tracey looked through the retail earnings charts to find those with the best track records this week. Some of these are trading near new highs, but some are not.Keep an eye on comparable store sales guidance as well as the earnings miss or beat. It’s just as important as beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.All 5 of these companies have had great comparable store sales results in the last few quarters. Can they do it again in a challenging retail environment?5 Top Retail Earnings Charts1.    Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) is a beast. Not only has it beat every quarter for 5 years it is also crushing the comparables. In the second quarter, it did a 6.3% sales comp. Almost no one in the industry is doing it as well as Home Depot.2.    TJX Companies (TJX  -  Free Report) is cashing in on the popular Home Goods chain, which did a 7% sales comparable last quarter. Consumers are willing to spend on their homes. But TJ Maxx’s shares have been a bit weak. Will another good quarter boost the stock out of its narrow trading range?3.    Children’s Place (PLCE  -  Free Report) is a mall-based retailer who hasn’t missed in 5 years. This type of specialty retailer was supposed to be Amazoned, and its competitor, Gymboree, was, as it declared bankruptcy and closed 330 stores. But this gave a boost to Children’s Place. It had a 3.1% comparable last quarter.4.    L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) used to be the darling of the Street with its popular Pink brand but Pink isn’t as popular as it once was and it has also exited swimwear. It pre-announced sales comps of 2% and shares are off the lows.5.    Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report) was supposed to be Amazoned years ago but instead of caving in to the competition, it upped its game and came roaring back. Its last earnings miss was nearly 5 years ago and it did a 5.4% comp last quarter, among the best in the industry.

3399,HD,"With Q3 earnings season nearly over, the focus is likely to shift to the retail sector, which hogs all attention with the advent of the holiday season. Retail stocks get a thrust during this busiest part of the year, which is often a make-or-break time for retailers. As the countdown to Black Friday begins, investors also scurry for bright spots in the space.Eye-popping Black Friday deals usher in the Christmas shopping bonanza. Apart from price-matching policies, retailers try to sweep buyers off their feet with early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies and free shipping on online purchases. Competition will certainly be tough, be it at the brick-and-mortar stores or online portals.Per the survey conducted by RetailMeNot, consumers are likely to spend an average of $743 this year during the Black Friday weekend through Cyber Monday up from the prior-year figure of $505.Retailers such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Best Buy (BBY  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report) and others are efficiently allocating a large chunk of their capital toward a multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers, renovating stores with a modern look, and developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery.Retail Space Rides on Favorable IndicatorsThe rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, an improving labor market, along with a rising housing market and manufacturing sector signal that the economy is in recovery mode that rose 3% in the third quarter of 2017. Further, the Fed’s indication of a likely rate hike in December reflects the underlying fundamental strength of the economy.Analysts believe that buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, fall in the unemployment rate to 17-year low, and a lift in the economic activity post hurricanes were enough to boost consumer confidence. We anticipate this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales in the current retail landscape, which is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers.

3400,HD,"Benchmarks finished higher on Tuesday after a slew of strong corporate earnings led gains for healthcare stocks. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record levels, with the blue-chip index touching the psychological 23,000 milestone for the first time in its 120-year history. Meanwhile, industrial production for September rebounded after two straight months in the lull.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,997.44, gaining 0.2%.

In its history spanning over a century, the blue-chip index has registered the fourth 1,000-point increase within a year for the first time — the largest so far.Economists believe that such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index has partially been due to optimism built around hopes of tax cuts after the new tax code was formulated by President Trump. Gains have also been in part due to a strong corporate earnings and broadly encouraging economic conditions.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) have contributed the most toward Dow’s significant 1,000-point ascent since Aug 2 — when blue–chip index surpassed the 22,000 mark for the first time, adding 142 and 121 points, respectively. For the year, the two stocks have rallied 65.9% and 41.2%, respectively, so far.

3401,HD,"Investors on the lookout for stocks that have the potential to offer the best growth as well as value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive growth prospects but are trading at a discount. Unlike the blend strategy, a portfolio created on the GARP way of investing is expected to help find stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS), and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Los Angeles, CA-based CBRE Group Inc.  operates as a commercial real estate services and investment company. It has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 18.71% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.MSCI Inc.

3402,HD,"Home improvement retailer, The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has been putting up a good show of late with its stock not having witnessed a downside in a long time. This could be mainly attributed to strong earnings trends, robust outlook, efforts to improve customer experience along with promising capital strategy. Additionally a recovering housing market and the rehabilitation process following the hurricanes have been aiding its performance.Superb Stock PerformanceShares of Home Depot, which seems unhindered at the moment, have surged 30.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s upside of 25.2%. This solid growth comes on the back of a spectacular surprise history and growth strategies, including an interconnected strategy and focus on Pro customers. Moreover, the company’s Growth Score of A suggests that the stock is bound to leap further.Robust Surprise History and Outlook Drive OptimismHome Depot has been reporting strong financial figures since 2008, with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. Notably, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 results marked the 13th straight sales beat, while it also retained the five-year long trend of delivering positive earnings surprise. The company is gaining from solid growth across all regions, both in stores and online. Further, Pro category sales continue to outperform, driven by constant efforts to enrich customers’ experiences. Additionally, housing market recovery remains a tailwind. The sturdy first half and expectations of improved home prices and re-emergence of first-time homebuyers, encouraged the company to raise fiscal 2017 view.Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteInterconnected Strategy — The Core Growth PlanHome Depot has been implementing several initiatives to drive long-term growth. The most prominent among them is building its interconnected capabilities to cater to the evolving retail backdrop, where digital and physical stores go hand in hand. In sync with this trend, the company has redesigned its website, upgraded mobile app, and introduced speedy checkout, which resulted in online sales growth of nearly 23% in second-quarter fiscal 2017. The dot.com sales also represented nearly 6.4% of the company’s top-line. Moreover, Home Depot’s interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot.com investments as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to cater to customers’ demand. We believe that these efforts will drive the company’s top and bottom-line in the long run.Pro Customers Remain Key Driving FactorHome Depot has been gaining from its focus on Professional Customers, or Pro Customers. Notably, sales from this category continued to outperform in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Notably, the company has undertaken several strides in this regard, which has helped it reap significant benefits. It is evident from Home Depot’s recent acquisition of Compact Power Equipment, which marked another step toward improving portfolio service offerings to Pro customers. This buyout is likely to have a positive impact on the gross margin in fiscal 2017.Disciplined Capital Strategy to Appease ShareholdersHome Depot has always maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy, focused on making investments to develop business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks. As evidence of progress on the strategic initiatives and commitment to reward shareholders, the company targets a dividend payout ratio of about 55% of earnings. The company bought back 17.3 million shares for nearly $2.6 billion in second-quarter fiscal 2017, which took its year-to-date buybacks to $3.9 billion. Moreover, management raised fiscal 2017 buyback target from $5 billion to $7 billion.Bottom LineWhile all is well with Home Depot, its margins look troubled. However, the aforementioned strategic initiatives and other measures clearly position it for an impending growth. Aptly, Home Depot currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want More of Retail?

3403,HD,"Holiday season and retail are synonymous, and with the upcoming festive season, the spotlight is back on the sector. Most of the retailers kick start their holiday season from Thanksgiving Day as buying on this holiday has become an emerging trend. Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) has decided to keep stores open, a tradition which it has been following since 2013, per media reports.This time the department store chain will open its doors at 5 p.m. and will remain open until 2 a.m. It will again reopen its stores on Black Friday. To take on online rivals, brick-and-mortar retailers do not want to miss out a single opportunity to attract shoppers who start early and seek attractive deals, and so keep their doors open on Thanksgiving. Additionally, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s move is seen as part of its effort to aggressively capitalize on the holiday season, in order to provide cushion to its dwindling top and bottom line. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 unveils that net sales declined decreased 7.4%, 3.9%, 4.2% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, while earnings per share plunged 28.6%, 15.6%, 69.6% and 3.3% during the respective quarters. During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017 the scenario was no different, as net sales declined 7.5% and 5.4%, while earnings per share fell 40% and 11.1%, respectively.Macy’s dismal top and bottom lines performance has remain the primary concern for investors and this has gravely hurt the stock's performance. We note that the stock has plunged roughly 29.9% in the past six months wider than the industry's decline of 15.8%.The holiday season accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits, and retailers are well on their toes to capitalize on this festive spirit, flooding the markets with offers and promotions.Opposition to Remaining OpenThe issue of stores remaining open on Thanksgiving has been played up by a movement, largely dependent on social media. This includes pages on Facebook such as Boycott Black Thursday and Boycott Shopping on Thanksgiving Day. The idea is to reclaim Thanksgiving as a day to spend at home eating with the family rather than shopping. Consumers can then be free to shop on Black Friday.In the previous year companies such as The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) remained closed on Thanksgiving.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

3404,HD,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 14, before the opening bell.We note that this leading off-price retailer’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters, with a trailing four-quarter average beat of 3.2%.Let’s now look into some factors that are likely to impact third-quarter results.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has been stable in the past 30 days at $1.00. Further, estimated earnings depict a year-on-year growth of 9.9%. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $8,885 million for the said quarter, reflecting an improvement of 7.2% from the prior-year period.Factors Influencing the QuarterHigher store traffic has been benefiting TJX Companies’ comps for the last 33 quarters.  In order to maintain sales momentum in stores, the company has been adhering to aggressive store openings and brand-enhancing initiatives. Evidently, TJX Companies plans to open approximately 260 stores during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018. Further, the company’s HomeSense store concept (launched during the second quarter) is expected to aid comps this season.In order to support store traffic growth, TJX Companies has been undertaking strategic marketing and advertising campaigns. Its gift-giving initiatives and loyalty card program have aided improved customer engagement. TJX Companies has also been ramping up e-commerce business and plans to add more categories to the online shopping site.The company is aiming to invest categorically to differentiate e-commerce business from its brick-and-mortar stores. Such efforts are likely to augment TJX Companies’ business and thereby benefit top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter.TJX Companies, Inc.

(The) QuoteHowever, the company has been struggling with rising costs and expects pre-tax margins to be under pressure during the third quarter, thanks to an increase in employee payroll.

So let’s see if TJX Companies’ growth endeavors can counter these hurdles in the third quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?

Well, the obvious question that comes to mind is will this operator of general merchandise stores be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the trailing four quarters, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15.1%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at 85 cents down from $1.04 reported in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $16,521 million compared with $16,441 million in the prior-year quarter. Target envisions third-quarter earnings in the band of 75-95 cents a share.Factors at PlayTarget’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores are encouraging. Additionally, the company intends to deploy resources to significantly develop online platform as well as store facilities to make shopping more convenient for customers.In a bid to stimulate its digital sales this holiday season, Target is also strengthening its relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express including voice-activated shopping. We observed that comparable digital channel sales surged 32% during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and added 1.1 percentage points to comparable sales.Meanwhile, Target plans to expand merchandise assortments with special emphasis on Style, Baby, Kids and Wellness categories that are performing well.

These measures will facilitate it to generate incremental sales and increase store transactions through higher conversion rate. Further, the company’s foray into international markets is likely to provide long-term growth opportunities and generate increased sales volumes.We believe that L Brands’ sustained focus on cost containment, inventory management, merchandise, and speed-to-market initiatives has kept it afloat in a competitive environment. This is evident from its positive earnings surprise history. In the trailing eight quarters, it has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 8.4%.Comps Seem Back on TrackL Brands finally broke its streak of declining comparable sales (comps) in October, reporting 2% gain. As a result, management now expects third-quarter earnings to be at the high end of its previously estimated guidance range of 25-30 cents. However, this is still down from the prior-year quarter earnings of 42 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has increased by a penny in the past 30 days, and is presently pegged at 30 cents.Additionally, comps have declined 2%, 4%, 7%, 9%, 7%, 5%, 10%, 13% and 4% in September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively. Meanwhile, the company continues to face short-term challenges due to its decision to exit the swimwear category that failed to generate desired results.Will Earnings & Revenues Continue to Decline?L Brands dwindling earnings and revenues remain the primary concern for investors. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2017 unveils that net sales declined 7% and 5%, while earnings per share fell 44% and 31% in the first and second quarter, respectively. Moreover, the second quarter marked the fourth-straight quarter when the company’s top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Per analysts surveyed by Zacks, third-quarter earnings are likely to decline more than 28% year over year.

However, the quarterly earnings declined roughly 6.7% year over year due to higher SG&A expenses. Even an increase in top line failed to act as a savior.

3409,HD,"Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is set to report the third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9.Despite continuous efforts to boost store traffic, the company has been struggling with bleak comparable store sales (comps). This trend is likely to continue in the third quarter, which may affect Kohl’s performance.Let’s look into some of the aspects that are anticipated to have an impact on the company’s third-quarter results.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable at 71 cents over the past 30 days, which depicts a decline of 11.3% from the year-ago earnings of 80 cents.We note that the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 18%. In fact, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in seven out of past eight quarters.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteFurther, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,301 million for the third quarter, down 0.6% from the prior-year period.Factors Impacting the Quarter Kohl’s has been witnessing dismal comps for some time, thanks to heightened competition and cautious consumer spending on apparel items and accessories. This can be attributed to a difficult sales environment stemming from evolving consumer patterns, which has significantly affected store traffic. Evidently, comps witnessed a year-over-year drop of 2.2% during fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, while it declined 2.7% and 0.4% during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. In fact, comps have declined consecutively in the last six quarters. This indicates that the company’s “Greatness Agenda”, which was designed to increase transactions per store, has been failing to deliver adequate results. The consensus mark for the third quarter projects flat comps with the prior-year quarter.Nevertheless, Kohl's has been undertaking initiatives to boost its store performance. Since October the company has started offering more outside famous brands, while cutting down sales of in-house clothing brands. Kohl's stores have begun accepting returns from Amazon.com’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) customers on select products in 82 of its U.S. store locations. Kohl's has also started selling Amazon’s devices, accessories and smart home products in 10 selected stores in Los Angeles and Chicago.Additionally, we expect Kohl's third-quarter performance to benefit from surging e-commerce business.

3410,HD,"Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9, after the closing bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading fashion specialty retailer will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the soon-to-be reported quarter.The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the five consecutive quarters now. It has also pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 36.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has been stable at 63 cents in the past 30 days but reflects nearly 25% decline from 84 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.6 billion, up 1.7% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for revenues at Nordstrom full-line stores and Nordstrom Rack are currently pegged at $1,495 million and $997 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year decline of 4.7% for Nordstrom full-line stores but 4.1% increase for Nordstrom Rack.Factors at PlayNordstrom’s shares have lost 18.9% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.8%. The downturn was owing to the temporary call off of the Nordstrom family's plans to take the company private.Though Nordstrom’s growth strategy bodes well, investments related to occupancy, technology, supply chain and marketing are expected to increase near-term cost and weigh upon margins. Evidently, the company’s merchandise performance was hurt by higher occupancy expenses related to new Rack and Canada stores in the previous quarter. Also, for fiscal 2017, management anticipates Retail gross profit to be impacted by higher new store occupancy expenses and mix impact from off-price growth.Further, the company’s projections for SG&A expenses incorporates higher technology and supply chain expenses related to its growth initiatives, offset by progress in productivity improvements.While Nordstrom’s business is in line with the evolving retail industry that focuses on offering maximum choices to customers to enhance their shopping experience, the company cannot be fully immune to the ill-effects of the industry. However, sales growth at Nordstrom Racks and solid e-commerce performance remains encouraging. Also, the company’s cost saving initiatives, store expansion efforts and progress on 2020 strategy remains on track and is likely to drive growth.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Nordstrom is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

3411,HD,"Leading departmental store chain, Dillard’s, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) is expected to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 9. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether the company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter.A look at the company’s earnings trend shows that Dillard’s has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last eight quarters. In fact, it incurred a loss of 58 cents per share in the previous quarter, which compares unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 21 cents.Let’s see what lies ahead for Dillard’s in the quarter under review.Which Way are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has moved down by 3 cents to 23 cents in the past 30 days. This reflects a plunge of about 65% from 67 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.Analysts polled by Zacks also expect revenues of $1.3 billion, down 4.9% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Factors at PlayDillard’s has been facing challenging trends in the retail sector, particularly in the apparel division. As the retail landscape is undergoing a fundamental change with technology playing a major role and customers’ preferences shifting from offline to online, the brick-and-mortar retailing concept is losing sheen. Also, retailers’ comparable-store sales are on the decline that is denting overall profits.Evidently, Dillard’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 results were hurt, wherein both the top and bottom lines declined year over year. Further, merchandise comps were down 1%, mainly due to soft sales across the shoes, cosmetics, home and furniture categories. Results were marred by higher markdowns undertaken by the company to manage inventories.Additionally, macroeconomic challenges like consumer spending patterns, demographic trends as well as stiff industry competition remains major concerns for the company.These factors have been reflected in the company’s share price that plunged 30.9% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 18.4%.While these factors pose concerns for the company, Dillard’s constant efforts to capitalize on growth opportunities in its brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce business remain encouraging. Further, its focus on increasing productivity, enhancing domestic operations and developing an omni-channel platform should strengthen customer base.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Dillard’s is unlikely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

3412,HD,"Office Depot, Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report), which is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 9, has seen shares plunge 47.6% in the past three months. Notably, the stock has underperformed the industry that declined 11.5% and the broader Retail-Wholesale sector that gained 4.5% in the same time frame.How are Estimates Shaping Up?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this supplier of a range of office products and services will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the preceding quarter, it had missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3%.Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable in the last 30 days, and is currently pegged at 14 cents down from 16 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Factors Likely to Hurt the Bottom LineThe office products sector has been grappling with multiple headwinds, and Office Depot is not fully immune to these. Demand for office products (paper-based) has been decreasing due to technological advancements. Smartphones, tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper-based office supplies.Dismal Top-Line PerformanceOffice Depot continues to battle a dismal top-line that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 12th straight quarter, when it reported second-quarter 2017 results. The company’s total sales of $2,363 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,460 million and fell 9% year over year, following a decline of 7% in the preceding quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect third-quarter revenue to be $2,612 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.9%.After assessing the impact of recent hurricanes, sluggish sales and soft traffic during the back to school period and a temporary rise in the supply chain costs, Office Depot now expects total sales to decline in the band of 7-8% during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales for Business Solutions Division are anticipated to tumble between 5% and 6% in constant currency.Declining CompsStiff competition from online retailers, loss of customers in Business Solutions Division and lower traffic count in retail stores are making things tough for Office Depot. We note that the company has been witnessing dismal comparable-store sales run for quite some time now. A look at the company’s performance in fiscal 2016 unveils that comps have declined 1%, 1%, 2% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. In the first and second quarters of 2017, the same has tumbled 5% and 6%, respectively. Management expects comps to decline in the range of 5-6% during the third quarter.Remedies UndertakenOffice Depot has undertaken a strategic review of business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure to bring itself back on growth trajectory. The company now intends to focus on core North American market. It is also closing underperforming stores, reducing exposure to higher dollar-value inventory items, shuttering non-critical distribution facilities, concentrating on e-commerce platforms as well as focusing on providing innovative products and services. The company by increasing its penetration into adjacent categories and enhancing share of wallet with existing customers intends to boost sales in the contract channel.With respect to the cost containment effort, Office Depot is employing a more efficient customer coverage model, focusing on lowering indirect procurement costs as well as general and administrative expenditures, and also gaining from its U.S. retail store optimization plan. Office Depot recently acquired CompuCom Systems that help it acclimatize to the fast changing retail landscape along with providing enterprise-level tech services and products to customers.Office Depot, Inc.

3414,HD,"The Q3 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are up 2.3% from the same period last year on 10.1% revenue growth with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 63.6% beating revenue estimates.While earnings growth is well below the last reporting cycle and the four-quarter average, revenue growth has been accelerating compared with the other recent periods. Additionally, the quarter so far has witnessed an above-average proportion of positive surprises, implying that the momentum has been carried forward. Further, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).This is especially true given the impressive stock market performance of department store operators like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report), J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and others following their quarterly releases. Nordstrom and J.C. Penney posted better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, Kohl's beat on revenues but missed on earnings, while Macy's beat on earnings and missed on revenues.The strength in these stocks led to smooth trading in the broad retail sector. In fact, retail ETFs — SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) — added 0.7%, 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

3415,HD,"If you wish to make merry this Christmas holidays, you still got time to add that extra jingle to your portfolio by adding growth stocks. Notably, these are hot and flourishing stocks with earnings growth potential. A booming U.S. economy as evident from third-quarter GDP growth rate of 3.3%, supportive monetary policy as well as tax reform and robust corporate earnings all seem to be working in tandem for investors.Barring a few hiccups, the U.S. stock market has displayed a decent run. So far in the year, the S&P 500 has gained 17.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 22.3%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has surged 25.6%. We believe that if the government well channelized the policies and implements pro-investors and pro-corporate reforms, the major indices could attain new highs.Well the recent tax overhaul plan passed by the Senate seems to be working in favor of retailers, who topped the list with a corporate tax rate of as much as 35%. President Trump has been advocating a tax rate of as much as 20% and pushing hard to pass on the benefits to companies who generate all or most part of revenues in the United States. Well this may not go well down with sectors, which fall under the low tax bracket and enjoy other tax benefits.Nevertheless, among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors, we are focusing on Retail-Wholesale sector today. The sector has gained 27% so far in the year, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 Index.Retail Seems to be the Season’s DemandImproving labor market, rising disposable income and elevated consumer sentiment have ushered confidence in retailers about a robust holiday season. The festive season is often a make-or-break time for retailers, as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. The five-day holiday period starting from Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday to Cyber Monday, marked an auspicious start to the season.Indeed, shopping season is likely to be more blissful for retailers. With Christmas falling on Monday and 32 days after Thanksgiving, shoppers are getting one extra day compared with last year and an extended weekend to do last minute purchasing.Overall, NRF projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Data compiled by eMarketer forecasts 3.1% jump in holiday sales (November and December) to $923.15 billion, while retail e-commerce holiday season sales are anticipated to rise 16.6%.Having said that we believe the sector offers lucrative opportunities for investors to make their Christmas holidays special. Here we have highlighted four Retail/Wholesale stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B. These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results. Not only this, these stocks have outperformed their respective industries.4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in PetMed Express, Inc. (PETS  -  Free Report) with a long-term earnings growth rate of 10% and a Growth Score of A. In the past one year, the stock has surged roughly 82.8% and outperformed the industry, which grew 50.2%.

3416,HD,"For people who are approaching their retirement, investing can be bit of a challenge.Yes, we are talking about baby boomers, the generation born between 1946 and 1964 per the U.S. Census Bureau. This generation is one of the largest in the history of the United States, currently estimated to be 74.1 million in number and accounting for approximately 23% of the country’s population. The oldest members are now 72 years old, while the youngest are just about to turn 54.The first baby boomer officially retired in late 2007 and since then, the number has increased to millions over the past decade, as increasing number of baby boomers continue to reach their retirement age. Over the next 15-20 years, the majority of them will have left the workforce.But are they financially strong enough to maintain their lifestyle and meet healthcare costs post retirement?We Don’t Think SoPer Pew Charitable Trusts’ latest report, only 13% of working baby boomers are currently covered under pension schemes. This means the majority of retirees will need to plan their retirement on their own, making it the most challenging factor for the boomers.Furthermore, this generation is notably believed to be the most active and wealthiest group of their era. Also, baby boomers were the biggest beneficiary of the 1982-2000 secular bull market, which gave them the opportunity to make plenty of money through aggressive investment in stock markets.Despite this, the generation has not saved enough assets due to the boomers’ excessive spending habits and luxurious lifestyle, according to a Paladin Registry report. The report states that about 60% of baby boomers have inadequate assets for post retirement survival.Additionally, the generation is expected to have a longer life span — thanks to the advanced medical science and healthier lifestyles — which again means they need more funds for longer periods. Escalating healthcare costs is another challenge, which boomers have to face with increasing age.Therefore, as the majority of baby boomers are still working, they need to plan their investments to maintain their living standards post retirement.Things to Keep in MindIn our opinion, if one has enough assets to maintain existing lifestyle and meet necessary healthcare expenses, it will be wise to play safe and invest in less risky portfolio. However, the majority of this generation does not have this liberty due to lack of adequate savings.Therefore, they need to invest in assets, which can generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Obviously, baby boomers will never get that return by investing in bonds. So, which investment plan has the potential to generate regular returns and provide them the opportunity to accumulate assets for the future as well?Investment in Blue Chip Dividend Stocks is the Best ChoiceBlue chip dividend stocks boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are unperturbed by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size as well.The companies’ dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.Our PicksWe have, thus, selected four blue chip dividend stocks for baby boomers that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), and have a dividend yield of more than 2%. The search was also narrowed down with a VGM score of A or B. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. All these four stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 index over the past decade.The first stock is one of the world’s leading semiconductor companies, KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has a VGM Score of B and a dividend yield of 2.2%.Our next pick is also from the tech sector — Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report). The company sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has a VGM Score of  A and a dividend yield of 2.3%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Another stock is Cummins Inc. (CMI  -  Free Report), which designs, manufactures, distributes, and services diesel and natural gas engines, and engine-related component products worldwide.

3418,HD,"If you are looking for maximum returns from a portfolio of stocks that offers the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive prospects.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO  -  Free Report) offers solutions and technologies for Enterprise Decision Management.

3421,HD,"After witnessing a negative earnings surprise of 33.3% in the second quarter of 2017, Office Depot, Inc. (ODP  -  Free Report) delivered in-line earnings in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the top line came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate after missing the same in the trailing 12 quarters. This along with the company’s transformation plan to give itself a complete makeover helped the stock to rise 7.6% during the trading session yesterday.This office supplies retailer posted adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 14 cents that met the consensus estimate but declined roughly 13% from the prior-year quarter, as the top line continues to struggle. The company generated sales of $2,620 million that fared marginally better than analysts’ expectations of $2,612 million but declined 8% year over year due to hurricane related disruptions as one of the primary factors.For quite some time now, Office Depot has been grappling with dwindling top-line performance. Analysts pointed out that demand for office products (paper-based) has been decreasing due to technological advancements. Smartphones, tablets and laptops are fast emerging as viable substitutes for paper-based office supplies. Further, stiff competition from online retailers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), loss of customers in Business Solutions Division and lower traffic count in retail stores have been playing spoilsport.The reflection of the same is quite visible from the stock’s performance in the bourses. So far in the year, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have plunged 28.3%, wider than the industry’s decline of 22.2%.Nevertheless, the company is closing underperforming stores, reducing exposure to higher dollar-value inventory items, shuttering non-critical distribution facilities, concentrating on e-commerce platforms as well as focusing on offering innovative products and services.Gross profit plunged 13% year over year to $633 million, while gross margin contracted 140 basis points (bps) to 24.2%. Adjusted operating income came in at $131 million, down 17% from the year-ago period, while adjusted operating margin shriveled 60 bps to 5%.Segment PerformanceIn the reported quarter, the Retail Division’s sales fell 10% to $1,329 million on account of planned closure of stores, hurricane impacts and a 5% drop in comparable-store sales (comps). Comps declined due to fall in foot traffic and average order purchase value during the back-to-school season. The segment reported operating income of $82 million, down 22% from the prior-year quarter, while operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 6.2% due to lower sales and gross margin rate, partly offset by fall in SG&A expenses. Total store count at the division was 1,404 at the quarter end. During the quarter, the company shut down four outlets, thereby bringing the total store closure count to 109 under the second phase.Sales for Business Solutions Division tumbled 4% to $1,288 million on account of customer attrition in the contract channel, stiff competition and hurricane impacts. The segment posted operating income of $71 million, down from $81 million reported in the year-ago period. Operating margin decreased 50 bps to 5.5% due to lower sales and gross margin rate, partly offset by effective cost management, including lower SG&A expenses.Office Depot, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Office Depot, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Office Depot, Inc. QuoteOther Financial DetailsOffice Depot ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $788 million, long-term debt (net of current maturities) of $265 million, non-recourse debt of $781 million, and shareholders’ equity of $2,042 million.During the quarter, the company generated cash flow of $293 million from operating activities and incurred capital expenditures of $37 million, thereby resulting in free cash flow of $256 million. Management continues to expect free cash flow from continuing operations of more than $300 million in 2017. The company anticipates capital expenditures of approximately $125 million in 2017, which comprises of investments to fund critical priorities.During the quarter, the company bought back 4 million shares for an aggregate amount of $17 million. Since May 2016, the company has bought back approximately 45 million shares at a total cost of $166 million with $84 million remaining at its disposal under the current share repurchase authorization of $250 million.Discontinuation of International BusinessOffice Depot concluded the sale of its mainland China business and has entered into a deal to divest operations in Australia and New Zealand. However, the company has retained sourcing and trading operations in Asia. Results from the Asia operations are reported as “Other” segment.OutlookManagement expects total sales to be lower in 2017 in comparison with 2016, owing to the store closures, tough market conditions, hurricane impacts and losses of contract customers in the previous year. However, management anticipates the rate of decline to decelerate in the final quarter after taking into consideration higher customer retention and strategic endeavors, along with the implementation of new customer wins.After assessing the impact of recent hurricanes, sluggish sales and soft traffic during the back to school period, temporary rise in the supply chain costs and investments to catapult into a services-driven company, Office Depot now envisions adjusted operating income in the range of $400-$425 million, down from $500 million projected previously.Strategic MeasuresAfter the termination of merger with Staples, Office Depot has undertaken a strategic review of business operating model, growth prospects and cost structure. To give itself a facelift, the company recently acquired CompuCom Systems, Inc. The buyout will help this traditional office supplies retailer to widen its domain of offerings.The company will now be able to provide enterprise-level tech services and products to customers. Management believes that the addition of CompuCom will help take a huge leap toward automation and innovation. The acquisition is likely to add approximately $1.1 billion in revenues and help realize cost savings of more than $40 million within a period of two years. The company also launched a new subscription-based business services platform, BizBox, to assist start-ups and small businesses on host of things such as website designing, financing and accounting service, HR/payroll support and others.Office Depot is also employing a more efficient customer coverage model, focusing on lowering indirect procurement costs as well as general and administrative expenditures. Further, the company will also gain from its U.S. retail store optimization plan. Management expects these endeavors to result in annual benefits of over $250 million by the end of 2018 with nearly two-thirds of those benefits are expected to be realized by the end of the current year.Interested in Retail?

Moreover, as a part of store rationalization program, the company plans to shut down underperforming stores.

3423,HD,"Supermarket giant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has been making aggressive efforts to expand in the e-commerce space, which is dominated by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). Efforts to enhance physical and digital operations has been fueling Walmart’s top line and U.S. comparable store sales (comps) for quite some time now, helping it surge about 30% over a year, faring better than the industry’s 19.6% jump.Also, the company’s bottom line has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for eight straight quarters now. So, let’s see how things are placed for the company, which is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 16.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteFactors Setting the Stage for Q3While Walmart’s constant efforts to expand in the e-commerce space is likely to fuel its top line, investments associated with these expansions may weigh upon its margins. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has remained stable over the past 30 days at 97 cents. The estimate is pegged a penny lower than the year-ago period earnings figure. Nonetheless, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $121.1 billion, up over 2% from revenues reported in the year-ago quarter.Robust E-Commerce Initiatives – A Major Growth DriverAs Amazon’s growing dominance has created intense competition for retailers, Walmart has been undertaking significant efforts to boost its e-commerce sales. This was evident in the company’s last reported quarter, wherein both top and bottom lines improved year over year and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were largely driven by strength in the company’s e-commerce business, as evident from a 67% surge in its U.S. e-commerce GMV, with sales up 60% (including acquisitions).  Well, Walmart is likely to continue gaining from its efforts to expand its e-commerce presence across all three divisions. In this regard, the buyouts of Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Bonobos have solidified its product assortment, and are likely to continue fueling sales. Also, the company is set to benefit from its rollout of online grocery, which delivered robust results in the second quarter.Sam’s Club & International Businesses Bode WellWalmart’s Sam’s Club division has also been performing well, as witnessed in the last quarter. Incidentally, Sam’s Club comps (excluding the impact of fuel sales) rose 1.2% compared with 0.6% growth in the prior-year quarter. This was mainly attributable to a 2.1% rise in traffic and 0.8% contribution from e-commerce sales. As for the International segment, results were somewhat impacted by the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia. Nonetheless, Walmart’s initiatives to serve customers better (in-store and e-commerce) helped its International sales climb 2.5% on a currency neutral basis. Notably, nine out of 11 regions posted positive comps, with Walmex continuing to outperform as comps here advanced 7%.We believe that all aforementioned factors, along with strong back-to-school season offerings are likely to drive Walmart in the quarter to be reported. In the third quarter, management expects U.S. comp sales growth in the range of 1.5-2.0%. Sam’s Club comp sales, without the impact of fuel sales, are expected to increase 1-1.5%.Heavy Investments May Pressurize MarginsWhile the aforementioned factors bode well for the company, costs associated with investments in e-commerce expansion and technological advancements; the mix impact from growing e-commerce operations and Walmart’s compelling pricing strategy remains a threat to margins. This, in turn may dent Walmart’s bottom line in the quarter to be reported. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter is envisioned in a range of 90-98 cents per share.Segment Estimates for Q3The consensus mark for Walmart U.S. net sales is currently pegged at $76.7 billion, representing a 2.8% upside from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimates for Walmart International and Sam’s Club sales are pegged at $28.8 billion and $14.6 billion, depicting increases of 1.8% and 2.8%, respectively.A Look at the Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that Walmart is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Though Walmart currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of -0.12% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and flaunts a Zacks Rank #2.

These initiatives are reflected in its second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, when Abercrombie delivered a positive earnings surprise for the first time in last six quarters, following in-line results in the first quarter.Furthermore, the company’s top line outpaced the consensus mark for the second straight quarter. This marked a significant progress on its strategic initiatives and reflected strength in Hollister and direct-to-customer businesses. As a result, management provided an encouraging outlook for fiscal 2017 and the fiscal second half.Additionally, it expects foreign currency to be a tailwind going forward, reflecting slight gains in sales and operating income.However, performance at its namesake brand remains a major concern. While the company is making strides to improve performance at Abercrombie based on learning from Hollister, we believe full turnaround for the brand is still away.Additionally, the company has been witnessing strained margins for last few quarters owing to soft traffic at stores and a highly promotional environment. Abercrombie’s ongoing strategic initiatives to improve profitability have also been weighing on the margins.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Abercrombie is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

3426,HD,"Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 16. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading specialty retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the soon-to-be reported quarter.The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third quarter has been stable at 55 cents in the past 30 days but reflects more than 8% decline from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.8 billion to be almost in line with the prior-year quarter. The consensus mark for net sales at the Gap Global, the Banana Republic Global and the Old Navy Global segments are pegged at $1,269 million, $540 million and 1,773 million, respectively. While these estimates reflect growth of 3% for Gap Global and 0.9% for Old Navy Global, it reveals a decline of 6.7% for the Banana Republic Global segment, compared with the last quarter.Factors at PlayGap’s shares have gained 14.4% year to date, as against the industry’s decline of 20.6%. This performance was driven by its solid focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Meanwhile, the company has been making constant efforts to boost its digital and mobile offerings, besides improving product acceptance. Also, Gap’s new growth strategy focused on growing its Old Navy and Athleta brands looks promising.However, results continue to be soft at the company’s namesake and Banana Republic brands. Moreover, going forward, management expects SG&A expenses to increase at a higher rate than the first half. This mainly stems from increased product, marketing and digital investments for the significant back-to-school selling season. The company expects the rise in costs to hurt its bottom line.Further, Gap’s significant international presence exposes it to adverse currency fluctuations. Though the company’s earnings and sales topped estimates in the previous quarter, currency headwinds caused results to decline year over year. Unfortunately, management expects these hurdles to persist in fiscal 2017, which in turn might dent the quarterly results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that Gap is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Gap, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteGap has an Earnings ESP of -0.76%. Although its Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the stock’s negative ESP does not make us confident of a positive earnings surprise.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Zumiez Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Home Depot, Inc.

Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

3427,HD,"Lowe's Companies, Inc.’s (LOW  -  Free Report) back to back lower-than-expected results, weak margins and a soft outlook for fiscal 2017 have been major concerns for quite some time. In addition, a tough retail landscape and stiff competition from The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) have been weighing upon this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s performance.If we look at the performance of Lowe's in the past six months it shows a sharp contrast from that of Home Depot. In the said time frame, Lowe's shares have dipped 0.6%, as against Home Depot’s gain of 12.2%.Meanwhile, the industry’s performance reveals that it has rallied 6.6%, while the broader Retail-Wholesale sector gained 11%. Notably, Lowe’s dismal run in the bourses is quite evident from its Momentum Score of F.Comparative AnalysisLet’s Take a Closer LookNegative Earnings Surprise TrendA look at Lowe’s bottom-line performance shows that it has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four of the trailing five quarters. The company also delivered average negative earnings surprise of 1.6% in the last four quarters, including a 3.1% negative surprise witnessed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.In the second quarter, this home improvement retailer posted adjusted earnings of $1.57 per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. Net sales of $19,495 million also came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19,524 million. Nevertheless, both sales and earnings grew year over year, albeit at a rate lower than the preceding quarter.Margins Have Been Under PressureMarkedly, Lowe's has been posting weak margins since past few quarters. We note that in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016 the company's gross margin had contracted 25, 40, 10 and 43 basis points (bps), respectively. Also, margins declined 64 and 23 bps to 34.4% and 34.2%, correspondingly, in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017.Going forward, Lowe’s is expected to concentrate on consumer messaging and invest in incremental customer-facing hours in its stores that are likely to weigh on margins.Drab Outlook Hurt Investor’s SentimentWaning margins and negative earnings surprise trend compelled management to take somewhat conservative stance while issuing earnings and operating margin guidance.In fact, the company envisions earnings in the band of $4.20–$4.30 per share for fiscal 2017 versus $4.30, projected earlier. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year is pegged higher at $4.51. Furthermore, operating margin is anticipated to increase about 80 to 100 bps down from 120 bps, expected earlier.Can the Tables Turn for Lowe's?We believe that an improving job scenario, housing market recovery, merchandising initiatives and post hurricane construction activities along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well for Lowe’s. Also, the buyout of Maintenance Supply Headquarters is expected to help strengthen relationship with the pro customers.Moreover, Lowe’s strategic initiatives to make a turnaround cannot be ignored. We believe that these ongoing strategies will take time to deliver pronounced results. Meanwhile, investors can consider some better-ranked stocks such as Zumiez Inc.  and Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (LL  -  Free Report).Zumiez, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 18%, has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 27.1% in the last four quarters. Currently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lumber Liquidators holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term earnings growth rate of 27.5%. Also, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 24.2% in the trailing four quarters.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

3429,HD,"The earnings results are usually the corner stone of gauging a company’s performance. The third-quarter 2017 earnings reporting cycle is drawing closer to an end where we already have a reasonably good picture of the winners and losers in this quarter. This gives investors a hands-on data to re-evaluate their portfolios and take on board stocks that promise handsome returns.Among all the sectors, our focus here will be upon the Retail-Wholesale sector. A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to struggle in an Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) dominated market. With market share growing for Amazon Prime, Marketplace and Prime Air, as well as the launch of drone delivery, Amazon is poised for exceptional growth, which undoubtedly presents fierce competition for traditional retailers.The rise of e-tailers has left the retail sector struggling with lower footfall at stores as all the brands are looking to directly sell to consumers through the expansion of digital stores. Further, these retailers are heavily investing in e-commerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.As the holiday season, which accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits for retailers, is just around the corner, analysts remain optimistic about the sector’s performance on grounds of gradual wage growth, lower inflation, low unemployment rate, an uptick in the U.S. consumer sentiment and a lift in economic activity post hurricanes. Characterized by the aforementioned improvement in the consumer backdrop, alongside early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, the holiday season this November and December is likely to be a huge success.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) rightly projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Additionally, the NRF projects online holiday sales to rise 7-10% to nearly $117 billion in November and December compared with a 9% improvement to $105 billion in 2015.The NRF predicts sales for the period to benefit from a longer holiday season as Christmas is falling on Monday this year and 32 days after Thanksgiving. This will give retailers one extra day of sales from usual, as well as benefit last-minute shoppers in the weekend before Christmas.While the holiday season is likely to impact the fourth-quarter of 2017, we bring our focus back to the third quarter, which is in its climax.Q3 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, about 436 S&P 500 members that together represent 87.2% of the Index’s total market capitalization have released third-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 6.8%, on 6.2% revenue growth. Further, about 73.4% delivered positive earnings surprises and about 67% beat revenue estimates.Key takeaways from the results so far point to clear revenue momentum as top-line growth has been accelerating compared with other recent periods. Further, the quarter has witness an above-average proportion of positive surprises, reflecting the carry forward of momentum from the preceding quarter. Additionally, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods.Among the 16 Zacks sectors, results for the Finance sector have been below average this quarter. However, this earnings season has been favorable for the Energy, Industrial Products, Technology, Construction, Business Services, and Medical sectors.Coming to expectations, total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.2% year over year, with a 5.7% jump in revenues. Here, the strength in the Technology and Energy sectors are likely to balance the soft Finance sector results.For the retail sector, in particular, earnings in the third quarter are expected to inch up 0.6%, with 6.2% revenue growth. Notably, the retail sector still has a sizable chunk of earnings to be reported. Only 47.4% of the S&P 500 members have reported results so far. Of these, 83.3% beat earnings estimates, while 66.7% topped revenue estimates. The sector has seen earnings for the quarter rise 2.9% thus far, with revenue growth of 10.9%.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Trends report published on Nov 8.That said, we bring to you seven retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. It makes sense to add these potential winners to your portfolio ahead of their releases. A rational investment can fetch higher returns on the heels of an earnings beat.Our PicksWe have highlighted seven stocks that not only meet the prescribed criteria but have also convincingly beaten earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, hold excellent prospects and are therefore well positioned for future earnings growth.Burlington Stores Inc.

3430,HD,"Barring a few hiccups, the U.S. stock market has displayed a decent run since the start of 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 14.7%, the S&P 500 has gained 13.4%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has surged 21.4% so far this year. With plenty of positive news — Trump’s ambitious tax plan, surge in factory activity to a 13-year high last month, uptick in construction activity and optimism surrounding the upcoming earnings reports — the rally is expected to continue.Though the stock market currently looks bullish, one can’t ignore the fact that the three major indices are trading close to their 52-week highs that is at lofty valuations. If the major indices breach their set benchmark, it is likely to boost the risk appetite of investors.Until this happens, you can fine tune your portfolio with growth stocks. These are generally hot and flourishing stocks with earnings growth potential. Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors, we are focusing on Retail-Wholesale. The sector has gained 18.8% so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500. Although the sector occupies the bottom 13% position (14 out of 16) in the Zacks classified list, it still holds promise given the favorable economic indicators.Retail Space Rides on Favorable IndicatorsThe rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market, and rising housing market and manufacturing sector signal that the economy is on a recovery mode that rose 3.1% in second-quarter 2017, marking the best growth in three years. Further, the Fed’s indication of a likely rate hike in December implies the underlying fundamental strength of the economy.Steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help increase sales in the current retail landscape, which is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping.Incidentally, most retailers have adopted the omni-channel mantra, and also recorded solid bumps in e-commerce sales this year. With the holiday season approaching, these factors are favorable for retailers, who make the most of the season.National Retail Federation projects a 3.6-4% rise in November and December sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%.Check These 4 Growth StocksHere we have highlighted four Retail/Wholesale stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B. These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results. Not only this, these stocks have outperformed their respective industries.Domino's Pizza, Inc. (DPZ  -  Free Report) has emerged as a strong contender with a long-term earnings growth rate of 16.6% and a Growth Score of B. In a year, the stock has surged roughly 33.4%, comfortably outperforming the industry’s growth of 9.9%. The pizza delivery company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 6.8% in the trailing four quarters and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We also suggest investing in The Children's Place, Inc.

3431,HD,"Stock futures are up slightly in today’s pre-market, following a precipitous sell-off yesterday, especially in the Dow. Myriad concerns — from North Korea nuclear testing to Hurricane Irma heading for another major American flood plain (this time Florida) — seemed to finally cause a downturn in equities trading on Tuesday.Perhaps it was that so many concerns, which on their own never seemed to register much resistance to the overall bull market of the last 10 months, all coming at the same time — and following a holiday weekend — created a “wall of worry” in aggregate. Or maybe it has more to do with the same bell being rung over and over — such as Kim Jon-un’s 6th nuke test, or the U.S.’s 2nd major hurricane to approach our shores — that finally sets traders into generating a headwind against the long-term bulls.Hurricane IrmaConsidering the coming storm for a moment, although Hurricane Harvey off the Southeast coast of Texas is already projected to be the most expensive storm in U.S. history, Irma is much bigger and faster — 400 miles in diameter with winds 185+ miles per hour — and, in fact, is now one of the biggest storms ever recorded! So we’re seeing huge runs on supplies at Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and bottled water from companies like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for those likely to try and ride the storm out. Hopefully this will result in unnecessary stockpiles if Irma suddenly turns back out to sea, but for now preparations are for another catastrophic storm to hit later this week. Irma is already bearing down on Puerto Rico this morning.Multitudes BuildingEither way, this theory would suggest that the more we see getting in the way of a prosperous market, complete with robust U.S. labor and lower-than-expected inflation, the more we see the likelihood of pushback and thus more red closings on the main indices. For today, we’re seeing a bit of a rebound ahead of the bell, perhaps the result of no new negative reports coming from North Korea or Hurricane Irma not yet making landfall in the continental U.S. to further drag stocks down.Even President Trump and Attorney General Sessions’ rollback of the “Dreamers” act — which would set about deporting 800K people currently living in the U.S. because they arrived as children undocumented — must pass through Congress before it has a material impact on our economy. Executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and elsewhere sent an open letter to Trump to reconsider his position on repealing DACA, to no avail. (Then again, it’s not like the president has a very good relationship with top executives these days, anyway.)July Trade DeficitWe see better-than-expected results in July’s trade balance: what was expected to ratchet up near -$45 billion has instead registered -$43.7 billion. True, we’re still deep in negative territory and slightly worse than last month’s -$43.5 billion, but the June read was the smallest deficit we’ve seen all year. Compare this with the nearly -$49 billion we saw in the first month of the year. Of course, we’re still a long way from being solvent on this measure — and likely will never be, actually — but we are in better stead than we had been earlier in the year.HPE BeatsFollowing a giant sell-off of more than 20% in the last 5 trading days at Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE  -  Free Report), shares are trading up in today’s pre-market following its positive surprise in earnings and especially revenues for its fiscal Q3 2017 after the bell yesterday: earnings of 30 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by a penny, whereas quarterly sales of $8.21 billion easily topped the $7.79 billion we had anticipated. Higher sales in its networking equipment contributed to the beat. Shares originally rose 4% on the news, and are now roughly +2.6% a half-hours before Wednesday’s bell.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

3432,HD,"The condition of houses in an area ravaged by a massive storm and the worst deluge in about 50 years can well be imagined. Right now, Texas is bearing out the nightmarish Category 3 Hurricane Harvey, which is expected to pour about 50 inches of rain over Houston this week.As per the source, flooding is expected to last for some days and take neighboring Louisiana in its grip too. Needless to say, several corners of the investing world have benefited or lost from this massacre. Among the losers, insurance seems to be at the forefront while oil refiners – clustered in Texas – are expected to be the greatest beneficiaries on higher gasoline prices (read: Hurricane Harvey Puts These ETF Areas in Focus).But what about the other less-celebrated investing areas that will be hugely benefited as and when Harvey retreats?Home Improvement Retailers: Promising Right NowAsHurricane Harvey is expected to devastate several houses, the need for rearranging houses would be higher, post storm. This necessity will boost demand for companies that operate as retailers of home improvement products.These companies includeHome Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report). The companies cater to do-it-yourselfers, as well as home improvement, construction and building maintenance or remodeling professionals.""Home Depot will most certainly see a financial benefit from Hurricane Harvey, just as it did from Hurricane Sandy back in 2013,"" according Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, quoted on Reuters.As per the source, Lowe’s, which has about 90 stores in the Harvey-prone areas, turned on its 24/7 emergency command center located in North Carolina. The company has started transporting bottled waters to help customers distressed by the storm. As per a Home Depot spokesperson, the retailer’s merchandising and supply-chain teams also jumped on the bandwagon to send necessary supplies to the affected region.The companies are doing everything to stock up and keep their shutters open. The Zacks Industry Rank of both companies is in the top 39% and both stocks have a VGM (Value, Growth, Momentum) score of A.

3433,HD,"Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, has put vast areas under water. The onslaught of the torrential rainfall followed the storm, which originated in the Gulf of Mexico. While it is too early to gauge the financial impact of the hurricane, some experts are calling for losses in the double-digit billions. Meanwhile, many are gearing up to rebuild homes, which drove demand for home-improvement equipment. In fact, the tropical storm is set to dump more rain in areas such as Houston, TX, which propelled shares of home-improvement retailers. This calls for investing in such stocks for solid gains.Harvey Wreaks HavocHurricane Harvey claimed almost 10 lives and injured many more. Houston, the fourth largest city in the United States, has been flooded. The city received more than 30 inches of rain, as per National Weather Service. Starting Saturday, the city plunged into the torrential waters and the rain is not likely to subside before Aug 30.Numerous residents are trapped in the floods, while many fled to higher shelters. Many residents sought help on social media and even made efforts to save their pets. Dramatic rescue operations took place, with the Coast Guard saving dozens of lives.Houston’s health care infrastructure, in the meantime, took great efforts to heal the affected. In fact, many nursing home residents were stuck in waist-high waters before they were rescued. Governor Greg Abbott of Texas said the region won’t recover soon and called the storm “one of the largest disasters America has ever faced”.Why It Was the Worst So FarThe rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. It worsened due to a lethal confluence of meteorological events.  Scientists say that warm water in the Gulf of Mexico intensified the downpour and lack of winds in the upper atmosphere that could have steered the hurricane away led to the intense damage.Hal Needham, a storm surge expert and founder of the private firm Marine Weather & Climate in Galveston, TX, said that a “two- or three-foot storm surge alone would not have been catastrophic.” He added that “it was all these ingredients coming together” that made the hurricane so destructive. Dennis Feltgen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Hurricane Center in Miami added a note of caution and said that additional rains of 15 to 25 inches are expected to pour over parts of Southeast Texas. Some areas might even witness as much as 50 inches of rain.Why Wasn’t America Prepared?As the storm isn’t over yet, people are keen on finding out about failures in policy, planning and execution. Politicians are expected to come with the usual answer that Harvey was just too devastating and not much could have been done to minimize the losses.But clearly, there are Meta problems that have turned this natural hazard into a full-blown mega-catastrophe. In such a case, looking into the condition of green space and wetlands could have reduced the impact of the storm. Proper runaway development plans and existence of large-scale mitigation projects like seawalls and levees would have helped as well.Home-Improvement Companies Rally on Harvey Deluge: 4 PicksNevertheless, Harvey continues to wreak havoc, while Houston’s flood-prone metropolitan area may have to bear several days of rainfall, adding to property damage. As home owners face damaged properties, likelihood of rebuilding efforts will gain momentum. This in turn will drive the demand for home-improvement equipment and materials, including temporary electricity generators.Home building and furnishing retailer Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) saw its shares climb 1.2% to $151.39 on Aug 28, while peer Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) gained 0.6% to $73.80.

3434,HD,"Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings per share of 70 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents. Earnings slumped 12.5% from the prior-year quarter, due to lower gross margin stemming from higher cost of sales and a moderate rise in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses.The disappointing bottom-line performance came after five successive quarters of positive earnings surprises. Consequently, shares of the company declined approximately 8% during the pre-market trading hours on Nov 9. We note that, Kohl’s shares have returned 3.3% in the last three months as against the industry’s decline of 10.9%.Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kohl's Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kohl's Corporation QuoteSales and MarginsNet sales were $4,332 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,296 million and improved 0.1% from the prior-year quarter. The top line mainly gained from increased comps and improved performance during the back-to-school season. The positives were offset by soft sales trends owing to unfavorable weather conditions during the middle of the third quarter.We note that the company’s store traffic continued to rise since the first half of 2017.  Encouragingly, the 0.1% rise in comps during the quarter under review compared favorably with the year-ago decline of 1.7%. This signifies that the company’s strategic initiative — Greatness Agenda — has started yielding results. The initiative, which commenced in first-quarter 2014, was designed to drive transactions per store and sales.Gross margin declined 30 basis points to 36.8% in the reported quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 1.4% to $1,095 million in the quarter. Other Financial DetailsAs of Oct 28, Kohl’s had $736 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2,796 million of long-term debt and $5,029 million of shareholders’ equity. Cash flow from operations amounted to $869 million.On Nov 8, Kohl's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 55 cents per share, which will be paid on Dec 20, to shareholders of record as of Dec 6.Kohl’s ended the quarter with 1,156 stores, 12 FILA Outlet stores and four Off/Aisle clearance centers in 49 states.Updated Guidance Kohl’s expects adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017 in the range of $3.60-$3.80 per share, compared with the previous range of $3.50-$3.80. We note that despite the weak bottom-line results, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company raised the low end of the fiscal 2017 earnings view on a gradual improvement in comps.Stocks to Consider Investors may consider other stocks from the same sector such as Burlington Stores, Inc (BURL  -  Free Report), Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores Inc (ROST  -  Free Report).

Orders and backlogs are also on the rise for both companies.And while home prices are hitting new highs in many big cities, mortgage rates still remain near all-time lows and the job market is strong.Should investors be jumping back into the homebuilders?Millennial RentersSince 2011, over 1.5 million new apartments have been built across the United States with thousands more still in the pipeline.These buildings have mostly been “luxury” apartments with expanded amenities including spas, rock climbing walls and swimming pools, designed to appeal to young Millennials.But some are now worried about excess supply and that a big apartment bust could be coming.Multi-Family Lending: A Danger?In early 2017, the Federal Reserve ordered the largest banks to set out how they would fare if rental apartment values fell by more than 35%.The largest lenders of multifamily loans, at the end of 2016, were, no surprise, the largest banks like JP Morgan (JPM) and New York Community Bancorp (NYCB  -  Free Report).But many smaller banks like Dime Community Bancshares DCOM and Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK  -  Free Report) have also gotten into the act and have large multifamily loan portfolios.There is a real fear of an apartment bust.

3436,HD,"The Dow Jones has been enjoying a phenomenal run this year, but gains in digital currencies have been even better. So the obvious question that arises is: which will stand first? The Dow 30,000 or bitcoin at $30,000?Of late, Bitcoin and other digital currencies have been getting toasted in recent trading sessions due to increased regulatory scrutiny in China. J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has also criticized bitcoin as one of the most bubblicious segments of finance. On the other hand, the Dow continues its upward journey driven by steady economic recovery and expectations of tax cuts. The Dow has also shown remarkable longevity and has frequently outdone the broader markets since inception.Such developments make us believe that the blue-chip index is better positioned than the cryptocurrency. The Dow’s 30 components have made it more diversified than the bitcoin, which could protect it from any future downside. Thus, place your bets on sound blue-chip stocks, rather than being super bullish about bitcoin.Dow or Bitcoin: Who Will Make It to 30,000?The Dow ended at a record high for the third straight session on Sep 14, marking its 38th record finish this year. The blue-chip index is currently at around the 22,000 mark, meaning it would need to rise just about 35% to hit the 30,000 milestone.Bitcoin, on the other hand, is down about 14% at $3,349, much lower than $5,000 in early September. This represented a loss of nearly $27 billion of market value in the world’s number one cryptocurrency, as per digital site Coinmarketcap.com. This makes things harder for bitcoin as now it will need to gain a whopping 795% to reach the coveted $30,000 mark. But, that doesn’t seem to be a very daunting task for bitcoin since it has risen 250% so far this year, with a market cap of $59.3 billion.Cryptocurrency is in a Bubble Ready to BurstChina has appeared to set the stage for a further pullback in bitcoin, making it difficult for the cryptocurrency to move north. BTCC, a bitcoin exchange, said that China-based exchanges will end operations on Sep 30. Chinese regulators are planning to shutdown bitcoin exchanges to crackdown on illegal uses of digital currency. They are also keeping an eye on fundraising linked to digital-currency ventures and have declared initial coin offerings illegal. This is a major setback for the cryptocurrency as China is a major hub for bitcoin activity that represents almost 20% of bitcoin mining and trade, said Charles Hayter, co-founder of CryptoCompare.The selloff, in part, gained momentum after Jamie Dimon called the bitcoin a fraud and compared it with tulip bulb mania, which will “eventually blow up.” Speaking at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference, Dimon said that “bitcoin is not a real thing and it’s solely speculative and that there’s no need for it in the U.S.”Upbeat Economic Data, Trump’s Tax Policy to Boost DowComparatively, the Dow is expected to gain traction this year, banking encouraging economic data. The U.S. GDP expanded 3% in the second quarter, the fastest in more than two years. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment gave the economy a boost. Increased spending on goods and services drove consumer expenditure by 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of the economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.The Dow is also expected to be driven byexpectations of tax cuts. A key component of such a tax reform is to bring overseas profits to the United States, without paying the 35% corporate tax rate. Per Trump’s proposal, companies need to pay only 10% on the money they bring back, often known as “repatriation.” Last week, Trump said in North Dakota, “We must bring back trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.” He wants to do so to spur jobs and growth.Dow Outdid the Broader Stock Market HistoricallySince its inception in 1896, the Dow has achieved a remarkable feat. The blue-chip gauge has outpaced the broader market, as measured by the S&P 500 index. The index during the most tumultuous periods for equities ever – Oct 9, 2007 to Mar 9, 2008 – fell 53.8%, narrower than the S&P 500’s loss of 56.8%.At the same time, the Dow also outperformed during better times for the stock market. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 have produced a slew of record highs since Trump has been elected as the President. However, the Dow is up 9.5% since then, more than the 6.6% gain for the S&P 500.How to Invest in Blue-Chip Stocks?With the Dow poised to score over bitcoin, investing in some solid blue-chip stocks seems prudent at the moment. We have, thus, selected four such stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Such stocks also boost a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

3437,HD,"About a month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 6.1% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Home Depot Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Raises FY17 ViewHome Depot reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of $2.25 per share, which escalated 14.2% from $1.97 in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21.Results gained from growth across the company’s interconnected platform as well as all regions. The company’s relentless focus on affording innovative products, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Further, the company continued to reap the benefits of a steady housing market recovery and strong customer demand.Quarterly DetailsNet sales grew 6.2% to $28,108 million from $26,472 million in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $$27,840.5 million. The company's overall comparable-store sales (comps) increased 6.3%, while comps in the United States grew 6.6%.Gross profit in the reported quarter improved 6% to $9,461 million from $8,927 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales.Improved gross profit led operating income to increase 8.8% to $4,463 million during the fiscal quarter. Further, operating margin expanded 40 bps from the year-ago quarter to 15.9%.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowHome Depot ended the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $4,830 million, long-term debt (excluding current maturities) of $24,422 million and shareholders' equity of $3,554 million.

Moreover, management now anticipates earnings per share to increase about 13% to $7.29 in fiscal 2017, compared with the previous guidance of 11% growth to $7.15.

3438,HD,"Homebuilding and construction stocks and ETFs have been in focus in the aftermath of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. They are expected to benefit from substantial rebuilding work required in areas affected by these massive storms.Homebuilding ETFs have done pretty well this year as the housing market got a boost from improving jobs market, rising wages and low interest rates.There are three ETF focused on homebuilding and construction, and while their names may sound similar, they are actually quite different from one another.iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction ETF (ITB  -  Free Report)ITB, the most popular ETF in the space, is market-cap weighted. About two-thirds of its portfolio is allocated to homebuilders. Top three holdings--DR Horton (DHI  -  Free Report), Lennar (LEN  -  Free Report) and NVR (NVR  -  Free Report)—account for about one-third of the portfolio.It has an expense Ratio of 0.44%.SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF: (XHB)XHB is modified equal weighted, selecting its holdings by their market-cap and then equally weighting them in the portfolio.  Homebuilding and Building Products industries get about one-third allocation each in the portfolio.The fund has an expense ratio of 0.35%.PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (PKB  -  Free Report)PKB is a smart beta ETF that evaluates companies on a variety of investment merit criteria, including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality and value.Currently, the portfolio has 27% allocation to Homebuilding, 14% to Construction & Engineering and 13% to Construction Materials.The product is a bit pricey with an expense ratio of 0.63%.To learn more about these ETFs, please watch the short video above.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3439,HD,"The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is one of those S&P 500 stocks that never lets down. This home improvement retailer has surged 29% in a year, beating the industry’s 22.1% growth. The company has long been on growth trajectory, courtesy of its spectacular surprise history and solid growth strategies. On top of it, expected recovery endeavors post Hurricane Harvey’s mayhem gave investors another reason to be bullish on the stock. So, it is definitely worthwhile to get an insight into the factors that are likely to boost this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock further.Home Depot Riding on Interconnected StrategyIn response to the evolving retail environment, where digital and physical stores go hand in hand, the company remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities. In this direction, the company has made great strides by redesigning its website with enhanced features. The benefits from these initiatives were evident from online sales growth of nearly 23% in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, dotcom sales represented nearly 6.4% of the company’s top line. Moreover, Home Depot’s interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot.com investments as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to cater to customers’ demand. We believe that these efforts will drive the company’s top and bottom line in the long run.Focus on Pro Customers Remains a Driving FactorHome Depot has been gaining from its focus on Professional Customers, or Pro Customers. Notably, sales from this category continued to outperform in second-quarter fiscal 2017. Well, the company has undertaken several strides in this regard, which has helped it reap significant benefits. As evidence, Home Depot recently acquired Compact Power Equipment, which marked another step toward improving portfolio service offerings to Pro customers. This buyout is likely to have a positive impact on the gross margin in fiscal 2017.Home Depot’s Stellar Past Record, View Boosts EstimatesHome Depot has been reporting strong financial figures since 2008, with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. Incidentally, both the top and bottom line grew year over year and topped estimates in second-quarter fiscal 2017. While sales marked its 13th straight beat, earnings retained its five-year long trend of positive surprise. Apart from the aforementioned factors, the company’s focus on innovations and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Also, housing market recovery remains a tailwind. These factors, along with expectations of better home prices and re-emergence of first-time homebuyers, encouraged management to raise its sales and earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2017.Home Depot, Inc.

3440,HD,"Hurricane Irma, one of the strongest storms to hit the United States, has wreaked havoc leaving widespread damage in its wake with many being rendered homeless. While it may be too soon to get an accurate idea about the damage caused by Hurricane Irma, building products like insulation, roofing, tiles and wallboard will see an increase in demand as well as pricing in the coming quarters as residents in Florida as well as Texas, which was hit by Hurricane Harvey, work toward rebuilding.Here is a look at four building product stocks that will remain in focus as cleanup and rebuilding efforts pick pace.Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report): Toledo, OH-based Owens Corning develops, manufactures, and markets insulation, roofing, and fiberglass composites. The company has a strong earnings track record having surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 20.17%.

3441,HD,"The first signs of the two monstrous hurricanes — Harvey in Southeast Texas and Irma up the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida — having affecting U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is finally showing up in this morning’s data. Forecasts from some of the major banks like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) look for anywhere from 0.4-0.8% loss in growth for Q3. This is kind of a big deal, when 1-3% growth per quarter is what’s expected; a drop from nearly a half-point to full-point in quarterly data is enough of a punch to affect trading attitudes, especially as we begin to see the end of 2017 in sight, without many more chances to reach 3% growth for the year.This morning’s Producer Price Index (PPI) numbers are from August, so we have yet to see the impact of the hurricanes. Even so, we look a little light at 0.2% growth, where 0.3% was expected. Stripping out food & energy costs, this number droops to 0.1%; 0.2% was expected. Cooler-than-anticipated conditions where economists continue to seek signs of inflation heating up in the marketplace are the culprit. This has not changed from the narrative we've seen most of 2017.Some experts say it’s President Trump’s immigration plans that are curbing the natural course of wage growth for high-skill employment opportunities, which would eventually transfer through the system and show up in inflation metrics. The minimum wage in the U.S. remains $7.25 per hour, which hasn’t risen since 1991. So until something shakes free on one of these two issues, we’re likely to see stagnant inflation overall. That’s how important wage growth is to this matter.Core PPI year over year is a nice, round 2.0%. That fits right in with other recent economic data. But again, we’re stuck in-range until a new catalyst enters the picture. If it winds up being hurricane damage that skews the outlook, this could actually suppress future growth overall — jobs and insurance payouts come immediately to mind — though they might be helpful for companies like Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report).Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) concluded its latest keynote event yesterday at the new Steve Jobs Theatre with the unveiling of its new iPhone 8 and iPhone X. There was also new information about Apple Watch and its growing Services businesses, but the iPhone, being the world’s biggest company’s bread and butter — and especially considering the company expects to sell the upgraded X model for a cool grand ($999) — is the big news here. And some analysts were immediately critical of the high price point for the X; they did not see value of functionality of the product to justify it.Apple shares are down a tad in today’s pre-market, and the stock — which had gone up nearly 40% in 2017 alone — did not spike northward following the keynote event. This, as discussed yesterday in this column, was to be expected. Will Apple continue to make a big deal of its new product unveilings if traders get used to selling the news?
"
3442,HD,"Stock futures are up slightly in today’s pre-market, following a precipitous sell-off yesterday, especially in the Dow. Myriad concerns — from North Korea nuclear testing to Hurricane Irma heading for another major American flood plain (this time Florida) — seemed to finally cause a downturn in equities trading on Tuesday.Perhaps it was that so many concerns, which on their own never seemed to register much resistance to the overall bull market of the last 10 months, all coming at the same time — and following a holiday weekend — created a “wall of worry” in aggregate. Or maybe it has more to do with the same bell being rung over and over — such as Kim Jon-un’s 6th nuke test, or the U.S.’s 2nd major hurricane to approach our shores — that finally sets traders into generating a headwind against the long-term bulls.Hurricane IrmaConsidering the coming storm for a moment, although Hurricane Harvey off the Southeast coast of Texas is already projected to be the most expensive storm in U.S. history, Irma is much bigger and faster — 400 miles in diameter with winds 185+ miles per hour — and, in fact, is now one of the biggest storms ever recorded!So we’re seeing huge runs on supplies at Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and bottled water from companies like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for those likely to try and ride the storm out. Hopefully this will result in unnecessary stockpiles if Irma suddenly turns back out to sea, but for now preparations are for another catastrophic storm to hit later this week. Irma is already bearing down on Puerto Rico this morning.Multitudes BuildingEither way, this theory would suggest that the more we see getting in the way of a prosperous market, complete with robust U.S. labor and lower-than-expected inflation, the more we see the likelihood of pushback and thus more red closings on the main indices. For today, we’re seeing a bit of a rebound ahead of the bell, perhaps the result of no new negative reports coming from North Korea or Hurricane Irma not yet making landfall in the continental U.S. to further drag stocks down.Even President Trump and Attorney General Sessions’ rollback of the “Dreamers” act — which would set about deporting 800K people currently living in the U.S. because they arrived as children undocumented — must pass through Congress before it has a material impact on our economy. Executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and elsewhere sent an open letter to Trump to reconsider his position on repealing DACA, to no avail. (Then again, it’s not like the president has a very good relationship with top executives these days, anyway.)July Trade DeficitWe see better-than-expected results in July’s trade balance: what was expected to ratchet up near -$45 billion has instead registered -$43.7 billion. True, we’re still deep in negative territory and slightly worse than last month’s -$43.5 billion, but the June read was the smallest deficit we’ve seen all year. Compare this with the nearly -$49 billion we saw in the first month of the year. Of course, we’re still a long way from being solvent on this measure — and likely will never be, actually — but we are in better stead than we had been earlier in the year.HPE BeatsFollowing a giant sell-off of more than 20% in the last 5 trading days at Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE  -  Free Report), shares are trading up in today’s pre-market following its positive surprise in earnings and especially revenues for its fiscal Q3 2017 after the bell yesterday: earnings of 30 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by a penny, whereas quarterly sales of $8.21 billion easily topped the $7.79 billion we had anticipated. Higher sales in its networking equipment contributed to the beat. Shares originally rose 4% on the news, and are now roughly +2.6% a half-hours before Wednesday’s bell.

3443,HD,"Growth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains. This well-liked strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount. Unlike the blend strategy, a portfolio created on the GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only eight.Here are five stocks that made it through the screen:Credit Acceptance Corporation (CACC  -  Free Report) is a specialized financial services company, which provides funding, receivables management, collection, sales training and related services to automobile dealers. The company’s average four-quarter positive earnings surprise is 6.7% and it sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Insperity, Inc. (NSP  -  Free Report) is engaged in providing an array of human resources and business solutions.

3444,HD,"PGT Innovations, Inc. (PGTI  -  Free Report) provided a preliminary update on its operations following Hurricane Irma and reported that its facilities and inventories remained unaffected. The company is also offering assistance to its employees, customers and communities, providing them immediate aid to cope with damages inflicted by the storm.Hurricane Irma was an extremely powerful tropical storm which followed cyclone Harvey. The storm caused catastrophic damage in many parts of the United States as a Category 5 hurricane.To recover from these damages, PGT Innovations has undertaken a number of initiatives. In line with this, the company has created an assistance center in the Naples area to provide essential supplies, including generators, chain saws and water. It has also provided online hurricane relief resources to gather requests from people across affected Florida communities. PGT Innovations has partnered with WorldVision to coordinate collecting required supplies and area volunteers.Its CGI facility in Miami, WinDoor facility in Orlando, and PGT facility in Venice has resumed production. The company is in the process of assessing the financial impact of the storm and will provide an update once completed.PGT Innovations belongs to the Building Products industry. Though many industries have felt the impact of Irma, home-improvement companies are poised to benefit. As home owners face damaged properties, the likelihood of rebuilding efforts will gain momentum. This, in turn, will drive demand for home-improvement equipment and materials.Home building and furnishing retailer Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) is one such stock that is expected to benefit from repair activity. Several Home Depot stores throughout Florida will receive additional inventory to help those preparing for Irma. The company also has long been on a solid growth trajectory, backed by its spectacular surprise history and robust growth strategies. The stock has surpassed earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 3.77%.Owens Corning (OC  -  Free Report), the OH-based company develops, manufactures and markets insulation, roofing, and fiberglass composites, will also benefit from rebuilding activity. The company has a strong earnings track record, having surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 20.17%. TopBuild Corp. (BLD  -  Free Report), Daytona Beach, FL-based company, is the leading purchaser, installer and distributor of insulation products to the U.S. construction industry. The stock has surpassed earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 10.42%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

3445,HD,"Beacon Roofing Supply Inc. (BECN  -  Free Report) is one of the few companies that are expected to benefit from the rebuilding activity triggered by back-to-back hurricanes Harvey and Irma. These storms have ravaged the United States, wreaking havoc across Texas and Florida, causing widespread damage to life and property.Texas was severely impacted by Harvey, which dumped more than 50 inches of rain creating a record high for rains from a single tropical storm. Texas Governor, Greg Abbott, estimated the damage at $150-$180 billion, eclipsing the previous Hurricanes, Katrina or Sandy. The damage from Harvey was mostly due to flooding while Irma that hit Florida caused most damage due to its high winds. The numbers for the damage from Irma are still coming in and are estimated in the range of $50-$100 billion. According to projections from investment banks, both these catastrophes have the ability to knock off between 0.6% and 0.8% from the U.S. GDP growth this quarter.Rebuilding to Benefit Companies Across Various IndustriesIt is likely take months to resume normalcy. As roads, buildings, and homes undergo repairs in the coming months, the rebuilding activity will benefit companies across various industries — those dealing in homebuilding materials, to building roads and roofing activity. Stocks like The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) that sell home construction materials and other must-haves required to rebuild after storm damage, stand to gain. Texas-based Sterling Construction Company, Inc. (STRL  -  Free Report) builds, repairs, and reconstructs transportation infrastructure projects, including highways, roads, bridges, airfields, ports, and light rail will also play an important part in the recovery process. Roofing distributor Beacon Roofing Supply and roofing producer Owens Corning are among the other companies that are likely to benefit from the home repair activity.How Beacon Roofing Stands to GainBeacon Roofing is the largest publicly traded distributor of roofing and complementary building products in North America. It also distributes complementary building products, including siding, windows, specialty exterior building products, insulation, and waterproofing systems for residential and non-residential building exteriors. As it is, 75-80% of Beacon Roofing’s revenues is related to re-roofing activity.As of Oct 31, 2016, the company operated 369 branches, a few with multiple leased facilities or combined facilities, as well as 10 other facilities. Among these, 17 branches were in Florida and 36 in Texas. The company has consolidated presence in both Florida and Texas driven by expansion  through acquisition strategy as well as branch openings.In October 2015, the company acquired Dallas, TX-based Roofing Supply Group, a roofing products distributor. RSG distributes roofing supplies and related materials from 83 locations across 24 states, including the key Western and Southern markets of California, Florida and Texas. In December 2015, the company made another acquisition, of Roofing and Insulation Supply, a distributor primarily of residential and commercial insulation along with roofing and related products with 20 branches spanning 13 states operating across New England, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, the Upper Midwest, Texas and Colorado.The company’s recent announcement in August that it has struck a deal to acquire Allied Building Products Corp. for $2.625 billion, comes at an opportune time. The acquisition is expected to close on Jan 2, 2018, pending customary regulatory procedures. The buyout will catapult Beacon Roofing as one of the largest public wholesale building materials distributors in North America. It will have 593 branches in six provinces across Canada and in all 50 states, expanding foothold in key markets including Texas, Florida, Colorado and California.Allied Building Products is a leading distributor of roofing, siding, wallboard, ceiling systems and other building products. The company’s 70% of sales is generated from repair and remodel business. With projected revenues of roughly $7 billion from the combined company, it will be an increase of 69% in the company's annual revenues from current levels. It will also be about 50-60 cents incremental to earnings per share in the first year. The combined company is anticipated to realize $110 million in run-rate synergies within two years of the closure of the deal.Further, the increased geographical presence as a result of the acquisition will enable Beacon Roofing to capitalize on the rebuilding activity stemming from the damage caused from Harvey. It also puts the company in a position to benefit from any inclement weather experienced across either coastline in the future as well. With the rising concerns of global warming leading to further storms, this is likely to be a regular occurrence.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3446,HD,"The effect of the highly talked-about Hurricane Irma was weaker than feared in Florida but the level of destruction was still pretty high. The cost of the storm varies from analyst to analyst. As per the guardian, “the economic cost of Hurricane Irma could rise as high as $300 billion” as it ravaged homes, businesses and farms on its way up.Insured losses from Hurricane Irma are projected from $20bn to $65bn, according to risk modelling companies, as per an article published on Financial Times. On the other hand, AccuWeather founder, ""estimated that Hurricane Harvey is to be the costliest weather disaster in U.S. history at $190 billion or one full percentage point of the GDP.”Damage estimate caused by Irma is expected to be about $100 billion or 0.5 percentage point of total GDP. AccuWeather estimates these two disasters (Harvey and Irma) will account for about 1.5 of a percentage point of the GDP.That said, let’s discuss the key areas that call for attention right now for profits or losses.Gasoline: Helped by Harvey, Marred by IrmaHarvey has thumped a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and a substantial portion of the U.S. refining capacity. Lower demand from refineries put pressure on crude oil prices and ETFs like Oil Fund LP USO. However, demand for finished product gasoline rose, benefiting United States Gasoline Fund (UGA  -  Free Report). As crack spread rose, VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK  -  Free Report) gained.However, Irma weighed on natural gas futures by cutting demand from power plants, and will likely hurt oil and refined products’ prices by obstructing shipments to the nation’s third-largest gasoline market. Irma has quashed power to 3.3 million customers, brought tanker traffics to a halt and shut about 6,000 gasoline stations. United States Natural Gas Fund LP UNG was off 2.7% on Sep 8 and CRAK lost 0.2%.Agriculture ETFs to Rule Ahead?First, Harvey washed away the largest U.S. cotton producer, drenching extra supplies stored on fields by many Texas farmers. Then Irma may ruin Florida’s farmlands, ravaging $1.2 billion worth of fresh tomatoes, oranges, green beans, squash and sugar cane. After impacting the eastern coast of Florida, Irma is expected to shift to Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina — states famous for cotton, grain and livestock, as per CNBC.Needless to say, against this backdrop, iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN LSTK, PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (DBA  -  Free Report), iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN and Teucrium Sugar Fund (CANE  -  Free Report) may be up for gains (read: Hurricane Irma: ETF Winners & Losers).Can Insurance Industry Survive the Storm?With huge destruction in Texas and Florida, insured losses could be sky high. Property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Florida was smashed in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, slammed insurers with $15 billion and led to the failure of more than a dozen insurers. So, one can expect how heavy the impact on insurance companies would be this time around. iShares US Insurance ETF (IAK  -  Free Report) will likely feel the brunt.However, if rates rise in the coming days, insurance companies may get some cushion. Plus, the global reinsurance industry is oversupplied with capital. As of March, it had about a $605-billion capital, thanks to fewer enormous natural disasters in the United States since 2005, as per Wall Street Journal (see all Financials ETFs here).Already, shares of property and casualty homeowners insurance companies like Universal Insurance Holdings Inc. UVE and HCI Group Inc. HCI added about 8.9% and 2.7% on Sep 8. Reinsurers XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) too added about 5.8% and 5%, respectively. This means that most of the sell-offs are overdone and priced in at the current level. Insurance companies’ shares are recouping losses.Home Retailers & Infrastructure in Sweet SpotRebuilding of homes and structures are necessary after a hurricane aftermath. Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) are thus in a bright spot. ETFs like Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction (PKB  -  Free Report) should also benefit (read: Home Retailer ETFs Set to Gain After Harvey).A Boon for Auto Sales Too?Repurchase of cars will gain traction now on higher replacing demand for the damaged vehicles. First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) can thus gain ahead (read: Harvey: Pain or Gain Ahead for Auto Stocks and ETFs?)Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3447,HD,"Central Garden & Pet Company (CENT  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its robust strategies, spectacular earnings history and solid brand portfolio. Moreover, the company intends to take a balanced approach that include improvement in revenues and profits through operational efficiency as well as cost reduction.Let’s Dive DeepGrowth DriversCentral Garden & Pet is revamping both its Pet and Garden segments. It also plans to launch several products that appeal to customers, along with upgrading its customer service. Management expects its ongoing transformation efforts to yield results in the near future. In fact, the company is expected to gain market share in the home centers, mass market, grocery, specialty pet store and other independent channels.Evidently, the Pet and Garden segments reported revenue growth of 9.1% and 14.9% year over year, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Further, the company’s Pet segment recorded eighth straight quarter of organic sales growth primarily owing to robust consumer brands performance.Markedly, being the leading producer of garden and pet supplies products in the United States with a diversified portfolio of brands has aided Central Garden & Pet in developing healthy commercial relationships with giant retailers such as Walmart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report). We believe this provides the company significant opportunity to boost growth.Solid Earnings HistoryDriven by its strategic efforts, Central Garden & Pet’s bottom line has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 12 straight quarters now. In fact, the company has delivered an impressive average earnings beat of 122.2% in the trailing four quarters. Further, the company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.Impressive Gross Margin TrendGross margin – an important financial metrics – that gives an indication about the company’s health has shown constant improvement in the past five quarters. Improvement in gross margin can be attributed to the company’s efforts toward improving manufacturing efficiency and exit from the holiday decor business, which was hampering the margin. Further, margin gains result from lower raw material costs.In the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017 gross margin expanded 110, 90 and 10 basis points to 28.8%, 32.2% and 31.9%, respectively.Bottom LineThough stiff competition and seasonality of garden business may strain its margins, we believe that these headwinds will be easily offset by Central Garden & Pet’s robust strategies.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3448,HD,"It's been nine years since the U.S. central bank launched its quantitative easing program. Also, the U.S. stock market recently celebrated eight years of the bull run. That’s obviously not just a coincidence!The Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing programs, initiated in December 2008, has played a major role in stimulating the U.S. economy. Apart from rescuing it from the ravages of the 2007-09 financial crisis that was marked with stock market downturns, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment, the boost in cheap liquidity from the rather unconventional monetary policy drove up stock and property markets, while bringing down bond yields. Today, the stock market indices are pushing further into record-high territories almost daily.As consumer spending continues to grow on a recovering jobs market, low interest rates, strong U.S. dollar and cheaper fuel, the world's largest economy may have more leg to run in 2017. However, even as we cheer the eighth birthday of the U.S. bull market, some investors are concerned that the conclusion of Fed's unprecedented program of liquidity infusion might unnerve the market.Fed's Plans for Balance Sheet NormalizationWith the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policy providing the U.S. economy its much-needed impetus, the agency has now announced the beginning of the slow, long-drawn timetable to unwind its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The Fed plans to commence the procedure in October with reductions of a modest $10 billion each month through December. The rate would then go up by $10 billion every quarter so as to reach a cap of $50 billion in October 2018. Also in the offing is another hike in the short-term interest rates, which could take place in December this year.The tightening of the monetary policy usually preludes weak demand, contraction of corporate earnings and a possible stock market correction. While the potential negative drag from a strong dollar on overseas profits and geopolitical concerns regarding the North Korean regime remain key concerns, a rapid unwinding of Fed’s holdings is the last thing the U.S. economy needs.Though the Fed intends to move slowly and cautiously toward shrinking its bloated balance sheet and higher interest rates, telegraphing their every move far in advance, the experience is still going to bring a lot of volatility to the markets. In particular, speculations surrounding the timing of the Fed’s interest rate rise may result in increased market volatility.However, before you freak out and decide to steer clear of the stock market apprehending the 'taper tantrum' that lies ahead, you may want to reconsider.Do Investors Need to Panic?Even as Fed prepares to end its stimulus campaign, it will likely take quite some time to impact the economy. This means that the U.S. economy still has some time to benefit from cheap liquidity and low rates, which will continue to catalyze the bull run.Fed officials have also made clear that they plan to decline balance sheet rates slowly and predictably enough to avoid hurting the expansion or killing the bull market. Thus, one can rule out the detrimental impact of a rapid unwinding on the financial markets.And finally, withdrawing the quantitative easing stimulus is actually a by-product of rising economic growth and optimism. The expected 'policy normalization' simply indicates that the economy is ready for the tap to be turned off. Though higher interest rates raise the cost of debt capital, an expanding economy supersedes low-borrowing costs in the grand scheme of things.And fortunately, economic strength would also buoy the overall stock market.Play It SmartNaturally, when the broader market sentiments have a predetermined positive direction, there is hardly any strategy as lucrative as growth investing. However, at a time when volatility may continue to unsettle the stock market, investors want to seek haven in safe income stocks.When investors find themselves in such a tight spot, we believe that one of the smartest plays would be to go for mega-cap stocks (stocks with a market cap of around $100 billion or more) which still have high growth potential.Mega-caps, usually the largest and most established companies in the stock market, have been around for a while. They tend to be stable, and many of them pay dividends based on their earnings. These companies enjoy leading market positions, have a global footprint, strong cash positions and are large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events.Though mega-caps may not see the exponential returns that the small-caps sometimes achieve, they are equally less likely to see the big downturns frequently experienced by smaller companies. And with the current situation being unpredictable at best, you may not want to be lured by the expectant triple-digit returns (and end up losing money), but instead find a growth story in the relatively safer mega-cap stocks.Our ChoicesWith the help of our new style score system, we have identified five mega-cap stocks with excellent growth potential. These stocks have a solid Zacks Rank as well.Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth.

3450,HD,"Lowe's Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report), once an investor favorite, is in the red territory for quite some time now. In fact, the company has been losing investors’ favor due to the dismal earnings performances, a soft outlook and weak margins, amid a tough retail industry backdrop.Notably, Lowe’s shares dropped nearly 3.1% after the company posted lower-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 23.Shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have declined 9.8% in the last six months, wider than the Zacks Building Products industry’s fall of 2.7%. Currently, the industry is placed in the bottom 10% of the Zacks classified industries (230 out of 256). Meanwhile, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector gained 8.5% but is currently placed at the bottom end of the Zacks classified sectors (16 out of 16).Let’s Delve DeepSoft Q2 Results & GuidanceLowe’s delivered dismal second-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom lines fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second straight quarter. In fact, both earnings and sales have lagged estimates in four of the last five quarters. This, in turn, has caused the company’s average negative earnings surprise of 1.6% in the trailing four quarters.  Nevertheless, the company’s earnings and sales improved from the last year, albeit at a rate lower than the preceding quarter. The lower-than-expected results and investment plans compelled Lowe’s to trim fiscal 2017 earnings view. It now envisions earnings to come in the band of $4.20–$4.30 per share compared with $4.30, projected earlier. (Read: Investors Punish Lowe's on Q2 Earnings & Sales Miss)Estimates RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lowe’s have declined sharply in the last seven days. Over the said time frame, 11 analysts lowered estimates for both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.49 for fiscal 2017 and $5.10 for fiscal 2018 has moved down 11 cents and 14 cents, respectively.Other ConcernsLowe’s faces stiff competition from the leader in home improvement retail segment — The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) — which posted robust second-quarter fiscal 2017 numbers. This is Home Depot’s highest quarterly sales and earnings ever. Notably, sales at this segment surpassed estimates for the 13th straight quarter, while the company retained its five-year long trend of delivering positive earnings surprises.Also, Lowe’s investment in customer-facing hours in stores and promotions are likely to hurt margins. We note that in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of fiscal 2016, the company’s gross margin had contracted 25, 40, 10 and 43 basis points (bps). In the first and second quarters of fiscal 2017, gross margins declined 64 and 23 bps to 34.4% and 34.2%, respectively.Is There Any Silver Lining?Nevertheless, Lowe’s comparable store sales (comps) showed considerable improvement in the last reported quarter, despite a tough retail landscape. Further, improving job scenario, recovery in the housing market and merchandising initiatives along with efforts to enhance omni-channel capabilities bode well. Management continues to expect sales to increase 5% with comps growth of 3.5% during fiscal 2017.Bottom LineThough Lowe’s has been taking strategic initiatives to spark a turnaround, it might take time. Hence, we would suggest staying away from the stock until pronounced results of the company’s ongoing initiatives are seen in its overall performance.Want to Know About the Gems in the Retail Space?Better-ranked stocks in the broader Retail sector include The Children's Place, Inc.

3452,HD,"On Tuesday, shares of department store Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) are gaining, up over 4% in late-morning trading after the company announced a major restructuring plan that could be exactly what the struggling retailer needs.Macy’s said it will be cutting 100 jobs as part of a consolidation plan to unite its merchandising, planning, and private brands operations into one department. The company also said the plan will save Macy’s an estimated $30 million a year, including roughly $5 million, or a penny per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. But, the change will also mean one-time costs of approximately $20 million to $25 million, taking effect mostly in the third quarter, according to Macy’s.The company has also named a new president, bringing in former eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) executive Hal Lawton. Lawton has previously worked for The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm; he will begin his tenure on September 8.Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette commended Lawton's ""deep expertise at the intersection of retail and technology, a diverse set of business experiences that give him a unique perspective, and a track record of successfully driving a change agenda at scale.""This is a key step,"" Gennette added, ""as we look to further transform the business and work through the volatility of today’s retail landscape.""At eBay, Lawton was in charge of marketing, merchandising, and consumer selling, and has a strong background in technology and digital expertise, all things that will be vital to Macy’s has the department store giant makes big moves to revitalize its business.Additionally, Macy’s is getting ready to roll out its off-price division, Macy’s Backstage, in more of its store locations, as well as strengthen its beauty business, leveraging its recent acquisition of Bluemercury, notes CNBC. The company launching a new loyalty program that will officially hit the market in October.Macy’s In-DepthMacy’s is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘A.’ Though its industry, Retail-Regional Department Stores, has lost almost 36% year-to-date, it sits in the top 43% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank.This past quarter, Macy’s surpassed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, though the company still expects comparable sales for the full year to decline by 2.2% to 3.3%. Looking ahead, earnings are expected to grow about 7% for the current year, while sales are projected to decline nearly 4% in the same time frame.From a value perspective, Macy’s is very cheap, with a P/E of only 5.85. The stock has depreciated over time too, losing about have its value over the last 12 months—its P/E a year ago was around 10.5—and demonstrating the brutal environment of traditional brick-and-mortar retail.Macy’s value story also reflects the so-called “perceived value” among retailers. Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), for instance, has a P/E right now of 14.9. Macy’s and Nordstrom are in the same industry and arguably have suffered many of the same problems. The only difference is that investors have always been willing to pay more for JWN because of the company’s perceived high-status among retailers, a factor that has worked in their favor with shareholders and customers.Right now, people don’t equate “high-end” with Macy’s. But bringing in executives like Mr. Lawton, and working to utilize acquisitions like Bluemercury, and rethinking what it means to do retail in the twenty-first century may help Macy’s reach that icon status once again.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Also, Rigby raised ExxonMobil’s target price from $75 to $76.After touching the lowest closing price of $76.10 in 19 months on Aug 30, ExxonMobil gained almost 4% over the last five days. Hence, the rating upgrade helped ExxonMobil to maintain its winning streak.On Sep 6, among all the components of Dow Jones Industrial Average, ExxonMobil gained the maximum after the likes of The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report). Shares of ExxonMobil rose slightly more than 2%, while Home Depot, Chevron and Intel rallied a respective 2.4%, 2.2% and 2.1%.

Rigby projects a gradual improvement in crude price and margins from downstream business on rising demand. These favorable macro-economic scenarios will support ExxonMobil, according to the UBS analyst.Irving, TX-based ExxonMobil is the world’s best run integrated oil company based on its track record of high return on capital employed.

3455,HD,"The recent struggles of the retail industry have been well-documented. While several major indices continue to flirt with new highs, traditional retail stocks have been hammered by changing consumer trends and a worldwide shift to online shopping.The popularity of e-commerce is nothing new, but it feels like 2017 has been the year that the floor has finally fallen out from under those companies who have not transitioned. And with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) deal to buy Whole Foods  getting approved this week, the online shopping king has entered a whole new market.Of course, some retailers are faring better than others. Big-box behemoths like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) saw the writing on the wall years ago and invested heavily in their own digital platforms. Others, like Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Tiffany & Co (TIF  -  Free Report), have proven to operate more “Amazon-proof” businesses.However, plenty of the world’s great retail brands have been hammered by digital competition. The once-iconic Sears  is hanging on by a thread, and department stores like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) have also tanked.But who has had it the worst? Take a look at three of the ugliest stocks in the retail industry below!1.       Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report)Just last week, Dick’s posted second-quarter earnings of 96 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00. Management also significantly lowered its full-year outlook, guiding for earnings in the range of $2.80 - $3.00 per share—down from the previously announced $3.65 - $3.75 range.The report was the latest chapter in what has been an awful year for Dick’s. The stock tumbled to a 52-week low and is now down nearly 50% year-to-date. On top of this, we’ve now seen a whopping 13 negative revisions to its full-year and next-year earnings estimates, which have dragged the stock down to a Zacks Rank #5 (Sell). Dick’s will be further challenged by Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) decision to begin selling its products on Amazon—a move that only adds to the company’s competition. Looking ahead, profits are expected to slump by over 45% this quarter and 6% this fiscal year, and that regression is expected to continue into the next fiscal year as well. 2.       Ingles Markets (IMKTA  -  Free Report)In today’s retail landscape, it should come as no surprise that a regional supermarket chain like Ingles is struggling. As the staples of the grocery store become increasingly available online, it’s been tough enough for the industry’s giants to compete—let alone a company that doesn’t have the advantage of scale.Shares of Ingles have fallen more than 46% year-to-date, and the stock currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Earnings are expected to slump more than 12.3% this fiscal year, and the company’s cash flow has retracted nearly 1% already.On top of its questionable financial position right now, Ingles is the type of store that could be threatened the most by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods. The suburban supermarket can keep up with trendy organic grocers because it can traditionally offer lower prices, but that might change soon. 3.       Vitamin Shoppe (VSI  -  Free Report)Vitamin Shoppe shares have been steadily dropping for years now, but 2017 has been a particular rough period for the company. The nutrition supplements retailer just missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by over 40% in the latest quarter, extending its earnings-miss streak to three.The stock has now tumbled more than 75% year-to-date. Earnings are expected to slump more 66% this fiscal year, and sales are projected to tumble nearly 7%. That regression will continue next year, with earnings and sales expected to retract another 4% and 1%, respectively.   4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

Through the Allied acquisition, Beacon Roofing would mark its foray in local markets in the New York, New Jersey and Upper Midwest.With projected revenues of roughly $7 billion from the combined company, it will be 69% increase the company's annual revenues from current levels and add about 50-60 cents incremental to earnings per share in the first year. However, this does not include incremental transaction-related amortization costs of $70-$80 million and acquisition costs of $65-$75 million in the first year after the combination. The combined company is anticipated to realize $110 million in run-rate synergies within two years of the closure of the deal.In addition to growing its roofing supplies business, Allied Building will add a wallboard and acoustical ceiling tile wholesale business to Beacon Roofing, making it the fourth largest distributor of such products in the United States, with more than $1 billion of revenues in the interior market category. The company will gain foothold in the robust, growing and still-consolidating interior products market.  The acquisition will also help  boost growth in other key product categories, including siding, windows, doors, decking, trim, waterproofing, insulation and solar. Through the combination, Beacon Roofing will be able to capitalize on Allied’s various market advantages, including established private-label business and strong e-commerce platform, to deliver its organic growth strategies.Beacon Roofing intends to fund the acquisition by taking up debt of approximately $2.7 billion, which will result in escalation of its total debt to $3.9 billion. Consequently, this will lead to a concerning debt to capitalization ratio of 74%, a massive jump from the current 46%. Further, given the size of the acquisition, integration risks also remain.Beacon Roofing underperformed the industry with respect to the year-to-date price performance. The stock dipped 5.5%, while the industry recorded growth of 6.8%.The company’s revenues in fiscal 2017 will bear the impact of lower-than-expected sales rate in the third quarter due to higher rain and more limited re-roof work as a result of milder winter weather. The drag effect from the last winter will continue in certain northern markets, impacting fourth-quarter’s sales. The company guides adjusted earnings per share between $2.15 and $2.25 for 2017.The commercial roofing market has been experiencing competitive pricing pressures recently. Year-over-year comparisons in the Southwest will remain difficult during the coming quarters and Eastern Canada will be impacted by competitive pressure; limited big project work along with the increased levels of rain and consecutive mild winters. Lower capital expenditure, increased competition remain headwinds.Beacon Roofing currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the sector include The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (LL  -  Free Report). Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3457,HD,"The Q2 earnings picture for the retail sector is among the weakest this reporting cycle with results tracking below past quarters and leading to 0.5% negative price performance for the broad sector.Total earnings from 90.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are down 0.8% on 4.8% higher revenues with 77.4% of the companies beating on earnings and 80.6% exceeding top-line estimates. While earnings growth rate is unimpressive, the proportion of retailers beating revenue estimates is the third highest of all 16 Zacks sectors, behind only the conglomerates (83.3%) and technology (85.2%).Positive earnings reports from Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) offset some negativity of weak results from department stores like J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report), Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), and Kohl’s KSS.Let’s dig into the details of the earnings releases:Earnings Sending Stocks HigherBig-box retailer, Target, emerged as the real champion in the Q2 earnings season as the stock surged as much as 4.9% following robust second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on August 18. The company topped our estimates by three cents for earnings and by $147 million for revenues. It expects earnings per share in the range of 75-95 for the ongoing quarter and raised its outlook to $4.34-$4.54 from $3.80-$4.20 for the fiscal year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was 78 cents for the third quarter and $4.42 for fiscal 2017 (read: Will Big-Box Retailers Push Up Retail ETFs in Q2 Earnings?).Specialty retailer, Nordstrom, rose as much as 2.5% following second-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $61 million. The company raised its lower end of its earnings per share guidance to $2.52-$3.00 from $2.75-$3.00 for fiscal 2017.The DampenersOne of the leading department store retailers, J.C. Penney, dampened investors’ mood as its share price plunged 19.9% following the earnings announcement on August 11. The company posted loss per share of 9 cents, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 6 cents. However, revenue came in higher than our estimate by $92 million. For fiscal 2017, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of 40-65 cents (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).The second-largest department store retailer, Macy’s tanked 10.8% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking the biggest daily loss since January 5. Though the retailer beat our estimates for earnings by three cents and for revenues by $51 million, it reported drop in same-store sales, sparking concerns on the prospect of its turnaround before the crucial holiday season. For fiscal 2017, it continues to project sales decline of 3.2-4.3% and earnings per share in the range of $2.90-$3.15.One of the leading departmental stores Kohl’s also had its worst day since January 8, falling 5.8% posting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly sales on August 10. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel and revenues came in slightly higher than our estimate by $6 million.Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement retailer, beat on second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings by three cents and on revenues by $267 million. For fiscal 2017, Home Depot raised the earnings per share guidance to $7.29 from $7.15, which represents 13% increase year over year. However, the stock dropped as much as 3.9% on the day of its earnings announcement on August 15.The world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, lost as much as 3.2% on August 17 on bleak guidance. It topped our earnings and revenue estimates by a penny and $646 million, respectively. The company raised the lower end of its fiscal 2018 earnings per share guidance to $4.30-$4.40 from $4.20-$4.40. The midpoint of the guidance was much below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.37 at the time of earnings release (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus on Wal-Mart Earnings Beat).ETFs in FocusA slew of negative price reactions led to terrible trading in retail ETFs over the past 10 trading sessions.

3458,HD,"Wednesday, September 13, 2017The first signs of the two monstrous hurricanes — Harvey in Southeast Texas and Irma up the Gulf of Mexico coast of Florida — having affecting U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is finally showing up in this morning’s data. Forecasts from some of the major banks like Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) look for anywhere from 0.4-0.8% loss in growth for Q3. This is kind of a big deal, when 1-3% growth per quarter is what’s expected; a drop from nearly a half-point to full-point in quarterly data is enough of a punch to affect trading attitudes, especially as we begin to see the end of 2017 in sight, without many more chances to reach 3% growth for the year.This morning’s Producer Price Index (PPI) numbers are from August, so we have yet to see the impact of the hurricanes. Even so, we look a little light at 0.2% growth, where 0.3% was expected. Stripping out food & energy costs, this number droops to 0.1%; 0.2% was expected. Cooler-than-anticipated conditions where economists continue to seek signs of inflation heating up in the marketplace are the culprit. This has not changed from the narrative we've seen most of 2017.Some experts say it’s President Trump’s immigration plans that are curbing the natural course of wage growth for high-skill employment opportunities, which would eventually transfer through the system and show up in inflation metrics. The minimum wage in the U.S. remains $7.25 per hour, which hasn’t risen since 1991. So until something shakes free on one of these two issues, we’re likely to see stagnant inflation overall. That’s how important wage growth is to this matter.Core PPI year over year is a nice, round 2.0%. That fits right in with other recent economic data. But again, we’re stuck in-range until a new catalyst enters the picture. If it winds up being hurricane damage that skews the outlook, this could actually suppress future growth overall — jobs and insurance payouts come immediately to mind — though they might be helpful for companies like Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report).Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) concluded its latest keynote event yesterday at the new Steve Jobs Theatre with the unveiling of its new iPhone 8 and iPhone X. There was also new information about Apple Watch and its growing Services businesses, but the iPhone, being the world’s biggest company’s bread and butter — and especially considering the company expects to sell the upgraded X model for a cool grand ($999) — is the big news here. And some analysts were immediately critical of the high price point for the X; they did not see value of functionality of the product to justify it.Apple shares are down a tad in today’s pre-market, and the stock — which had gone up nearly 40% in 2017 alone — did not spike northward following the keynote event. This, as discussed yesterday in this column, was to be expected. Will Apple continue to make a big deal of its new product unveilings if traders get used to selling the news?Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

3459,HD,"World’s largest home improvement retailer, Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has been gaining on the back of strong earnings trends, robust outlook, efforts to improve customer experience along with promising capital strategy and a recovering housing market. These factors have aided the company to retain the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while carrying a VGM Score of A.Further, Home Depot’s shares have outpaced the broader industry year to date primarily owing to its spectacular surprise history. While the stock gained 11.3%, the industry grew 6.3%. Moreover, the stock has gained 3.2% in the past month, reflecting sustained positive momentum.What’s Aiding the Stock Performance?Home Depot has been delivering strong financial figures since 2008, with steady improvement in revenues and earnings per share. The company has been consistently gaining from its interconnected strategy, focus on Pro customers and housing market recovery.These factors helped this Georgia-based company to post a stellar second-quarter fiscal 2017 performance, which marked its highest ever quarterly sales and earnings. Notably, sales marked its 13th straight beat, while earnings retained its five-year long trend of positive surprise. Results were driven by solid growth across all regions, both in stores and online. Further, Pro category sales continued to outperform, driven by constant efforts to enhance services to Pro Customers. The company’s recent buyout of Compact Power Equipment is one among the many evidences of such efforts.Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteApart from this, its relentless focus on innovations, boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity seems to be paying off. Also, housing market recovery remains a tailwind. These factors, along with expectations of better home prices and re-emergence of first-time homebuyers, encouraged management to raise sales and earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2017.This led to an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 rose to $1.80 per share and $7.30 per share, respectively, from $1.79 and $7.24.Further, Home Depot has always maintained a disciplined capital allocation strategy. The company has remained focused on making investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks. As evidence of the progress on strategic initiatives and commitment to reward shareholders the company targets dividend payout ratio of about 55% of earnings. It bought back 17.3 million shares for nearly $2.6 billion in second-quarter fiscal 2017, which took year-to-date buybacks to $3.9 billion. Moreover, management raised fiscal 2017 buyback target from $5 billion to $7 billion.Possible DeterrentsWhile Home Depot has been posting splendid results for a while, the company’s gross margin looks troubled. Evidently, the company’s gross margin contracted 6 bps year over year in second-quarter fiscal 2017, due to unfavorable mix of products sold. Prior to this, the company’s gross margin declined 10 bps each, in first-quarter fiscal 2017 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2016. Moreover, management expects gross margin to drop about 10 bps from last year in fiscal 2017. This could impede results in the coming quarters.ConclusionThough the company’s soft gross margins is definitely a concern, we believe growth endeavors and surprise history overshadow this drawback. This suggests that the company will keep its momentum going in the future.Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the retail space are Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. (LL  -  Free Report), The Children’s Place Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report) and Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Lumber Liquidators has gained a stupendous 126.5% year to date. Moreover, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 27.5%.Children’s Place has a long-term EPS growth rate of 9%. Further, the stock has returned 18.3% in the past year.Canada Goose has gained nearly 6.7% year to date. Moreover, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 34.1%.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars. But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

3460,HD,"The Dow posted a four-day winning streak before declining on fresh concerns emanating from the White House. During the early part of the week, the index rode on gains from individual components to cross the psychological 22,000 milestone for the fourth time this year. Broader markets were also lifted by signs that tensions between the U.S. and North Korea were cooling down. Fresh concerns emanating from the White House and the terrorist attack in Barcelona ultimately ended the index’s gains on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe index advanced 0.1% last Friday, buoyed by an increase in the shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). The Dow as well as the broader markets were also boosted by diminishing rate hike prospects, following concerns over sluggish inflation levels.  However, gains were curbed by escalating geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. US consumer prices increased 0.1% last month against expectations of a 0.2% increase.The index declined 1.1% last week, marking the biggest one-week drop since November. The blue-chip index started off the week on a high, but tumbled following President Trump’s warning to North Korea. Subsequently, the Dow also incurred losses, after shares of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) declined following its decision to end the distribution deal with Netflix, Inc.

Also, contributing to the gains were increases in shares of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Apple. Broader markets were lifted by signs that tensions between the U.S. and North Korea were cooling down.The index inched up less than 0.1% upward on Tuesday. The biggest drag on the Dow was the decline in shares of The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company shaved off around 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer.The Dow crossed the psychological 22,000 milestone for the fourth time this year on Wednesday, rebounding from the lows it hit the last week due to rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington. The index added 0.1% following broad based gains which were incurred after the release of the minutes of the Fed’s July policy meeting. The minutes clearly indicated that Fed officials remain divided in their opinions to increase the interest rates.The index declined 1.2% on Thursday with all its 30 components ending the day with losses. Broader markets were weighed down by fresh concerns emanating from the White House as well as the terrorist attack in Barcelona. Shares of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) closed the day and lower, respectively after their earnings results disappointed investors.

Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be in the range 59-61 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 55 cents on revenue estimates of $12.09 billion. (Read: Cisco Meets Q4 Earnings Estimates, Revenues Beat)Wal-Mart’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share beat both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and prior-year quarter’s adjusted earnings of $1.07 by 0.9%. Earnings reached the top end of the guided range of $1.00-$1.08 per share.Total revenues came in at $123.4 billion (including membership and other income). The figure came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $122.7 billion by 0.5% and increased 2.1% year over year. Currency impacted sales by approximately $1.04 billion.

3461,HD,"If you’re looking for a profitable portfolio of stocks that will offer the best of value and growth investing, try the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy. It helps an investor gain exposure to stocks that are undervalued and have impressive growth prospects.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) to make the strategy foolproof.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Only Strong Buy and Buy-rated stocks can get through.)Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than X-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are six of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Insperity, Inc. (NSP  -  Free Report) is engaged in providing an array of human resources and business solutions.

3462,HD,"Tuesday, August 15th, 2017High profile U.S. retailers continue to report Q2 results in this final leg of earnings season: specialty retailers Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Coach  and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) all posted July quarter numbers ahead of today’s opening bell. Retail Sales for last month also hit the tape. Finally, more CEOs have resigned President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council this morning, following Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier’s departure yesterday in the wake of Trump’s initial response to the white supremacist rally over the weekend that claimed one life and several injuries.July Retail Sales came in hotter than expected this morning, rising 0.6% from the 0.3% expected. Perhaps even more telling, June’s revision swung from a disappointing negative to a decent positive: from -0.2% in the initial read to a revision of 0.3% this morning. Behind the headlines, ex-autos and ex-autos & gas were a strong 0.5%, with the control number 0.6%. These indicate real retail sales growth and not a one-time anomaly making its way into the headline number.These figures also satisfy those economists who’ve been scratching their heads of late, trying to figure out how a robust labor market, surging consumer confidence and other growth metrics all pointing higher while retail sales continued to lag. Now growth of more than a full percentage point over the past two months look to keep these folks from tearing up their models in despair.Q2 Earnings RoundupHome Depot outperformed expectations this morning, beating on the bottom line by 3 cents to $2.25 per share (up 14.2% year over year) on quarterly sales that reached $28.11 billion, easily outpacing the $27.84 billion in the Zacks consensus (up 6.2% year over year). The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-ranked home improvement giant cranked up guidance in sales (from 4.6% to 5.3%) and earnings (from 11% to 13%). Even still, HD shares are trading down slightly in today’s pre-market — potentially a “sell the news” scenario for a company that is up 15% year to date.Specialty handbag retailer Coach beat earnings and sales estimates for its fiscal Q2, but guidance was down and so is the stock in pre-market trading. Earnings of 50 cents per share beat expectations by a penny, on $1.33 billion in revenues which surpassed the $1.15 billion we were looking for. Yet Coach lowered full-year earnings down nearly a dime per share from previous estimates. The company expects the Kate Spade purchase to yield $1.2 billion by the end of the fiscal year.And Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated Dick’s Sporting Goods is selling off “big league” this morning following its Q2 earnings release. Bottom line was worse than expected by 4 cents from $1.00 per share expected, while sales were a smudge under the $2.17 billion in the Zacks consensus. Guidance for both sales and earnings in the full year have also been ratcheted down, and Dick’s shares are selling off after already having tumbled more than 30% this year.The Incredible Shrinking Manufacturing CouncilCEOs from both Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and UnderArmour  have given up their seats on President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council early today. Intel’s Brian Krzanich and UA’s Kevin Plank both cited tacit support from the White House toward separatists who rallied and attacked protestors in Charlottesville, VA on Saturday as the reason for their forfeiting their posts. President Trump has since stated publicly that “racism is evil, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.” It is unclear if these corporate leaders will attempt to be replaced. To this point, the President has not yet tweeted anything disparaging about either CEO.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>

3464,HD,"On Aug 23, we issued an updated research report on Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (BECN  -  Free Report). The company’s performance will be hampered competitive pricing, difficult year-ago comparisons in Southwest United States and issues in Canada.Beacon Roofing’s third-quarter fiscal 2017 top and bottom lines improved on a year-over-year basis but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company lowered revenue growth range for 2017 to 5-6%, lower than the prior guidance of 6-9%. This takes in to consideration lower-than-expected sales rate in the third quarter due to higher rain and more limited reroof work as a result of milder winter weather. While the company expects a more normal rainfall impacting the fourth quarter, the drag effect from last winter will continue in certain northern markets, impacting the quarter’s sales. Organic growth outlook for the full year is 2-4% on a daily sales basis.The company had earlier provided daily sales guidance of 4-6%. The company now anticipates adjusted full year earnings per share to be between $2.15 and $2.25. Beacon Roofing had earlier projected earnings per share at around $2.34. Further, it is projecting 2017 full-year gross margins at 24.5-24.6%, in line with fiscal 2016. The fourth-quarter comparison will be particularly difficult as the company posted its highest gross margin ever in fourth-quarter fiscal 2016.The commercial roofing market has been experiencing more heightened competitive pricing pressures recently. The segment was also impacted by deferred work due to wet weather in the company’s normally strong commercial regions.Southwest United States and Canada continue to be the company’s weakest performing regions. The Southwest region suffered a sales decline of 7.9%, reflecting difficult year-ago comparisons tied to hail damage in Texas. In third-quarter fiscal 2016, the company had witnessed a 46% increase in sales in the Southwest. Year-over-year comparisons in the Southwest will remain difficult during the coming quarters because of the magnitude of last year's hail's damage.Sales in Canada dropped 16.2% during the quarter. Eastern Canada is being negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including heightened competitive pressure; more limited, larger project work; along with the increased levels of rain and consecutive mild winters.Beacon Roofing’s suppliers in both residential and nonresidential sectors have announced multiple price increases during 2017 in response to rising cost pressures from escalating raw materials. Most recently, several vendors have attempted to pass through low to mid-single-digit price increases in residential roofing and in other products. End market acceptance of these higher prices remains uncertain at this point.Moreover, Beacon Roofing underperformed the industry with respect to the year-to-date price performance. The stock dipped 14.0%, while the industry recorded growth of 6.8%.Additionally, Beacon Roofing has been witnessing an unflattering movement in its earnings estimates trend, reflecting ongoing pessimism in the stock’s prospects. In the last month, current quarter earnings estimates have moved down 11% due to eight downward revisions versus none in the opposite direction. Meanwhile, current year consensus estimate has been revised 7% downward due to nine negative revisions versus none moving south. Likewise, the estimate for the next fiscal has moved down 6% due to nine negative revisions.Beacon Roofing currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the sector include Rush Enterprises, Inc. (RUSHA  -  Free Report), The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), and Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (LL  -  Free Report). Rush Enterprises sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Home Depot and Lumber Liquidators carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Rush Enterprise’ earnings estimate for fiscal 2017 currently is pegged at $1.83, reflecting a 62.24% year-over-year growth. The earnings estimate for fiscal 2017 for The Home Depot is at $7.30, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13.19%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Lumber Liquidators for fiscal 2017 is at a loss of 69 cents, a considerable improvement from the loss of $2.51 in the prior fiscal.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3465,HD,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. (BMCH  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in BMCH.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen three estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.28 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.15.Also, for the current quarter, BMC Stock Holdings has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 38 cents a share from 46 cents over the past 30 days.   The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 8.3% in the past month.BMC Stock Holdings, Inc.

3466,HD,"Shares of Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) fell 6% in morning trading on Wednesday after the company reported worse-than-expected second quarter fiscal 2017 results.Lowe’s reported adjusted earnings of $1.57 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.62. The company also reported revenue of $19.495 billion, missing our estimate of $19.523 billion, although the company still grew 6.76% year-over-year.  Lowe’s poor earnings contrast sharply with their rival The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report). Home Depot has been one of the few retail stocks that had a great earnings report this fiscal quarter. The company beat our earnings estimates while its comparable store sales were up about 6.3% year-over-year. In comparison, Lowe’s said their comparable sales rose only 4.5%.In order to improve sales, Lowe’s plans to increase the number of hours their employees work in order to provide additional customer service face-to-face. “We believe this is the right strategy to more fully capitalize on strong traffic trends in what we believe is a supportive macroeconomic backdrop for home improvement,” said Robert Niblock, Lowe’s CEO.However, because workers will need to be paid more, the company’s bottom line will take a hit. Lowe’s has lowered its guidance for the full fiscal year to $4.20 to $4.30 a share, well below our estimate of $4.62 per share.This strategy could pay off in the long run, though. Customer service remains a large incentive for customers to choose Lowe’s over online retailers, like Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), in order to get assistance on home improvements. “This is one category in retail where service really matters,” Brian Nagel, an analyst for Oppenheimer & Co., told CNBC this morning.Lowe’s remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), with a VGM score of ‘A.’4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

3468,HD,"The retail landscape has been undergoing a fundamental change, with technology playing a key role and the focus shifting to online shopping. This transition in buying pattern has persuaded retailers to come up with innovative ways to market their products. Retailers who have responded quickly to it by staying ahead technologically stand in good stead.With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers including big-box ones are struggling to compete with e-Commerce channels. These companies are being forced to trim store count to focus more on an online model.Nevertheless, retailers are now efficiently allocating a large chunk of capital toward multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, and developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers. Further, the retailers are renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery, implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system along with improving relationship with existing and new customers.How Is the Sector Placed?Although the Zacks Retail Sector — which occupies the bottom most position among the Zacks Sector Rank (16 out of 16) — has not been an outstanding performer. However, it still holds some promise, given the favorable economic indicators. We note that so far this year, the sector has registered an increase of 15.8% compared with the S&P 500 that was up roughly 9.9%.A decent run in the U.S. stock market, sturdy retail sales data along with steady job addition and improvement in the manufacturing sector have lifted investors’ mood as well as highlights the solid economic report card. These were reflected in Consumer Confidence — a key determinant of the economy’s health — that reached its second highest level in August since late 2000. U.S. retail and food services sales in July rose 0.6% following a revised reading of 0.3% growth registered in June.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers and definitely play a crucial role in raising buyers’ confidence.We expect this positive sentiment to translate in to higher consumer spending that may help revive sales. Not to forget, deadly hurricanes one after another, political gridlock and flaring tensions with North Korea may impact the economy to an extent and hurt consumer sentiment.But for now you can focus on the following Retail/Wholesale stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results.5 Stocks that Outpaced Their Respective IndustriesRush Enterprises, Inc. (RUSHA  -  Free Report) has emerged as a strong contender with a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% and a VGM Score of A. In a year, the stock has surged roughly 65.4% comfortably outperforming the industry’s growth of 5.5%. This integrated retailer of commercial vehicles and related services delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 27% in the trailing four quarters and flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We also suggest investing in The Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report) with a long-term earnings growth rate of 9% and a VGM Score of B. In a year, this Zacks Rank #1 stock has increased roughly 33.1%, while the industry witnessed a decline of 35.3%.

The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 14% in the trailing four quarters.

3469,HD,"Even before the country could heave a sigh of relief post Hurricane Harvey, another storm started brewing in the open Atlantic Ocean. The new threat called Hurricane Irma has been accredited the Category 5 status (the highest degree) and is feared to be more disastrous than Harvey. It is expected to ravage the Caribbean islands and Florida this week. Florida announced a state of emergency.Below we highlight a few potential ETF and stock winners and losers from Irma.LosersInsurance Severe destruction is likely in Florida. Insured losses could be as high as $125 billion to $130 billion, as per an analyst at Barclays, quoted on Bloomberg. Property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Insurance stocks normally fall over 1% in the month, following the disaster caused by a Category 3 storm. So, the impact of Hurricane Irma on insurance stocks is anybody’s guess. Already, shares of property and casualty homeowners insurance companies like Universal Insurance Holdings Inc. UVE, Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc. HRTG and HCI Group Inc. HCI plunged about 14.6%, 17% and 20% on Sep 5. Reinsurers XL Group Ltd XL and Everest Re Group Ltd. RE too lost about 5.8% and 6.9%, respectively.Insurance companies like Chubb Limited CB, Allstate Corporation ALL, Prudential Financial Inc. PRU and Progressive Corp. PGR are also likely to be hit hard. Naturally, the insurance ETFs iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Fund (IAK  -  Free Report) andSPDR S&P Insurance ETF KIE will feel the brunt (see all Financials ETFs here).Transportation As per an article published on CNBC, a severe impact from Irma could roil rail and container activity, and crush infrastructure for transportation. Airlines started considering Florida airports for their Hurricane Irma change-fee waivers. American (AAL  -  Free Report), JetBlue (JBLU  -  Free Report), Spirit (SAVE  -  Free Report), and Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) are some of the airlines doing this.As per the policy, “they permitted customers to make one change to their itineraries without paying change fees that can cost $200 or more per passenger.” Naturally, transportation ETFs like SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS may feel the pressure ahead.Cruise LinesSince Caribbean islands are famed for cruise trips, cruise stocks and ETFs deserve a special mention in this case. Operators are abandoning trips that haven’t left port.Carnival Corp. CCL, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. RCL and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) lost about 3.1%, 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, on Sep 5.  With this, PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment (PEJ  -  Free Report) and iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Discretionary ETF (CNDF) could feel a slight adverse impact as these funds have certain exposure to cruise lines (read: What Lies Ahead of Leisure & Travel ETFs in 2H?).RestaurantsAnalysts are apprehensive that restaurants may see considerable sales reduction and destruction due to Irma. A Canaccord analyst said that some restaurants have considerable exposure to Florida. Among these, Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc. FRGI (37% exposure), Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc. (RUTH) (21% exposure), Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) (19% focus), BJ's Restaurants BJRI (12%), Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) (11%), Ruby Tuesday Inc. (RT) (10%) and Brinker International Inc. (EAT) (10%) have a double-digit focus. These stocks lost in the range of 0.4% to 5% on Sep 5. USCF Restaurant Leaders Fund  would thus be on high alert.GainersAgriculture Three agricultural commodities, namely orange juices, cotton and lumber, saw price rises in recent trading. Key cotton-producing areas around the Gulf Coast have already suffered from flooded fields caused by Hurricane Harvey. Crops in parts of Georgia and South Carolina will also be at risk of yield losses from Irma, as per MDA and quoted on Bloomberg. As a result, cotton prices rallied. iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN jumped about 7.3% on Sep 5.Lumber prices surged on apprehensions of damage. This should act as a tailwind foriShares Global Timber & Forestry ETF (WOOD  -  Free Report) while orange prices skyrocketed as Florida is key growing region of oranges.Home Retailers The condition of houses in an area ravaged by a massive storm with 180 mile-per-hour winds can well be imagined. So, home improvement retailers like Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) (up 1.43% on Sep 5) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW) (up 1.4%) are in a bright spot. ETFs like Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) and PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction (PKB  -  Free Report) should also benefit (read: Home Retailer ETFs Set to Gain After Harvey).Infrastructure First Harvey, and now Irma should shower gains on infrastructure stocks as re-building will push up their demand. So, companies dealing in building materials should see a surge. The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLB  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) have high chances of outperforming.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3470,HD,"Markets suffered losses on Friday after Hurricane Irma gained traction, destroying swathes of the Caribbean and sending insurance stocks lower. Meanwhile, home improvement stocks rose ahead of Irma’s fallout. Investor sentiment was also hurt following reports that North Korea would likely test another nuclear missile over the weekend to celebrate their foundation day. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives passed the Hurricane Harvey relief legislation, extending the debt-ceiling deadline through Dec 8.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,797.79, gaining 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.2% to close at 2,461.43. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,360.19, declining 0.6%. A total of 6 billion shares were traded on Friday, higher than the last 20-session average of 5.8 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.19-to-1 ratio.  On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by a 1.01-to-1 ratio.  The CBOE VIX increased 1.1% to close at 104.74.North Korea and Hurricane Irma Keep Investors on the EdgeMarkets suffered broad based losses on Friday after Hurricane Irma gained traction. Irma comes just weeks after Hurricane Harvey destroyed the Houston area of Texas. Hurricane Irma destroyed parts of the Caribbean on Thursday and was expected to make a landfall on the coast of Florida over the weekend. This sent insurance stocks lower on Thursday.

The House of Representatives passed the Bill on Friday, extending the debt-ceiling deadline through Dec 8, 2017. The legislation includes $15.25 billion for the relief of victims of Hurricane Harvey. The amount also provides for possible recovery efforts in case of any casualties after Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall over the weekend.On the economic data front, wholesale inventories for the month of July increased 0.6% from the previous period, whereas the consensus estimate was an increase of 0.4%.Weekly UpdateFor the week the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq declined 0.9%, 0.6% and 1.2% respectively. Reports from South Korea indicated that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate their foundation day. Such news led investors to rotate out of financial stocks into bonds, leading to broad based losses. President Trump reached an agreement with key members of Congress to extend the debt ceiling deadline. This was done to aid the relief funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile, Fed’s Vice Chairman announced his plans to retire in mid-October, citing ‘personal reasons’ behind his decision. Meanwhile, the ECB decided unanimously that interest rates would remain unchanged.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

3471,HD,"From the “sell in May and go away” to the Santa Clause rally, there are numerous calendar-driven investing strategies. Lately, talks that September is the worst month for stocks have been making the rounds, and rightly so.Devastating storms continue to affect the energy, restaurant, travel and insurance industries in the United States. While hurricane Irma has begun its destructive barrage on Florida, the estimated impact of hurricane Harvey on the economy surpasses the combined effect of hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. As if that wasn’t enough, North Korea continues to add to geopolitical tensions at a time when U.S. stock valuations are stretched and global growth soft.Meanwhile, investors should practice caution and pick stocks of companies with big brands. Such companies have established business models and tend to draw consumers and investors, even when the equity market gets rocky.Irma Batters Florida, Harvey Drains CoffersIrma made landfall on Florida’s southern islands. The hurricane has claimed three lives and has resulted in power loss for more than 1 million customers. Residents of Miami and Tampa moved to safer zones, leaving behind ghost towns. Per National Weather Service, Irma gained strength as category 4 storms after being downgraded to category 3 as it moved to Florida. Governor Rick Scott has warned that Irma is stronger than hurricane Andrew that had wrecked the state in 1992 (read more: Hurricane Irma Set to Hit Florida: Gainers & Losers).AccuWeather raised the estimated damage caused by Hurricane Harvey to $190 billion, or a full 1% of U.S. GDP. This highlights an increase from an earlier tally of $160 billion. The most affected area is likely to be Houston, the fourth biggest city in the United States. The city is expected to remain uninhabitable for weeks or even months, thanks to mold and dirty water.  Harvey has crippled a dozen refineries including the biggest in the country, Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s Motiva facility in Port Arthur and Exxon Mobil Corp’s (XOM  -  Free Report) Baytown facility. Both of the facilities account for more than 30% of U.S. refining capacity, per HIS Markit. Meanwhile, restaurant companies with business concentration in Texas and surrounding areas have been affected the most. Sonic Corporation (SONC  -  Free Report) and Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK  -  Free Report) have almost one-third of their store base in Texas. And for airlines, United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL  -  Free Report) will eventually have to bear the brunt since 19% of its capacity is in Houston. Major insurance companies are also factoring in the catastrophic effect of the hurricanes on their business (read more: 4 Home-Improvement Stocks to Buy Post Harvey Mayhem).North Korea Threatens ‘Greatest Pain’ for Sanctions North Korea, in the meanwhile, threatened to inflict ‘pain and suffering’ on the United States if it issues sanctions in response to Kim Jong-un regime’s sixth nuclear test last week. Notably, the bomb is an advanced hydrogen one that can be placed on an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said that if the United States “does rig up the illegal and unlawful resolution,” it would respond in kind.The White House reacted strongly and warned North Korea that military actions are still on the table if Pyongyang threatens the United States or its allies. The White House wants the United Nations to impose a halt to oil exports to North Korea and at the same time freeze Kim Jong-un’s assets. The United States is also demanding a ban on North Koreans working abroad since they pass most of the foreign currency to the regime.U.S. Stocks Overvalued, China Raises Global Growth WorriesA record number of fund managers see the U.S. market as the most overvalued in the world. Among the 20 valuation metrics tracked by Ned Davis Research, 16 indicate that the U.S. stocks are extremely overvalued.The stocks’ current cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio has only been exceeded in 1929 and 2000 – both prior to major corrections. In 1929, Wall Street was subjected to an infamous crash, while 2000 saw the dotcom implosion. This time around, expansion in profit margins led to lofty valuations, which raise concerns of a possible downturn (read more: 5 Great Value Picks for the World's Priciest Market).Overnight trade data from China was rather mixed, raising questions about global growth. China’s exports did increase from a year earlier in August, but, the recent rise in yuan’s value is starting to weigh on such exports. The yuan rose 2% against the U.S. dollar in August, its highest monthly gain since July 2005. The currency rebounded from a 6.6% decline last year to its highest level in more than 20 months this week. Chen Lin, general manager at Hefei DGCT Imp. & Exp. Co. Ltd, added that rising yuan is eating into profits from his pet toys business. Imports are also expected to take a beating because the government’s efforts to reduce debt are having an adverse impact on domestic demand.4 Solid Big-Brand Stocks for NowWith so many concerns plaguing investors, big-brand stocks offer some respite at the moment.

3473,HD,"The investing world may go gaga over the rapid emergence and acceptance of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and be enamored by its 94% share price gains in two years against 10.5% decline in SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report),butthere is a section that still doubts this monumental success. Moody’s Investors Service falls in this category. Let’s delve a little deeper”:Still Low Online Penetration in the United StatesAs per Moody’s, Amazon.com Inc. is far from ruling the U.S. retail market: “Online sales still account for only about 10% of overall U.S. retail sales, with a much lower percentage in the grocery segment, leaving the big brick and mortar retailers, led by Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), still really formidable competitors in the industry,"" as noted by Moody’s. This makes the e-commerce behemoth’s foray into the grocery segment with the Whole Foods acquisition appear not as profitable as many thought it will be (read: Tough Time Ahead for Grocery Stocks and ETFs?).Amazon’s Top Line Promising, Bottom Line a Drag Moody’s went on to explain that Amazon is doing great on sales growth but not on profitability. The company reported earnings per share of 40 cents, way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 and down 77% year over year. Revenues climbed 25% year over year to $37.95 billion and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37.21 billion.In comparison, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart beat our earnings and revenue estimates on both lines. Nordstrom raised the lower end of its earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 too. Investors’ unloved bet Kohl's Corporation KSS also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the bottom line by a nickel while revenues came in slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $6 million (read: Solid Q2 Revenue Beat Fails to Boost Retail ETFs).Amazon's Prime Membership Exaggerated by Analysts?Some market watchers estimate Amazon's Prime membership base as high as 85 million. But Moody's calculations show Prime membership somewhere around 50 million against Costco's paid membership of 47.6 million and total membership of 86.7 million as of the fiscal year ended August 2016, as per the source.Wal-Mart Not Amazon Has Upper Hand in Food Market Last but not the least, Moody’s noted that U.S. food sales total about $800 billion a year, of which Walmart takes about 25%. Kroger is responsible for about $130 billion while Albertson's accounts for about $60 billion and Costco about $50 billion. Moody’s agreed that Whole Foods provided Amazon with an important crucial brick-and-mortar presence, which should prove beneficial for the latter.  Moody’s sees that “even with Whole Foods in its basket, [Amazon’s] food sales still amount to less than $20 billion annually.""However, Moddy’s is bullish on Amazon Web Services or AWS, which constitutes a significant portion of the company's operating income. Amazon's cash cushion and excellent liquidity profile are also well liked by Moody’s.Traditional Retailers Cashing on Amazon Success Investors should note that traditional retailers are capitalizing on Amazon’s popularity lately. For example,Kohl’shas formed a partnership with Amazon under which the former will start selling Amazon devices, like Echo and Fire tablets, at 10 stores in Los Angeles and Chicago from October. Prior to this, in July, Sears SHLD entered into a deal to sell its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon.Inside the Stock’s Unimpressive ScoresAmazon has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a Value and Momentum Score of F. Only a Growth Score of A looks promising. The company’s Zacks Industry Rank is in the bottom 41%, at the time of writing.ETF Strategies Investors may be cautious on ETFs heavy on Amazon given the above-mentioned analysis. VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (FDIS  -  Free Report). AMZN holds the top spot in these funds with a double-digit exposure each.On the other hand, ETFs like First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF (FTXD  -  Free Report), XRT, PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio ETF (PMR  -  Free Report) and Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) can be considered for gains. FTXD is low on Amazon while PMR, XLP and XRT do not have it in their top-10 holdings.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3475,HD,"While Houston, Texas and other parts of the Gulf are still reeling under the effects of Hurricane Harvey, another storm is brewing which might hit the Sun Shine state of Florida. Irma, which has become the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record, will hit the shores of Florida in some days’ time. It has already caused widespread devastation in the Caribbean.While Irma has already hit the insurance, travel and restaurant industries hard, home improvement retailers stand to gain.Irma Lashes Caribbean Islands, Florida Braces for ItIrma has claimed at least eight lives and has severely injured 23 in the French Caribbean island territories. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb expects the death toll to go higher, while it’s devastating impact wrecked roads and telecommunications systems. Significant destruction was also reported in St. Martin, an island split between French and Dutch control.The Category 5 storm is set to hit South Florida on Sep 10. Residents of Florida are fleeing to safety as the hurricane might hit with record-breaking winds of 185 miles an hour. The 400-mile-wide hurricane is devastating enough to affect the entire state. Florida Governor Rick Scott warned that Irma is bigger and stronger than hurricane Andrew that had wrecked the state in 1992.U.S. Military Gears Up for IrmaU.S. military is deploying ships and personnel to cater to the potential crisis. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis approved naval ships USS Oak Hill and the USS Kearsarge to provide relief. The Navy is also preparing to dispatch USS Iwo Jima and the USS New York. These actions are being carried out while the storm roars through the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands.Three air force bases, Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey and Warner Robbins AFB in Georgia, have been designated to carry out recovery operations. The National Guard has also been alerted. The National Guard has around 650 members in the U.S. Virgin Islands, 5,200 members in Puerto Rico and more than 7,000 in Florida.Florida Damage Might Hit Stock MarketIrma has already sent ripples through the U.S. equity market, just days after Harvey wreaked havoc in the southern states.Insurance Stocks Take a HitSince Irma is the strongest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin, damage to properties and infrastructure is inevitable. Stock prices of providers of property and casualty homeowners insurance, having heavy exposure to Florida, are taking a beating.Prominent among them are HCI Group Inc (HCI  -  Free Report), Universal Insurance Holdings, Inc.  and Heritage Insurance Holdings Inc (HRTG  -  Free Report), whose shares tanked 16.1%, 13.1% and 11.8% this month, respectively. Collectively, the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE  -  Free Report) is down 2.9% for the month.Cruise Lines Also Face the BruntShares of cruise line operators, including Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL  -  Free Report) and Carnival Corp (CCL  -  Free Report), lost value. Cruise operators are canceling voyages and rerouting ships to avoid stops at islands that maybe affected. While Royal Caribbean canceled two trips to Port Canaveral and Miami-based vessels to the Bahamas, Carnival rerouted four vessels from Eastern Caribbean to Western Caribbean. Additionally, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH  -  Free Report) will bring back two of its Miami-based ships.Shares of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Carnival Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line are down 4.5%, 3.6% and 3.9%, respectively, in the month.Restaurant Stocks Lose Strength Restaurants having significant number of locations in Florida are likely to see decline in revenues in the third and fourth quarter. Deadly winds will result in closure of outlets and displace workers.As per Canaccord analyst Lynne Collier, restaurants that are most at risk are Fiesta Restaurant Group Inc FRGI, which owns Taco Cabana; Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc. (RUTH  -  Free Report), which operates Ruth's Chris Steak House and Bloomin’ Brands Inc (BLMN  -  Free Report). While Fiesta has about 37% of its restaurants in Florida, Ruth's Hospitality has about 21% and Bloomin' Brands around 19%.

This in turn will drive demand for home-improvement equipment and materials.Shares of multi-channel specialty retailer of hardwood Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc (LL  -  Free Report) are already up 5.1% this month. Shares of Kirkland's, Inc. KIRK, a specialty retailer of home décor and Tempur Sealy International Inc (TPX  -  Free Report) a bedding manufacturer, have also been in the green this month.

3476,HD,"Benchmarks ended mixed on Tuesday despite better than expected retail data and a de-escalation in tensions with North Korea. Weaker than expected earnings from Home Depot weighed on the Dow and pared gains for the blue-chip index. However, the Dow ended in the green following gains from American Express and Apple. The S&P 500 ended in the red overall losses in the market because of the slump in the retail sector. The Nasdaq also ended in the negative territory due to broad based losses for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,998.99, advancing 5.28 points or less than 0.1%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 1.23 points to close at 2,464.61. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,333.01, increasing 7.22 points or 0.1%. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,799 to 946. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,671 to 1,016.Retail Sales Notch Up a Seven Month HighSales at U.S. retailers recorded their biggest increase in seven months in July. Retail sales advanced 0.6% last month, the best performance since a gain of 0.9% last December, according to the Commerce Department. Retail sales jumped 4.2% in the past twelve months, which is near the five-year average. Excluding auto and gasoline, retail sales rose 0.5% in July. In fact, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales went up 0.6% last month. June’s retails sales were also revised to show a 0.3% gain, in contrast to the previously reported 0.2% decline. May’s retail sales were revised up to show no change instead of the earlier report of a 0.1% dip.The lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Amazon Fells the Traditional Retail SectorWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation KSS and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.The Dow closed higher for the third day on Tuesday. The blue-chip index notched 45 points earlier in the day. These gains were offset by weak earnings from the retail sector. The biggest drag on the Dow was falling shares of Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). The home-improvement company cut about 30 points from the Dow. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker. (Read More: Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) Beats on Q2 Earnings & Sales Estimates August 15, 2017)Telecom, Consumer Discretionary Stocks Drag S&P 500 LowerThe S&P 500 declined on Tuesday as the telecom and consumer-discretionary sectors disappointed. Five of the eleven primary sectors ended in the red, led by consumer discretionary. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) was down 0.9%. Moreover, Advance Auto Parts Inc. (AAP  -  Free Report) reported a 16.8% decline in adjusted earnings to $1.58 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Jul 15, 2017) from $1.90 earned in the prior-year quarter. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65. Adjusted net income declined to $117 million from $141 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.

3477,HD,"Earnings season chugs on although this week there are only about 300 companies reporting.But don’t write earnings off just yet. Within those 300 companies are some of the top names in retail and technology.Retail is being ignored by the market.

3478,HD,"The Dow Jones steered past the 22,000 mark for the first time in its 120-year history, driven by robust earnings. Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) rallied on stellar earnings, which helped the blue-chip index hit the psychological milestone. The index also enjoyed an upward journey, powered by upbeat quarterly earnings results by several other blue-chip companies, including Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report).Also, there has been a particularly sharp run-up in the stock price of blue-chips on signs of a strengthening economy. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter.As the Dowcontinues to scale record highs, it will be prudent to invest in stocks listed in the said index. Such companies are slated to gain further in the near term as they are well established and financially sound.Dow Jones Hits 22,000 first the First TimeThe Dow gained 52.32 points or 0.2% to close at 22,016.24 on Aug 2, marking its 32nd record close of the year. The 30-stock index closed above the 22,000 mark, reflecting the seventh fastest move to a 1000-point milestone. It just took 107 trading sessions for the blue-chip gauge to achieve such a feat. It had hit the 21,000 mark on Mar 1. Let us now have a look at the table of the index’s milestones.Trading Sessions Between 1,000 Point MilestonesDow’s 1,000-Point MilestoneDates of First Close Above 1,000-Milestone12018,00012/4/201448319,00011/22/20164220,00001/25/20172421,00003/01/201710722,00008/02/2017The Dow has hit three 1,000-point milestones this year and the journey hasn’t been a smooth one. The index improved in fits and starts over the past five months as investors remained skeptical about how efficiently President Trump will be able to implement his promised pro-growth policies. The latest setback to pass the bill to revamp the Affordable Care Act underlined those bearish sentiments.Nevertheless, the Dow is trading up 11.4% on a year-to-date basis buoyed by healthy corporate earnings results and broadly encouraging economic data.Catalysts Driving DowEarnings Blow Past ExpectationsApple Inc.’s stock drove the Dow above 22,000. The tech giant’s shares rose 4.7% after its quarterly earnings results topped expectations and iPhone sales met expectations. The iPhone maker posted fiscal third-quarter earnings of $1.67 a share, compared with $1.42 a year earlier. Earnings also came ahead of analysts’ estimates. Revenues of $45.41 billion edged past estimates, with sales of iPhones totaled 41.03 million more than 40.4 million in the same period last year. Remarkably, Apple’s revenues fell 10% in the Greater China region from year-ago quarter (read more: Apple Earnings Prove It No Longer Needs China to Succeed).The blue-chip gauge’s steady advance was also powered by moves in shares of plane maker Boeing. The aerospace company has skyrocketed 53% so far this year, making it the best performer in the Dow.  The company reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, beating analysts’ expectations and improving from last year’s loss of 44 cents per share. Escalating geopolitical risks, involving Syria and North Korea, has led to increased demand for defense products, which bodes well for Boeing (read More: Boeing Stock Flies to All-Time High After Q2 Earnings).Several other blue-chip stocks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report), 3M Co (MMM  -  Free Report), Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), McDonald's Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report)CAT), to name a few, have come up with promising quarterly results. In fact, the overall earnings for the quarter are on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record (read more: No Shortage of Revenue Surprises This Earnings Season).US GDP Goes Past $19 Trillion for the First TimeOn the economic front, thinks are also looking brighter. After a feeble start to the year, Americans spent more in the spring driving the U.S. economy beyond the $19 trillion mark for the first time. Real gross domestic product rebounded in the second quarter and more than doubled from the first quarter. Pick-up in consumer spending and an uptick in business investment in software, research and equipment boosted economic growth.Consumer outlays grew 2.8% in the second quarter as Americans spent more on healthcare, groceries and clothes. Spending rebounded in the last quarter, buoyed by an uptick in household finances. Disposable income adjusted for inflation saw the best back-to-back quarters this year since the first half of 2015. Consumer spending was also driven by the strongest labor market in years.Companies, in the meanwhile, increased investments in equipment like computers, which rose at a rate of 8.2%, the highest in almost two years. This also highlights the optimism among companies over demand in domestic and overseas markets. Among other bright spots, nonresidential fixed investment that includes structures and intellectual properties contributed 0.64 percentage points to growth. Government spending also increased at a clip of 0.7%, adding 0.12 point to growth (read more: US GDP Crosses $19TN for the First Time: 5 Best Gainers).5 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for Solid GainsThanks to the aforementioned bullish factors, there has been a particularly sharp rally by the Dow.  The companies under the index are slated to gain further in the near term as they have large market capitalization, strong balance sheets and solid cash flow.

3479,HD,"The largest increase in retail sales in seven months failed to lift consumer sentiment substantially on Tuesday. Moreover, a selloff in traditional retail stocks followed, raising concerns over the sector’s long-term prospects. Industry watchers may hold differing views on this issue, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to profit from the country's rising purchasing power using traditional retail stocks.At the same time, it is difficult to ignore that a resilient labor market, accompanied by a slow and steady rise in wages, has made U.S. consumers increasingly confident. Traditional retail stocks may have lost their luster, but there are still several other avenues to profit from rising discretionary spending. Investing in consumer discretionary stocks from domains other than retail makes for a smart move at this point.“Amazonification” EffectThe lion’s share of the spurt in July retail sales was attributable to a pickup in demand for autos and to what is now a national event, Amazon Prime Day. The annual event, during which consumers flock to Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) for the year’s best shopping deals, contributed to gains for every product category. The Department of Commerce’s report reflects this as a 1.3% monthly increase in what is categorized as non-store retail spending. But for the sudden spurt in auto sales, other notable movements in the consumer spending report also have crucial linkages with Amazon. For instance, the decline in sales at electronics stores is likely a result of most consumers opting to buy this category of products from online alternatives, possibly Amazon.Home Depot Leads Retail SlideWhile Amazon did end the day around 0.1% lower, investor attention was largely fixed on the fall in traditional retail stocks. Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report), Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) declined 2.6%, 1.5%, 1.5% and 3.8%, respectively. Only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) ended the day unscathed, notching up a minor increase of 0.1%.But of particular concern was a 2.7% decline in shares of The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report), even after it reported stellar second-quarter results and raised its guidance for the second time for the year. Such a turn of events makes it amply clear that the company is not immune to “Amazonification” despite its status as a leading specialty retailer. This is particularly surprising since Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and professional customers form Home Depot’s core audience. But the move to sell Kenmore devices via Amazon indicates that even the building products behemoth is now susceptible to the rising power of the Kindle and Fire Stick maker.Our ChoicesConsumer’s growing tendency to switch from offline to online alternatives has been apparent even in the recent past. But this is possible the first spurt in retail trade which is being partially attributed to sales derived only from Amazon.com. Clearly, the days of retail are increasingly numbered.However, this doesn’t mean that you should ignore the higher discretionary spending power of the American consumer. Several profitable alternatives from domains other than retail continue to exist. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score.Nutrisystem, Inc. (NTRI  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of weight management products and services.Nutrisystem has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A. The company has expected earnings growth of 54.5% for the current year. Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 12.4% over the last 30 days.Malibu Boats, Inc. (MBUU  -  Free Report) operates as a designer, manufacturer and marketer of sport boats primarily in the United States.Malibu Boats has a Zacks Rank #1 and a VGM Score of A. The company has expected earnings growth of 15% for the current year. Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 2.8% over the last 30 days.SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA  -  Free Report) is engaged in the manufacture of home beverage carbonation systems, which enable consumers to easily transform ordinary tap water instantly into carbonated soft drinks and sparkling water.SodaStream has a VGM Score of B. The company has expected earnings growth of 33.6% for the current year. Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 6.6% over the last 30 days. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL  -  Free Report) is a cruise company. It owns and operates three global brands — Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises.Royal Caribbean Cruises has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A. The company has expected earnings growth of 22.4% for the current year. Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 3.3% over the last 30 days.Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. (BFAM  -  Free Report) is engaged in providing employer-sponsored child care, early education and work/life solutionsBright Horizons Family Solutions has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. The company has expected earnings growth of 22.9% for the current year. Its earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 1.8% over the last 30 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

3480,HD,"As another earnings season passes us by, concern about the state of the retail industry is once again rising. Changing consumer habits and competition from e-commerce sites have devastated several traditional retail giants, and very few encouraging retail reports emerged this earnings season.Of course, “very few” does not mean “none at all.” Indeed, some retailers—be it those who have been deemed Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)-proof, or those who have successfully adapted to the times—were able to produce quality results in the most recent quarter.So who sticks out from the pack? Which retail companies actually did report solid earnings? Check out these three stocks below:1.       Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report)While several of its department store peers disappointed investors, Nordstrom was able to post earnings and revenue figures that topped estimates this quarter. Adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents and extended the company’s surprise streak to five. Total revenue of $3.8 billion surpassed our consensus estimate of $3.73 billion.Net retail sales increased 3.5%, while credit card revenues rose 28.8%. Total company comps rose 1.7%, driven by comps growth at both full-line and Rack stores. Nordstrom Rack total revenues, which include Rack stores and nordstromrack.com) gained 9.8%. So far this year, the company has opened a total of six new Rack stores and closed one full-line store—not bad in the face of shuttering department stores around the country.Nordstrom now anticipates net sales growth of nearly 4% for fiscal 2017, which is at the high-end of its previous guidance of nearly 3–4% growth. Also, the company now envisions fiscal 2017 earnings per share in the range of $2.85–$3.00, compared with $2.75–$3.00 projected earlier.JWN is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but the stock does carry “A” grades in each of our Style Score categories, including the overall weighted average VGM category. 2.       The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report)Home Depot reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue results before the bell on Tuesday, adding more support to the idea that it is one of the few retailers safe from the dangers of Amazon and providing more evidence that the housing market is relatively sound right now.The company posted fiscal second-quarter earnings of $2.25 per share, which was up more than 14.2% from the year-ago quarter and comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.21. Net sales grew 6.2% to $28.1 billion, while comparable-store sales were up about 6.3% year-over-year.Thanks to its impressive performance in the first half of the year, Home Depot now expects sales growth of 5.3% and comps growth of 5.5% for the full fiscal year. The company also raised its full-year earnings outlook to $7.29 per share from $7.15 per share.Interestingly, Home Depot’s beat and raise was not met with immediate excitement from investors, and shares were actually down more than 3% through early afternoon trading Tuesday. However, Home Depot’s report contained plenty of strength, so it will be interesting to see if the stock rebounds soon. Currently, HD is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). 3.       Aaron’s, Inc. (AAN  -  Free Report)Despite a tough retail environment, Aaron’s was able to post its fifth-straight earnings beat in the most recent quarter. Indeed, earnings of 68 cents per share surpassed our Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents by a cool 17%.Revenues of $815.6 million were up about 3.3% year-over-year and above our consensus estimate of $790 million, perhaps adding to the theory that the company’s rent-to-own model could be helping it stick out right now. However, comparable store sales are continuing to slump, which is a familiar story in the retail industry.Nevertheless, share of Aaron’s received a nice lift from the report. The company released its earnings details before the market opened on July 28, and the stock closed more than 17% higher that day. Aaron’s also recently announced that it was purchasing its largest franchisee, a move that investors clearly feel is coming from a position of strength.In fact, Aaron’s shares are up over 41% year-to-date, making it one of the best performing stocks in the retail sector this year. AAN currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an overall VGM grade of “B.” Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3481,HD,"The super-powerful but slow-moving Hurricane Irma has so far claimed at least 8 lives in the Caribbean, and has not lost steam from its Category 5 status and one of the strongest storms to ever affect the Atlantic Ocean. Puerto Rico has not taken a direct hit but has been blacked out due to rain and winds; this morning Irma has the Dominican Republic and Haiti in its sights. The storm is not expected to make landfall in Florida until this weekend, most likely Sunday.There is still a chance the hurricane will change direction and head back out to sea, but for now precautions are being taken, and rightly so: those who have not left their homes to escape the storm have cleaned out Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) of supplies to combat the storm’s potential damage, and supermarkets and convenience stores are selling out of consumables, most notably drinking water. In breaking news, Miami Beach is now under mandatory evacuation as of this morning.Hurricane Irma may well surpass Hurricane Harvey — which hit the Southeastern Texas coast not two weeks ago — as the most expensive storm in U.S. history. Oil refineries shutting and chemical plants experiencing fires are just a couple of the most immediate affects; soon we will find out what the payout will be from insurance companies such as Travelers (TRV  -  Free Report).Jobless Claims Surge in Harvey’s AftermathThe impact of Harvey continues to be at crisis levels, and we even see it affecting Initial Jobless Claims, which have spiked to 298K last week, a surge of 62K from the previous week’s 236K. The latter figure is quite representative of the last year or so’s very modest claims totals, which mostly stayed between a healthy 225K-250K each week. The four-week moving average is now a smudge above 250K based on this latest read’s big jump — the largest since Hurricane Sandy hit New York City and its surrounding area nearly 5 years ago.Continuing claims have not yet been affected by the storm: 1.94 million claims actually dropped by 5000 for the week. We expect this figure to ratchet up accordingly as joblessness continues to affect the regions of both Southeastern Texas and Florida coasts, should Hurricane Irma strike the area in and around Miami.ECB Keeps Policy Unchanged“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” A most American phrase that might well be applied to European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi when he announced today he would keep interest rates unchanged and current quantitative easing (QE) program in place. The Eurozone has seen strides in economic improvement since the ECB has followed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (since rescinded) approach of slashed interest rates and bond buybacks. Draghi’s decision to keep marginal lending at 0.25% and EUR 60 billion in buybacks per month through the end of 2017, as expected.In his address today, Draghi said there is “still a need for substantial accommodation” and that currency volatility is a source of uncertainty. The ECB President also said low interest rates would remain past the bond-buying QE program.The euro monetary unit is up 1% versus the U.S. dollar in the pre-market following Draghi’s statement.

3483,HD,"High profile U.S. retailers continue to report Q2 results in this final leg of earnings season: specialty retailers Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Coach  and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS  -  Free Report) all posted July quarter numbers ahead of today’s opening bell. Retail Sales for last month also hit the tape. Finally, more CEOs have resigned President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council this morning, following Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO Ken Frazier’s departure yesterday in the wake of Trump’s initial response to the white supremacist rally over the weekend that claimed one life and several injuries.July Retail Sales came in hotter than expected this morning, rising 0.6% from the 0.3% expected. Perhaps even more telling, June’s revision swung from a disappointing negative to a decent positive: from -0.2% in the initial read to a revision of 0.3% this morning. Behind the headlines, ex-autos and ex-autos & gas were a strong 0.5%, with the control number 0.6%. These indicate real retail sales growth and not a one-time anomaly making its way into the headline number.These figures also satisfy those economists who’ve been scratching their heads of late, trying to figure out how a robust labor market, surging consumer confidence and other growth metrics all pointing higher while retail sales continued to lag. Now growth of more than a full percentage point over the past two months look to keep these folks from tearing up their models in despair.Home Depot outperformed expectations this morning, beating on the bottom line by 3 cents to $2.25 per share (up 14.2% year over year) on quarterly sales that reached $28.11 billion, easily outpacing the $27.84 billion in the Zacks consensus (up 6.2% year over year). The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-ranked home improvement giant cranked up guidance in sales (from 4.6% to 5.3%) and earnings (from 11% to 13%). Even still, HD shares are trading down slightly in today’s pre-market — potentially a “sell the news” scenario for a company that is up 15% year to date.Specialty handbag retailer Coach beat earnings and sales estimates for its fiscal Q2, but guidance was down and so is the stock in pre-market trading. Earnings of 50 cents per share beat expectations by a penny, on $1.33 billion in revenues which surpassed the $1.15 billion we were looking for. Yet Coach lowered full-year earnings down nearly a dime per share from previous estimates. The company expects the Kate Spade purchase to yield $1.2 billion by the end of the fiscal year.And Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated Dick’s Sporting Goods is selling off “big league” this morning following its Q2 earnings release. Bottom line was worse than expected by 4 cents from $1.00 per share expected, while sales were a smudge under the $2.17 billion in the Zacks consensus. Guidance for both sales and earnings in the full year have also been ratcheted down, and Dick’s shares are selling off after already having tumbled more than 30% this year.CEOs from both Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and UnderArmour  have given up their seats on President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council early today. Intel’s Brian Krzanich and UA’s Kevin Plank both cited tacit support from the White House toward separatists who rallied and attacked protestors in Charlottesville, VA on Saturday as the reason for their forfeiting their posts.President Trump has since stated publicly that “racism is evil, including the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists.” It is unclear if these corporate leaders will attempt to be replaced. To this point, the President has not yet tweeted anything disparaging about either CEO.

3484,HD,"The Dow finished at an all time high on Monday buoyed by the rally in shares of Goldman Sachs, Home Depot and Boeing. However, the technology sector slumped due to familiar overvaluation concerns, pulling the Nasdaq and S&P 500 to end in the negative territory. Although seven out of eleven major sectors of the S&P ended in the green, led by financials, a selling in major tech stocks such as Facebook and Google owner Alphabet negated such gains.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) touched an all-time intraday high of 21,929.80, earlier in the session. However, the blue-chip index pulled back to close at 21,891.12, also an all-time high, rising by 0.3% or 60.81 points in the process. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined 0.1%, dwindling 1.80 points to close at 2,470.30. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,348.12, declining by 26.55 points or 0.4%. A total of around 6.3 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.0 billion shares. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,495 to 1,017. On the Nasdaq, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 1,278 to 971.Boeing Lifts Dow to Fresh Record The Dow’s stellar showing was powered by excellent earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report). A rally in the shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) also helped Dow’s excellent performance. Moreover, low sovereign bond yields along with these results have essentially helped the Dow notch a record high on Monday.Technology Stocks Suffer, Drag S&P 500 and Nasdaq LowerOngoing tech overvaluation concerns led the investors to indulge in portfolio reshuffling toward the end of the month. A sell off in stocks of tech giants dragged the Nasdaq lower. During the session, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 1.2%, 3.2% and 1.3% respectively. Apple Inc is due to report on Tuesday and investors are hopeful of a good show from Apple.  The analysts expect Apple to control much of the tech sector over the coming week.Upbeat earnings from Chevron CVX and the growth in housing market boosted energy and bank shares. Broad based gains for the S&P 500 came from what has been an amazing earnings season all around. Further, there was a hike in oil prices as a result of production-curb commitments from OPEC and Saudi Arabia’s decision to curtail oil export to the States. However, the S&P 500 declined 1.8% to finish at 2,470.30. This fall was a result of the slump in tech stocks.Materials also contributed to the decline in S&P 500. The Materials Select Sector SPDR declined 0.8%. Seven of the eleven sectors of the S&P 500 were high, with the financial sector turning up in good numbers. The Financials Select SPDR was up 0.6%. However, this was negated by the losses incurred in the technology sector which turned out to be one of the worst performers. The Technology Select SPDR was down 0.5%.White House Drama Keeps Markets on the EdgeThe latest White House upheaval was marked by Anthony Scaramucci’s resignation from the post of White House communications director. Scaramcci stepped down just ten days after being nominated to the post. Moreover, the Trump administration’s failure to push through a bill to repeal the Obamacare has hurt the investor sentiment. Market watchers are increasingly losing faith in the promises made by President Trump in the run up to presidential elections. Trump's failure to keep his campaign trail promises has made investors doubtful about his ability to further his wider pro-growth agenda.Economic DataThe National Association of Realtors announced that its Pending Home Sales Index, increased 1.5% in June based on contracts signed last month. This was more than what the economists’ expectation of a 0.7% increase. For the record, the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index declined to 58.9 in July from 65.7 in June.Monthly RoundupFor the month, the Dow increased 2.5% and the S&P 500 rose 1.9% whereas the Nasdaq increased 3.4%. The Dow’s great run has been supported by excellent earnings for the month. Leading companies which posted better-than-expected earnings include the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report), McDonalds MCD, Boeing, Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), Facebook and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).However, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 lost out on some of the gains made earlier in the month. The tech rally initially gained on strong tech earnings expectations which were expected to justify high valuations of the tech stocks.  Gradually, investors took profits off the table by selling off tech stocks and this weighed on the broader markets, curbing gains for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.Also, Trump administration’s inability to repeal Obamacare hurt investor sentiment. Market watchers lost their faith in Trump’s ability to bring about tax reforms and increasing spending on infrastructural growth among other items on his pro-growth agenda. Moreover, the Fed’s call to leave rates unchanged aided rate-sensitive industries and helped in broad based gains. Pegged at 1.4%, inflation still remains well below the targeted 2.0%, hurting investor sentiment.Stocks That Made Headlines:Discovery Lags Q2 Earnings, To Buy Scripps NetworksSilver Spring, MD-based Discovery Communications, Inc.

3486,HD,"The Dow enjoyed a strong week of gains, riding on stellar earnings results. The index declined on Monday due to a spike in bond yields, which dimmed the attraction of such safe haven stocks as telecom and utilities. But the index closed in the green on each successive day, closing Thursday at a record level. The Fed’s decision to refrain from raising rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting also lifted investor sentiment.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow lost 0.2% last Friday after General Electric Company GE posted a decline in second-quarter earnings and revenues.

Such expectations of an increase in production level amid oversupply concerns dragged oil prices lower.The index declined 0.3% over last week.

3487,HD,"The Q1 earnings season has reached the tail end for all sectors save retail, which has seen about half of its total releases. Total earnings for the sector reported so far are down 1.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% revenue growth with 73.9% beating EPS estimates and 78.3% beating revenue estimates.While the growth pace is well below the four-quarter average, revenue and earnings surprises are much better than recent quarters. This is especially true as woes for departmental stores continued given the shift toward digital shopping.  Though departmental stores - Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) and Kohl’s (KSS  -  Free Report) - topped our revenue and earnings estimate, they reported a drop in same-store sales, sparking off concerns on the prospect of their turnaround before the crucial holiday season. As a result, Macy’s dropped 10.2% following the earnings announcement on August 10, marking their biggest daily loss since January 5 while Kohl's shares had its worst day since January 8 falling 5.8%. Another department store chain Dillard's (DDS  -  Free Report) also tanked 15.9% on August 10 after it missed on both fronts (read: 3 ETFs & Stocks to Buy Post June Retail Sales).J. C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) shed as much as nearly 17% at the close on August 11 to reach an all-time low of $3.77 following dismal second-quarter results.All these results continued to weigh on the broad retail sector, suggesting more pain ahead for the retailers. In fact, retail ETFs - SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Retail Fund (PMR  -  Free Report) – shed 3.5%, 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively, over the past five trading days.Given that earnings are the most important drivers of stock performance, it is necessary to look at the expected surprise of big-box retailers that are likely to report this week. These also have the potential to push the related ETFs upward or downward (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).A Peek into Earnings SurprisesReports from Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Staples , Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) will be crucial for the sector this week.According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP has chances of an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot is slated to report earnings before the bell on August 15. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +0.45%, indicating higher chances of beating estimates this quarter.

On the contrary, the broader Retail-Wholesale sector, which is currently placed at the bottom 13% of the Zacks classified sectors (14 out of 16), gained 9.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Estimates TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second quarter has moved down by a penny to 37 cents in the last seven days. This reflects a year-over-year decline of over 43% from 66 cents. Also, the same was revised downward by 2 cents to $1.39 for fiscal 2018.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $867.5 million, down 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Zacks Model Shows Unlikely Earnings BeatOur proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Urban Outfitters this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Urban Outfitters, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Urban Outfitters, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Urban Outfitters, Inc. QuoteUrban Outfitters has an Earnings ESP of -2.70%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 36 cents is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents. Moreover, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Note we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayChallenging retail landscape, aggressive pricing strategy, waning mall traffic and increased online competition are the major deterrents for Urban Outfitters. Investors’ sentiments were hurt when the company in a SEC filing unveiled that the comparable sales for the fiscal second quarter are deteriorating. Also, management anticipates gross margin rate to decrease year over year in the quarter due to rise in delivery and logistic expenses, higher markdowns and lower initial mark up. In fact, its gross margin has shown constant deceleration in the last three quarters.Further, Urban Outfitters’ sales have lagged the consensus mark for seven of the nine consecutive quarters, including the last reported quarter. Moreover, the company faces stiff competition in the retail segment from other department stores, discounters, home furnishing stores, specialty retailers and direct-to-consumer businesses on attributes such as merchandise assortment, price, quality, location and credit facility.Nevertheless, we expect the company to drive growth on the back of new store openings, increase in direct penetration, growing wholesale operations, technology advancements and merchandising improvements. Going forward, we believe that better product execution and effective inventory management may help augment its performance.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Gap, Inc.

3490,HD,"(0:15) - Sears Downfall: What Happened?(1:00) - Company Background: Consumer Bible, Online Retail and Mergers(4:00) - Is The Economy To Blame?(6:10) - Amazon Partners With Sears: Is There Still Hope?Podcast@zacks.comOn this week’s episode of Shopping for Stocks, Editor Maddy Johnson dives into Sears Holdings , and looks into how the retailer, once America’s largest, fell so far from its former glory.Launched in 1893, Sears’ beginnings were humble. The company began as a catalog for watches and jewelry under the name Sears, Roebuck, & Co., but quickly grew into a retail empire that became consumers’ go-to store.Its retail locations, constructed in the 1920s, began outselling its famous catalog by 1931, and Sears exploded, growing and expanding into numerous markets.From constructing the famous Sears Tower (now the Willis Tower) in Chicago to buying a securities and real estate firms in the 1980s, Sears began to stray from its core retail business, allowing its top competitors like Macy’s (M  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) to invade to invade its market.But Sears kept on going, creating a popular online store and merging with Kmart in 2005. During this time, though, Walmart had dethroned Sears to become the biggest retailer in the company, while Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) was just beginning to branch out from selling books (and we know now Amazon’s true retail goal).Sears was losing ground, and losing ground fast. Hit hard by the financial crisis—something the company was never able to recover from—Sears then split itself into several different business units, a decision that caused internal tension, anger, and bitterness.It’s easy to say that Walmart and Amazon killed Sears, but the retailer itself did a nice job of contributed to its own slow demise. And when you look at its history, a not-so shocking one.As a reminder, if you feel that something was missed, or if you want a different topic covered, send an email to podcast@zacks.com.

Earnings results guided the Dow’s fortunes over the next two trading days of the week. However, it was a deal between two retailing majors which led to losses for a key component, and hence for the index itself on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row last Friday. The 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year, increasing by 0.4% as tech stocks gained. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all posted better-than-expected earnings results.But shares of these banking-behemoths fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic reports on retail sales and inflation, which led market participants to believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The index gained 1% last week even as all major benchmarks posted solid gains. The indexes overcame a series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.The Dow This WeekThe index declined a meager 0.04% on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week. Investors geared up for key quarterly earnings results of major players that were slated for release during this week.The index declined 0.3% on Tuesday weighed down by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

However, earnings witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback.

COST co-brand portfolio.The company reaffirmed its earlier EPS guidance of $5.60–$5.80 for 2017.

3493,HD,"The Home Depot, Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 15. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this home improvement retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has a spectacular positive earnings surprise record of over four years now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise   Home Depot, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Home Depot, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $2.21, reflecting year-over-year growth of over 12%. We noted that our earnings estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $27.8 billion, up about 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayHome Depot’s splendid past performance reflects its focus on solid strategic initiatives. The company remains keen on building its interconnected capabilities, in response to the evolving retail environment – where digital and physical stores go hand in hand. In this direction, the company has made great strides in the past, by redesigning its website with enhanced features. Further, Home Depot’s interconnected strategy goes beyond the dot.com as it continues to invest in fulfillment options to meet customers demand through launches like customer order management system (COM) and the Buy Online Deliver From Store (BODFS) capability. Well, Home Depot continues to reap benefits from these initiatives, as evident from online sales growth of nearly 23% in first-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, we believe that these efforts are likely to drive the company’s top and bottom lines in future. Apart from this, Home Depot is also gaining from housing market recovery and favorable customer demand.All these factors, which had encouraged management to raise its earnings view for fiscal 2017, also usher in confidence about the company’s upcoming release. However, intense competition remains a threat. Also, significant exposure to international markets makes Home Depot vulnerable to currency headwinds. Nonetheless, we note that shares of Home Depot have gained about 2.5% over the last six trading sessions, which clearly underscores investors’ positive sentiment in the company. Moreover, Home Depot’s shares have jumped 14.3% so far this year outperforming the industry’s 11.3% growth. Well, it looks like Home Depot is most likely to maintain its robust trend this time too.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Home Depot is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Home Depot currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both, the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.21. The combination of Home Depot’s Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.93% and a Zacks Rank #2.

3495,HD,"U.S. retail and food services sales in June declined 0.2%, following a revised reading of 0.1% decrease registered in May, as people curtailed their spending on clothes and spent less at gasoline stations, department stores and restaurants. This suggests that consumer spending, which plays a pivotal role in driving the economy, may have lost momentum.As per the Commerce Department report, sales at clothing & clothing accessories stores declined 0.1%, while receipts at gasoline stations fell 1.3%. Sales at food & beverage stores dropped 0.4%. Department store sales decreased 0.7% and were down 3.9% from the prior-year period. Sales at non-store retailers, however, inched up 0.4% in June and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.Certainly, the second straight month of slump in retail sales overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration. This also cast a doubt over the expected rebound in the economy, which at one end witnessed a rise in interest rate and U.S. factory activity in June, while on the other end saw oil prices lose ground and encountered political gridlock.If the downward spiral in retail sales has put you in a spot of bother, we advise you to dismiss concerns about its impact on your portfolio and locate greener pastures.Where to Look for the Right Stocks?Although the Retail-Wholesale sector has not been a spectacular performer, it still holds promise, given some favorable economic indicators. Moreover, friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration also bode well. The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode.The economy added 222,000 jobs in June, while the unemployment rate was 4.4%.

We note that the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 9%, the S&P 500 has gained 9.1%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index has surged 16.3% so far in the year.The buoyant market provides an ideal opportunity to boost your portfolio by adding growth stocks. These are generally hot and flourishing stocks with earnings growth potential. Among the 16 Zacks categorized sectors, we are focusing on Retail-Wholesale. The sector has gained 14.3% so far in the year and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 index.The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, improving labor market and gradual recovery in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are favorable for retailers. On the other hand, steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration offer a perfect background to drive consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending that may help revive sales in the current retail landscape that is witnessing a sea change with the focus gradually shifting to online shopping.As a result, retailers are now concentrating more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities. Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report) is one of those retailers who are making extensive investments to upgrade operations with special focus on developing omni-channel and strengthening partnership with vendors.

3497,HD,"DICK’S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 14, before the opening bell. In the previous quarter, the company reported negative earnings surprise of 4%. Notably, , the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.2%.What to Expect?The big question facing investors is whether this sporting goods retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 26 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 45.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.89 billion, reflecting 4.4% growth from the prior-year quarter.Dick's Sporting Goods Inc Price and EPS Surprise Dick's Sporting Goods Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Dick's Sporting Goods Inc QuoteHowever, we note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the past three months. The company’s shares have declined 25.7%, while the industry has dropped 8%.Factors at PlayDick's Sporting has been reeling under major sports industry woes of late, mostly related to increased competition and heightened promotional activities. The company is trying all means to boost omni-channel presence to counter the competition from Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). In fact, it recently re-launched its website to improve customer experience. While these endeavors bode well for the long term, costs associated with these investments remain a deterrent for the company’s margin. Further, margins are bearing the brunt of intense promotional activities undertaken by the company to thrive amid the mounting competition.Additionally, the company is battling a soft hunting business, where comparable-store sales (comps) declined double-digits in the preceding quarter. Further, management expects the hunting business to witness tough times in the remainder of fiscal 2017. Despite its strong efforts to capture displaced market share from liquidation of rival firms, the company anticipates the hunting category to remain drab.Not only this, management anticipates all aforementioned barriers to persist in fiscal 2017, which compelled it to curtail fiscal 2017 earnings per share and comps forecasts.While DICK’s Sporting remains committed toward its merchandise plan and strategies of boosting digital operations and exploiting industry consolidation, these plans may take a while to offset the prevailing glitches.Given the near-term hurdles, we remain a little skeptical of the outcome in the to-be reported quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that DICK’S Sporting is likely to beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.DICK’S Sporting has an Earnings ESP of -2.86% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the chances of delivering surprise. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.40% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.27% and a Zacks Rank #2.Signet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +69.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>
