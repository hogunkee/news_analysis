4,NTAP,"Just as it stepped on the accelerator in the race to develop artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, Zenuity hit a traffic jam of sorts.XThe data-storage technology used by the joint venture to make autonomous vehicles couldn't pump out visual data fast enough to let its new Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processors work at anything approaching top speed.Enter Pure Storage (PSTG) and its FlashBlade technology. As one of 10 vendors brought in to clear the bottleneck, Pure Storage left the competition in the dust and a partnership was born, according to the website Next Platform.""The partnership with Nvidia started in the field, which I think is generally, at least in my experience, where the best partnerships begin,"" Pure Storage President David Hatfield said on a recent company earnings call.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePure Storage is still a relatively small player in a slow-growing industry. Yet it's competing in fast-growing areas and taking market share from legacy providers.Its relationship with Nvidia serves as a prime example. Joint marketing activities between Pure Storage and Nvidia have been ongoing for several quarters. The wins have been piling up, helping push Pure Storage to profitability in the latest quarter. Following its first product launch in 2012 and initial public offering in 2015, Pure Storage eclipsed $1 billion in annual revenue for fiscal 2018.On March 27, Pure Storage announced its AI-Ready Infrastructure, which combines its FlashBlade and Nvidia's DGX-1 high-performance workstation as a fully integrated hardware and software system. The aim is to enable scientists to jump-start their artificial intelligence initiatives ""in hours, not weeks or months.""Pure Storage and Nvidia share other traits. Both stocks broke out of consolidations into buy zones on May 7. Nvidia cleared a double-bottom base ahead of its earnings report. Pure Storage broke above a cup-with-handle pattern.Pure Storage shares climbed more than 2% Wednesday morning and were near 23.50. Nvidia was up 1% near 248.10.IBD'S TAKE: Pure Storage cleared a 21.43 buy point on Monday, May 7. A buy point is the point at which a stock has the greatest likelihood of further near-term gains, especially when the stock is a leader in a leading industry group. Pure Storage qualifies as the No. 3 stock, according to IBD Stock Checkup, in the Computer-Data Storage industry group that's ranked No. 7 of 197 groups based on price performance and momentum. Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a recent note to clients, initiating coverage on Pure Storage, that FlashBlade accounted for roughly $80 million, or 10%, of product sales in the past year.Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski expects FlashBlade to emerge as Pure Storage's top revenue producer ""over the next 2-3 years, as more Big Data and Artificial Intelligence workloads are deployed.""In a recent note to clients, Nowinski said the unstructured data that dominates artificial intelligence historically is stored on disk-based, networked devices from the likes of NetApp (NTAP) and Dell Technologies (DVMT). He says they ""cannot meet the performance requirements of next-generation analytics.""Nowinski sees Pure Storage's system that relies on flash memory rather than spinning hard-disk drives, as ""uniquely positioned to capture market share in this segment.""FlashBlade's debut in the second half of 2016 opened a new market for Pure Storage. It also gave the company a full portfolio to serve the data-storage needs of enterprise customers.Supporting all of a customer's workloads has helped Pure Storage move upmarket. It sells to cloud-service providers and has gained more Fortune 500 customers looking to consolidate storage vendors used in their data centers, Nowinski says.About 50% of FlashBlade customers were already Pure Storage customers, he notes. The company said it signed up about 500 new customers in the latest quarter. That raised the total to more than 4,500 organizations.The company puts its total addressable market opportunity at $35 billion. Meanwhile, the market for external storage systems stands at $23 billion a year and dropped slightly in 2017, William Blair analyst Jason Ader said. He expects it to be flat over the next several years. Yet the areas that Pure Storage plays in grew 35% last year, he says.Tech research firm IDC expects all-flash arrays to comprise 44% of external storage sales by 2021. That's up from the current figure of 28%. Scribner thinks that projection could prove conservative.""Current infrastructures are based on old, slow, scale-out architectures which demand many data copies and silos, fragmenting the potential of data and increasing its cost and complexity,"" Pure Storage Chief Executive Charles Giancarlo said on a recent earnings call.Giancarlo came aboard as CEO last August, having previously served as chief technology officer at Cisco Systems (CSCO). Cisco is a key partner for Pure Storage and seen as a potential acquirer. Pure Storage markets its FlashArray and FlashBlade storage system with Cisco networking gear in an optimized package called FlashStack.Ader adds that roughly 30% of Pure's revenue in the latest quarter came from public cloud customers, such as software-as-a-service providers Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW).""Management has noted that this vertical has been growing faster than the overall business and that it now has over 500 cloud customers to date,"" he wrote.But getting business from the big public cloud providers such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is considered out of reach.Still, Pure Storage said last August that FlashStack was seeing triple-digit growth. It reported thousands of deployments in more than 30 countries.The company is widely credited as being the technology leader in its field. Industry research firm Gartner placed Pure Storage as being furthest along on its ""completeness of vision"" axis for solid state arrays.Ader says Pure Storage designed its software and systems architecture from the ground up to take advantage of flash media. In contrast, rivals for the most part designed their products for hard disk ""and only later retrofitted for flash.""The market appears to be recognizing that leadership as evidenced in customer win rates. Those are ""ticking up quarter-by-quarter,"" Giancarlo says. Further, Ader notes, Pure Storage was able to carve out 66.4% product gross margins in calendar 2017 vs. 50.2% for NetApp.With so much going for it, what could slow Pure Storage's momentum?""The biggest risk is the competition,"" Ader told Investor's Business Daily.Dell EMC has acknowledged its market-share struggles in storage and pledged to spend $2 billion to turn it around. Dell last week unveiled new storage products aimed at negating Pure Storage's technology lead.But Piper Jaffray's Nowinski wasn't impressed. He compared Dell's updated product line with that of what he considers the more up-to-date Pure Storage.His assessment: It ""did very little to narrow the gap.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Pure Storage, 58.com Are Breakouts; These 3 Top Stocks Are In Same Bullish PatternCloud Software Stock Splunk Breaks Out Of Base Ahead Of Quarterly ResultsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

40,NTAP,"The Nasdaq composite and Russell 2000 turned in solid performances Thursday, with gains of 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. The IBD 50 fared even better, as nearly half the names in the index of leading growth stocks rose 2% or more.The strength in the broad market was mostly due to another round of strong earnings reports. Meanwhile, House Republicans passed a tax reform bill that's now in a divided Senate's hands.XThe Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 added 0.8% each. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE coming in lower than Wednesday's levels. Nasdaq volume edged higher.In the stock market today, earnings winners were a dime a dozen as results from Cisco Systems (CSCO), NetApp (NTAP), NetEase (NTES) and Wal-Mart (WMT) impressed.Cisco Systems jumped 5% to 35.88. Headed into earnings, Cisco's daily chart showed a cup-with-handle base with a 34.20 buy point and an alternate handle entry of 34.85.NetApp soared 16% to 53.11. Similar to Cisco, it was floating near a buy point ahead of earnings.NetEase rose 8% to 326.24. It's still in buy range from a 320.77 cup-with-handle buy point. Despite a big move higher in recent years, NetEase's latest breakout was from a first-stage base. That's because the Sept. 28 low of 253.20 undercut the low of a prior base, serving to reset the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that enough sellers have been shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more gains.Wal-Mart jumped 11% to 99.62 as Wall Street cheered a strong report and solid guidance. Wal-Mart's outlook for the current quarter was a lot different than Target's on Wednesday, when the latter warned of a ""highly competitive holiday quarter.""RH Inc. (RH), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, vaulted 26% to 104.81 after the company reported strong preliminary third-quarter results and gave bullish sales guidance for 2018. Shares of RH have been on the move ever since CEO Gary Friedman announced a strategy shift to a membership model and fewer promotions.Meanwhile, a couple of deals made headlines. Time Inc. (TIME) soared 28% on news it's considering a sale to fellow publisher Meredith (MDP). It's not the first time the two companies have talked. Separately, Emerson Electric (EMR) raised its bid for Rockwell Automation (ROK) to 225 a share, up from a prior bid that valued Rockwell at 215. Shares of Rockwell jumped nearly 3% to 193.61.RELATED:House Passes GOP Tax Plan, But Senate Bill In Doubt As Three Republicans Take A Stand Tesla's Electric Truck Arrives Amid 'Production Hell,' Hot Competition

41,NTAP,"Stocks opened sharply higher Thursday, despite some disappointing early economic data, as House Republican leaders in Washington readied their version of a closely watched tax reform bill for a vote before the end of the day.XThe Dow Jones industrial average opened up 0.6% and the S&P 500 leapt up 0.5%, as Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Wal-Mart (WMT) surged following their quarterly reports. The Nasdaq Composite vaulted 0.7% higher, aided by Cisco, as well as a big jump from NetApp (NTAP).The U.S. House of Representatives is largely expected to pass its tax reform package in a vote today, while the Senate Finance Committee is working to present its own offering this week, aiming for a full-Senate vote after the Thanksgiving holiday. The two different proposals must then be reconciled into a single piece of legislation. Earnings news drove the Dow's early action, with Cisco Systems throttling up 6% on fiscal first-quarter earnings that met or narrowly topped analysts' targets. It was the networking gear maker's first revenue increase in eight quarters, and included a second-quarter earnings forecast that was just above expectations. The gain left shares extended, beyond a buy range above a 34.20 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Wal-Mart racked up a 6% premarket advance, looking to take back ground lost in a 1% slip Wednesday. The retail giant reported third-quarter sales and profit growth ahead of forecasts, with comparable sales and traffic also better than expected, and offered a fourth-quarter earnings outlook that topped consensus views. The stock is also extended, after clearing a flat base in mid-October.Another retailer, RH (RH), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, gapped up 18% at the open. The Corte Madera, Calif.-based company significantly boosted earnings guidance for its upcoming third-quarter report. It also hoisted revenue guidance above consensus views.RH shares have climbed more than 300% since February, and are extended after clearing a buy point in early October.Data storage gear maker NetApp swept up 16% to easily lead the Nasdaq 100 list. BMO Capital raised the stock to outperform, from market perform early Thursday, after NetApp's fiscal second-quarter report late Wednesday easily surpassed expectations. Management boosted its third-quarter earnings guidance above consensus forecasts, and lifted its prediction for revenue to the high end of the expected range.NetApp shares are now extended above a 45.24 buy point in a first-stage, cup-with-handle base.Apple (AAPL) climbed 0.9% early action, looking to turn around a five-day decline.Tesla (TSLA) jumped 1.1%, ahead of this evening's scheduled introduction of the tech leader's automated tractor-trailer-style truck. The stock is trading below its 10- and 40-week moving averages, as it forms a possible new base.Helmerich & Payne (HP), a leading manufacturer of land-based drilling rigs, tacked on a 3% gain after reporting its third-quarter results. Shares dropped 8% through Wednesday, as oil prices eased from a recent rally, but the stock is still up 27% from a September low.First time unemployment claims ticked up, to 249,000, in the week ended Nov. 11, according to Labor Department estimates. Up from 239,000 in the prior week, the number surprised economists who had called for a further decrease, to 236,000 new claims.The Labor Department also said the price of imported goods rose 0.2%, while prices earned by exports remained flat in October. Import prices had gained 0.8% in September, whereas export prices jumped 0.7%. Economists had projected a 0.4% rise in the price of imports, a 0.1% rise in exports.The Philly Fed Index showed mid-Atlantic-region manufacturing  growth slowed sharply in November, sending the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey to an 18.9 reading for the month. That was down from 27.9 in October, a much further decline than the dip to 25 forecast by economists. New orders rose during the month, while shipments and employment eased from recent highs.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Fall Again, Leaders Firm AS Market Awaits Tax ReformThe GOP Just Bet It All On A 20% Corporate Tax RateWill Tesla Really Blow Our Minds?

50,NTAP,"The S&P 500 index was slightly lower for the week even as Dow components Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) skyrocketed on strong earnings and hopes that the titans will continue to transition into faster-growth markets. The Dow's General Electric (GE) tumbled as Wall Street isn't sold on its turnaround plan. Tesla (TSLA) unveiled new future vehicles even as it struggles to get the Model 3 out the door and General Motors (GM) ramps up its electric car goals. Chinese internet leaders Tencent (TCEHY), JD.com (JD), YY (YY) and NetEase (NTES) all had strong earnings reports.The S&P 500 index fell 0.1% for the week while the Dow lost 0.3%. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.5% after hitting an all-time high Thursday. Wal-Mart, Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Applied Materials (AMAT) and several Chinese internets helped, along with some up-and-down movement on tax cuts. General Electric was a disappointment.Wal-Mart per-share earnings unexpectedly rose 2% to $1 a share on 4% sales growth to $123.18 billion, including e-commerce growth of 50%. Investors were pleased, sending shares up 10.9% on Thursday to a record high. On Wednesday, Target (TGT) offered up weak guidance for the ""highly competitive"" holiday quarter. The discounter did top Q3 forecasts with a 12.5% EPS fall to 91 cents and 1.4% sales rise to $16.67 billion. Shares tumbled below their 200-day line on Wednesday but regained that key level by the end of the week.New General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery offered up a plan to turn around the troubled industrial giant, but Wall Street found GE's strategic vision held little that was new or bold. GE will reduce its footprint to just three key divisions — aviation, power and health care. Flannery also halved the profit outlook for 2018 and GE's rich dividends. Investors sent GE shares to a nearly six-year low.Cisco Systems (CSCO) surged to a 17-year high after the computer networking giant said it expects December-quarter revenue to rise 1%-3%, the first year-over-year gain in nearly two years.

Analysts were modeling for EPS of $2.03 on sales of $14.36 billion.Semiconductor-equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) beat fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings targets and guided higher for the current quarter. Its stock climbed to a record high on the news, finally eclipsing its previous record reached in April 2000 during the dot-com bubble.

Also, semiconductor-equipment firm Lam Research (LRCX) got a boost after announcing a $2.3 billion capital return program.Biotechs were relatively beat up last week with a few key exceptions.

Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September. The overall 0.2% gain edged past expectations, but came in on the weak side outside of autos with a 0.1% rise.Emirates announced an order for 40 Boeing (BA) 787-10s, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices, instead of the expected Airbus (EADSY) A380 order.

But the struggling retailer said earnings per share next year could fall by as much as 20%, citing flat same-store sales and plans to spend money on e-commerce, private brands and other investments.

For most stocks, early-stage bases carry higher odds of success after a breakout occurs.Cisco is reaching price levels not seen since 2001 after reporting fiscal second-quarter results, positive guidance and new switches for the data center.Cisco, the best growth stock in the 1990s, is likely seen today as a solid income play. Its annualized dividend yield of 3.4% is based on a quarterly cash payout of 29 cents a share and smokes the 1.9% yield of the S&P 500.The question for growth-stock hunters will be whether Cisco can achieve a reacceleration in top- and bottom-line growth that has been exhibited by fellow megacap Apple.Cisco reported flat earnings at 61 cents a share, but it does represent acceleration from a 3% dip in the July-ended fiscal fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 2% to $12.14 billion, extending a streak of shrinking sales to seven quarters.Cisco currently receives relatively low ratings from IBD Stock Checkup, including a 68 for Composite Rating and a 53 for Relative Price Strength. That's typical for a large-cap stock that forms long bases that last up to 12 months or more, and are trying to stage a fundamental turnaround.In contrast, Apple has achieved acceleration in the top line for four straight quarters, going from a 9% drop in sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to gains of 3%, 5%, 7% and 12% in the past four periods.Earnings per share, in turn, have lifted from a 15% dive to increases of 2%, 11%, 18% and 24% for the iPhone marketer. Apple now sports high ratings compared with the start of the year; the Composite Rating, which combines IBD's proprietary ratings with recent stock price action, has jumped to a solid 91 on a scale of 1 to 99.The Street sees Apple's profit for the fiscal year ending next September to accelerate, rising 24% to $11.44 a share; in fiscal 2017, profit rose 11% to $9.21 a share despite some reports on concerns regarding the speed of ramping up production of new iPhones.Apple is now slightly extended after recently clearing a new cup with handle at 160.97. The 5% buy zone goes up to 169.02.Apple is also up 45% after breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. That breakout was covered extensively in IBD's Stock Market Today columns.Other companies within the Dow Jones industrial average that have become excellent turnarounds over the past 12 months include Caterpillar (CAT) and money center play Bank of America (BAC).Cat initially cleared a bottoming base pattern at 80.99 in the week ended July 15, 2016, moved up at a slow yet steady pace, then broke out again in big turnover during the week ended April 28 this year, this time clearing a well-formed flat base pattern at 99.56. Shares have since ramped up 37% from that recent entry.Bank of America is trying to extend gains from a recent breakout from a second-stage saucer with handle at 25.45, 10 cents above the handle's high of 25.35.Outside the Dow 30 names, steel producers are trying to move higher too after bottoming out in 2016. Global giant Arcelor Mittal (MT), which has now posted six quarters in a row of healthy earnings, is testing support at the 10-week moving average after a recent breakout from a large cup with handle at 27.71.Arcelor has jump-started its revenues as well, boosting the top line 1%, 20%, 17% and 21% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Full-year profit is expected to swing sharply up for a second year in a row, up, 64% to $3.47 a share this year, then cool 11% to $3.09 in 2018.Meanwhile, the IBD 50 is a great place to find small-, mid- and large-cap firms showing double-digit or even triple-digit growth. Cisco rival Arista Networks (ANET) is just one example. The data center-focused maker of networking gear rose another 3% to 232.37, stretching gains from an August breakout from a narrow flat base at 163.07.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Apple Back In Buy Zone, 5 Leaders Thumb Nose At Market DipStocks Near A Buy ZoneWant To Find Great Stocks?

Broadcom rose a fraction early Thursday.Skyworks sank 2.1% to 108.89 on Wednesday after finding support near its 50-day moving average and rebounding from an intraday low of 107.14.

59,NTAP,"If the Trump administration pushes through a tax reform package in 2018 that includes relief on foreign profits brought into the U.S., Goldman Sachs has a new way to look at the biggest potential gainers.Proposed changes on ""repatriated"" overseas cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Oracle (ORCL). Many Wall Street analysts have speculated that cash brought back into the U.S. could be used for stock buybacks or acquisitions.Goldman Sachs in a report focuses on stocks with the highest overseas cash-to-equity cap ratio. The top seven companies, Goldman Sachs says, would be Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Qualcomm (QCOM), Apple, Amgen (AMGN), Oracle and Microsoft.A bit further down would be Western Digital (WDC), Citrix Systems (CTXS), General Electric (GE) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).Goldman Sachs forecasts that U.S. firms would repatriate $250 billion of their overseas cash in 2018, if a tax reform package is approved.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8.

The Nasdaq Composite dumped 0.2%, as Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks all posted moderate losses.Markets stalled Wednesday ahead of the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting, and just after news broke that the Trump administration had abandoned two key business councils manned by blue chip top executives. The decision once again stirred concerns that Washington's commitment to tax cuts and other key elements of the president's agenda would not be soon in coming.The chief executives of Corning (GLW), General Electric (GE), United Technologies (UTX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had decided to leave the council Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported, in response to the President Trump's response to events Saturday in Charlottesville, Va.

65,NTAP,"Nutanix (NTNX) shares were flat Friday following a quarterly earnings report late Thursday that soundly beat the Wall Street consensus, but reeled back from big gains achieved at the outset of trading.XEarly in the day, Nutanix shares were up 10% then reversed. At the close on the stock market today, shares finished at the break-even mark at 22. The company held its initial public offering in September 2016, pricing shares at 16.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi raised his price target on Nutanix to 30 from 27, with a rating of outperform.""We are impressed by the company's continued growth in software bookings,"" Seyrafi wrote in a research note to clients, adding that the company also benefited from many large deals.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Nutanix is involved in an emerging technology field called hyperconvergence infrastructure. It replaces silos of servers, storage and networking gear with a converged system that combines storage, computing and software into one package, based on commodity, lower-cost hardware.After the market close Thursday, Nutanix reported revenue of $226.1 million, up 62% from the year-ago quarter and above Wall Street estimates of $216 million, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended July 31. It reported an adjusted 33-cent loss, beating the consensus view for a 37-cent loss, as polled by Zacks. The company said it added more than 875 customers in the quarter, bringing the total to 7,051.Among the negatives, as seen by analysts, Nutanix is facing increased competition from NetApp (NTAP), Cisco Systems (CSCO) (IBD), VMware (VMW) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). Analysts also noted that Nutanix is having to deal with higher DRAM-chip prices but is maneuvering through that challenge with software enhancements.For the current quarter, Nutanix guided revenue in the range to $240 million to $250 million, an increase in the range of 44% to 50% from the year-ago quarter and above the consensus estimate of $231 million. It also forecast an adjusted loss of 37 cents, matching the consensus estimate.RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Hedberg maintained an outperform rating on Nutanix and price target of 34.""Results were strong, with large deals again at record levels,"" Hedberg wrote in a research note to clients.Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron maintained an outperform rating on Nutanix and price target of 34.""Overall execution continued to improve with sales productivity rebounding, strong North America and international traction, and record large-deal activity,"" Kidron wrote in a research note to clients.RELATED:Pure Storage Zooms; Price Target Raised On Strong Earnings Report

98,NTAP,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) is at a crossroads and should make ""needle-moving"" acquisitions either in data-center infrastructure, software or security, says a William Blair analyst.""We do not believe the old Cisco playbook of numerous tuck-in acquisitions combined with a few larger bets in emerging product areas will work,"" said Jason Ader, a William Blair analyst, in a research report Monday. He maintained an outperform rating on Cisco stock, which inched down 2 cents to 31.30 on the stock market today, close to a buy point of 32.04.If Cisco ""doubles down"" on data-center infrastructure, Ader speculates, it could buy Nutanix (NTNX), Pure Storage (PSTG), Nimble Storage (NMBL) or NetApp (NTAP).If Cisco takes a ""hard pivot"" toward software, it could acquire Splunk (SPLK), Red Hat (RHT) or ServiceNow (NOW), Ader said.Cisco now garners about 5% of revenue from computer security products. It could make a big jump by purchasing Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) or Proofpoint (PFPT), Ader added.""Like its large-cap peers in IT infrastructure, we believe Cisco needs to embark on a fundamental business metamorphosis,"" Ader said in the report.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, Glaukos and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Cisco in January agreed to buy AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, just ahead of that company's planned IPO. AppDynamics provides cloud-based software that measures and analyzes the performance of business critical applications.While Cisco has a partnership with Dell-EMC on networking products,  Ader says it could ""file for a full divorce.""Ader says that Cisco's effort to build a cloud computing rival to Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), hasn't clicked. ""Its much-hyped, $1 billion Intercloud cloud-federation project launched in 2015 is expected to be shuttered shortly — likely another casualty of AWS,"" wrote Ader.The Trump administration has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, which could provide Cisco with more ammunition to make acquisitions, says the William Blair analyst.""We believe the company needs to place needle-moving M&A bets with a clear strategic objective, instead of its current (incremental) approach,"" he wrote.RELATED:How Cisco's AppDynamics Buy Could Impact New Relic, Splunk, IBM, HPE

Jim Suva, a Citigroup analyst, upgraded F5 Networks to buy from neutral and hiked his price target to 175 from 143.""We see F5 Networks, Electronics for Imaging (EFII), NetApp (NTAP) and Benchmark Electronics (BHE) as potential M&A targets,"" said Suva in his research report Wednesday.F5 Networks stock had jumped nearly 47% to 142.40 in 2016 as of Tuesday, well extended from its last buy point of 125.01 touched in July. Shares of F5 Networks have traded well above its 50-day moving average since its last earnings report, in late October.IBD'S TAKE: Both F5 Networks and Akamai belong to IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which is ranked No. 134 out of 197 industry groups.  Gigamon, which had been the group's leader, has dropped out of the IBD 50, where chip maker Nvidia is the top-rated stock.Akamai's stock has climbed 19% in 2016 through Tuesday, despite slowing revenue and EPS growth. The stock has been forming a flat base, with a buy point of 71.14.Akamai closed 2.8% higher at 66.99 in the stock market today. F5 rose 1.2% to end at 144.08.""Akamai has done a good job diversifying into cloud security and we believe that high 30% growth for the product category is achievable over the next couple of years,"" said Horan in his research report.Cambridge, Mass.-based Akamai's CDN (content delivery network) services increase the speed of e-commerce transactions, business software downloads and video streaming to mobile devices.""Akamai  could also be a viable acquisition target for any company looking to create unique/highly secure cloud capabilities, but we do not believe it is for sale,"" Horan wrote.

100,NTAP,"Data management systems giant NetApp (NTAP), amid a tough transition to the cloud, late Wednesday gave current-quarter guidance solidly above Wall Street estimates, sending shares gapping up to a 20-month high.For the current fiscal Q3 ending Jan. 27, the company expects earnings per share minus items of 72-77 cents, where analyst consensus had been just 65 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. It sees revenue of $1.4 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, where analyst consensus had been $1.36 billion.NetApp stock jumped 6.3% in the stock market today to 36.90 and easily popping above a buy point of 36.20 out of a consolidation. Earlier, shares rose as much as 12% to 39, their highest point since February 2015.The company's fiscal Q2 ended Oct. 28 was a mixed bag, however. EPS ex items of 60 cents, down 2% from the year-earlier quarter, easily beat the 54-cent consensus, but sales of $1.34 billion, down 7%, missed by $20 million. It marked the 12th straight quarter of year-over-year sales declines. EPS has fallen in six of the past seven quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That easy to find at IBD's New Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the companies making new highs by Composite Rating. So the best are at the top, making this a quick and easy read to find stocks for your watch list.Drexel Hamilton upgraded its rating on NetApp stock to buy from hold, and at least three investment banks hiked their price targets, RBC and Baird to 40 and BMO to 39. In raising his price target from 36, RBC analyst Amit Daryanini said ""we think NTAP's ability to streamline its cost structure while positioning the company for (year-over-year) growth through mix shift toward strategic marks an encouraging step toward revenue/margin stabilization following volatile financial performance in recent years.""But many analysts remained cautious. William Blair's Jason Ader maintained an underperform rating on NetApp stock, and expects much more competition from Dell Technologies (DVMT), the recently merged Dell-EMC. Flash-storage firm Pure Storage (PSTG), a 2015 IPO, is among its other rivals.""While NetApp is managing expenses well, product gross margin continues to be challenged, and we see significant execution risks ahead as competition intensifies in all-flash storage, cloud-based and hyperconverged alternatives encroach on the traditional storage market, and macro and IT spending environment continue to be constrained,"" Ader wrote in his research report. ""We believe Dell-EMC in particular could be a thorn in NetApp's side in calendar 2017 as the dust settles on their merger and the company goes into attack mode (we believe NetApp is likely benefiting from merger-related disruptions at present.)""Pacific Crest's Alex Kurtz maintained a sector weight rating. He said the decline in NetApp's legacy business might have bottomed out, though, and says prospects will improve if NetApp can maintain its momentum in moving more customers to its flash/cloud clustered ONTAP data management software.NetApp this month announced a 6% workforce reduction, following a large round of layoffs in February, as it tries to convert to the cloud.""Our second-quarter results are evidence of our ability to maintain a high level of execution while streamlining the business and pivoting to the growth areas of the market,"" company CEO George Kurian said in the earnings release. ""Our market-leading innovations in flash, next-generation data centers and hybrid cloud, coupled with a sharp focus on operational discipline, position NetApp to lead in the digital era.""RELATED:NetApp Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Earnings

109,NTAP,"Enterprise data-storage company NetApp (NTAP) reported quarterly earnings after the market close Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines, as did forward-looking estimates, sending the stock up sharply to a nine-month high in heavy volume.NetApp has experienced multiple quarters of year-over-year declines in earnings and revenue as the company undergoes a product transition in a challenging market.NetApp reported revenue of $1.29 billion, down 3% year over year but just above Wall Street estimates of $1.26 billion. In 10 out of the last 11 quarters, NetApp has posted year-over-year revenue declines.Excluding one-time items, NetApp reported earnings per share of 46 cents, topping the consensus of 36 cents, for its fiscal first quarter ended July 29. EPS rose 59%, reversing five quarters in a row of EPS declines. It was the best gain since fiscal Q1 2011.NetApp stock surged 17.4% to 33.88 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: NetApp stock on Thursday broke a nearly 20-month long downtrend, representing a very significant change in character and honing in on a 52-week high of 34.81 set on Oct. 23.

He rates NetApp stock a hold.""This intentional shift in the business mix has been ongoing for many quarters now, but the headwinds from the legacy business appear to be diminishing (somewhat),"" Kugele wrote.Srini Nandury, an analyst at Summit Redstone Partners, maintained a sell rating on NetApp stock, but he expects to re-evaluate that at after an industry conference later this month.Still, Nandury upped his price target on NetApp to 30 from 20 ""to reflect the recent multiple expansion across the tech landscape,"" he wrote.""The storage industry remains in turmoil with pricing pressures, migration of some workloads to cloud, and NetApp-specific product transition issues,"" Nandury wrote. ""We are cautiously optimistic the worst is behind for the company, and we believe NetApp can grow its product revenue from the current levels during fiscal 2017.""In the company's earnings conference call, NetApp CEO George Kurian said the product transition is beginning to change the trajectory of its business.""We are clearly making progress but still have work to do as we operate in a low-growth macroeconomic and IT spending environment,"" he said. ""We are controlling what we can and are increasingly confident in our ability to execute as we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market.""

115,NTAP,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) is likely to make more software- and security-related acquisitions, based on what the computer networking firm said at its Cisco Live customer conference July 10-14, according to a new research report from RBC Capital.""While Cisco did not provide financial updates, comments and partnerships announced (at Cisco Live) suggest that the company is laser focused on expanding its recurring revenue streams and de-emphasizing legacy routing/switching in the future,"" RBC analyst Mitch Steves wrote.""We think Cisco's strategy remains sound, and we believe future M&A and partnerships will continue to focus on software/security transactions,"" Steves said.IBD's TAKE: Cisco stock has traded between 24 and 31 for the past 18 months, but it's one of the most followed tech stocks and ranks third in the IBD Computer-Networking industry group -- facts you can learn at IBD Stock Checkup.Some analysts have speculated Cisco could buy a data storage company such as NetApp (NTAP) to better position itself vs. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE).Cisco Systems stock is up 10% in 2016. Cisco stock ticked up 0.3% to 29.91 at the close on the stock market today.

"
116,NTAP,"Cisco Systems (CSCO) could go shopping for a data storage company with software expertise, as enterprise customers shift toward “converged infrastructure,” says Barclays.While Cisco has a joint venture with EMC (EMC) and alliances with NetApp (NTAP) and startup SimpliVity, the computer networking giant needs to own data storage assets as customers shift to converged data center infrastructure -- including servers -- that run on network management software, the investment bank said.“We believe converged infrastructure could be an area of interest for Cisco to tactically acquire software-defined storage assets,” Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a research report.  “While storage is the glaring hole in Cisco’s portfolio, we think the company will move away from hardware-based assets as it attempts to shift to more software mix and value-added services.”Aside from Cisco, Moskowitz says Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), EMC, VMware (VMW) and Oracle (ORCL) aim to be players in the converged infrastructure market. EMC is in the final stages of  being acquired by privately held Dell.“Hyper-converged infrastructure relies more on software and seems to be ushering in the software defined data center. As such, consolidation may be critical for some of the systems-centric vendors to keep pace with innovation within the software realm,” he wrote.San Jose, Calif.-based Nutanix has been gaining share in converged infrastructure, says the Barclays report. Nutanix might well rekindle plans for an initial public offering, analysts say.Hewlett Packard Enterprise, meanwhile, also is on the prowl for acquisitions, according to analysts.“Converged infrastructure is just a way of packaging IT components to drive efficiencies rather than a radically different concept that unlocks incremental revenue,” said Moskowitz. “We think storage vendors get hurt the most, implying only upstarts or companies not possessing legacy storage like Cisco are best positioned to benefit from this trend.”Cisco stock fell 0.65% to 28.84 in the stock market today. HPE lost 2.7% and EMC dipped 0.1%.

117,NTAP,"Stocks rose sharply for a second session Wednesday as oil prices neared $50 a barrel, bolstering sentiment that the economy is strong enough to withstand higher interest rates.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each climbed 0.7%.

118,NTAP,"Pure Storage (PSTG) received an upbeat review ahead of its first-quarter earnings report next week, with an analyst saying the flash storage market appears to be growing faster than expected.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin said Pure Storage appears to be gaining market share at the expense of legacy storage vendors including IBM (IBM), NetApp (NTAP) and EMC, which Dell is acquiring.“Reseller and partner feedback during March and April suggests demand for flash remains strong, particularly for Pure Storage,” Bracelin wrote in a research note.Pure Storage makes storage products based on flash chips, designed for the business enterprise market. Flash-based storage arrays are much faster than disk-drive storage systems but generally come at a higher price. Flash is seen as the future of storage, with that transition well underway but still in the early stages.The vast majority of the storage spend is still with the largest incumbents, including NetApp, IBM and EMC. Pure Storage is growing fast, but it's still incurring large losses.Pure Storage continues to invest heavily to support a business model that is on pace to quickly scale to a $1 billion run-rate within five years after shipping its first product, Bracelin wrote. The company has $604 million in cash and no debt, and it remains on track to reach positive cash flow by the end of 2018, he said.""We estimate Pure's revenue could grow by 60%-plus this year, driven by flash share gains,” Bracelin wrote.Pure Storage is set to report earnings after the market close Wednesday, for its fiscal Q1 ended April 30.The Wall Street consensus estimate on revenue is $138 million, up 86% year over year. The bottom-line consensus, as polled by Thomson Reuters, is for a per-share loss minus items of 23 cents, vs. a 26-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter.Pacific Crest continues to rate Pure Storage stock overweight, or buy, ""based on the promising potential to build a next-generation storage franchise, strong balance sheet with over $600 million in cash, and the longer-term profit potential,” Bracelin wrote.Bracelin has a price target on Pure Storage stock of 24. The company came public in October 2015, raising $425 million with an initial public offering that priced 25 million shares at 17.Pure Storage stock was near 14.50, up 1%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.

122,NTAP,"Make room for IBM (IBM) as well as the usual suspects -- Amazon Web Services, Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet’s Google --  in the cloud computing market hierarchy, UBS says in a research report.While AWS, part of Amazon.com (AMZN), and Google (GOOGL) are strongest in infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), Microsoft’s Azure service and IBM are formidable in platform-as-a-service (PaaS), according to the UBS survey of corporate information technology executives.In the IaaS market, customers rent computers and data storage via the Internet. In PaaS, companies sell applications and software, including business management and database services, that run on cloud infrastructure.“Cloud is not a winner-take-all market,” said UBS. “We believe the 'big will get bigger,' ... AWS, Microsoft, and Google are going to be winners, with IBM holding its own.""The likely losers, based on UBS estimates of revenue exposure, include Rackspace (RAX), Nimble (NMBL), Pure Storage (PSTG), Brocade (BRCD), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and NetApp (NTAP).”Rackspace, which is set to report Q1 earnings after the close Monday, is transitioning to a services model, providing support for AWS and Azure.IBM acquired IaaS provider Softlayer in 2013. To be stronger in PaaS, IBM has layered software on Softlayer’s infrastructure and made other cloud acquisitions, says UBS.One surprise in the UBS survey is that IT executives expect pricing for cloud computing to moderate. Some analysts predict Google will be more aggressive in cutting prices.

123,NTAP,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will cut 12,000 jobs by mid-2017, and that will help kick off a ""recession"" with nearly 400,000 tech positions to be cut this year, a Global Equities Research analyst predicted Tuesday.Late Tuesday, Intel added another domino to the layoff train, joining VMware (VMW), Yahoo (YHOO), BlackBerry (BBRY), Autodesk (ADSK) and NetApp (NTAP), which recently announced plans to collectively lay off 5,125 employees.Intel's 12,000-cut represents 11% of its global workforce. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry says it's just a drop in a 369,000 bucket (his prediction for tech layoffs that will be announced this year) and argued against a Federal Reserve rate increase amid what he calls a likely oncoming recession.On Wednesday, Wall Street was largely split on Intel's mixed Q1, with at least five analysts still rating Intel stock a buy. At least two analysts cut their price targets, however, and another downgraded Intel stock.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Intel stock was up 1.5%, near 32. But shares are down 8% for the year vs. a 3% decline in IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group.For Q1 ended April 2, Intel reported $13.7 billion in sales and 54 cents earnings per share, up a respective 7% and 20% year over year. The consensus of 45 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $13.8 billion and 48 cents.PC chip sales rose 2%, but that trailed stronger growth in data center, Internet of Things and security -- up a respective 9%, 22% and 12%. Nonvolatile memory chip sales fell 6%.Current-quarter sales guidance for $13.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, lagged the consensus for $14.2 billion. Intel's April quarter benefited from an extra week.Intel's transition from a PC-oriented company will be ""messy,"" Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer wrote in a research report. Late Tuesday, CEO Brian Krzanich said the layoffs would allow Intel to save $750 million in the first year and $1.4 billion per year starting by mid-2017, so that the company can ""intensify"" investments in key growth areas.Pitzer reiterated an outperform rating and a 40 price target on Intel stock.PCs represented 55% of Intel's Q1 sales vs. 58% a year earlier. In 2011, the client computing group accounted for 65% of Intel's revenue. The company is aiming to trim that to 50%, which Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire calls a ""milestone.""""Intel is certainly trying, perhaps with varying degrees of success, to get revenue from many other markets,"" Maire wrote in a research report. ""While individually, none hold a candle to the PC market, collectively they have been a great offset.""Unlike other companies, Intel isn't in the red while transitioning, Maire noted. He likened the restructuring -- which includes transitioning CFO Stacy Smith into a role leading sales, manufacturing and operations -- to teaching an elephant to dance.The elephant theme was popular Wednesday. ""Who says elephants can't dance?"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan queried in a report. Sundararajan reiterated his buy rating and 37 price target on Intel stock.""Keeping (2016) capital expenditures the same ($9.5 billion at the midpoint) while proceeding with a layoff confirms that Intel is trying to be more nimble and refocusing itself away from the PC,"" he wrote in a report.During Q2, Intel will recognize a $1.2 billion restructuring charge. But the second half of 2016 looks promising, Sundararajan said. Intel dropped full-year guidance to mid-single-digit growth vs. earlier views for mid- to high-single-digit growth.Sundararajan says this suggests a big second-half-year recovery, with revenue up 13%.

125,NTAP,"Tectonic shifts to cloud computing and flash storage make the time ripe to build a new storage franchise, with Pure Storage (PSTG) seen as an industry disruptor.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brent Bracelin, in a new research note, says that Pure Storage has been able to sustain solid growth and market share gains despite legacy vendors such as EMC (EMC) and NetApp (NTAP) putting Pure Storage in their cross hairs.Bracelin’s report came as Pure Storage introduced several new products on Monday that expand its portfolio of storage systems, including products that integrate more tightly with server gear from Cisco Systems (CSCO).Pure Storage provides the $24 billion enterprise storage market with technology using flash chips, similar to the chips that smartphones use. Flash-based storage arrays are much faster than disk-drive storage systems but come at a higher price, depending on how the technology is deployed. Flash is seen as the future of storage, with the transition well underway but still in the early stages.“We believe these new products, coupled with continued declines in flash pricing to less than $1 per GB, should give Pure Storage the ammunition to sustain share-gain momentum into 2016,” Bracelin wrote.EMC and NetApp lead in the disk-storage systems market and also have expanded into flash-chip storage systems. NetApp and EMC, which Dell is acquiring, are much larger than Pure Storage, but the smaller company is growing much faster. It has yet to turn a profit, however.Pure Storage revenue has zoomed from $6 million in 2013 to $440 million for its fiscal 2016 ended Jan. 31. But the company has posted big losses as it spends heavily on research and development and on marketing to grow market share.Pure Storage kept its string of triple-digit revenue growth alive on March 2, when it posted fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, as did its Q1 outlook.Company CEO Scott Dietzen says that the data storage industry is on the cusp of a revolutionary change that Pure aims to lead. But a recent report from Summit Research said that while Pure Storage has cutting-edge data technology, it will face an uphill battle trying to dislodge EMC and NetApp.Bracelin has an overweight rating on Pure Storage stock and a price target of 24.Pure Storage stock was near 12.50, in midday trading on the stock market today  -- down 3% despite the bullish research note. Pure raised $425 million with its initial public offering on Oct. 7, pricing shares at 17. The stock peaked at 20.60 on Oct. 15 and hit a low of 11.05 on Feb 8.“While execution risks remain elevated as legacy vendors attempt to grab share by discounting storage pricing, a solid track record of execution since the October 2015 IPO increases our confidence that Pure Storage can sustain solid momentum and share gains,” Bracelin wrote.Image provided by Shutterstock.

126,NTAP,"Apple (AAPL), IBM, and Cisco Systems (CSCO) have higher earnings quality than some 3D printer makers, based on their GAAP vs. non-GAAP accounting, says UBS.Tech companies, and some others, typically report both non-GAAP  earnings -- which exclude stock options grants to employees and often other items -- and earnings under GAAP (generally accepted accounted principles), which include everything. Financial analysts typically provide non-GAAP estimates for quarterly results, and those numbers frequently get more play in quarterly earnings stories in the business press.“Non-tech investors sometimes recoil at the liberal non-GAAP reporting by tech companies and its acceptance by investors,” noted UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in the research report. Milunovich says a large difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings should be taken into account in assessing a stock's price-to-earnings, or P/E, ratios.“Apple's financial statements embody the same user-friendly nature as its products in only reporting GAAP numbers,"" he wrote.Milunovich also said the GAAP to non-GAAP EPS difference for IBM (IBM) is just ""modest,"" and is a ""relatively conservative"" 12% for Cisco.IBM is slated to report its Q1 earnings on April 18, and Apple on April 25.IBM stock fell 0.3% to 152.07 on the stock market today. Apple rose 1% to 111.12, closing just below Apple's 200-day line after the stock topped that key level intraday for the first time in 2016.Milunovich is the second tech analyst in a week to take a close look at GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings. Citigroup analyst Mark May last week slashed his price target on LinkedIn (LNKD)  and also lowered its targets on shares of Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) in a report that examined the earnings dilution from stock compensation grants.Milunovich says restructuring charges also impact GAAP vs. non-GAAP accounting.The UBS analysts flagged the leading makers of 3D printers. He said that in 2015 “both Stratasys (SSYS) and 3D Systems (DDD) had large impairments, especially Stratasys' write-off of MakerBot, creating the biggest gaps (in GAAP vs. non-GAAP accounting)” among the companies he looked at. Storage vendors including Nimble (NMBL), NetApp (NTAP) and EMC (EMC) also had relatively large differences in GAAP vs. non-GAAP earnings, he wrote.

127,NTAP,"Stocks dipped narrowly at Monday's open, then quickly improved to mixed action as oil, mining and some retail stocks all posted early gains.The Dow rose 0.4% as Wal-Mart (WMT) and DuPont (DD) gained more than 2% each. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped 0.3% apiece.The stock market today had opened to mixed trade, with volume rising 2% on the Nasdaq and dipping 8% on the NYSE, compared with action at the same time Friday.About a third of the Dow industrials' stocks rose at the starting bell. DuPont kept its premarket lead, up almost 3%, as takeover speculation continued to make the rounds. Pfizer (PFE) and Nike (NKE) slumped lower, down 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively.Nine of the S&P 500's 10 largest gains were from energy and oil stocks. The tenth was a 3% gain from NetApp (NTAP). The data storage heavyweight rallied for four straight weeks through Friday. On Monday, shares traded 28% above a Feb. 12 low.Losses among S&P 500 stocks were moderate. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) took the hardest hit, down about 1.5% after Bank of America downgraded shares to neutral from buy.Iron ore was a focal point of the morning after spiking 19% overnight on global markets -- a record one-day surge. Ore miners posted the best gains on the London Stock Exchange, although London's FTSE 100 traded down 0.8% in afternoon trade.

128,NTAP,"Pure Storage (PSTG) kept its string of triple-digit revenue growth alive and posted fourth-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates, as did its Q1 outlook.Pure Storage reported revenue of $150.2 million, up 128% from the year-earlier quarter and soundly beating the consensus estimate of $138.6 million. It was the ninth quarter in a row of triple-digit gains.The company reported a per-share loss minus items of 12 cents, vs. the consensus estimate for a 16-cent loss, as polled by Thomson Reuters, for the period ended Jan. 31.Pure Storage stock, which rose 5% to 15.71 in regular trading, was up another 5% in after-hours trading, after the company released its earnings.For Q1, Pure Storage forecast revenue of $135 million to $139 million, above the $130.5 million analyst consensus. For the year, Pure Storage expects revenue of $685 million to $725 million. The consensus is $667 million.""We delivered our best ever quarter in Q4, concluding another record setting year for Pure Storage,"" company CEO Scott Dietzen said in the earnings release. ""The business continues to run on all cylinders, fueled by the rapid worldwide adoption of FlashArray combined with improved operating efficiency as we scale.""The company grew its customer base by more than 120% over the past year to more than 1,650 organizations, it said.Pure Storage provides flash-chip-based storage systems for the enterprise market, a cutting-edge technology that is making life difficult for storage leaders EMC (EMC) and NetApp (NTAP).CEO Dietzen says that the data storage industry is on the cusp of a revolutionary change that Pure aims to lead. But a recent report from Summit Research said that while Pure Storage has cutting-edge data technology, it will face an uphill battle trying to dislodge EMC and NetApp.

129,NTAP,"Pure Storage (PSTG) stock was up for the fifth day in a row ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings set for release today after the close.Pure Storage is a provider of flash-chip-based storage systems for the enterprise market, a cutting-edge technology that is making life difficult for storage leaders EMC (EMC)and NetApp (NTAP).Pure Storage CEO Scott Dietzen says the data storage industry is on the cusp of a revolutionary change that it aims to lead. He says Pure Storage is one of the fastest-growing tech companies in history. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company launched its first product in May 2012 and has posted triple-digit revenue growth for at least eight quarters in a row.Make that nine, if Pure Storage holds onto its brisk revenue-growth pace.The consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters call for Q4 revenue of $138.6 million, up 110% from the year-earlier quarter. But that rapid growth has come at a cost, as Pure Storage is pouring big sums into sales and marketing, and research and development, in an aggressive bid to expand market share.The company is expected to post a loss of 16 cents a share, compared with a 25-cent loss last Q4.Pure Storage stock was up 1.2%, near 15, in afternoon trading in the stock market today, and Wednesday touched its 2016 high. Pure Storage made its initial public offering in October, raising $425 million by pricing 25 million shares at 17.A recent report from Summit Research said that while Pure Storage has cutting-edge data technology, it will face an uphill battle trying to dislodge EMC and NetApp.EMC on Feb. 29 announced new products that it called “a quantum leap in flash storage.” EMC said it will commit to all-flash for its primary storage offerings, ""relegating traditional disk to bulk and archive storage requirements."" In October, EMC has agreed to be acquired by Dell for $67 billion, a deal that is not yet completed.In December, NetApp announced that it will pay $870 million in cash to acquire SolidFire, a provider of storage systems that are based on flash-memory chips.

131,NTAP,"A Marvell Technology (MRVL) patent settlement, a Chinese takeover of Ingram Micro (IM), NetApp (NTAP) layoffs and weak Jack in the Box (JACK) earnings moved those stocks in after-hours action Wednesday.Ending litigation that started in 2009, Marvell Technology agreed to pay $750 million to settle a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Carnegie Mellon University over disk drive technology.The settlement was announced six months after a federal appellate court vacated a record $1.5 billion judgment against Marvell and ordered a new trial. But the court also ruled that Marvell must pay at least $278.4 million in damages.A federal jury in Pittsburgh had awarded Carnegie Mellon $1.17 billion in damages in 2012. The trial judge later raised that total to $1.5 billion, reflecting Marvell's alleged willful infringement plus interest.A ""substantial share"" of the $750 million settlement will go to the inventors of the disputed technology, minus legal fees and costs, Carnegie Mellon said.Marvell shares rose more than 6% after hours.China-based Tianjin Tianhai Investment will pay $38.90 a share, or $6 billion, for Irvine, Calif.-based information technology company Ingram Micro.Ingram Micro stock soared 24% after hours when news of the deal broke.Tianjin Tianhai is a unit of Chinese shipping and aviation conglomerate HNA Group. Some of Ingram Micro's customers include Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).The offer represents a 31% premium on Ingram Micro's closing price of 29.65 on Wednesday.McDonald's (MCD) launch of its all-day breakfast menu hurt Jack in the Box during the latter's fiscal first quarter, sending its shares plunging nearly 20% after hours.For the three-month period ended Jan. 17, the San Diego-based fast food restaurant chain earned 93 cents a share, flat from a year earlier and 10 cents below estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 0.5% to $470.8 million, missing estimates of $475.5 million.""We believe a competitor's messaging around its launch of all-day breakfast had some impact on our results, particularly in the 10:30 a.m. to noon period,"" Jack in the Box Chairman and CEO Lenny Comma said in a statement.McDonald's launched its all-day breakfast menu during Q4, which helped the Oak Brook, Ill.-based fast food giant post its best U.S. quarterly sales in nearly four years.Same-store sales at Jack in the Box's subsidiary Qdoba rose 1.5% at company-owned locations, less than previous projections of 2%. That's despite rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reporting plunging Q4 and January same-store sales due to food-borne illness scandals.Jack in the Box narrowed its full-year earnings guidance to  $3.50 to $3.63 a share, compared with the previous range of $3.55 to $3.70 a share.The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based data-storage company announced a plan to axe 12% of its workforce, or nearly 1,200 workers, as NetApp aims to cut $400 million in costs.NetApp estimated that it will book between $60 million and $70 million in costs tied to the layoffs during its fiscal Q4.For its fiscal Q3, the three-month period ended Jan. 29, NetApp earned 70 cents a share excluding items, down 6.7% from a year earlier, and beating by 2 cents estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue fell 10.6% to $1.4 billion, missing estimates of $1.5 billion.NetApp also gave light Q4 guidance.But NetApp stock rose 2% late.

132,NTAP,"The data storage industry is on the cusp of a revolutionary change that Pure Storage aims to lead. Pure Storage (PSTG) is a provider of data storage systems, for business and other enterprise users, that are based on a chip technology known as flash — similar to chips used in smartphones. Industry observers expect storage systems based entirely on flash chips will ultimately replace systems based on high-performance disk drives, with Internet cloud-based storage growing much faster than on-site storage.The leaders in the disk-storage systems market are EMC (EMC) and NetApp (NTAP), companies that also have expanded into flash-chip storage systems. NetApp and EMC, which is being acquired by Dell, are much larger than Pure Storage, but the smaller company is growing much faster. It has yet to turn profitable, however.For its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, Pure Storage reported revenue of $131.4 million, up 167% from the year-earlier period, and an operating loss of $55.6 million.Mountain View, Calif.-based Pure Storage, which raised $425 million in an initial public offering in October, is looking to disrupt EMC and NetApp, among others.Scott Dietzen, Pure Storage CEO, recently spoke with IBD about the company's plans.IBD: How has cloud computing changed storage requirements for the business enterprise?Dietzen: Cloud computing is disrupting the storage business because most of the legacy storage is very expensive, very complicated and it doesn't fit well into cloud data centers. And then you have flash memory, which is poised to replace all of the fast, high-performance disks drives in data centers. It's a double tsunami hitting the storage industry.IBD: How is Pure Storage disrupting the storage industry?Dietzen: If you look at the storage industry before Pure entered the market, most of the technology in use today is more than 20 years old. It was designed far in advance of cloud computing and was designed in advance of flash memory.We came to market and said there is an opportunity to deliver storage that actually costs less to buy and is at least 10 times better in every dimension that businesses care about. It's 10 times faster, it's 10 times denser, it's 10 times more power efficient, and it's way more than 10 times reliable. Flash is 50 times more reliable than a mechanical disk. This collection of innovation in software, in hardware, in harnessing the cloud computing model and changing the business model — that combination completely changes the storage landscape. All of the legacy technology will be replaced with brand new technology.IBD: When did flash storage become less expensive than disk drive technology for enterprise storage systems?Dietzen: When Pure launched (2009), flash cost about four times more than a fast disk, and that's why we worked very hard on the data reduction technology, to get the acquisition price below that of a disk storage array. We are in the situation today where flash is dramatically cheaper than fast disks.When we started back in 2011, we were already below the price of an EMC Vmax disk array, the flagship disk array system. Since then, the cost of flash has dropped four times faster than the cost of the fast disks. We are in a situation where the consumer-grade flash we use is less than the price of fast disks and we get a 10-fold reduction in power, space and management. And we've moved to a cloud business model. We are in this situation where the $24 billion market for performance-intensive storage, in our calculus, is going to go to flash storage over the next refresh cycle or two, over the next seven or eight years.IBD: You are saying if I compare an EMC disk storage system to a Pure Storage system of similar capacity, that you will be cheaper?Dietzen: Yes, cheaper to buy and dramatically cheaper to operate. And as further evidence that the Pure disruption is carrying the day here, EMC has bought two (flash-storage system) companies — XtremIO and DSSD. Their intent, we believe, is they are going to try to replace all of their existing tier-one disk storage with flash products.And the No. 2 company in the market, NetApp, just made a similar acquisition ($870 million to buy SolidFire). If we weren't right in saying none of the technology from the disk drive era is going to make the leap to flash, then why do you have the Nos. 1 and 2 storage vendors in the market spending a lot of their dollars on trying to buy disruptors in order to compete with Pure?IBD: Some analysts say Pure Storage will face an uphill battle with EMC and NetApp, which they say will pass you by in flash storage.Dietzen: We think EMC and NetApp have hurdles in front of them. Keep in mind that changing out from an existing EMC technology like Vmax, which is the market share leader, and replacing that with ExtremIO, is an extremely disruptive change. And companies do not embrace that kind of change without looking at the newest technologies.We just have to be in the mix and get a chance to prove out the difference in our product. We beat EMC 70% of the time vs. XtremIO. We are confident that we are looking at a two-year technology lead over any of the large incumbents in the marketplace.IBD: What will happen two years from now if they catch up to you?Dietzen: We have been able to attract the best and brightest from Silicon Valley. Our goal and our belief is that our lead is growing. When we can hire the best engineers, we are able to do things that other companies can't achieve. Pure is changing the business model, we're changing all of the technology. These large incumbents are only just beginning to transition their installed base. It's extremely hard when you have 20-year-old incumbent technology and you are trying to look after that business and get disrupted at the same time. We think we have the right recipe to ultimately build the leading share in this market.IBD: When will Pure Storage reach profitability?Dietzen: We're investing heavily in R&D and also in sales, marketing and our partnering organization. The largest component of our investment is to drive growth. We are at a $500 million revenue run rate and growing at 167% year over year. At the same time, the operating efficiency of the business has been improving dramatically. We have more than $500 million in the bank. Our business is growing really fast, while we are getting more efficient at the same time. Our investors want us to capture this market. We are playing for No. 1 in a $24 billion market. We don't want to miss the opportunity and cede that long-term leadership position.

""On the large-cap front, we have seen many changes from the HP split (into HP Inc.

""Most people don't understand that,"" she said.""Yesterday, we announced that we were partnering with Microsoft (MFST) Azure to provide the public cloud,"" she told CNBC. ""And then we have this great cloud system automation that helps you orchestrate your clouds in your data center. So if you think about where the money is spent today, interestingly, still about 85% of the spend is in traditional I.T. ... The next-biggest segment is private cloud.

And I feel really good about our strategy and excited about the partnership that we announced yesterday with Microsoft Azure.""Microsoft Azure competes with market leader Amazon Web Services, a unit of Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and others in providing public cloud services.Needham's Kugele liked the Azure partnership and the fact that HPE was ""abdicating"" in the public cloud sector, but he pointed out that Azure is fighting against AWS, ""and ultimate success is going to be a marathon and not a sprint.""New Era BeginsEnterprise is roughly half — most analysts say the more promising half — of the Nov. 1 split of the legendary 76-year-old Hewlett-Packard Co. The other half, HP Inc. (HPQ), focuses on the PC and printer businesses, and it kept the old HPQ ticker.The Q4 report was the last for the old company, which Whitman also chaired. It earned 93 cents per share minus items in its fiscal Q4 ended Oct. 31, down 12%, on revenue of $25.7 billion, down 9%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 97 cents on $26.35 billion.Enterprise's pro forma portion of Q4 sales fell 4% to $14.1 billion but was up 3% in constant currency. Analysts were expecting Enterprise to post Q4 revenue of $13.5 billion.Enterprise reaffirmed its fiscal 2016 outlook of $1.85-$1.95 in adjusted earnings per share, with the $1.90 midpoint higher than the $1.88 estimated by analysts on revenue of $50.81 billion.Whitman told analysts in the conference call following Tuesday's earnings release that HPE ""will double down on our private and managed cloud (efforts), and sunset our public cloud."" Of ""the move to a hybrid cloud environment ... you can expect to hear more.""Needham analyst Kugele said that with HPE still on its way to 30,000 layoffs, and the service business determined to ""drag its margins higher through careful contract signings, we are most focused on the storage and server opportunity for HPE. In servers, the lumpy buying pattern of tier-1 hyperscale customers helped them in the quarter but is hardly consistently reliable.""Nevertheless we expect the segment to show slight growth in fiscal '16.""He said storage has benefited from ""aggressive pricing,"" but he sees more competition from rivals such as NetApp (NTAP) and Pure Storage (PSTG).""Bottom line, there are more puts and takes and caveats than investors should accept in a long thesis,"" Kugele wrote. ""Staying on the sidelines.""

"
176,NTAP,"""Although we find the valuation and dividend yield somewhat attractive, we think the business fundamentals are likely to get worse before they get better,"" he said about HP. ""We expect the printing margin to come under pressure and PC sales to decline albeit at a more modest rate.""

""In the near term, HP should benefit from distractions at its printing peers and No. 3 PC vendor Dell, which is in the process of attempting to swallow larger EMC (EMC).""
"
191,NTAP,"HPE faces a different set of challenges. He described it as ""an on-premise vendor in an increasingly off-premise world."" IT customers are shifting from servers and storage located on site to cloud computing resources accessed over the Internet.

This transition is affecting all traditional IT vendors, whose growth rates have stagnated.""

193,NTAP,"Besides HPE, other vendors hurt by the shift include IBM (IBM), NetApp (NTAP), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and EMC excluding its VMware (VMW) unit, he said.

198,NTAP,"True or false: Greed and fear look different on a stock chart.Absolutely true. Greed sends a stock rising in price. A stock drops on fear.Okay, that was easy. How about this? True or false: The speed in which a stock moves up on greed is the same as when a stock goes down on fear.If you've bought and sold growth stocks for a year or longer, you might agree that the answer is not so simple. Sometimes it's true, but most of the time it's false.When greed is widespread, a stock can roar with the force of a space shuttle at liftoff. A climax run — when a stock goes up faster in price in a few weeks than it ever has over the course of its run — shows how fast a leader can rise.But in most cases, fear causes a stock to lose its gains in far less time than it took to amass them.Why? Fear is mankind's survival tool. Imagine a fire at a packed movie house. You can bet people will rush out of the room much faster than they walked in.Some legendary investors strove to sell before investors panicked.In IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil's ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" he quoted Wall Street maven Joseph Kennedy as saying: ""The object is to get out while a stock is up before it has a chance to break and turn down.""To maximize your profits, be mindful of how fear greases the wheels of a stock once it's topped.

It's worth checking out just how fast it surrendered those awesome gains.The pioneer in network-attached data storage gear recovered from a huge sell-off in October 1998 and cleared a V-shaped base with a 61.35 buy point in heavy volume on Nov. 5 (chart shows split-adjusted prices). NetApp formed a new base in the summer of 1999, broke out again, sprinted for seven months and formed another deep base in the first half of 2000 2.The stock's climb took more than 23 months before it peaked. Earnings more than tripled from fiscal 1998 to 2000, ending in April each year. Sales grew 78%, 74% and 100% over the same time frame.NetApp broke out in September 2000 just as the major indexes were rolling over. But the breakout failed and the stock slid fast.NetApp fell 64% over six weeks in October and November 3, then gave up all its gains going back to November 1998 in less than 12 months 4.

261,NTAP,"Nimble Storage (NMBL) could be the hottest acquisition target in the storage market.And Cisco Systems (CSCO), NetApp and EMC are the likeliest buyers, says Srini Nandury, an analyst for Summit Partners, in a research report Tuesday.""The storage industry is ripe for consolidation and we believe OEMs such as NetApp (NTAP), EMC (EMC) and Cisco are looking to acquire next-generation storage assets,"" he wrote. ""Given that Nimble is one of the best hybrid storage assets in the market, any buyout offer for Nimble will likely trigger a bidding war as we have previously seen with both Data Domain and 3Par.""And, given that Nimble is executing solidly in both small and medium-sized business and storage environments, and is expected to roll out both Network-attached storage and Object storage in the near term (12-18 months) and will most likely get acquired, we reiterate our buy rating on the stock and maintain our 40 price target.""Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) acquired 3Par for $2.35 billion in 2010, a year after EMC picked up Data Domain for $2.4 billion. Recently, EMC used a separate acquisition to help boost its cloud business.Though Nimble isn't profitable, it's posted year-over-year revenue growth of 89%, 77%, 64% and 53% in its past four quarters.Nimble stock was up more than 2% in morning trading in the stock market today, at a five-month high above 28. Nimble stock is up nearly 25% since April 1 and sports an IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A+. That indicates heavy institutional buying of the stock of late.""The company is executing well and has shown solid momentum in its most recent quarter, and we expect the momentum to continue for the rest of the year,"" Nandury wrote. ""Though the company continues to report solid growth, in our view, much of the price appreciation has been driven by the belief that Nimble is THE acquisition candidate. We tend to agree.""

On Oct. 24, Riverbed sold its SteelStore cloud storage product line to NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) for $80 million.Even with the recent divestiture and restructuring plan, a sale seemed inevitable, says Jason Ader, an analyst for William Blair & Co. in a research report Monday.""We viewed this as a likely outcome, with previous diversification efforts showing mixed progress and wide area network optimization secularly challenged, making it increasingly difficult to attach a 'growth' label to Riverbed's business,"" he wrote. ""Additionally, with a set of high-quality assets at differing levels of maturity as well as healthy profitability and cash flow, private ownership may allow Riverbed to thrive in a way not possible in the public market.""

446,NTAP,"Investors generally gauge a stock’s potential return by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples. At the same time, it’s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers, or the appropriate benchmark.If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors, then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative. However, those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

447,NTAP,"The global tech space has been ravaged in the last one month. Back-to-back threats emanating from Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data breaches and consequent concerns over stringent regulations over the social media space, a massacre with Nvidia’s self-driving car tests and an acute selloff in Netflix on overvaluation thrashed the space in March.Then, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would levy new tariffs worth up to $60 billion on China, targeting mainly that country’s telecom and technology sector. If these weren’t enough, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security barred American companies from selling to ZTE for seven years as the Chinese company had allegedly “broken a settlement agreement with repeated false statements” and has been involved in exporting telecom equipment to Iran and North Korea.Then, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSM  -  Free Report) dealt a blow to the tech industry on Apr 19 after the company reported Q1 results before market open and pointed at a decline in smartphone demand.The company’s revenue forecast target for the second quarter came in the range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, falling shy of the analysts’ expectation of $8.8 billion.

Year over year, Apple logged a decline (5%) in iPhone sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Samsung saw a unit decline of 3.6%.Since TSMC is big supplier of Apple AAPL, order cuts from the current Apple iPhone X processor took a hit to the iPhone maker too.

460,NTAP,"FireEye, Inc. (FEYE  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of X15 Software with an aim to incorporate the latter’s Big Data platform to its security solutions against cyber attacks. FireEye will be paying $15 million in equity and $5 million in cash for the acquisition per the terms of the transaction.X15 Software, which was founded in 2013 by Val Rayzman, has offices in California and India. The company currently employs around 20 employees who after this acquisition will work from their current locations.Details of the DealAt a time when data generation is increasing at an exponential rate, management of the data to extract useful trends, patterns or information has become important.  X15 Software’s Big Data platform assists in collecting, retrieving and analyzing huge volumes of machine generated data in a scalable fashion in real time, per the press release. Hence, the buyout is anticipated to enhance FireEye’s abilities of managing security related data for better decision making, thereby helping its clients to counter the risks against them more effectively.Apart from adding capabilities related to big data management, X15 Software will also be adding a single management console for on-premise, hybrid and pure cloud environments including the likes of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as Oracle Cloud. Given the varied adoption of different cloud platforms by organizations, this feature will be a lucrative addition.This acquisition is anticipated to be a good buy for FireEye as the application of Big Data and machine learning in cyber security is increasing. This will eventually boost the adoption of the company’s offerings and benefit its top line.We believe impressive financials will help the company to rebound, which has otherwise underperformed the industry in the last six months. FireEye stock has gained 0.5% in the last six months, underperforming the 3.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.FireEye’s Overall PerformanceNotably, for the past several quarters, the company has been losing business to its rivals. FireEye faces stiff competition from other well-established players such as Check Point Software (CHKP  -  Free Report) and Fortinet (FTNT  -  Free Report) in the cyber security space.FireEye’s management has been striving to turn the business around through a string of initiatives, which includes product launches, acquisition and cost optimization. We consider that FireEye’s turnaround strategies are paying off as reflected from its back-to-back three quarters of splendid results.However, the company’s guidance for the ongoing quarter fell short of analysts’ expectations, which has been a drag. Although a shift from product-based to subscription-based business model will lead to more stable revenues over the long run, it will have a negative impact on FireEye’s near-term results, which is a headwind for the company.FireEye carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry is NetApp, Inc.

461,NTAP,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited’s (BABA  -  Free Report) Taobao was recently put on United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) annual list of world’s most “notorious markets”, for the second consecutive year, along with 24 other online markets and 18 physical markets.Alleged sale of counterfeit products on the online shopping platform and the challenges faced by the right(s) holders in removing and stopping sale of such illegal products are the reasons  behind Taobao  being blacklisted.USTR said in its report, “A high volume of infringing products reportedly continue to be offered for sale and sold on Taobao.com and stakeholders continue to report challenges and burdens associated with IP enforcement on the platform.”Also, the agency recommended ways through which Alibaba Group can improve its position by stating, “Simplifying processes for right holders to register and request enforcement action; making good faith takedown procedures generally available; and reducing Taobao’s timelines for takedowns and issuing penalties for counterfeit sellers.”Moreover, it stressed on the fact that Alibaba’s efforts to protect brands and IP appeared to be more biased toward global brands, neglecting small and medium businesses.To defend the company, Alibaba’s President Mike Evans spoke up in a blog post, “In light of all this, it’s clear that no matter how much action we take and progress we make, the USTR is not actually interested in seeing tangible results. Therefore, our inclusion on its list is not an accurate representation of Alibaba’s results in protecting brands and IP, and we have no other choice but to conclude that this is a deeply flawed, biased and politicized process.”Notably, shares of Alibaba have gained 95.3% in the past 12 months, substantially outperforming its industry’s 61.9% surge.Our TakeAlibaba dominates the Chinese e-commerce market with a share of 80%. For some time, the company has been taking steps to strengthen its position outside China, especially in the United States. In pursuance of this strategy, Alibaba made its first foray into the U.S. retail market in June this year with the launch of a low-profile website with an American name — 11Main.com — a platform for smaller sellers to hawk their wares.The company has also dealt with lot of copyright and intellectual property infringement issues in the recent past and has closed 240,000 online stores on Taobao on suspicion of infringement last year. Moreover, the company said that it witnessed a sharp decline in the number of complaints after this move. In its annual report on intellectual property protection in 2017, the company claimed that transactions involving suspicion of fake goods went down to 1.49 out of every 10,000 transactions.The recent report may have a negative impact on the company’s reputation and its international expansion strategy, as it is making all efforts to strengthen its position in the United States. Also, the decision of blacklisting it will make it more difficult for the company to win the trust of U.S. and global brands.The e-commerce market in the United States is expected to grow at a double-digit rate over the next few years and if the company wishes to tap this growth, it’ll have to take some steps to improve its position.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAlibaba has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc.

464,NTAP,"Shares of Expedia Inc. (EXPE  -  Free Report) soared recently following a bullish research note from Morgan Stanley, which has given a boost to investors’ confidence. Shares of Expedia raced to a high of $131.23 following Morgan Stanley’s favorable report and ultimately closed at $129.41 on Jan 11, gaining 1.8% during the day.In its report, Morgan Stanley upgraded shares of Expedia to overweight from an equal one, based on the company’s decisive efforts to expand in the overseas markets by acquiring properties beyond the largest hotels to serve its customers better. Analyst Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley expects the shares to return almost 23% in the upcoming 12 months and reach a target of $160.Nowak said in a report that the firm is ""planting seeds for faster growth"" by buying up properties in the international markets. He also added, “We are bullish about Expedia's recent strategic investments to increase its global property supply. We are particularly positive on Expedia's more refined hotel supply strategy, given we believe Expedia's non-vacation rental supply count is still roughly 50 percent of Priceline's ... and increased selection should lead to higher conversion and an increased ability to bid on Google keywords to drive traffic and user growth.""Nowak also seemed optimistic about Expedia’s HomeAway platform. According to him, the company is progressing well by integrating 95,000 listings of HomeAway, thus making the total count on Expedia platform 500,000.  This in turn also improves the supply of instantly bookable properties. Moreover, Nowak expects HomeAway to generate 27 percent room night growth in 2018.Also, management sees great potential in HomeAway business, which is why Expedia is making continuous investments in it. Hotel acquisition ramped up in 2017 with the company having announced to add 80,000 properties last year. Going forward, the company expects to do a step change as well. These positives will ultimately help drive the company’s capacity to grow revenues.Apparently, Nowak sees 2018 as an investment year and expects Expedia’s strategic investments to pay off in 2019.The stock has gained 9.6% in the past 12 months, underperforming the 22.2% rally of the S&P 500 index.Our TakeExpedia is well-positioned in the online travel and alternative accommodation space. The company has been snapping up companies to increase its penetration in the existing markets while expand in others and also eliminate competition. We believe, HomeAway has significant growth prospects as it is relatively disorganized but competition is also intense, given the success of Airbnb and Priceline.

Gimv is one of the notable selling shareholders. However, the deal is subject to customary closing conditions and its terms have been kept under wraps.Though the acquisition looks slightly out of place for Accenture, but the firm is aiming at improving the capabilities of Accenture Interactive platform, part of the company's digital marketing-services arm. Its foothold in the interactive content space will be bolstered with the buy-out of this producer of computer generated imagery (CGI) content based on its animation and 3D visualization abilities.The combination of the two companies will enhance Accenture’s abilities to address the requirements of the next-generation customer experiences, innovative content generation and extended reality applications, thereby boosting Accenture’s top line.Accenture stock has gained 37.4% over a year, outperforming the 32.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. Per the press release, “Mackevision’s creation, visualization and production services are used for online product configurators, digital and print catalogues, virtual showrooms, point-of-sale kiosks, augmented and virtual reality experiences, as well as broadcast video and feature films.

467,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced that it is currently working on an algorithm to prioritize posts made by friends and family on News Feed. Public contents such as the ones made by businesses, brands and media will have less priority, adds CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a blog post.Although Zuckerberg expects this change to have a negative impact on “the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement” but will help people engage in “more meaningful social interactions”. Notably, this is what the company prioritizes now.Moreover, last month, the company revealed that “engagement bait” posts that forcibly seek an individual’s attention by provoking them to like, share or comment will be demoted.Facebook’s initiatives go on to show its new objective which in Zuckerberg’s own words during the last earnings call are — “Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits”.Notably, Facebook has gained 48.2% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 25.7% rally.Impact on the PlatformFacebook continues to be the largest social service platform with over 2 billion monthly active users (MAUs). The company’s consistently expanding user base remains one of its biggest growth catalysts.Facebook’s initiatives to declutter News Feed, which is the first thing the user views after logging in to the platform, will help drive user satisfaction. The steps are in sync with the company’s strategy to improve the time “well spent” on the platform even if that means compromising with the total time spent on the platform.We note that Facebook has witnessed significant traction online and mobile advertising spending in a short span of time.

In October 2017, Synopsys acquired Sidense Corporation, which also deals with OTP NVM IP.Last year, Synopsys also acquired QuantumWise, which works on delivering software tools for atomic-scale modeling of materials. The integration of QuantumWise with Synopsys' Sentaurus TCAD will aid Synopsys to better manage simulation tasks and analyze simulation results.The company also completed the buyout of Black Duck Software, which is a provider of solutions related to security and management of open source software. Black Duck’s flagship product, Software Composition Analysis is anticipated to enhance Synopsys’ solutions as well as broaden its clientele, thus boosting the top line.Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Synopsys, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Synopsys, Inc. QuoteConclusionThe acquisitions have expanded the company’s product suite, thereby driving the company’s top line. This is evident from the company’s fourth-quarter revenues that jumped 9.9% year over year to $696.6 million.We believe the unique intellectual properties and global support provided by Synopsys are likely to drive its near-term performance. The company’s recent product launches and deal wins will boost results, going ahead.However, uncertainty regarding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keeps us on the sidelines. Moreover, escalating costs and expenses, which are putting pressure on margins, make us increasingly cautious about its near-term profitability. Further, customer concentration risk remains a huge concern for the company.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSynopsys has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the sector are NetApp, Inc.

In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit a record on the technology surge powered by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).

471,NTAP,"By now, the year 2018 can easily be credited to trade tensions. In the first half, the two countries targeted $50 billion of each other’s goods for tit-for tat tariffs. But now, the situation has deteriorated with President Trump’s latest threat of 10% tariffs on further $200 billion in products imported from China.Trump has even gone on to say that if Beijing continues to retaliate, the United States will impose a total tariff on $550 billion in Chinese goods – an amount that was not even the total U.S. import from China last year.Now, if any broader investing spectrum falls prey to such political tensions, then that will be the large caps. Though the large-cap index S&P 500 started 2018 on a better footing than the Russell 2000, the game started changing from mid-March. President Trump’s protectionist agenda and the resultant trade war fears started weighing on large-cap stocks.Trade War Fear Seems Oversold, Time to Look at Better Data Points?Investors should note that after a nagging four-month trade war talks, investors seem to be ignoring the reality in July. U.S. stock futures are trading at a five-month high currently. This is especially true given that Chinese and U.S. officials have lately hinted at the prospect of recommencing talks over trade between the two countries.Three big ETFs including SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report) have added about 0.9%, 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively, in the past five days (as of Jul 12, 2018).Investors also shifted focus to upbeat U.S. economic data points from the trade war. U.S. employers added 213,000 new jobs in June, after an upwardly revised 244,000 in May. The number breezed past market expectations of 195,000. The momentum in the manufacturing sector is equally upbeat with the sector logging the strongest expansion in four months in June.If this was not enough, U.S. retail sales rose the maximum in six months in May. Sales increased 0.8% sequentially in the month, after an upwardly revised 0.4% growth in April, handily beating market expectations of a 0.4% rise.Earnings Growth Momentum SolidEarnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 19.1% in Q2 on 8.2% higher revenues, per the Earnings Trends issued on Jul 11.  Investors should note that the present earnings cycle for the S&P 500 started from 2009, when the U.S. economy came out of its last recession.By now, the growth momentum should have slowed and reached the historical normalized pace of the mid-single-digits’ level. But an expected double-digit growth rate for Q2 earnings is the result of the tax reform, per the Earnings Trends.The Atlanta Fed estimates real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 to be 3.8%, much higher than the 2.0% rate recorded in Q1. The combination of these factors should continue to boost growth stocks.Why Large Caps?Having said this, while all sorts of growth ETFs may scale higher, large-caps are likely to enjoy some special benefits. This is because, large-caps have been subdued this year on trade concerns, resulting in cheaper valuation.Secondly, large-cap stocks perform better in a falling dollar environment as these have wide foreign exposure. Along with many analysts, we too believe that “tariffs, rising debt and deficits” may put a downward pressure on the greenback. This could bode well for large-cap stocks.Given this, we have highlighted a few top-ranked, large-cap growth stocks for investors. These large-cap stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Growth score of A.NetApp Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report)It is the data authority for hybrid cloud and hails from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 20%).ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report)It is a major global exploration and production (E&P) company with operations all over the world.

472,NTAP,"Brian Bolan, the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research has two more names for your aggressive growth stock radar screen. First up is CyberArk (CYBR  -  Free Report) which is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports that divergence that Brian is always looking for.  Brian reviews the earnings estimate movements of late, the history of beating the number and a broad look at the chart.  Earnings are a few weeks away for this one and Brian say it would be a good idea to keep this one on your radar screen. The next stock is NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report) and this one really has a great recent chart.  If you are a long term investor, this could be a great growth stock for your portfolio.  Estimates continue to move higher and this stock looks to keep moving up as well.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

473,NTAP,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Flex Ltd. (FLEX  -  Free Report), as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past one year. Moreover, it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the ongoing quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further ascertains the innate weakness of Flex.Estimates Moving SouthThe company has been witnessing a negative earnings estimate revision trend. For the current year, we have witnessed one estimate moving down in the past 30 days. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, dropping from $1.24 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.23 per share.Further, for the current quarter, Flex has seen one downward estimate revision, dragging the consensus estimate down to 24 cents a share from 25 cents over the past 30 days.Falling Behind the IndustryFlex has underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year. The stock lost 13.4% against the industry’s rise of 10.8%.Negative Earnings Surprise HistoryIn fact, Flex’s earnings history is also not impressive. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, recording an average negative earnings surprise of 0.8%.Higher Debt Level Remains a ConcernFlex’s balance sheet is highly leveraged, which adds to the risk of investing in the company. As of Mar 31, 2018, the company had total debt (including the current portion) of almost $2.94 billion. We note that interest expense has increased significantly in the last couple of years due to higher debts. Consequently, bottom-line growth has been negatively impacted. The higher interest expense along with increasing tax rate (10–15% from 8–9%) is anticipated to affect the bottom line in fiscal 2019 and beyond.Near-Term Headwinds RemainThe company faces stiff competition from other EMS providers like Jabil Circuit, Benchmark Electronics, Celestica, Sanmina-SCI Corporation and Taiwan-based Original Design Manufacturing (“ODM”) suppliers like Foxconn. Intensifying competition negatively impacts contract wins, hurting top-line growth.In order to remain competitive, the company has also increased spending on research & development (particularly on design and innovations business) in the last 12 months. Moreover, continuing investments on “Sketch-to-Scale” portfolio transition is expected to increase operating expenses. This will eventually keep margins under pressure at least in the near term.Moreover, the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market. Consequently, we expect adverse foreign currency exchange rates to impede revenue growth in the near term owing to fluctuation in the U.S. dollar as against the Chinese renminbi, Brazilian real, the Euro and other foreign currencies.Bottom LineLooking at the prevailing challenges and an unfavorable Zacks rank, it will be prudent to stay away from Flex stock right now. So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) and NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Intel, Micron and NetApp have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 8.4%, 8.2% and 13.8%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

474,NTAP,"Guidewire Software, Inc. (GWRE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP loss of 6 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents per share. The reported figure was, however, much lower than the year ago bottom-line figure of 2 cents per share.The company posted revenues of $108.2 million, which increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101 million and was above the guided range.Management noted that the recent consolidated release of the Guidewire platform has been instrumental in the enhancement of its product suite. The company is also banking on its strategic partnership with Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report) for its growth.Notably, the company is transforming to a subscription based model from a term license based one, which might hurt the top line in the near term. This is because term license revenues include advance payments and subscription-based revenues are a bit delayed.Nevertheless, management is extremely optimistic about the several cloud-based products launched in the quarter, at a time when the P&C insurance industry is moving steadily toward adoption of cloud solutions.So far this year, Guidewire stock has gained 56.0%, substantially outperforming the 27.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Revenue Details    The company has three main segments namely Maintenance, License and Other and Services.Maintenance revenues amounted to $18.9 million, up 15% year over year. However, the same from License and other decreased 22% from the year-ago quarter to $30.1 million. Service revenues surged 52% from the year-ago quarter to $59.1 million.Management stated that a substantial majority of the first quarter’s revenues were from subscription based products. Backed by the strong performance of subscription products, management expected increase from subscription sales were in the range of 30% to 40% from 20% to 30% for fiscal 2018.However, growth of the Maintenance revenues that are part of subscriptions will be negatively impacted while the change in the company’s business model is in progress, because of the delayed revenue recognition from the subscription based products. Per management, the license revenues will have a negative impact in fiscal 2018. The sales process might be a bit elongated due to the time taken by customers to choose between on-premise and cloud delivery options. Perpetual license revenues facing a decline will be a further drag to the license and other revenues.Meanwhile, services revenues were better than expected in the quarter. The segment is anticipated to improve its performance in the near term backed by proper implementations of InsuranceNow. Also, the corrective measures taken up via use of sub-contractors to eradicate the capacity related constraints have been beneficial for the revenue generation at the Services segment.Additionally, management is optimistic about the completion of the Cyence buyout that determines the economic impact of a cybercrime via a software platform, which is built on cyber-security related data science. The integration of Cyence would imply that the company would be able to provide an entire life cycle to the insurance products starting from designing to transaction management.Guidewire Software, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Guidewire Software, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Guidewire Software, Inc. Quote Margin DetailsIn first-quarter fiscal 2018, non-GAAP operating margin was 50.9% compared with 62% in the year-ago quarter. The decline was slight owing to the negative impact of higher mix of low-margin services revenues and shift in investments to the cloud based model.According to management, Guidewire is investing more over impressive product suite that  might prove to be tailwinds for future growth. As of now, these are affecting the company’s margins.Balance SheetThe company had cash and cash equivalents of $653.5 on Oct 31, 2017 as compared with $687.8 million in July 31, 2017.GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to be in the range of $152 to $156 million.Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be between $18 and $22 million, while non-GAAP net income is anticipated to be within $13.2 million to $15.8 million.Non-GAAP net income per share is expected to be between 17 cents and 21 cents.For fiscal 2018, total revenues were anticipated to be in the $631 to $641 million band.Non-GAAP net income is expected to be between 82 cents and 90 cents per share.Zacks Rank and Key PicksGuidewire Software carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NetApp, Inc.

475,NTAP,"Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) recently announced that its worldwide merchant base of over 500,000 sold more than $1 billion worth of gross merchandise volume (GMV) during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. Merchants also generated above $1 million transactions in a minute during the peak hour.As a result, management was extremely positive about the strong response received by the small business owners and entrepreneurs who list their products on their portal, especially during a time which has always been under the dominance of prominent retailers.Shopify noted that UK, Spain and South Africa were the top international sellers. Currently, the sales figure was the highest in the United States, California, New York and Texas. Mobile sales accounted for around 64% of the total figure, which had 10% year-over-year increase. In terms of sales volume, apparels, accessories and house wares were the leading product lines.Recent Upgrades of the PlatformPrior to the BFCM weekend, Shopify’s platform was upgraded with enhanced features that aided the merchants during the sale. In fact, the company unveiled the BFCM tool box to assist merchants better connect with the customers.In third-quarter 2017, the company’s Instagram channel was unveiled connecting merchants with a huge base of monthly active users. The newly launched eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) sales channel has also been beneficial.The shipping partnerships with the likes of UPS and DHL Express are added positives. The application called Live View helped in real-time reporting of the performance of the stores. Also, the discounting procedure was simplified.In addition, the company’s new application called Buy Online for Shopify POS that enabled shoppers to try products in person and then buy those at a later convenient date is encouraging.Furthermore, the improvisations of the checkout process by including features like Google Autocomplete and Checkout with Phone have made it easy for the consumers to use the platform.Shopify Inc. Revenue (TTM) Shopify Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Shopify Inc. QuoteShopify’s Growing Merchant BaseShopify continues to launch a number of merchant-friendly applications to meet the requirements of a dynamic retail environment, thereby adding to its merchant base. This, in turn, gets reflected in the compnay’s year-over-year top-line growth. The company’s effective partner ecosystem also helps it identify and reach out to the merchants, which otherwise unreachable.In the third quarter, the company added quite a few prominent brands like Phoenix Suns, RBS, Josie Maran and Rebecca Minkoff. Consumer packaged goods providers like Gurmay, Mai, Blue Diamond Growers and Beer Nuts also enriched the merchant base.We believe the company’s easy-to-use upgrades and expanding merchant base have boosted the GMV, which soared 69% from the year-ago quarter to $6.4 billion in the preceding quarter. This trend is anticipated to continue, thereby aiding the company to perform impressively, going ahead.Zacks Rank & Key PicksShopify carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NetApp, Inc.

476,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced recently that it is expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) efforts to identify users with suicidal motives by recognizing patterns in their posts and live videos. The company is set to roll out this feature globally except the European Union where data protection rules are different.In March this year, the company started an experiment to determine suicidal intent in text-based posts in the United States by using AI-based suicide prevention tools. The success of the test led the company to announce this global rollout.Regarding this latest initiative, although not much of technical details were shared, the company mentioned in a blog post that comments such as “Are you ok?” and “Can I help?” will act as signals.The company is also increasing the number of reviewers for such posts. AI will help the reviewers from the Community Operations team to prioritize the most serious ones. Reviewers can also escalate such issues to local authorities apart from directing users to connect to support organizations or friends.Facebook has been working on suicide prevention for a really long time. The company collaborated with suicide prevention groups like Forefront, Now Matters Now, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Save.org to provide users with suitable help.We believe these initiatives will significantly drive user dependence and reliability on Facebook, draw more users to the platform and thereby sustain its share price momentum. Notably, Facebook has gained 59.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 27.3% rally.Building a Better Community With AIFacebook’s attempts to protect the community indicate its new mission, which is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.""The company continues to invest heavily on developing AI technology as CEO Mark Zuckerberg considers AI to have “different strengths than people do.”Facebook set up an AI research center in Montreal, Canada in September. The company already has a research facility in Paris. In addition to these, Facebook operates two more AI focused labs in Menlo Park, CA and in New York City.The company strongly believes that technologies like AI will revolutionize the future and emerge as big business opportunities. Research firm IDC estimates that AI will be worth close to $46 billion by 2020.A few months back, Facebook deployed AI technology to contain terrorist activities on its platform. Facebook said that it will deploy advanced algorithms that can detect images, text, pages or groups that seem to promote extremism and take it down.The company also used AI to look at satellite images to locate survivors and victims in Hurricane Maria affected areas so as to provide them with connectivity and other resources.On the last conference call, management said that after being criticized for its Live feature where suicide-related activities were also streamed, the company made investment in AI tools, increased the number of reviewers working on it and brought down the time taken to review those Live videos to less than 10 minutes. The company expects to reduce the time further.The CEO was quoted saying, “Our community continues to grow and our business is doing well. But none of that matters if our services are used in ways that don't bring people closer together. We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.”We therefore believe, Facebook’s efforts in AI technologies bode well for long-term growth but the high investments remain an overhang on margins.Facebook, Inc.

479,NTAP,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN  -  Free Report) displayed its latest chipset, designed for high-resolution headlight systems at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES).The new DLP chipset is first of its kind that provides full programmability and highest resolution. Its resolution is 10,000 times more than all existing driving beam (ADB) technologies. It can work with any light source, be it LED or laser illumination.Texas’ lead customers have already started trying out the DLP5531-Q1 chipset, which is expected to be widely available in the second half of 2018. We believe that the new DLP chipset will see strong demand in the future from car manufacturers and Tier-1 suppliers as it will improve the driving experience.

481,NTAP,"Twitter Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Snap Inc. (SNAP  -  Free Report) are partnering with Fox Sports to provide coverage of FIFA World Cup 2018 to be held in Russia from Jun 15 to Jul 15.Twitter announced in a blog post that a half an hour live show will be streamed on the platform on each match day from Moscow's Red Square. The show will be hosted by Rachel Bonnetta and feature top personalities like Rob Stone, Landon Donovan, Kate Abdo, Alexi Lalas and Fernando Fiore.The show will also cover “match action previews, recaps and Twitter reaction as well as original segments produced by FOX’s team in Moscow” and will be available to the U.S audience via @FOXSoccer on Twitter.Fox Sports mentioned that a Publisher Story featuring daily updates of the tournament will be produced by it exclusively for Snap’s messaging application, Snapchat.Snapchat will also produce ""Our Stories"" that will cover video highlights of goals and other moments of the tournament provided by Fox Sports.Why is the Partnership Important?Twitter and Snapchat are trying to bring more video content to attract users.  We observe that both the companies are struggling to expand their user base and increase revenues.Twitter’s focus to boost user growth rate and engagement levels is evident from the fact that it is now exploring beyond news. Twitter has been focusing on ""live"" to turn around its fortunes. Live streaming has also resulted in an increase in tweet impressions.Twitter had earlier mentioned that streaming deals will fuel a “long-term shift away from desktop video to premium mobile environments and we believe Twitter is well positioned to benefit from that shift.”Notably, shares of Twitter have gained 39.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 26.7% rally. Snapchat is also having a hard time amid growing competition from other major social networks. Per a survey conducted by the investment firm Cowen, 96% of the 50 U.S. ad buyers surveyed preferred Snap’s arch rival Facebook Inc.’s (FB  -  Free Report) Instagram Stories, a blatant copy of Snapchat’s feature of the same name, for advertisements compared to just 4% who backed Snap Ads.Analysts fear that the company’s growth opportunities could be dampened because of slowing growth in its user base as advertisers will no longer be attracted to the platform.We believe this initiative of the company to woo audience and advertisers to its platform will help shares rebound. Notably, shares of Snap have lost 42.4% of their value since its listing date of Mar 2, 2017 against 21.1% growth of its industry. Zacks Rank Twitter has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Snap has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Key PickA better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NetApp Inc.

482,NTAP,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for NTAP’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Short Term Price Change for NetAppA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity. This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now. It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.With a one week price change of 0.1% compared to an industry average of 0.0%, NTAP is certainly well-positioned in this regard. The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large.Longer Term Price Change for NetAppWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of NTAP, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 42.8% to 16.5%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 47.4%. Clearly, NTAP is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors. NetApp, Inc. Price  NetApp, Inc. Price | NetApp, Inc. QuoteNTAP Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with NTAP as of late.Over the past two months, six earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that two estimate has move upwards with none downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, NTAP was expected to post earnings of $3.11 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $3.31 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have NTAP as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep NTAP on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

According to research firm IDC, the HCI market is anticipated to be a $6-billion opportunity by 2020.We believe that the acquisition will boost Cisco’s competitive position in the HCI market particularly against Nutanix (NTNX  -  Free Report). The company believes HyperFlex to be a better system as compared with Nutanix and others to address the challenges related to networking and performance of the HCI systems.Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus  Cisco Systems, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteThe product gained strong traction with Cisco attracting almost 1800 customers last year.NetApp: Next Target?Cisco is now speculated to show interest in Sunnyvale, CA-based NetApp, per Barron, which quoted Summit Redstone analyst, Srini Nandury.According to channel checks, the analyst noted that Cisco is likely to acquire NetApp (market capital of $11.04 billion) instead of flash-storage provider Pure Storage. Per the analyst, the deal will boost Cisco’s competitive position in the data center market against the likes of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report).We note that in accordance to its software-centric approach, Cisco has completed a plethora of acquisitions in the software space over the last couple of years. The list included bigwigs like Internet of Things (IoT) cloud service provider Jasper Technologies (for $1.4 billion in 2016) and app performance management software provider AppDynamics (for $3.7 billion in 2017).However, the company has been a laggard in the storage space prior to Springpath. Cisco’s last notable storage acquisition was solid-state memory systems provider WHIPTAIL, way back in 2013. But the acquisition failed to deliver and the company closed down Invicta Storage business (that it got from WHIPTAIL) in 2015.NetApp: A Long time PartnerCisco has been dependent on partners like NetApp and Dell-EMC for storage needs in the data center market. Its relationship with NetApp dates back to 2003. The company is currently a Cisco Original Storage Manufacturer (“OSM”).In June, Cisco-NetApp expanded product offerings by launching FlexPod SF solution, which includes NetApp SolidFire all-flash, scale-out, cloud-connected storage, Cisco UCS B-Series servers and Cisco Nexus switching.ConclusionNetApp can be an ideal acquisition candidate for Cisco due to their long running relationship. The company will be easy to integrate into Cisco’s existing business line-up and also accretive immediately as noted by the Summit Redstone analyst, Srini Nandury.However, apart from NetApp there are few other storage companies that can interest Cisco. We believe that Reduxio Systems, Nimbus Data, Qumulo are the noticeable ones.Reduxio secured $22.5 million of funding in an investment round in March, this year. Per Reuters, C5 Capital was the lead investor. Jerusalem Venture Partners, Carmel Ventures, Intel Capital and Seagate Technology also participated in this round.Per TechCrunch, Seattle-based Qumulo raised $40-million Series B investment in 2015.Currently, Cisco has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Revenues from Hardware Maintenance & Other Services (27.8% of total revenue) declined 6.4% year over year and 4.9% quarter over quarter to $368 million.

The figure was also 3% higher than the mid-point of the guidance.Although the narrower loss and revenue beat are positives for Pure Storage, it continues to experience intensifying competition due to the presence of major players such as Amazon’s Amazon Web Services, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure in cloud storage and NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report).Pure Storage stock has gained 11% year to date, underperforming the 11.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter DetailsIn the second quarter, Product revenues of $175 million surged 33.7% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by “strong repeat purchases” by existing and new customers.

493,NTAP,"Volatility has been dominating Wall Street over the past couple of weeks. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones saw second consecutive weeks of loss, with the Dow suffering its largest percentage decline in two weeks since mid-September 2016. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index witnessed the fourth week of losses, marking the longest weekly losing streak since May 2016 (read: 4 ETF Ways to Hedge Against Volatility).The Washington turmoil, a terrorist attack in Barcelona and rumors over the resignation of President Donald Trump's Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn led to investors’ pessimism, sparking off risk aversion. Investors losing faith over Trump’s ability to deliver business-friendly policies following the abandon of his plans to form an infrastructure advisory council to implement his keystone $1-trillion infrastructure spending plan took a toll on the stock market last week.Further, lingering tensions over North Korea and a slew of disappointing earnings reports added to the woes. In particular, Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) tumbled nearly 30% following weaker-than-expected earnings while Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) dropped 1.6% despite earnings and revenue beat.Both, network equipment maker Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) and data storage company NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report) issued weak sales forecasts for the current quarter while L Brands (LB  -  Free Report) cut its annual profit forecast on weakening sales that led to a decline in their share price following their reports (read: Consumer ETFs in Focus on Wal-Mart Earnings Beat).The feeble domestic backdrop coupled with a weak dollar has given an edge to international and commodity investing. As such, we have highlighted five top-performing ETFs of last week. Any of these could be strong momentum plays for investors should uncertainty prevail this week.iPath Pure Beta Aluminum ETN This note provides exposure to the Barclays Aluminum Pure Beta TR Index, which reflects returns that are potentially available through an unleveraged investment in the futures contracts in the aluminum markets.

Revenues from Hardware Maintenance & Other Services (27.8% of total revenue) declined 6.4% year over year and 4.9% quarter over quarter to $368 million.

497,NTAP,"Recently, Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) announced that it is set to exclusively premiere July Hygreck’s debut film, Blockbuster on the platform.The romantic comedy, starring Charlotte Gabris and Syrus Shahidi in the leading role, will be available on the streaming platform from Jan 24.Per the blog post, “If you like laughters, if like a good cry, if you like life, if you like Paris, if you like romantic comedies, if you like big blockbusters, if you like small blockbusters: you are going to like our Blockbuster.”Bringing the French original movie to the platform marks the company’s focus on international markets, which has been the key growth driver for it.Notably, shares of Netflix have gained 65.5% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 18.7% rally.Growing International FootprintNetflix’s efforts to rapidly expand internationally and into original regional content have paid off.Reportedly, 4.45 million new subscribers were added overseas in the last reported quarter. International Streaming revenues (44.5% of total revenue) soared 55.6% year over year to $1.327 billion driven by an increase in paid members in the third quarter. The company expects to add another 5.05 million international subscribers in the fourth quarter.Netflix’s investment in producing films is also beneficial for the company. The company’s portfolio of original films improved with the addition of Death Note, Naked and To the Bone to its platform in the third quarter.Per Nielsen data, which was quoted by Bloomberg, Bright released in December, starring Will Smith and Joel Edgerton, was made with a budget of $90 million.

499,NTAP,"On Jun 14, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index scaled a fresh high at closing. Yesterday’s rally can be attributed to strong showing by media, telecom and tech stocks fueled by market anticipation of mega merger deals. This also highlights the gradual fading of investors’ apprehensions regarding the trade and geopolitical issues, which was the primary reason behind severe market volatility in the last three months.On Jun 12, the favorable verdict regarding unconditional merger of AT&T and Time Warner by a U.S. district court opened the floodgate of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the integrated telecom-tech-media industry. The market is rife with speculations of similar deals, consequently propelling major media and telecom stocks. Market watchers consider this as further evidence of upbeat sentiment about the economy.With investors finally coming out of broad-based market fluctuations, it will be prudent to invest in tech stocks that are part of the Nasdaq Composite.Integration of Telecom-Cable TV-Media: A Survival StrategyFierce competition from tech behemoths has completely altered the market landscape, compelling telecom, cable TV and media operators to band together in order to survive. Vertical integration of distribution and content creation will create a unique platform to serve any sort of communications, broadcasting along with a vast area of entertainment industry.In order to derive maximum synergy from the combined video content and video distribution platform, telecom, cable TV and media operators are aggressively penetrating the digital advertising technology market. Currently, tech behemoths like Alphabet, Facebook and Twiter are major beneficiaries of digital advertisements.M&A to Provide Economies of ScaleThe merger between AT&T and Time Warner poses a fresh challenge to the likes of Alphabet Facebook and Twitter which dominate the online advertising space. If AT&T now decides to combine it broadband, mobile and online video streaming services with Time Warner’s films, television shows and sporting events, it will be capable of becoming a serious threat to tech companies.  Court’s approval of AT&T-Time Warner deal immediately triggered a merger battle between Comcast and The Walt Disney for majority assets of Twenty-First Century Fox. Moreover, stocks prices of other major media companies like Disney, CBS, Viacom and Discovery Communications also increased as all of these became lucrative takeover targets.Stock prices of telecom giants like Verizon, AT&T, Comcast and Charter Communications also increased as these potential acquirers of media companies will have a highly diversified business model and significant economies of scale if these buyouts take place.Our Top Picks  With U.S. economic growth being the sturdiest since recession, unemployment at an 18-year low, and both consumer and business confidence at high level despite the ongoing trade conflict, it makes sense to ride out the amazing growth momentum. At this stage, investment in Nasdaq stocks with strong earnings momentum will be lucrative option.We have narrowed down our search to five stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and strong growth potential.

500,NTAP,"Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report) owned Snapchat is evolving into a social platform from a mere photo or video sharing application. The company’s e-commerce strategy is a step toward that direction.Snap has recently teamed up with New York-based event ticket-search engine, SeatGeek that will let users buy tickets to events through Snapchat Stories.Snap has been working on in-app purchases for quite some time now. In February, Snap launched Snap Store to sell Snap merchandise, an alternative revenue channel for the company.However, the integration with SeatGeek will be the first time that Snap offers ticket-buying experience on the platform. The partnership will likely bring more sports, concerts or Broadway play events tickets to Snapchat.In October 2017, SeatGeek signed up Snap’s biggest rival Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) as its primary distribution partner.Why Snapchat?Growing popularity of Snapchat among teenagers is probably the reason that attracted SeatGeek to the platform.SeatGeek co-founder Russ D’Souza was quoted saying, “We see Snapchat as an incredible opportunity for teams and artists to increase discovery of their events while also potentially rewarding their most dedicated fans with exclusive offers.”SeatGeek recently entered into a multi-year partnership with National Football League (NFL) for serving as a secondary ticket provider for the league.Notably, the first sports league to feature on Snapchat’s Discover, in order to provide users access to football content, was NFL. A total of 42 million viewers of NFL content on the platform during the 2016-2017 session represented a huge chunk of its U.S. user base, which was 61.7 million in 2016, per eMarketer.Snapchat has 191 million daily actives on the platform. By giving users the convenience to purchase tickets on the app, the company will be able to stop them from migrating to other platforms. This will also result in an increase in user engagement and will likely drive advertisers to the platform.Snap Inc. Price Snap Inc. Price | Snap Inc.

502,NTAP,"This Global Week Ahead is likely to get off on the wrong foot.On Monday – with trading already finished up in Asia – Mainland Chinese stock indexes suffered through one of their most pessimistic days this year. This led to a knock-on decline across other Asian markets. The Asian sell-off then ripped up European sentiment, as trade war fears dominated the start of the second half of 2018.The CSI 300, a key index of big China stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, closed down -2.9%. This was its fifth-sharpest daily decline this year, according to Reuter’s data.Japanese and South Korea stock markets both ended down more than -2.0%, while the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 was -0.7% weaker when I looked in.For the remainder of this 4-day U.S. trading week, here are Reuters in London’s five big world market themes. These are likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders.I list them in order of importance to global equity markets.(1) Second Half of 2018 BeginsIt has been the worst first-half of a year for global stocks since 2010 as a mix of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in Europe wiped a trillion dollars off MSCI’s 47-country world index.But let us put that behind us — Monday is the first trading day of the second 2018 half.What lies ahead?What is certain is that the U.S. Fed will raise interest rates again, at least once, possibly twice. The ECB will end its bond-buying at the end of December. The Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and some big emerging market central banks will also raise interest rates.The question is whether more misery lies in store for assets such as Chinese stocks, which have entered bear-market territory. The yuan’s fate will be key to other emerging markets after losses of 5-8 percent on stocks and bonds.So who will emerge the winner?At this point it is the FAANG U.S. tech stocks, which collectively are up almost 40 percent.Whether the gains continue may depend on trade politics and Fed policy — a more aggressive Fed could ensure 10-year yields rise above 3 percent again and stay there.(2) Big Friday U.S. Non-Farm Payroll Print HappensJune’s U.S. unemployment data, due Friday, will be closely watched for further signs of a tightening labor market.Unemployment data for May boosted markets, with the rate falling to an 18-year low, pointing to strength in the U.S. economy, and helping send stocks up around 1 percent that day.Non-farm payrolls surged by 223,000 jobs during that month, as warm weather bolstered hiring at construction sites. June’s data is expected to show a 200,000 increase, according to a Reuters poll.The closely watched hourly wages in May rose 0.3 percent, topping economists’ estimates. The same figure is expected in June.(3) U.S.-China Trade War Shifts Up a GearThe Sino-U.S. trade conflict is about to shift into a higher gear, with additional tariffs on Chinese imports kicking in on July 6.Respective market moves indicate the United States has won Round One of the tariff war — the yuan just clocked up its worst month on record while China’s stock market suffered its deepest monthly slide since January 2016.This week, the yuan will take center-stage as investors wonder what action, if any, Beijing might take to stem the currency’s slide. Chinese policymakers are known for their readiness to intervene in the economy and financial markets and economy at any opportunity but they seem less interventionist this time.This could, of course, show commitment to a long-promised liberalization process. More likely though, authorities are signaling their readiness to use yuan weakness as a response to U.S. import tariffs.The risk is that an extended sell-off feeds off itself, sparking capital outflows. Without an easing in trade tensions it’s hard to see the yuan moves reversing, unless manufacturing and service sector surveys next week provide some relief.(4) Fallout from Presidential Elections in MexicoThe polls showed former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will be the next president, garnering over half of the votes.This is the third bid for the key job by AMLO, as the leftist Lopez Obrador is commonly known; his popularity has grown hand in hand with Mexicans’ anger at the failure of traditional parties to end record levels of violence and corruption.His history of protest politics has unnerved investors though and while throughout this campaign AMLO has courted Wall Street, he has still pledged to review a 2013 opening of the oil industry to private producers.The vote comes at a delicate point for Mexico, which is at odds with the United States over migration and trade, while talks on reworking the NAFTA trade agreement are deadlocked. The new president will have to steer his country through these issues.The peso sank to a 1 1/2-year low in June, though its weakness has mostly been blamed on a global emerging market sell-off. AMLO’s election win looks already priced in.(5) EU Migration Deal Gets ClosedAn EU deal to share out refugees on a voluntary basis and create “controlled centers” to process asylum requests has thrown a lifeline to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose coalition government has been teetering on the brink of collapse.Bavaria’s Christian Social Union met on Sunday to decide whether that deal addressed its concerns. They will meet again on Monday night. If not, it could make good on a promise to unilaterally introduce tougher immigration controls, potentially shattering its alliance with Merkel’s Christian Democrats and toppling her three-month-old government.But hopes a political crisis has been averted sent the euro and stock markets rallying on Friday. The gains could extend should the CSU give the agreement the thumbs-up.Italian debt has been the other beneficiary from the migrant deal. Investors, possibly, have interpreted the compromise by Rome’s anti-establishment government with EU peers as boding well for similarly contentious talks on Italian budget policies later this year.Top Zacks #1 Rank Stocks—NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report): This chip stock is stacking up to $143B in market capitalization. The Value score is F and the Growth score is A. You can call it either way, based on that.Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report): This is one of the biggest U.S. producers of natural gas. We haven’t seen a natural gas producer on this list for some time. It must be because WTI oil prices are rising above $70. The Value score is C and the Growth score is C.NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report): This is a $20B market cap Computer Storage Device stock. With a Zacks VGM score of B, this one may be worth picking up during the trade war sell-off, at some point.Key Global Macro Data—There is a load of ISM manufacturing monthly updates, out on Monday, across all global regions.The big macro fundamental prints come out of the USA. Look for non-farm payroll — on Friday — and the average hourly earnings data.On Monday, the China Caixin Manufacturing PMI came out at 51.0, versus a prior 51.1. No change is predictable. But no change in the face of a US China Trade War is notable.The India manufacturing PMI went up to 53.1 from a prior reading of 51.2.The German manufacturing PMI was 55.9 versus a prior reading of 55.9. Europe is also holding up well, in the face of the trade war rhetoric.The Eurozone manufacturing PMI was 54.9 versus a prior reading of 55.5.Eurozone unemployment gets updated. The last reading was 8.5%.The U.S. manufacturing PMI was 54.6. A new reading comes out.On Tuesday, the Eurozone retail sales data comes out. It was +1.7% y/y.Russia’s GDP growth went up +1.3% y//y. We get a fresh update.On Wednesday, the Eurozone composite PMI hits. The prior reading was 54.8.The Brazil Markit PMI composite was 49.7. We get a fresh monthly reading.

504,NTAP,"At times, it is prudent to hold on to certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Flex Ltd. (FLEX  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long-term benefits. Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Shares of Flex have gained 26.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the 13.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors in Favor of FlexFlex had reported stellar fiscal second-quarter 2018 results, wherein both the top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues also increased year over year primarily owing to the company’s focus on Industrial & Emerging Industries (“IEI”) and High Reliability Solutions (“HRS”) segments which improved diversification.The company has a diverse end-market as well as customer base thanks to its “Sketch-to-Scale” approach. Moreover, based on its growing intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio (1,200 patents, 1,100 pending), the company is well positioned to address the needs of customers who are looking to leverage the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous/connected cars, artificial intelligence (“AI”), Industrial automation, augmented & virtual reality (AR/VR), and 5G technologies.Flex thrives on low-cost manufacturing. The low-cost manufacturing improves competitiveness of its customers, which is a key catalyst. At the end of fiscal 2017, almost 80% of its manufacturing footprint was located in low-cost locations, such as Brazil, China, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Romania and Ukraine. It is to be noted that the low-cost strategy along with “Sketch-to-Scale” approach in diversified end-markets has made Flex a ready-to-go partner for brands and companies like Fossil, Skullcandy, Nike, Savari, Caruma Technologies among others.Acquisitions, over time, have been Flex’s most favored mode for expanding manufacturing footprint as well as penetrating new end markets. In the last five years, the company acquired 17 companies, most of which expanded the capabilities of HRS and IEI businesses. Apart from these, the company has made several smaller acquisitions over time, which has expanded capabilities in the medical devices, consumer electronics, household industrial and lifestyle market. The recently acquired AGM Automotive further increases the company’s capabilities in the automotive market. Expanding automotive business driven by a plethora of acquisitions drove HRS revenues in fiscal 2017.The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 16.7%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.7%.Risks PersistThe company faces stiff competition from other EMS providers like Jabil Circuit, Benchmark Electronics, Celestica, Sanmina-SCI Corporation and Taiwan-based Original Design Manufacturing (ODM) suppliers like Foxconn. Intensifying competition negatively impacted contract wins, which hurt top-line growth. Moreover, continuing investments on “Sketch-to-Scale” portfolio transition is expected to increase operating expenses. This will eventually keep margins under pressure at least in the near term.Further, Flex’s balance sheet is highly leveraged, which adds to the risk of investing in the company.Our TakeWe expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Hence, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

505,NTAP,"The technology sector has been one of the best performing sectors this year so far. However, not all the companies have fared that well. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) is one of them.IBM has been witnessing a year-over-year decline in its top-line over the last several quarters. The inconsistent revenue growth trajectory, slow transition to cloud, increasing competition and sluggish IT spending have been the major reasons behind the company’s dismal performance.So far this year, IBM has lost 8.5% against Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) gain of 32.3%.What’s Hurting the Company?IBM is under tremendous pressure due to its time consuming business model transition, which is negatively impacting results. Despite significant investments, the company is yet to gain a dominant position in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Hosted private cloud market. Intensifying competition in most of the markets is a major concern for the company.Contrary to expectations IBM’s focus on becoming a major force in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market with Watson has failed – at least in the near term.Moreover, IBM’s continuing investments and pricing pressure related to its legacy hardware business is a concern. We believe the underperforming legacy business segments will remain an overhang on the company’s bottom line till the business model transition, which is heavily time-consuming, is completed.IBM Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteIs Any Turnaround Possible in the Near Term?Although the company is undertaking a number of initiatives to counter the aforementioned challenges, its impact on quarterly results has not been significant.We believe that IBM’s significant investments in “Strategic Imperatives” – cloud computing, mobile, cognitive technologies and AI – will take some more time to deliver credible top-line growth.   IBM has also undertaken a number of blockchain initiatives to grab the growth opportunity in the industry. However, all the efforts are at a very nascent stage and will take time to contribute meaningfully to top-line growth. This is a significant headwind in our view.Moreover, Warren Buffett led conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s, the company’s largest shareholder, lowering of shares in IBM by 32% to 37 million in May raised concerns among investors and impacted the share price movement.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)We know that Buffett is a value investor as he mostly considers the intrinsic value (fair value of a stock calculated by its future earnings power) of a stock for making investment. His investment apart from value also includes understanding of the business, competitive advantages and capable management. Thus, the loss of Buffett’s confidence doesn’t bode well for the company.We believe that the company’s turnaround efforts will yield results in the long run though its impact on near-term results will likely remain muted.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderIBM carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include IPG Photonics Corp.

506,NTAP,"Shares of Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $47.64 on Dec 20, closing marginally lower at $47.56. The company has gained 38.4% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 33%. The stock has a market cap of $202.46 billion. What’s Behind the Rally?Intel is the global leader in the microprocessors market in terms of market share and product performance. The company not only focuses on selling separate components but also on optimizing platform for specific markets, including mobile, enterprise and digital home.The company recently announced Intel Stratix, the industry’s first field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated with high bandwidth memory to accelerate workloads and keep pace with data explosion.The newly added product will expand the onboard memory pool and add more bandwidth. We believe that the launch will improve scalability, reliability, power and density requirements of future HPC deployments.Intel also announced substantial advances in its wireless product portfolio to accelerate 5G adoptions, alongside introducing Intel XMM 8000 series and Intel XMM 7660 series modems. The launch of Xeon Scalable, Core 8 chips, Myriad X and next-generation desktop processors are also key catalysts for thecompany.The new desktop processors are expected to help Intel's gaming endeavors amid stiff competition from AMD and NVIDIA. Moreover, the launch of Core 8 is expected to boost PC market share.Partnerships and AcquisitionsIntel has also been active on the acquisitions front. Its acquisition of Israel-based Mobileye, an autonomous vehicle technology provider, has enabled it to enter the autonomous car technology market currently dominated by NVIDIA and Qualcomm. The company’s continued investment in Internet of Things (IoT) and non-volatile memory storage, primarily targeting enterprise/data center customers, are also aiding the stock’s momentum.Additionally, the company also partnered with Micron to develop memory technologies. This led to the production of the densest 3D NAND technology. Intel also launched Optane, its non-volatile storage (NVM) product based on 3D XPoint technology this year.EarningsIntel reported third-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of $1.01 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 21 cents. The figure surged 26.3% from the year-ago quarter and 40.3% sequentially.The strong earnings growth was driven by better-than-expected top-line performance and operating margin expansion. Moreover, Intel Channel Alliance Program (ICAP) contributed 13 cents to quarterly earnings.Revenues totaled$16.15 billion, up 2.4% year over year and 9.4% quarter over quarter. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.71 billion. After adjusting for the McAfee (formerly Intel Security Group) transaction, revenues grew 6%.Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Intel Corporation QuoteTo ConcludeIts diversified product segments form the base of Intel’s data-centric business model.We believe that growing demand for server chips that are used in data centers from cloud-based service providers like Amazon.com, Alphabet and Microsoft is a key catalyst for Intel.Moreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. Intel currently trades at a forward P/E of 14.47x as against the industry group average of 23.30x.Intel has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 9.75%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksIntel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some of the top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corp.

507,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced a partnership with Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi to launch its next generation of virtual reality (VR) products at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.Facebook revealed that Xiaomi, apart from being the hardware partner of its cheaper VR headset – Oculus GO – unveiled last October, will also develop new VR headset called Mi VR Standalone exclusively for the Chinese market. Both the products are based on Oculus technology and powered by Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) Snapdragon 821 Mobile VR Platform.Facebook’s vice president of VR Hugo Barra, who worked previously for Xiaomi, revealed that the new product is similar to Oculus Go in terms of core hardware features and design. Apart from that, it also supports Oculus's mobile software developer kit, thereby making it easier for Oculus developers to bring their content to the Mi VR Store in China.We believe that Facebook’s attempt to diversify will help the company penetrate the world’s most populous market, where its main service has been blocked since 2009. Facebook's target to bring a billion people to use VR in the near future is expected to be aided by this.Notably, Facebook has gained 50.8% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 26.8% rally.Facebook’s VR EffortsFacebook’s focus to expand its VR capabilities is well reflected in Barra’s words who was quoted saying, “We’ve worked closely with Qualcomm to deliver the highest possible level of performance to meet the high computing demands of the standalone VR product category.”We note that Facebook is trying to fuel its ambitious AR/VR efforts with Oculus which it had acquired for $2 billion in 2014. Oculus has long been dubbed as a multibillion dollar opportunity along with Facebook’s other subsidiaries like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that Facebook will spend over $3 billion to build these technologies over the next 10 years. Zuckerberg believes that VR will emerge as a major computing platform in the coming years.Oculus GO, which carries a price tag of $199, will be shipped this year, per the company.Last October, following mixed reviews from critics and users, the company slashed the price of its other VR headset, Rift.Zuckerberg was quoted saying last February that the virtual reality efforts aren’t profitable now. However, he asked the investor community to be patient as investments in VR will take some time to generate profits.Apart from headsets, Facebook’s VR offering include Facebook Spaces. Spaces will enable users to connect with family and friends in an interactive virtual environment. Users can create their VR avatar and customize it to make it look like them. The app will not only help to create a virtual world but also keep users connected to reality by enabling Messenger calling.Given the massive growth potential, there is tremendous interest in AR/VR. Right from Facebook to Alphabet to Microsoft, all are pumping in resources to develop these technologies. According to an IDC report, global revenues from the AR/VR market will grow to a whopping $143.3 billion by 2020.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Facebook, Inc.

The move came on solid volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. The stock picked up sharply from the near-flat trend of $40.47 to $42.99 in the past one month time frame.The upside was driven by rumors of the company being one of the early investors in the crypto currency Ripple, which can boost Seagate’s earnings.The company has seen estimate revision of no increase and one decrease over the past few weeks, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter remained unchanged.

Interestingly, the first episode will feature former U.S. president Barack Obama on a TV talk show for the first time since he left office.Other than Obama, the one-hour monthly talk show will have a single guest in a long-format interview as well as in-between segments.  Its lineup of guests includes influential personalities like George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z, Tina Fey and Howard Stern.The company first revealed its plans for the show in last August when CCO Ted Sarandos was quoted saying that Netflix's original content effort will get a boost from bringing “a true television icon” like Letterman on board as he is a master at “out in the wild, out from behind the desk and interviewing the people he finds most interesting.”In a separate release, the streaming giant also announced that it is developing a 20-episode original series Untitled Sabrina Project starring Kiernan Shipka. The one-hourly drama is an adaptation of Archie Comics’ The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.We believe the company's improving content portfolio will drive subscriber growth and boost the stock price. Notably, shares of Netflix have gained 60.3% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 14.2% rally.Expanding Original Content: Key CatalystLast week, Netflix announced that it is set to launch a sequel to its highly popular production, Bright starring Will Smith and Joel Edgerton. Per Nielsen data, which was quoted by Bloomberg, the movie Bright with a budget of $90 million attracted 11 million views between Dec 22 and 24, 2017.We believe that the company’s continued focus on producing quality original content is driving its top line. Reportedly, there will be 80 original movies this year, with expenditure on original content expected to be $8 billion. This is a substantial jump from 40 original movies and budget of $6 billion in 2017.Netflix’s expanding catalogue of original content will continue to be a growth driver in 2018. The addition of Death Note, Naked and To the Bone to its platform in the third quarter is worth mentioning.The company’s efforts to boost regional programming are also helping it expand its international presence. The company also reported profits from its international operations in the last reported quarter.At the end of the previous quarter, Netflix's paid streaming members across the globe increased 24.9% year over year to approximately 104 million.

510,NTAP,"Shares of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) rallied to a 52-week high of $88.41 on Jan 5, eventually closing marginally lower at $88.19. The momentum can be attributed to its recent acquisition of Avere Systems as well as increasing traction in blockchain technology.Notably, the stock has returned 40.8% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 37.5%. The stock has a market cap of $653.35 billion.What’s Driving the Stock?Microsoft’s acquisition of Avere Systems, a start-up specializing in data storage systems, will help strengthen and increase the use of Microsoft’s Azure public cloud.

As per the company’s first quarter fiscal 2018 results, server product and cloud services revenues went up 17% year over year, with Azure revenues soaring 89% in the same period.Microsoft is also gaining from its increasing traction in blockchain technology. Its collaboration with Bank Hapoalim for the use of blockchain technology for digital bank guarantees is aiding Azure to penetrate the cloud market.Recently, the company released updates for Windows to prevent malware attacks from exploiting Meltdown Vulnerability in Intel x86-64 processors.

The company has gained 37.7% in the last year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%. The stock has a market cap of $27.64 billion.What’s Behind the Rally?The rally in shares can be accredited to Corning’s leadership in glass substrates, strong relationships and share buyback policy and acquisition of 3M’s communication market division.With increasing demand for efficient data networks for mobile devices, Corning’s fiber optic solutions business has seen significant growth. Itis expected to act as a key growth catalyst over the next few years.The company has also been benefiting from its innovations in the glass substrate industry.

512,NTAP,"Holding onto shares of Pegasystems Inc. (PEGA  -  Free Report) might not be a good option. Shares of Pegasystems have lost 17.6% in the past six months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 17.1%. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock might continue to witness a downside. A key reason for this is the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year 2017, we have seen two estimates move south in the past 60 days with no upward revisions.

514,NTAP,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.6% over the past month. NTAP hit a new 52-week high of $72.93 in the previous session. NetApp has gained 31.7% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 21.6% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 23, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $1.05 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.86%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $4.05 per share on $6.19 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.71% change in EPS on a 4.74% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.72 per share on $6.5 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.61% and 5.06%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are An and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.1X versus its peer group's average of 14.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.5. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 3% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

515,NTAP,"On Monday, the Nasdaq hit a fresh record high for the first time in almost three months. A rally in tech and consumer discretionary stocks ensued, indicating that investors are choosing to ignore trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts. Instead, markets are focusing on strong economic fundamentals following last Friday’s strong jobs report.The major catalyst to the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which hit an all-time high. Analysts believe that this is further evidence of upbeat sentiment about the economy. With investors choosing to show confidence in a sector which has had a turbulent ride this year, this seems to be the best time to invest in tech stocks that are part of the Nasdaq.   Apple, Amazon, Microsoft Power Broader GainsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Monday, finishing at a record level for the first time since Mar 12. One of the major drivers of the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple. The iPhone maker’s stocks gained 0.8% to hit an all-time high. Gains were primarily attributable to the enthusiastic response to the company’s WWDC 2018 keynote. Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) also contributed to the day’s gains, increasing 1.5% to hit a record high. Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) shares also gained 0.9% to hit a new record. These gains came after the software giant revealed that it was buying software developer GitHub for $7.5 billion. As a result, the Nasdaq failed to hit an intraday high by only around 0.5%.Investors Focusing on Economic FundamentalsStocks had surged last Friday following encouraging data from the Department of Labor. The economy added 223,000 jobs in May even as unemployment plummeted to an 18-year low. Additionally, wage gains remained limited, curbing fears about surging inflation which had caused losses in February.Investors continued to focus on the positive sentiment that this report spurred on Monday. Analysts are of the opinion that the surge in shares of Apple was an expression of confidence in the state of the U.S. economy.In choosing to focus on strong fundamentals, investors ignored a spate of headwinds that dampened sentiments recently. These include trade tensions with China and geopolitical concerns emanating from the discord with North Korea and the political situation in Italy.Our ChoicesFresh evidence of the United States’ robust economic health has pushed investors toward riskier assets over the last two trading days. Tech stocks, which have had a somewhat rocky ride this year, are once again the favored option of investors.Investing in large tech stocks which make up the Nasdaq looks like a smart option at this time. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

Product revenue increased 14% from the prior year period, and NetApp said that all-flash array annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion increased 58% year-over-year. Shares closed that initial November trading day at $56.41.The stock kept up its #1 run until well into January and was made a Strong Buy stock again on April 20. This was most likely due to analyst bullishness as the company headed into its fourth earnings report, as well as the lingering effects of impressive Q3 results. During the third quarter, net revenues grew 8% year-over-year, earnings beat our estimate, and guidance was positive and above what analysts were expecting. Six months after first becoming a Zacks Rank #1, shares of NTAP were up almost 22% to $68.66.NTAP held onto the #1 rank for another good run, thanks to a strong Q4 performance. Both its top and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus, with net revenues increasing 11% year-over-year; 2018 product revenue jumped 15% from 2017. And, free cash flow was 23% for the year and increased 64% year-over-year.As a result, the stock was given the Strong Buy title once again on June 1 and has been able to hold on to that rank ever since. Eight months after first becoming a Zacks Rank #1, shares of NTAP grew 24% to $69.71. Additionally, shares of the cloud company are up around 70% in the past one-year period.This table shows the price performance of NTAP (in red), as well as the 12-month forward looking EPS estimate (in green) over the last one year.

518,NTAP,"Investors in NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 25, 2018 $68.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NetApp shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NetApp is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Computer- Storage Devices industry that ranks in the Top 4% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.00 per share to $1.01 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NetApp right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.Notably, the company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 63.13%.On the revenue front, Lions Gate witnessed a surge of 51.9% year over year to approximately $1.14 billion.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors Lions Gate Media Networks’ segment, formed after the acquisition of Starz, continues to drive its top line on the back of strong growth in over-the-top (OTT) and international digital media licensing arrangements. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Media Segment is currently pegged at $375 million. In the year-ago quarter, segment revenues amounted to $370.8 million.The addition of Starz is also aiding the company to emerge as a major player in the TV space and helping it regain lost ground in the streaming network.In the soon-to-be reported quarter, Starz and Altice USA signed a new multi-year affiliation agreement, which gives the latter broader access to Starz programming on video-on-demand and authenticated streaming platforms. This is expected to boost Starz subscriber base.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Television Production revenues stands at $272 million, up 12% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.However, fewer movie slates in fiscal 2018 compared with the previous year is anticipated to hurt Motion Pictures revenue performance. The segment is likely to face tougher year-over-year comparisons as the company benefited immensely on account of robust performance of La La Land, winner of six Academy Awards, John Wick: Chapter Two, and The Shack, in the year-ago period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Motion Pictures Segment is currently pegged at $415 million, indicating a decline of 36.5% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.

(ADSK  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2019 results on May 24.In the last reported quarter, the company reported non-GAAP loss of 9 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. The figure was also better than the company’s guided range of a loss of 10-14 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 21.7%.Revenues of $553.8 million beat the consensus mark of $545.3 million and increased nearly 15.7% year over year. The figure surpassed the guided range of $537-$547 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key FactorsAutodesk’s results are expected to be driven by its core business, which comprises maintenance, product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions.Autodesk is gaining from robust growth in product subscription. Autodesk’s broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. The company’s growing maintenance to subscription program coupled with increasing adoption of Collections is a tailwind.Moreover, increasing spend by customers of Collections is leading to an increase in the company’s average recurring revenues (ARR) and average revenue per subscriptions (ARPS).For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARR is $2.12 billion, up 21.7% from the reported number in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company’s e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription sales in the last reported quarter. Moreover, half of AutoCAD LT subscriptions in the United States came through the e-store.Although cloud remains a very small contributor to Autodesk’s total business, growing momentum of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is a positive.However, churn rate for maintenance subscribers is expected to remain high, given the rise in cost of staying on a maintenance plan.Management expects billings growth in the quarter to be impacted by tough year-over-year comparison as the company recorded strong billings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Further, cash flow in the quarter will be negatively impacted by the company’s restructuring activity and exit tax related to the shift of European operations center to Dublin from Switzerland.Autodesk, Inc.

523,NTAP,"Shares of Acxiom Corporation (ACXM  -  Free Report) have climbed about 15.3% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the year-to-date period, its shares have gained 43.1%, while the industry recorded growth of just 16.4%.Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent fundamentals and trends in order to get a better understanding of the important drivers.Growth DriversAcxiom recently inked a deal with Interpublic Group (IPG  -  Free Report) to divest its Acxiom Marketing Solutions segment (“AMS”) for $2.3 billion in cash. Post sell-off, the company will change its brand name to LiveRamp and start trading under the new ticker “RAMP”.Acxiom has been devising methods to maximize the output of its AMS segment. The deal marks an expanded relationship between IPG and LiveRamp. The company now aims to focus on its ""LiveRamp"" segment which is registering impressive growth and gaining traction.The company had acquired LiveRamp for approximately $310 million in 2014. We feel the recent divestiture will further enhance the company’s ability to curb operating expenses and generate solid bottom-line growth along with greater financial flexibility.In the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results, revenues in the Marketing Services segment (accounted for 40.4% of total revenues) rose 5.3% year over year to $99 million, while LiveRamp revenues surged 32% year over year. This impressive growth trend bodes well for Acxiom. We believe reinforcing focus on LiveRamp segment holds promise in the longer haul.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Axciom's current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 per share, up from earnings of $1.02 per share earlier.Style Scores Look GreatAxciomcurrently sports an A grade for Growth and B grade for Momentum, lifting its overall VGM score to B.ValuationOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 38.5x, significantly lower than the industry average of 64.8x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Consequently, lower the P/E of a stock, the better for investors.To ConcludeNotably, the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 27.7%. Additionally, the stock has long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%.In our opinion, the stock deserves a place in investor’s portfolio and we are expecting an impressive return from the stock in the next few months.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

524,NTAP,"The U.S. stock markets have been reeling from severe volatility since February primarily owing to inflationary concerns and global trade war fears. In June, trade conflicts escalated to an unprecedented level as countries of European Union and NAFTA treaty also bore the brunt of U.S. tariffs beside China. Additionally, geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and oil price fluctuations also fueled volatility in the Wall Street.Despite the presence of several destabilizing elements in the markets, the S&P 500 – stock markets most closely watched index – is in the positive territory year to date. The benchmark index is up almost 2%, in the first half of 2018.In fact, this stock market barometer - commonly used to gauge broader market movement - has witnessed northbound movement in the last three months.

At this stage, investment in S&P 500 stocks with favorable Zacks Rank and significant growth potential will be a prudent move.U.S. Economy Remains HealthyThe U.S. economic growth is at its sturdiest since recession. On Jun 13, the Fed raised forecast for 2018 GDP growth from 2.7% in March to 2.8%. The primary catalyst behind these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%. Moreover, repatriation of income will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Strong Labor MarketOn Jun 1, the Department of Labor reported that the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in May, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000. The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, its lowest in 18 years. The decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened.

The June reading was highest in last four months as well as better than the consensus estimate of 58.4. The manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 12% of the U.S. economy. Notably, readings over 50% indicate more companies are expanding instead of shrinking.Robust Earnings Momentum   Second-quarter earnings results have been exhibiting strong momentum so far. Total earnings are expected to be up 19% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. It is to be noted that the first quarter witnessed the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. For full-year 2018, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are anticipated to be up 20.2% on 6.3% higher revenues.

525,NTAP,"The Computer – Storage Devices industry is witnessing an exponential rise on widespread use of streaming media, cloud storage solutions, cloud-based apps, data virtualization and other data-intensive chores.The key driving force of the worldwide storage devices market is its increasing use in mobile devices that have now higher memory capacities. Rampant growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals have compelled several companies to turn to storage devices vendors. This represents significant growth opportunity for the industry players.As consumers’ dependence on cloud for storage purpose increases, a proportionate rise in demand for cloud-dedicated data centers is inevitable. Also, with simultaneous increase in data volumes, demand for cloud-based storage systems in data centers is likely to grow significantly.Extensive implementations of CRM solutions, increased Internet and mobile penetration, rapidly growing media and regulatory compliance have resulted in data explosion for enterprises. Now, these enterprises are realizing the importance of storing information which, in turn should favor growth.Banking on the rise of connected devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI), the Computer – Storage Devices industry remains a lucrative investment opportunity.Industry Offers Solid Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 27.5%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 12.5% and 19.2%, respectively.The secular growth of digital data and higher demand for storage especially for SSDs, contributed to the performance of both the sector and the S&P 500. Sector Stocks Trading CheapOwing to the strong fundamentals of the industry over the past year, the valuation looks attractive. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Computer – Storage Devices stocks because their earnings are effective in gauging performance.    Generally, the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings. As forecasts for expected earnings move higher, demand for the stock should drive its price. If the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company’s inherent strength.This ratio essentially measures a stock’s current market value relative to its earnings performance. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 11.58, near the lowest level over the past year and below the median level of 12.15. Clearly, there is plenty of upside left.The space also looks quite inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.9 and the median level is 20.17. Outperformance to Continue on Robust Earnings OutlookRobust market adoption of cloud computing, big data, IoT, auto, connected devices, VR, and AI will continue to drive the industry and have encouraged many companies to raise their projections for the current fiscal year. This optimism is likely to help Computer – Storage Devices stocks generate positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The earlier valuation discussion shows that market participants have been willing to pay up for these stocks already, potentially limiting further upside from current levels.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and its aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018. This becomes even clearer when we focus on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $4.70 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the earnings per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has evolved recently. The consensus earnings per share estimate for the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry reflects solid year-over-year improvement.Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that sell-side analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 7.8% upward since Mar 31, 2018.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Robust ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #17, which places it at the top 7% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks. Computer – Storage Devices Stocks Promise Long-Term GrowthThe long-term prospects for the industry are alluring. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has shown signs of improvement since mid-April 2018 to reach the current level of 15.25%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite. Moreover, the growing demand of  data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics and cloud computing to store, manage, protect, and analyze data are some of the incredible business drivers. These factors are expected to drive growth in top line that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016. In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be another reason for the steady top line growth that the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry has witnessed since 2016. Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group’s gross margin. Bottom LineThis is a great place to invest in right now, both with respect to the near term and the longer term. Factors like an improving unit revenue scenario, increased demand for connected devices, cheap valuation and growing need for improved data storage to eliminating data portability issues are positives for the sector and might contribute to long-term growth.Keeping these factors in mind, investors may look for some good entry points in the stocks that will help them make the most of the momentum in the industry.Here, we list three stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)NetApp, Inc.

527,NTAP,"Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) is trying to maintain its “cool quotient” in order to prevent users from shifting to other applications. The company’s recent announcement to launch a Lip Sync Live feature is a step toward that direction.The Lip Sync Live option that will be available while streaming a Facebook Live video will let users lip sync to a popular song alone or with friends, add descriptions and customize the video with filters and effects.Notably, the feature will be a direct competitor to the highly popular video creation and live broadcasting app, Musical.ly, which has a dominant younger user base.Facebook’s recent move is thus seen as a way to lure young users to the platform as the popularity of the main platform among them is on the decline per a recent report.Moreover, we believe with videos becoming the primary mode of communication, Facebook is trying to capitalize on the trend with such additions.Notably, Facebook has gained 9.4% year to date, while the  industry declined 2% over the same time frame.  Video PushFacebook has been aggressively promoting Live in order to boost its top line. The company has taken a number of initiatives to capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media platforms. It has also been improving its scope of monetization through video views on its platform.CEO Mark Zuckerberg had stated last year that, “video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do that.”Further, management notes Stories to be a big part of the future of video sharing. Probably, it is the reason why the company will start testing options for adding music to Facebook Stories in the coming months.We believe the addition of such engaging features on the main platform will help the company drive “meaningful engagement” among users. Moreover, it could have a strong influence onGeneration Z, the upcoming market for advertisers and marketers.However, higher investments on video and increase in royalties that the social media giant is offering to major record labels and music publishers to host content on all its platforms will remain an overhang on margins.Facebook, Inc.

In its last earnings report on May 23, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $1.05 versus consensus estimate of $1.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.86%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $3.54 per share on $6.19 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.71% change in EPS on a 4.77% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.03 per share on $6.51 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.15% and 5.13%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 22.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 20.6X versus its peer group's average of 13.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.6. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 7% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

530,NTAP,"The technology sector, which has showed its immense strength against the trade and tariff threats recently on the FANG surge, has lost its ground following news of a potential curb in Chinese investment. In fact, the sector pushed Wall Street even lower on Jun 27 with the S&P 500 Technology Sector dropping 1.5% and Philadelphia semiconductor index sliding 2.5%.What Happened?The Trump administration is seeking to limit many Chinese companies from investing in U.S. technology firms and block additional technology exports to that country. The Treasury Department is working on the rules to block companies with at least 25% Chinese ownership from buying companies involved in ""industrially significant technology.” The measures are expected to be announced by the end of this week and are intended to counter Beijing's Made in China 2025 strategic plan. Under this plan, China wants to become a global leader in 10 broad areas of technology, including robotics, aircraft and aircraft components, advanced rail equipment, electrical-generation and transmission equipment and pharmaceuticals and advanced medical devices.As such, the potential move would hurt the tech sector more broadly than just the semiconductors and hit revenues, earnings and stock prices of the tech titans having significant exposure to China.Solid OutlookHowever, the outlook for the technology sector has been encouraging. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Additionally, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher. Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically perform well in a maturing economic cycle.How to Buy the DipGiven encouraging long-term trends, investors could definitely tap the current dip in the stocks. While there are many stocks in the space having a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), we have highlighted six big technology names (market cap of more than $10 billion) that have seen their Rank surging to the top rank.All these are backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others and have a potential to beat the ongoing trade turmoil.

533,NTAP,"With WWDC announcements making headlines, other news gets pushed to the backburner. So here are the highlights from Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) big event for developers, as well as a brief recap of other events-WWDCApple’s Worldwide Developers Conference included a number of important announcements-iOS 12: The new OS focuses on speed improvements (even for 6S owners), probably inspired by the user discontent of slowdown in older iPhones and the growing role of its services business, which will require faster speeds to be effective. So apps are now expected to get 40% faster, with the camera launching up to 70% faster.It introduces Group FaceTime for iPhone, iPad, Mac and in audio mode on Apple Watch. Up to 30 people can join in (targeting enterprise users).ARKit 2.0 brings improved face tracking, more realistic rendering, 3D object detection and continuous experiences that can be shared. So multiplayer AR games are facilitated across different Apple devices (doesn’t include Android devices for now at least).Photos get better search and share options.It brings new animojis and a new concept called memoji, which is basically and animoji that has lends itself to personalization by the user.Screen Time and Reports apps that allow the user to track when and how time is spent on the device so users can better manage time.  Updated parental controls allow parents to track their kids’ time and create allowances for chosen apps and time limits, after which the device will become inactive.New Mac OS Called Mojave: The new OS has dark mode so you can reduce the glare. It also comes with better curation, featuring some original content. There will also be better synchronization with iPhone, for example, you can turn on your iPhone camera from your Mac with the picture subsequently taken appearing automatically on your Mac.Apple is also creating the framework necessary (including things like trackpad support and window resizing) to start bringing iOS apps to Mac. The first apps coming will be Stocks, News, Home and Voice Memos. The feature will be available to developers in 2019.Siri: Apple’s personal assistant is somewhat handicapped with respect to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) because the company doesn’t consume as much user data, but it’s now doing a catchup with a feature called Shortcuts. This is a single command that sets off a cluster of routine activity surrounding the command.Watch: The device is getting more sensitive with respect to automatically identifying your activity while adding new activity forms like yoga and hiking. You can now also set targets/challenges between friends and compare notes. The connected device also doubles as a walkie talkie, if you want it.CarPlay OS for autos is getting support for third-party apps like Google Maps, Waze, Google Play Music, Spotify, NPR and iHeartRadio, as well as Siri support.Apple TV is getting Dolby Atmos audio. Also, a single sign on to the service allows access to all the apps, removing the headache that comes from remembering passwords for the different apps. There’s also a new video of Earth in the background for Apple devices.Encouraging numbers: Apple said that the App Store now has 20 million registered developers on iOS, collectively making about $100 billion in revenues from around 500 million visitors per week. Over 350,000 of iOS apps have been written in Swift. Apple Watch sales grew 60% in 2017. Apple TV users have grown 50% over the past year, as it now offers more than 100 video channels including several new live news and sports channels.HomePod Update and Expansion Apple’s HomePod that launched amidst mixed reviews will launch in Canada, France and Germany on June 18 following its launch in the U.S., UK and Australia.The device is also getting a software update that will support both multi-room audio (by pairing with some model speakers from Bang & Olufsen, Denon, Marantz and Sonos using Apple’s AirPlay 2 streaming tech) and stereo audio playback (by pairing two or more HomePods across the house). Just ask Siri.The HomePod will also let users hear upcoming calendar appointments.Apple Allows Updates to Telegram Messaging AppRussian authorities have been trying to crack down on messaging app Telegram, which has been IP hopping to remain in operation while requesting its 14 million users in Russia (it has 200 million across the world) to use VPNs to avoid detection. Russian law requires that all data from apps be stored in servers inside the country and be shared with authorities.Apple has prevented updates to the app after the authorities reportedly wrote to it to remove the app from the App Store and prevent push notifications. Apple didn’t do either. So it isn’t clear what prompted Apple to block updates globally, or whether at all it was related to the problem in Russia and what caused the change of heart. But Apple generally plays by the rules: it earlier pulled NYT from the App Store in China when required by the government.    Apple Won’t Attend EU HearingApple has said that it didn’t want a public hearing on its tax evasion issue in Ireland, because the court is set to rule on its appeal on June 21 and a public hearing at this juncture could be detrimental to its case. Apple was ordered to pay 13 billion euros (11.4 billion pounds) in back taxes to Ireland. Both Apple and Ireland have appealed the court’s decision, although after much delay, Ireland has finally created an escrow account into which Apple could deposit the disputed taxes and last month, Apple deposited the first instalment into it.Samsung Must Pay Apple $539 MillionThe jury has ruled that Samsung must pay Apple the above amount, around $140 million more than the previous order, for infringing on some of Apple’s design patents. At issue here was whether Apple deserved compensation on the basis of end value of the device or the value of components that were copied. The jury appears to have gone with the latter. This brings a long-awaited end to a case that has been dragging on since 2011 on designs (like rounded corners) that don’t seem particularly patent-worthy today. RecommendationsApple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Technology stocks worth buying instead are Akamai Technologies (AKAM  -  Free Report), NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report), Aspen Technology (AZPN  -  Free Report) and SS&C Technologies & Holdings (SSNC  -  Free Report). Or take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Domain name registrations increased 3.7 million or 1.1% year over year.Country Code Top-Level Domains (“ccTLDs”) increased 3.2% year over year and 0.3% sequentially to 144.7 million in the September quarter. On a combined basis, .com and .net domain names increased 1.2% year over year to approximately 145.8 million in the third quarter.The company is benefiting from strong gTLD prospects. New gTLDs (“ngTLD”) represent 6.4% of total domain name registrations.Reportedly, new .com and .net registrations were 8.9 million compared with 8.3 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by strong demand in the United States. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).Shares of VeriSign have gained 45.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the 41.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Domain Registration ProspectsVeriSign is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).The company announced a new agreement with ICANN per which the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will be increased from $8.20 to $9.02 effective Feb. 1, 2018.

The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as in international markets. Rise in bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is also contributing to an increase in domain name registrations, which is a tailwind for the company.However, a significant headwind for VeriSign is the soft growth in active domain name business for .com and .net TLDs.Also, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain headwinds.VeriSign, Inc.

536,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced a number of initiatives in its attempts to build a safer community.In its latest blog post, Facebook revealed that “engagement bait” posts that forcibly seek an individual’s attention by provoking them to like, share or comment will be demoted by the company.The social media giant also unveiled tools to prevent harassment on the platform as well as on Messenger by preventing friend requests and messages from a separate account of a user who has already been blocked.Facebook is also coming down heavily on fake accounts by using signals like the IP address of the user.Facebook also rolled out changes to tackle unwanted conversations on Messenger. Per the company, once the conversation is ignored by the reader, notifications will be disabled and it will subsequently be moved to Filtered Messages Folder. The sender will not be intimated whether the message has been read, thus eliminating any chance of abuse outside the platform.Facebook also unveiled an advanced version of its face recognition technology to help users identify pictures in which they are not tagged as well as help them detect when others use their images as profile picture.  Facebook’s aim as reported by the company is “to reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading in order to promote more meaningful and authentic conversations on Facebook.”We believe these initiatives will significantly drive Facebook’s user base and sustain the share price momentum. Notably, Facebook has gained 50.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 24.6% rally.Developing Social InfrastructureFacebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover’s advantage in this market. The company’s user base continues to grow at a significant pace driven by new features and tools that improve engagement.Facebook’s continuous efforts clearly indicate that the company is on track to accomplish its mission to protect the community.In February, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in his statement, “the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.”We note that rising abuse on social media is a serious concern these days. Cyber bullying and trolling are a serious threat to user growth on social networking platforms.Facebook’s initiatives to declutter News Feed, which is the first thing the user views after logging on the platform, and provide more security to users will help drive user satisfaction in our view.The company’s emphasis to drive user engagement by making the platform safer to use is expected to be accretive to its growth. The latest developments to make the platform more viable are encouraging.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Facebook, Inc.

538,NTAP,"As one of the largest hard disk drive producers in the United States, Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) is riding on its acquisitions and an expanding SSD storage market. Here is why you should add this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock to your portfolio.Western Digital has returned 3.1% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s gain of 2%. The company is experiencing robust demand in end markets as well as strong growth prospects for flash-based storage products.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryWestern Digital outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.43%.Further, the company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 25.1%.Expanding SSD Market & Cloud DeploymentWestern Digital has been expanding into the SSD storage market due to declining sales in the PC market. The emergence of thinner laptops, tablets and demand for fast processing storage devices in the past few years has created an ideal market for SSDs. Due to the expansion in digital data, modest growth of TAM and higher demand for storage, Western Digital’s long-term prospects look exciting.Anticipating potential acceleration in cloud deployments, Western Digital is investing heavily to deliver high capacity storage devices that will support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications. Additionally, the company has expanded its My Cloud solutions with My Cloud EX4, which enables the user to manage and store huge volumes of digital data.Acquisitions Driving GrowthWestern Digital’s acquisition of SanDisk has aided the company’s growth and also helped it to gain traction in SSD.  Additionally it has allowed the company to step in to the NAND products market, which, owing to its strong demand, will drive the company’s revenues.Moreover, the company’s acquisition of Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio.ValuationMoreover, from a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Western Digital currently trades at a forward P/E of 6.52x as against the industry group average of 16.10x.ConclusionManagement is particularly positive about the company’s flash-based storage segment and joint venture fab operations in Yokkaichi. The ongoing transformation to 3D NAND technology is another tailwind for Western Digital.With expanding product portfolio, secular growth of digital data and growing exposure to the SMB space, shares of Western Digital look well poised for the long term.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.

539,NTAP,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for fiscal first-quarter 2018. While earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, it registered growth on both the counts.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.04, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.98. The figure exceeded the guided range of $1.93 to $1.99 per share. Moreover, adjusted earnings improved 16.6% on a year-over-year basis.Quarter DetailsFactSet’s revenues of $329.1 million increased 14.3% from the year-ago quarter and came ahead of the guided range of $321 million-$328 million. Organic revenues increased 5.8% year over year to $304.3 million during the quarter. Successful integration of newly acquired businesses along with expansion in workflow-based solutions backed the company’s top-line performance. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $331 million.In the reported quarter, FactSet’s revenues from the United States increased to $208.8 million while international revenues grew to $120.4 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions and disposition, U.S. revenues and international revenues rose 4.8% and 7.7%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.FactSet Research Systems Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise FactSet Research Systems Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | FactSet Research Systems Inc. QuoteThe company’s Annual Subscription Value (ASV) increased to $1.32 billion as of Nov 30, 2017, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.17 billion. Of this, nearly 84.2% was generated by buy-side clients while the rest came from sell-side firms performing functions like mergers & acquisition, advisory work and equity research. Organically, it had increased 5.1% on a year-over-year basis.FactSet added 65 clients in the reported quarter, taking the tally to 4,809. The company retained 90% of its clients. The percentage of client retention was more than 95% of ASV.Coming to the operational metrics, FactSet reported a 21% rise in total operating expenses. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased approximately 400 basis points (bps) to 73%.FactSet’s adjusted operating income increased 10.6% from the year-ago quarter to $105.1 million. However, operating margin decreased 130 bps year over year to 31.7%, owing to increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.Adjusted net income during the quarter was $80.9 million compared with $70.1 million in the year-ago quarter.FactSet exited the quarter with $221.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $194.7 million from the previous quarter. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter amounted to $574.7 million.Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $61.1 million. The company generated free cash flow of $55.2 million.FactSet repurchased $30.9 million worth of its common stock under its existing share repurchase authorization during the first quarter. The company has still $213.2 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization as of Nov 30, 2017.GuidanceStarting this quarter, the company has decided not to provide quarterly guidance. Instead, it will issue a fiscal guidance. The company initiated guidance for fiscal 2018. GAAP revenues are expected to be between $1.34 billion and $1.36 billion (mid-point $1.35 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.36 billion.Organic ASV for fiscal 2018 is projected to increase by $65 million to $85 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4.9% to 6.5%. The anticipated range for adjusted operating margin is 31% and 32.5%.Adjusted earnings are expected to be within $8.25 and $8.45 (mid-point $8.35). The midpoint represents 14% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.18 per share.Bottom LineShares of Factset have gained 25.3% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 30.7% rally. Investors seem concern about lower-than-expected revenues and unimpressive top-line guidance for fiscal 2018. Furthermore, declining client retention ratio remains a major concern. The company’s client retention ratio in the first quarter came in at 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. It should be noted that a strong client retention ratio signifies more stable revenues.Although the company continues to add clients every quarter, it has failed to retain old clients. This will negatively impact its near-term top-line growth.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderFactset has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc.

540,NTAP,"Shares of Twitter Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) surged 11.02% to close at $24.68 on Dec 18, following the company’s decision of enforcing the rules announced last month to handle content that promotes violence, hatred and harassment.Per the blog post by Twitter, “Specific threats of violence or wishing for serious physical harm, death, or disease to an individual or group of people is in violation of our policies.”Twitter revealed that accounts of organizations that promote violence or content that “glorifies violence or the perpetrators of a violent act” will be removed from the platform. Frequent violations of rules will result in permanent suspension of accounts, the company warned.Twitter also added that accounts that engage in derogatory and hateful remarks “to silence another person’s voice” through abusive profile information in the form of username, display name or biography will be permanently suspended.Images promoting abhorrence on the basis of race, caste and creed, disability or sexual orientation will also be removed from the platform.As part of Twitter’s move to create a “safer environment”, it suspended the accounts of far-right group Britain First along with the profiles of its leaders Jayda Fransen and Paul Golding.Moreover, Twitter users can now report profiles that they consider offensive as against reporting only individual posts previously.Notably, shares of Twitter have gained 51.4% year to date, outperforming the  industry’s 34% rally.Focus to Increase EngagementTwitter’s focus to drive user engagement by making the platform easier to use is expected to be accretive to its growth. The latest developments to make the platform more attractive to users are positives in our view.We note that rising abuse on social media is a serious concern these days. Cyber bullying and trolling are a serious threat to user growth on the social networking platforms.For a company like Twitter that has been facing lackluster user growth, the initiatives taken to combat hateful activities on the platform is prudent in our view.On the last conference call, CEO Jack Dorsey was quoted saying, “we're taking a more aggressive stance in our abuse rules and how we enforce them.”He also added that by publishing the company’s upcoming safety work planned through January 2018, the company has for the first time provided such visibility into its work and expects it to build “trust along the way.”We believe that enforcement of strict policies will help the company battle extensive PR damage.Twitter, Inc.

541,NTAP,"Will the bull market continue after a year of double-digit gains and low volatility? Market pundits believe the broader markets will push further into the record territory in 2018. Long-awaited tax cuts, which are likely to be passed as early as this week, are expected to provide a shot in the arm to this aging bull market.Big banks are poised to gain enormously as they have been paying heavy taxes. Lower tax rates will also drive after-tax earnings for tech behemoths as it leads to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and development as well as mergers and acquisitions. Thus, investors should focus on big financial and technology service providers that can make the most of the slashed corporate tax rate.How Did the Major Bourses Do?The Dow Jones posted its 70th record close of the year, marking the highest number of record closes in a calendar year. The Dow also notched its seventh positive trading session in the past eight. The sheer number of Dow’s record closes reflects the ease with which the market is scaling higher. The blue-chip index is also inching closer to the 25,000 milestone after having crossed the 20,000, 21,000, 22,000, 23,000 and 24,000 levels this year.The S&P 500 also maintained its upward journey for 13 straight months through November. The benchmark index, in fact, hasn’t seen a drop of at least 3% since Nov 7, 2016, the longest stretch on record. The index had rallied 20% so far this year and is on track to record its best year since 2013, when it had surged 29.6%.The Nasdaq, in the meanwhile, topped the 7,000 mark for the first time in history. So far this year, the tech-laden index is up 30%, largely driven by mega-cap technology and Internet stocks. Some hot tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google rallied more than 30% in the same time frame.Market volatility isn’t roaring back either, with 2017 being the calmest for stocks since 1964. The so-called “fear gauge”, CBOE Volatility Index traded at 9.29, substantially lower than its long-term average of 20. What’s Driving the Markets?Anticipation of the passage of the tax bill by Republican congressional leaders is primarily responsible for propelling the major indices to record highs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he has “no doubt” that the GOP will pass its tax bill this week.Senators Bob Corker of Tennessee and Marco Rubio of Florida have also pledged their support for the tax reform. Senator John McCain of Arizona’s absence won’t matter either as there is a 52-48 Senate Republican majority. McCain is expected to miss the vote since he will be going back to his home state for some physical therapy.Biggest Beneficiaries of a Corporate Tax CutThe tax bill will be a big boost for Corporate America as it will slash the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut  to 20%.Corporates would also be charged a one-time low tax rate of 15% on foreign profits. This helps multinationals including large tech majors to bring funds held overseas back to the United States at a lower tax rate. Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths like Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Oracle hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.5 Top WinnersGiven the positives, investors should double down on the hottest banking and tech bigwigs. We have, therefore, selected five companies that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Eagle Bancorp, Inc. (EGBN  -  Free Report) is a bank holding company for EagleBank (the Bank).

542,NTAP,"Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 23.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 8.4%. In the last reported quarter, the company came up with a positive earnings surprise of 10%.The question lingering on investors’ mind is whether this vendor of electronic design automation (EDA) software will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise this time.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.We believe the company’s continued focus on introducing products, acquisitions and deal wins will continue to aid financials. The global support provided by the company and its unique intellectual properties are expected to boost results as well.The company’s inorganic additions are accretive to its portfolio. Apart from enhancing the product suite, these acquisitions strengthen its market reach and drive top-line growth.Synopsys’ recent additions include PhoeniX Software, Silicon and Beyond, Kilopass Technology and Black Duck Software, which are anticipated to boost the company’s revenue generation going ahead.Additionally, the company’s time-based license revenue model, which offers better visibility and predictability, is a positive for the company. It ensures effective renting of the software rather than paying a one-time upfront license fee.However, dampened margins pertaining to increased costs and expenses remain a headwind for near-term profitability. Furthermore, competition from peers and uncertainty surrounding the exact time of realizing acquisition synergies keep us cautious.Synopsys, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Synopsys, Inc.

545,NTAP,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) was having a splendid 2017 until it was revealed that software updates were slowing iPhones with older batteries. The stock lost 2.2% in the last five sessions and is currently facing at least eight lawsuits in various federal courts regarding the issue.The iPhone-maker recently issued a letter at its website, apologizing for the lack of transparency relating to the handling of iPhone performance with older batteries. However, the company denied that it has ever done anything to intentionally shorten the life of a product.Moreover, the company announced certain steps to pacify aggrieved customers.The company will lower the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement by $50 for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later. The offer will be available from late January through December 2018. It will also issue an iOS software update with new features that give users more visibility into the health of their iPhone’s battery.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. Quote Apple Devices Activated Most in the HolidaysApple’s apologetic stance is understandable considering the value of older models in the market.According to TechCrunch, which quoted data from Flurry Analytics, Apple devices accounted for 44% of smartphone and tablet activations during the holidays. Interestingly, older devices — iPhone 7 and iPhone 6 — took the top spots in terms of activations.The data reflects Apple’s diversifying business model. It’s no longer dependent on a single device for generating top-line growth. We note that iPhone 7 and older models have significant demand in cost sensitive markets of Asia-Pacific, India and China.Apple’s flagship product iPhone X at $999 is pricey for these markets. Taiwan’s Economic Daily recently suggested that Apple may cut unit volume by 20 million from its original expectation in the fiscal first quarter.What to Expect from Apple in 2018Despite the “transparency” debacle, we believe that Apple has significant prospects in 2018, backed by expanding product portfolio.Apart from the iPhone, the aggressively growing Services business is a key catalyst. Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, surged 34% year over year to nearly $8.5 billion in the last quarter.Apple is on track to double Services revenues of $24 billion in fiscal 2016 by 2020. To boost subscriber base, the company is now venturing into original programming. Apple is reportedly willing to invest $1 billion and has appointed ex-Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, to initiate expansion into original television programming.Apple recently acquired popular music discovery app Shazam for an estimated $400 million. The company is expected to integrate the software into Apple Music (or Siri) or in HomePod, its high-end smart speaker with a superior sound quality, which will be launched in 2018.Moreover, we believe that foray into fast-growing technologies like autonomous vehicle, artificial intelligence (AI) & AR/VR are other long-term catalysts.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Apple sports a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

546,NTAP,"Shares of ON Semiconductor Corporation’s (ON  -  Free Report) have been moving north backed by strong automotive, industrial and communications end-markets. The company has been expanding its product portfolio supported by inorganic growth strategies and successful integrations. However, increasing debt burden continues to erode margins amid stiff competition.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has returned 65.6% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 25.8%.The company reported third-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings of 25 cents per share, much higher than the year-ago earnings of 2 cents per share. Earnings also increased 14% sequentially.The company reported revenues of $1.39 billion, which surged 46% year over year and 4% from the previous quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong demand and adoption of the company’s diversified product portfolio for automotive, industrial and communications end-markets. Management is particularly positive about the strong operating model followed by ON Semi.ON Semiconductor Corporation Revenue (TTM) ON Semiconductor Corporation Revenue (TTM) | ON Semiconductor Corporation QuoteIn the last 60 days, fiscal 2017 estimates were revised upward, taking the Zacks Consensus Estimate up from $1.40 per share to $1.44 per share.Valuation Looks ImpressiveOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 14.68x, significantly lower than the Zacks industry’s average of 27x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Therefore, the lower the P/E of a stock, the better it is for a value investor.Product Additions and Acquisitions - Key CatalystsThe company is quite active on the mergers and acquisitions front. Its acquisition of Cypress Semiconductor’s CMOS image sensor business unit, AMI Semiconductor and CMD have expanded its product breadth. These acquisitions have also given the company exposure to new end markets along with higher margin capabilities.ON Semi’s automotive segment is a strong growth driver as evident from the strong booking trends in the last few quarters. Moreover, decreasing oil prices and attractive product offerings are further aiding revenues.In view of rising product demand, ON Semi launched three image sensors for ADAS and real view applications alongside its low energy Bluetooth technology and Smart Passive Sensors (SPS). These will strengthen its Internet of Things (IoT) development kit platform’s capabilities. The product launches in the automotive end market for next generation automobile designs and the existing product portfolio will increase revenues for the business, going forward.Additionally, management believes that Fairchild’s acquisition will be accretive to the company’s non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow and generate annual cost savings of at least $150 million. We believe that ON Semi can make the most of new socket opportunities through these acquisitions, thus recording top-line growth.Debt Burden and Competition - Potent ThreatsFairchild’s acquisition has increased the company’s debt, which will continue to have an adverse impact on net earnings also increasing the overall risk profile of the company.Additionally, ON Semi faces stiff competition from other integrated circuit manufacturers.ON Semi’s acquisitions may have provided earnings increment but its impact on margins are doubtful. Also, frequent acquisitions are a source of distraction for management.Zacks Rank &Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

547,NTAP,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report).The company recently reported impressive fiscal first-quarter 2018 results, wherein the top and bottom line figures increased year over year improvement and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company’s recent product additions in the analytics application space are anticipated to effectively address the increased demand for digital solutions. Additionally, its partnerships and acquisitions will broaden its clientele and addressed market.Accenture stock has gained 26.4% year to date, outperforming the 23.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Key FactorsAccenture, a provider of management consultancy, technology and outsourcing services,  continues to benefit from its outsourcing business. The company witnessed a 6% year-over-year increase in new bookings, which touched $37.4 billion in fiscal 2017.Notably, the exponential growth in data generation and the need for scalable storage techniques have increased the requirements of cloud computing vendors. In such a scenario, Accenture’s investments to enhance its cloud capabilities will be beneficial. Additionally, the enhancement of its digital marketing capabilities with significant acquisitions like Karmarama, Reactive Media and Acquity Group has been a key catalyst as well.Moreover, the company’s inorganic additions (37 acquisition deals) worth $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 are notable revenue boosters. The company’s partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP significantly contribute to its revenue stream.Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) Accenture PLC Revenue (TTM) | Accenture PLC QuoteAdditionally, the company’s strong balance sheet has enabled it to invest in growth initiatives.

548,NTAP,"Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) is trying to pacify employees about its relationship with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) even as it embarks on a new journey with blockchain and completes strategic acquisitions and deals. Here’s the low-down:ICE Contract And The Child Separation PolicyThe technology sector, by virtue of the talent it has attracted from all over the world, has helped the U.S. lead the world. But that also means it has the largest number of immigrant workers. That’s probably why it has been the one most attacked on immigration issues and the one that has had to take the most defensive stand.   So it isn’t surprising that the government’s zero tolerance policy and the lack of a policy on reunification elicited unsupportive comments from all technology leaders. Microsoft’s case was no different.The policy itself isn’t anything new: it entails temporary separation of the family while the parents are either prosecuted and/or the identity of the children as belonging to the family is confirmed. But more stringent enforcement is likely what the government was attempting to do when it reportedly separated as many as 2,000 children from those claiming to be their parents. In any case, the President has since signed an executive order forbidding the separation.  Microsoft was charged by its employees on the basis of a blog post from January where it praised the U.S. ICE for “implementing transformative technologies for homeland security and public safety, and adding that “we’re proud to support this work with our mission-critical cloud.”That blog also said that the ICE would be able to “process data on edge devices or utilize deep learning capabilities to accelerate facial recognition and identification” that “help employees make more informed decisions faster.” This is actually an ideal situation that could minimize the plight of immigrants, but the company has now stepped on the back foot.Nadella’s letter to employees says, “Our current cloud engagement with ICE is supporting legacy mail, calendar, messaging and document management workloads.” It also says, “I want to be clear: Microsoft is not working with the U.S. government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border.”Deploying BlockchainMicrosoft has collaborated with consulting firm EY to build a blockchain tool based on the Quorum permissioned distributed ledger (a system that uses a smaller network of nodes to validate transactions thereby saving system resources).The company claims that the technology can be used by authors, software developers and other creators to collect royalties. If true, it would eliminate a host of middlemen and be greatly beneficial for creators, IP holders and other licensors.Microsoft intends to start using the technology in its online gaming system and is already working with Ubisoft for implementation. The companies believe that this will enable them to process millions of transactions a day, so payments can be made daily instead of the current 45 days.“The scale, complexity and volume of digital rights and royalties transactions makes this a perfect application for blockchains. A blockchain can handle the unique nature of each contract between digital rights owners and licensors can be handled in a scalable, efficient manner with an audit trail for the participants,” according to Paul Brody, EY’s Global Innovation Leader for Blockchain.AI Deal with M&SBritain’s Marks & Spencer Group has partnered with Microsoft to jump-start the digitization of its operations. The company is particularly interested in Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) solutions that it intends to incorporate in its stores, as well as across its other operations.Microsoft’s retail prowess came into focus last week with the company announcing its own self-checkout system. Since this too will improve customer experience, M&S may the one of the first to adopt the technology. However, neither company offered details of their collaboration plans.Marks & Spencer CEO Steve Rowe did however put out a statement that said, “We want to be at the forefront of driving value into the customer experience using the power of technology,” and, “Working together with Microsoft to understand the full potential of how technology and artificial intelligence can improve the in-store experience for our customers and the efficiencies of our wider operations could be a game-changer for M&S — and for retail.”Acquiring Social Learning Platform FlipgridMicrosoft has acquired a startup that makes a rather popular app for educators. Called Flipgrid, the app allows people to make videos on any topic for easy sharing with others. The Minneapolis-based startup has less than 30 employees that currently serve 20 million users. Last year, it reported an 800% increase in teacher accounts.While losing a leadership position to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) chromebooks and other classroom tools, Microsoft has always put out products to ensure that it remained in contention. As far as Flipgrid is concerned, the company promises to maintain the brand and allow it to operate across platforms. It is offering the product free for now to anyone who’s willing to use it and schools that already have subscriptions will be refunded on a pro rata basis.The attraction for Flipgrid is of course Microsoft’s resources that will enable it to scale and better reach students and teachers across the world.Acquiring AI Startup BonsaiMicrosoft has finally bought the reinforcement learning startup called Bonsai for an undisclosed sum. Last year, it invested in the company through its Microsoft Ventures unit, now called M12. At the time, ABB, Samsung and Siemens also invested in the company to raise $7.6 million, taking its total funding to $13.6 million.The Berkeley-based startup has 42 employees, all of whom will be moving to Microsoft. The company has previously done some work in the energy, HVAC, robotics and autonomous vehicle sectors. Last year, it developed a new technique for programming industrial control systems that was 45X faster than the competing solution from Google.Reinforcement learning allows a developer to teach a system through a trial and error process by creating a simulated environment. It therefore allows both AI engineers and those less experienced to get involved in the training process.Microsoft is betting that AI adoption will be so fast that there will be a skills gap. So the ability to get more people on the job will be a valuable asset.One-Month Price Performance RecommendationsMicrosoft shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better tech plays include buy-ranked stocks like Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report), NetApp Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report), Akamai (AKAM  -  Free Report) and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report).

549,NTAP,"Shares of Pure Storage, Inc (PSTG  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $23.19 on May 10, closing marginally lower at $23.13. The company has a market capital of $4.84 billion.Notably, the stock has returned 103.8% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 23.3%. The momentum can be attributed to robust adoption as well as partnerships and collaborations that aid product innovation.

The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 53.24%. The company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 15%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter revenues is pegged at $251.52 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 37.72%.Robust AdoptionStrong product portfolio including the likes of FlashArray, FlashStack and FlashBlade business segments aid Pure Storage top-line. In the last reported quarter, the company added more than 500 new customers, bringing the total base to 4500 organizations and reflecting an increase of 50% from the year-ago quarter.Additionally, the company’s data platform for cloud is gaining traction. Per a ResearchandMarkets report, cloud storage market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 29.73% from $25.17 billion in 2017 to reach $92.49 billion in 2022. The company is well poised to capitalize on the opportunity.Pure Storage continues to focus on three major aspects, namely increasing cloud customer base, solidifying the position of its next generation workload related core data infrastructure and tapping large enterprises as they “cloudify” their on-premise IT infrastructure.Partnerships and Collaborations: Key CatalystCisco’s tie-up with the company’s FlashStack has significantly accelerated overall converged infrastructure and integrated systems markets. FlashStack is well-positioned for the future as the company continues to invest with its partners in full stack automation and simplicity.Management is optimistic about scalable storage solutions in an era when the world is typically being driven by big-data, artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data analytics-based information.Pure Storage strengthened its partnership with NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI related computation, to expand product offerings. The company recently released AIRI in collaboration with NVIDIA.The company claims AIRI to be a first-of-a-kind AI ready infrastructure. AIRI will cut short the time required for data to generate valuable insights significantly, consequently accelerating innovation.Per Gartner, 80% of enterprises are anticipated to deploy AI within 2020, which enhances the prospects of AIRI.Improving Cash PositionPure Storage recently announced plans of offering $450 million of convertible senior notes in a private placement. The interest rate, conversion rate and certain other terms of the notes are yet to be determined. Interest on the notes will be paid semi-annually and mature in 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.The enhanced capital deployment reflects Pure Storage’s strong balance sheet and confidence in long-term business prospects. The company exited the year ended Jan 31, 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $183.7 million.The company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it in capitalizing on investment opportunities and pursuing strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects. Moreover, the senior notes offering will lower its cost of capital, consequently strengthening balance sheet and supporting growth.Positive free cash flow for the full-year ended Jan 31, 2018 was reported for the first time in the company’s history at $7.7 million, compared with ($61.2 million) fiscal 2017. This can be attributed to strong performance in the quarter and employee stock purchase worth $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Underlying RisksThe aforementioned points will enable Pure Storage to remain afloat in difficult times. However, the company continues to face intense competition due to the presence of major players such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure in cloud storage.Zacks Rank and Key PicksPure Storage carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks trading at 52-week high include Citrix Systems, Inc (CTXS  -  Free Report), NetApp, Inc.

550,NTAP,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 5.4% over the past month. NTAP hit a new 52-week high of $70.15 in the previous session. NetApp has gained 25.9% since the start of the year compared to the 3.9% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 14.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 14, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $0.99 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.9 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.29%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $3.97 per share on $5.86 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.61 per share on $6.18 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.8% and 5.39%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.1X versus its peer group's average of 16.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.7. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 3% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

Price and Consensus NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteIn fact, while current quarter earnings estimates have remained stable over the past month, current year estimates have risen from $3.97 per share to $4.05 per share.

553,NTAP,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report).FactSet recently reported mixed results for fiscal first-quarter 2018. While earnings came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the same. However, on a year-over-year basis, it registered growth on both the counts.FactSet is bringing in new products across segments with an emphasis on financial services to expand its customer base. This approach is helping the company overcome macroeconomic challenges.However, decreasing client retention ratio is a major concern for the company as a solid base of existing clients indicates stable revenues.Notably, FactSet stock has gained 22.3% year to date, underperforming the 28.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Influencing the StockFactSet, a provider of global online integrated data-related products and services for the investment community added 65 new clients in fiscal first-quarter 2018, which boosted its Annual Subscription Value (ASV). The company’s competitive pricing strategy has also been a key catalyst for ASV.Notably, the Global Business Information market, which FactSet caters to, is expected to witness CAGR of 5.2% from 2017 to 2021, per technavio. We believe, the company’s core product suite, enriched by its acquired entities like BISAM, IDMS, Portware LLC, Code Red, Revere Data LLC, StreetAccount and others, will enable it to grab the growth opportunity.However, the industry being a highly competitive one with players such as Bloomberg L.P., Thomson Reuters Inc. and S&P Global Market Intelligence, FactSet continues to face strong headwinds. Though it has a technological advantage, some of these competitors have greater financial, technical and marketing resources and we expect competition to intensify in the future.Additionally, declining client retention ratio is a negative for the company’s near-term performance. The company’s client retention ratio in the first quarter was 90%, tanking 300 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter and 100 bps from the previous quarter. This might drag down the company’s top line going ahead.FactSet Research Systems Inc. Revenue (TTM) FactSet Research Systems Inc. Revenue (TTM) | FactSet Research Systems Inc. QuoteZacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderFactset has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report), and IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Intel Corporation INTC) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term expected EPS growth rate for Intel, NetApp and IPG is projected to be 8.42%, 11.34% and 12%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

554,NTAP,"Intuit Inc. (INTU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.9%.The company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 37.2%. QuickBooks Online ecosystem and TurboTax are likely to aid the to-be-reported quarter’s top-line performance. However, high costs and expenses remain a major concern.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Intuit is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it possesses two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Intuit carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +1.24%.Analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $2.84 billion, up 11.9% year over year and earnings are projected at $4.67 per share, up 19.7% on year over year basis.Factors at PlayThe company has two main products — QuickBooks which offer financial and business management online services and desktop software to small businesses, and TurboTax which offers income tax preparation products and services. Notably, the company has been witnessing solid year-over-year growth for the last several quarters in its QuickBooks subscriber base which is driving Small Business segment revenues.It should be noted that about 29 million small businesses in the United States depend on third-party companies to deal with their financial and accounting related preparation. With its enriched product portfolio, Intuit will have capitalized on this opportunity which we believe will be well reflected in third-quarter results.For the fiscal 2018, the company expects QuickBooks online subscriber base to be in the range of 3.27-3.37 million. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company will end the fiscal third quarter with a subscriber base of 3.144 million, marking year-over-year improvement of 41.6%.The year-over-year increase in the online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues going forward. The innovative features being launched by the company will also aid the top line.Going ahead, we expect the company’s Consumer Tax segment revenues to continue to benefit from strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products.The company’s continued focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it add new customers. The analysts covering the stock expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, consequently bolstering the overall top-line performance. Furthermore, the company’s TurboTax products derive high margins which are likely to cushion its bottom-line results.Nonetheless, Intuit’s high costs and expenses remain a major concern. During the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 quarterly earnings conference call, the company had hinted that it would increase investments in engineering and marketing to seize the growing opportunity globally. Notably, Intuit’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP operating margin contracted 10 basis points year over year. This makes us slightly cautious about the to-be-reported quarter’s bottom-line results.Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Intuit Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Intuit Inc.

555,NTAP,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 22. The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 47.8% in the last reported quarter. Notably, Hewlett Packard has a decent surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice, while missing the same in one occasion. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 11.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hewlett Packard is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Hewlett Packard currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings remained unchanged, over the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects earnings per share to increase 6% to 31 cents from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 25 cents. However, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to be down 26% year over year to $7.33 billion.Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company Price and EPS Surprise | Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company QuoteFactors to ConsiderThe year-over-year decline in revenues is expected mainly because Hewlett Packard is now focusing on the enterprise market and moving away from the firm’s hyperscaler business, which, we believe, will continue to hurt its revenues in short term.Furthermore, the acquisition of EMC Corporation (stylized as EMC) by Dell has been posing new challenges for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With this acquisition, Dell has become one of the major players in the cloud services and data-storage market. EMC offers data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing, and other products and services that enable businesses to store, manage, protect, and analyze data.Additionally, VMware (VMW  -  Free Report) was EMC’s subsidiary that focuses on cloud and virtualization software and services for its parent company. Therefore, the acquisition of EMC, along with its privately-controlled structure, is providing Dell an unmatched scale, strength and flexibility to deepen the company’s relationships with customers of all sizes.This apart, it also seems that Hewlett Packard Enterprise is losing market share to Dell in the server shipment. Notably, according to IDC, during fourth-quarter 2017, Dell managed to drastically narrow down the server shipment market-share difference with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as the company “continues to capitalize on expanded opportunities from its merger with EMC.”Nonetheless, the company’s bottom-line results are likely to benefit from the spin-off of its low-margin businesses like Software and Enterprise Services. In addition, massive share buybacks over the past year are expected to have boosted Hewlett Packard’s fiscal second-quarter earnings per share.Notably, during fiscal 2017, Hewlett Packard returned $3 billion to its shareholders, of which $2.56 billion was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments. Continuing the same, the company, during the last reported quarter, returned $862 million to shareholders, of which $742 million was through share repurchases and the remaining through dividend payments.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are couple of stocks, which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NetApp, Inc.

Therefore, if you have overlooked the company’s recent price appreciation then this is the right time to add the stock to your portfolio.This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 11.3% and has great prospects of carrying the momentum in the near term.Share Price AppreciationShares of NetApp have gained approximately 62.4% year to date, significantly outperforming its industry’s gain of 25.6%.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryNetApp outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording an encouraging positive average earnings surprise of 11.5%.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for NetApp’s third-quarter and Fiscal 2018 have witnessed upward revisions. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings has gone up by 6 cents in the last 60 days and is currently pegged at 90 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 also moved north by 21 cents to $3.31 per share, over the same time frame.Earnings NetApp announced stellar second-quarter 2018 results on Nov 15, 2017. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 81 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 69 cents. The figure increased by 35% year over year and was also within the guided range. Revenues of 1.42 billion also increased 6% year over year also surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 billion.The impressive second-quarter results were driven by the company’s successful ongoing transition from underperforming segments to growth oriented sectors like all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud and Data Fabric strategies.NetApp, Inc. Revenue (TTM) NetApp, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | NetApp, Inc. QuoteAdditionally, the company has a positive outlook toward the phenomenal rate of data growth since its cloud-integrated all-flash solution fits well with the hybrid cloud infrastructure.NetApp has been witnessing higher demand for its flash-based solutions which have been a major contributor toward the company’s revenue growth. Moreover, the acquisition of SolidFire has further enhanced NetApp’s position in the all-flash array market.Positive Outlook For third-quarter fiscal 2018, NetApp expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of 86-94 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter was pegged at 84 cents.Net revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $1.43-$1.58 billion, which at the mid-point implies 6.8% growth from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.43 billion.Other Driving FactorsThe company’s expertise in the flash array market is increasing its prominence in the storage area network (SAN) and converged infrastructure markets. The company’s newly launched hyper-converged infrastructure is also expected to be a positive for the top line in the long run.We believe NetApp is well positioned to enjoy steady growth with its diversified portfolio and strong distribution channels that will drive demand for the products going forward.NetApp’s decision to realign its business and invest in strategic initiatives will enable the company to ease the pricing pressure and soft sales due to lower demand from U.S. federal agencies.Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning cash through share repurchase and dividend payouts. It returned $900 million during fiscal 2017. NetApp’s strong cash generating abilities and a healthy balance sheet allows it to take shareholder-friendly decisions.NetApp recently announced new additions to its board of directors who will ‘strengthen’ the company’s boards and deliver value to the shareholders.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other stocks worth consideration from the broader technology sector are Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report).

557,NTAP,"On Dec 16, Zacks Investment Research downgraded VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The downgrade can be attributed to negative estimate revisions witnessed over the last seven days following fourth-quarter 2017 results.Although the company reported impressive results, the soft guidance provided by the company for the forthcoming quarter makes us skeptical about near-term prospects.The company witnessed eight downward revisions for the current quarter and seven for fiscal 2018 over the last seven days, with no upward revision. The trend has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018 to decline 24.4% and 3.8% to 25 cents and $1.51, respectively.Notably, VeriFone’s shares have gained 3% year to date, substantially underperforming the 38.3% rally of its industry.Key FactorsVeriFone’s business has been affected by macroeconomic headwinds in emerging markets. Apart from this, the Electronic payment system and services market is highly competitive and fragmented. Increased pricing pressure is an overhang.VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic as well as Latin America and Asia Pacific markets. In the last reported quarter, non-GAAP revenues from North America and Asia Pacific fell 9.6% and 3.8% from the year-ago quarter, respectively.The divestitures of Petro Media and the Taxi businesses are anticipated to hurt top-line growth in the near term.Moreover, newly-launched product like Carbon will take some time to contribute to growth.Further, the company’s leveraged balance sheet may limit future expansion and worsen risk profile. Higher interest rate on debt is expected to negatively impact profits.Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Verifone Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Verifone Systems, Inc.

558,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) recently announced changes in video policies which include distribution of videos on the platform, ad breaks and testing of pre roll ad format. The company expects this move to increase engagement and boost viewership.Facebook revealed that it has tweaked News Feed ranking which will “help surface videos people are proactively seeking out and coming back to on Facebook.”The company is also encouraging longer videos, having duration of minimum three minutes. Publishers will be able insert advertisements after a minute’s gap. Previously, ads were placed after a gap of 20 seconds in a video with a minimum duration of 90 seconds. Facebook has been resorting to such measures to uplift viewers’ satisfaction.Two new metrics that include Ad Break impressions and Ad Break CPMs at the video level have been introduced by Facebook to help advertisers gauge the performance.Facebook is also testing pre roll ad platform, wherein publishers will be able to put in ads for a duration of six seconds at the start of videos posted only on the platform’s Watch tab.We believe that these initiatives will help the company drive user engagement and improve the time spent on the platform.Notably, Facebook has gained 56.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 26.9% rally.Push To Digital AdvertisingFacebook intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media platforms. Earlier, the company mentioned that video has been emerging as a “megatrend”. The company believes that over the next three years videos will be the key catalyst among all product lines.Facebook’s focus to develop new ad products and making them more relevant and effective is yielding positive results. The company is using machine learning and automation to help advertisers reach the target audience.We note that the company has witnessed significant traction in online and mobile advertising spending in a short span. In the third quarter of 2017, ad revenues grew 49% year over year to $10.1 billion while mobile ad revenues surged 57% to $8.9 billion.Notably, average price per ad increased 35% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, ad impressions improved 10%, due to increases in mobile impressions.Management also noted that 70% of ad breaks having duration of 15 seconds were viewed on Facebook and Audience Network, helping advertisers boost revenues.In the last conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated, “video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do that.”Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising. As video ads generate more revenues than photo and text-based substitutes, Facebook is trying to incorporate more video-oriented content to gain revenues.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc.

559,NTAP,"The Nasdaq Composite index has performed exceptionally well in the year so far by setting record highs for more than 60 times. The index first hit the 6,000 milestone on Apr 25, crossing the 5,000 mark after 17 years. The index has been up 27.4% in the year-to-date (YTD) period, outperforming Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 gains of 24% and 18.5%, respectively.This can be attributed to the outstanding rally of tech stocks which constitute over 50% of weightage in the index. The technology sector has been benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, rapid adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Needless to say, tech stocks are preferred by astute investors due to their proprietary technological expertise and heavy cash balances. These companies also relish high barriers to entry, which position the firms for faster growth in the market.Some market pundits believe tech stocks are riding high on the years-long economic expansion, while most of them attribute part of this upsurge to the Trump administration’s pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.5 Tech Stocks Outpacing NasdaqHere are the five Nasdaq-listed tech stocks which have performed phenomenally this year and have potential to retain the momentum in the next year as well.

560,NTAP,"NCR Corporation (NCR  -  Free Report) recently announced the sale of the remaining assets of its Interactive Printer Solutions (IPS) division — located in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region — to Interactive Printer Solutions FZCO (IPS FZCO), a part of the Turbon Group of Companies.The deal included the IPS manufacturing facilities of Jebel Ali Free Zone in Dubai, IPS distribution centers and its employees. Per the latest contract, the acquirer will maintain a commercial relationship with NCR post the transaction. This sale marks the last phase of the divestment that was announced in 2016. The first phase of the sale of the IPS division to Atlas Holdings was completed in May 2016.Notably, NCR’s technological solutions (both products and services) — having the likes of automated teller machines (ATMs), self-service kiosks and point of sale (POS) devices as well as software applications that help in customer interaction — are a part of the core infrastructure in today’s connected economy.We believe the completion of the transaction is a testament to the fact that NCR is focusing on its growth in the software and services sector, which will help it rebound going ahead. NCR stock has lost 22.9% year to date, compared to the industry's decline of 13.1%.Factors Influencing the StockPer the company, “ATM orders continue to be negatively impacted by large customer delays in spending in North America, weakness in India, the Middle East and Africa, and the upcoming Windows 10 conversion.”Consequently, this is affecting NCR’s top-line performance. For third-quarter 2017, the company’s hardware revenues decreased 6% year over year on a reported basis to $578 million. The segment revenues from ATM and SCO also declined 16% and 24%, respectively.NCR Corporation Revenue (TTM) NCR Corporation Revenue (TTM) | NCR Corporation QuoteNevertheless, the company is gaining in Software and Services revenues which increased 2% and 3%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. This represented increase in Cloud, Professional Services and Software maintenance revenues as well as hardware maintenance growth.However, the weakness in the ATM market has been a potent threat for the company, which in turn negatively impacted the margins and the guidance for full-year 2017.Going forward, we believe the company’s focus on its core competencies and streamlined cost structure to be beneficial.Zacks Rank and Key PicksNCR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Intel Corp.

561,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) recently signed “an unprecedented global, multi-year” deal with Universal Music Group (UMG) that will allow users to post videos with music from the record label on its platform as well as on Instagram and Oculus.Facebook has been in talks with content providers like record companies for licensing for a long time before sealing the deal with UMG, which became the first major label to license recorded music to the company.The collaboration is expected to increase user engagement. Reportedly, “the agreement is intended to serve as a foundation for a strategic partnership roadmap that will deliver new music-based experiences online.”Going forward, the company also plans to bring more “music-based products” to platforms including Messenger in order to make the conversations more engaging for users.Earlier this month, Facebook launched a video editing tool called Sound Collection that offers users a number of free high-quality audio tracks and sound effects for creating videos and sharing them on Facebook and Instagram.We believe these initiatives will significantly drive Facebook’s user base and sustain its share price momentum. Notably, Facebook has gained 54% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 23.2% rally.Rising Online and Mobile Video ConsumptionFacebook has been extending its presence in the online video market with its growing user base and rising engagement levels. We note that social networking platforms are widely used for consuming music. Record labels therefore do not leave an opportunity to promote their albums on such platforms.The U.S. music industry witnessed 15% growth in the first half of 2017, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, while global sales grew 5.9%, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.Furthermore, the online video market (especially music) is expected to grow exponentially going ahead. Per research firm ZenithOptimedia, online video viewing will increase 20% this year, driven by 35% increase in mobile video viewing. The report also states that by 2019, mobile videos will represent 72% of total online video viewing compared with 61% in 2017.Growth in video consumption has translated to rising video advertisements as advertisers find this to be the most lucrative medium to attract the audience. Notably, online video is likely to represent 31% of worldwide ad spending by 2019, per ZenithOptimedia.The firm also states that in a lot of markets, after Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube, Facebook is the second largest provider of video content.Facebook has been improving its scope of monetization through video views on its platform. We expect music videos to form a major chunk of views, generating a significant portion of ad revenues.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Facebook, Inc. QuoteThere have also been speculations regarding Facebook’s entry into the music streaming market like its peer Apple Inc. and Spotify. However, nothing has been confirmed yet.Meanwhile, it seems that YouTube, which also signed a deal with UMG recently, is up for more challenging times ahead as Facebook gears up to strengthen its relationship with record labels.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderFacebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) and NetApp Inc.

562,NTAP,"There are certain stocks that continue to deliver the goods even in the face of macroeconomic headwinds. HubSpot (HUBS  -  Free Report) is one such stock that has been consistently increasing its customer base and expanding international footprint but has been weighed down by adverse impact of foreign exchange rate volatility and increasing operating losses.Shares of HubSpot have gained 90% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 32%. The long-term expected EPS growth rate is 50%.  The company’s revolutionary marketing and sales applications, expanding international footprint and significant scope in cross-selling sales products to its existing market customer base are key catalysts.Factors Worth ConsideringHubSpot reported adjusted profit of 3 cents per share in the third quarter of 2017 against a loss of 5 cents per share in the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents per share. The company has delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the past four quarters with an average surprise of 199.4%.Its performance has been backed by the company’s customer friendly marketing and sales applications, enabling businesses to easily reach, acquire and retain customers. Additionally, the introduction of enhanced social tools for HubSpot’s Marketing Hub enables users to convert Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Instagram audience into potential customers.This integration of HubSpot’s services with social media giants is expected to boost the company’s top line going ahead.We believe that HubSpot has significant scope for cross-selling sales products to its existing marketing customer base, led by its One HubSpot initiative. We believe that given its exceptional marketing and sales services, many of the customers that use these services for free will transition to HubSpot’s pro products.HubSpot’s acquisition of Motion AI, a leading provider of Chat bot building tools, will help users without programming skills create chat bots that work on platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Slack and SMS.HubSpot is expanding its international footprint rapidly. The company currently has international offices in Dublin, Sydney, Singapore and Tokyo. We expect the growing footprint will aid the company’s top-line performance.Risk Persists   Although the company’s $50 per month marketing starter pack will increase its customer base, it can also lead to product cannibalization. We infer that management may not continue with this offer price for long, eventually increasing prices which can lead to cancellation of subscriptions cancellation. This will have an adverse impact on revenues.Since Hubspot’s increasing international footprint contributes a significant portion to its revenues, we believe that foreign exchange rate volatility may impede revenue growth in the near term, due to a strengthening U.S. dollar.Additionally, mounting losses since the company’s inception doesn’t augur well for investors’ confidence, in our view.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHubSpot carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some of the better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NetApp, Inc (NTAP  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report).

563,NTAP,"Investors looking for stocks in the Computer- Storage Devices sector might want to consider either Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) or NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Both Western Digital and NetApp have a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.WDC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.95, while NTAP has a forward P/E of 21.72. We also note that WDC has a PEG ratio of 0.31. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NTAP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.81.Another notable valuation metric for WDC is its P/B ratio of 2.10. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NTAP has a P/B of 9.81.Based on these metrics and many more, WDC holds a Value grade of A, while NTAP has a Value grade of C.Both WDC and NTAP are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that WDC is the superior value option right now.

566,NTAP,"Voxeljet AG (VJET  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 17.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, having missed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, it delivered a negative earnings surprise of 33.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayVoxeljet’s first-quarter 2018 results are likely to benefit from its cost-saving initiatives. Also, the company’s large scale service centers globally, including the opened subsidiaries in China and India, are expected to bolster growth. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Voxeljet experienced improvement in revenues from its American and Chinese service centers. This upside was driven by increased market penetration in the respective regions and growing customer base.Revenues from the company’s Services segment also showed signs of improvement in fourth-quarter 2017. Evidently, the metric increased 26.5% to €2.9 million from €2.3 million in the year-ago period. Voxeljet’s gross profit and gross profit margin too increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We believe that improved operational execution is likely to drive the company’s bottom-line performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.This apart, Voxeljet’s solid investment in core R&D to maintain its position as a technology leader in 3D printing bodes well for upcoming quarters.However, over the past couple of years, the 3D printing industry has been suffering from a prolonged decline in demand for 3D printers. Revenues from the company’s System segment (including sales of 3D printers) declined 20% to €3.1 million in fourth-quarter 2017 from €3.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The waning demand for printers has added to the company’s concerns, which might reflect poorly on the coming quarterly results.Furthermore, Voxeljet has been suffering from a decline in total backlog of 3D printer orders over the past few quarters. For instance, the company’s total backlogs dropped 26.8% in fourth-quarter 2017 compared with its level at the end of 2016. Other headwinds, including inflation, currency fluctuations and commodity prices vagaries have also marred the performance of several companies in the industry. We expect Voxeljet’s first-quarter 2018 results to be adversely affected by these factors.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Voxeljet this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Voxeljet has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 12 cents.

Furthermore, the figure increased 10.5% on a year-over-year basis.The top line also increased 3% year over year to $11.89 billion and marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.82 billion.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are projected to increase 3-5% on a year-over-year basis.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 65 cents, in line with the mid-point of the management’s projected range, translating to year-over-year growth of 8.3%.Cisco Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Cisco Systems, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Cisco Systems, Inc. QuoteLet's discuss the factors likely to influence third-quarter results.Collaborations to Boost DigitizationCisco collaborated with UAE-based telecom company `du` and signed a MoU with the Government of Portugal to accelerate digitization.The company teamed up with Teradata (TDC  -  Free Report) to leverage on IoT with a view to digitally transforms cities. Integration of Cisco’s Kinetic IoT data platform with Teradata Analytics Platform enhances support for public safety and will aid in creating smart city framework. The company alsoNotably, at the Mobile World Congress (“MWC”) 2018, Cisco partnered with government and telecoms, like Reliance Jio, Telenor, SFR (a subsidiary of Altice), Airtel, TIM, Vodafone and Saudi Telecom Company to digitize and build advanced and 5G capable networks.At MWC, Cisco announced plan to form a multi-vendor ecosystem to accelerate adoption and viability of Open vRAN solutions. The company announced 5G Now portfolio to aid global service providers and consequently mobile operator customers worldwide by advancing their 5G plans.We can conclude that during the quarter, Cisco innovatively capitalized on digitization opportunities. The new collaborations are likely to boost top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Adoption of Expanding Networking PortfolioDuring the quarter, Cisco was selected by NBC Olympics as a provider of IP video and networking solution for the XXIII Olympic Winter Games.In order to simplify network architecture, Cisco collaborated with Verizon to accelerate adoption of Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (“ICN”).Cisco introduced its new Cisco Crosswork Network Automation software portfolio, which will improve the efficiency of its large-scale networks. The company unveiled NCS 1004 and NCS 1010 modular platforms to aid providers leverage their fiber investment by enhancing automation capabilities.The company also introduced Cisco SD-WAN vAnalytics and Cisco Meraki Insight to bring visibility to wide-area network (“WAN”).The new products are likely to strengthen the company’s networking capabilities.Focus on Enhancing Cloud OfferingsDuring the quarter, Cisco announced enhancement of its HyperFlex platform with the 3.0 software release allowing for dynamic deployment and management capabilities of its cloud services.Container Platform, a new production-grade software for the management of Containerized applications across the cloud environment, was also introduced.We expect Cisco to deliver robust performance in the Cloud services segment. The completion of Broadsoft’s acquisition during the quarter is likely to strengthen Cisco’s cloud strategy portfolio, helping it to achieve a leadership position in the segment.Significant Developments in Security SegmentCisco’s efforts on expanding footprint in the rapidly-growing security market bode well. During the quarter, the company collaborated with Rackspace to deliver its customers protection against evolving sophisticated threats such that their multicloud journey is secured. The company also collaborated with the likes of Apple, Aon and Allianz to introduce a new cyber risk management solution for businesses.In the last quarter, Cisco reported 38% deferred revenue growth for the segment driven by solid demand for unified threat, advanced threat and web security solutions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Security segment revenues is pegged at $578 million, representing year-over-year growth of 9.7%.Competition to Limit Infrastructure Platforms GrowthInfrastructure Platforms comprise switching, NGN routing, Wireless and Data Center. Notably, competition from several smaller players including Arista Networks (ANET  -  Free Report) is impacting top-line growth in the switching and routing businesses.Arista’s recent intention of manufacturing switches that connect campus networks is likely to hurt Cisco as it holds a dominant position in that market. Moreover, the ongoing transition to subscription-based model remains a concern.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

568,NTAP,"Per a recent report by Reuters, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) requests for deferment of tax on imported mobile phone parts in India are unlikely to be accepted. The government is supposedly against granting of any “special concessions” to the tech giant.We note that India imposes a 10% tax on imported components like batteries, chargers and headsets in order to foster domestic production. With Narendra Modi at the helm, the “Make in India” concept is fast catching up with global manufacturing majors.Apple is rumored to have demanded a 15-year tax holiday on the import of equipment and components in the country.  At the beginning of the year, the company met with the government in order to discuss its intentions of setting up manufacturing units in the country in exchange of tax breaks. It was estimated that the expansion would create 5-10K jobs in the country.Apple mentioned that it had ""constructive and open dialogue” with the government regarding the expansion of local production but declined to share additional details.However, both Apple and the concerned government are yet to make any comments regarding the current update.Why is Apple Eyeing India?Apple faces slowing iPhone demand in most of the regions, either because of competition or regulatory hurdles (as in the case of China) or market saturation (as in the United States). It is therefore taking a number of initiatives to strengthen its presence in growth regions like India, which can become a key long-term driver going ahead.Notably, shares of Apple have gained 49.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 45.3% rally.The country presents an attractive growth opportunity for the company over the long run given its younger population and increasing investment in 4G networks infrastructure. Apple has partnered with telecom company, Reliance, which will be providing its Jio (a unique all-IP network) service for free with the new iPhones along with Bharti Airtel.Furthermore, the company is also setting up a couple of development centers in India to boost app development and to accelerate the development of maps. Also, Apple has set up its first manufacturing unit in Bangalore, Karnataka and has teamed up with Wistron Corp. from Taiwan to take care of the assembly of the iPhones.In the last reported quarter, Apple sales in India doubled year over year. However, the company has failed to make it to the list of top five smartphone brands in the country.According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) report released in November, Xiaomi and Samsung are the two leading smartphone brands in India with 23.5% market share each in the third quarter.Therefore, the company’s increasing focus on India to claim a greater share of the vast smartphone market, of which it reportedly holds only 2% currently, is prudent in our view.However, the market is highly cost sensitive. The Chinese competitors are providing smartphones at very reasonable prices.Reportedly, the majority of the smartphones sold are priced around INR 10K. iPhone 8, on the other hand, costs almost six times more while iPhone 9 costs nine times more.The lion's share of Apple’s revenues in the country comes from devices that are a couple of generations old. Newer models have relatively low demand given their hefty price tag.The denial of tax benefits will translate into an increase in pricing of the products, which might be detrimental to Apple’s growth in the country.Apple Inc.

569,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) recently launched two tools for video creators — Sound Collection and the 360 Community Page.Per a blog post by the company, the video editing tool Sound Collection offers users a number of free high-quality audio tracks and sound effects for creating videos and sharing them on Facebook and Instagram.Facebook intends to expand the collection by adding new tracks and sound effects. It is also set to launch discovery tools that will enable users to know about various artists, follow them and browse the best-suited sounds for their videos by genre, mood, length and vocals.Facebook also launched a new 360 community page by partnering with Blend Media that offers tools for making 360 degree videos. The page covers tutorials on everything related to 360 video productions. The company claims to have shared over a million 360 videos on the platform since the launch of the feature in 2015.Facebook also introduced its new Camera Loaner Program, by which users will be able to borrow cameras directly from Blend Media. The company will initially be lending the GoPro Fusion and ZCam S1 but eventually more cameras will be offered.A page for editing videos called 360 Director has also been launched for both Pages and profiles.We believe Facebook’s video efforts will continue to pay off big time.Notably, Facebook has gained 55.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 24.5% rally. Video – A Key Growth DriverFacebook intends to capture the opportunity presented by ever-increasing video viewing on social media platforms. Facebook had earlier noted video to be a “megatrend” on the same lines like mobile.Talking about its video efforts, on the last conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned, “video can serve as a touchstone for building community and helping facilitate interaction, then that's the thing that we feel like we can uniquely do that.”The company believes that over the next three years videos will be the key growth catalyst among all its product lines. Moreover, per the company, interactions and comments are 10 times more for live videos compared to other videos.In November, Facebook launched Creator App for creators to “manage their presence” on Facebook. In August this year, Facebook unveiled a new tab called “Watch” that will be exclusively dedicated to video viewing. The company is also increasing investment in producing more video content for the Watch tab.Facebook has also launched a website for creators, which will assist creators to “find resources and tips on how to create great videos, connect with fans, and grow on Facebook.”By bringing more video content, Facebook is trying to bring in more ad dollars, which remain the mainstay of the company’s revenues with over 95% contribution.Moreover, online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising.As video ads generate more revenues than its photo and text based counterparts, Facebook is trying to incorporate more and more video-oriented content to bring in more ad dollars.Facebook, Inc.

572,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced the addition of two new features, live streaming and video chat, to its Instant Games platform launched a year back on both Facebook and Messenger.Facebook will conduct a test run of the video chat feature, which will enable Messenger users to engage in video chats while playing games with one another, before rolling it out early next year. The company mentioned Zynga’s Words with Friends to be the first game to include this feature.The live streaming feature has however been rolled out already. It enables gamers to broadcast their games via Facebook Live and engage in conversations.Along with these, Facebook also announced a number of games to be launched on its platform by next year. The games include the highly popular Angry Birds, Sonic Jump from SEGA, LINE’s Disney Tsum Tsum and a new puzzle game by GungHo Online Entertainment Inc.The platform now offers 70 games globally from over 100 developers compared with the initial launch of 20 games in 30 markets.Notably, Facebook has gained 55.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 24.5% rally.Focus on Boosting User EngagementFacebook’s attempts to integrate more video content into the platform are expected to increase user engagement. The company focuses on “time well spent” rather than just increasing the time spent on its platform in order to build a better community.Talking about its video efforts, on the last conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that “connecting with friends and family and having those meaningful interactions is more important than just consuming content.”The CEO believes videos to be more “engaging than a photo and a better representation of that than writing it out in text.”We believe the addition of live streaming and video chatting while playing games will increase social interaction and thereby make the games more interesting and engaging.We note that Facebook was once the hub for social gaming but all that changed with the arrival of mobile games. Mobile games quickly gained precedence in the social gaming space. Facebook took a hit on the revenue front as in-game purchases floundered. Per Tech Crunch, at its peak, Facebook made about $250 million from in-game purchases.In October, Facebook rolled out testing of monetization options to select developers. The company began testing of in-app purchases and advertisements on Instant Games platform. We believe monetizing Instant Games will help Facebook to boost its non-advertising revenues.In the last reported quarter, revenues from Payments and other fees decreased 5% year over year owing to reduction in payment revenues related to PC games against 49% growth in advertising revenues. Management warned that the segment will face further decline as PCs lose market share.The company’s attempts to boost its non-advertising revenues as well as attract users to spend more time on its platform are prudent in our view. Moreover, the launch of live streaming games will also help it counter growing competition from YouTube and Microsoft who are ramping up their efforts to tap the market.Facebook, Inc.

574,NTAP,"The overlooked Deep Value ETF (DVP  -  Free Report), which carries an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a High risk outlook, emerged as the best-performing ETF of November. It gained 11.6%.Most of the gains came in the first half as concerns over the delay in implementation of corporate tax cuts and the sell-off in high yield bonds made investors jittery, triggering the demand for value stocks. Additionally, the recent technology rout and North Korea new missile tests led to a further increase in demand (read: Value ETFs & Stocks to Buy on Tax Cut Delay Concerns).Honing in on value securities ensures a safety net for investors as it includes stocks with strong fundamentals – earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow – that trade below their intrinsic value and are undervalued by the market, In fact, value stocks have the potential to deliver higher returns and exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts.Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of DVP.DVP in FocusThis ETF offers exposure to undervalued dividend paying stocks in the S&P 500 with solid balance sheets, earnings and strong free cash flow. It tracks the performance of the TWM Deep Value Index, charging investors 80 bps in annual fees. The product is home to 20 stocks with none accounting for more than 8.1% of the assets. It has amassed $104.3 million in its asset base and trades in a meager volume of 6,000 shares a day.DVP is a large cap centric fund, which tend to be the most stable in an adverse economic scenario while at the same time offer capital appreciation in a booming market (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Though most of the stocks in the fund’s portfolio delivered strong returns, a few were the real stars.

It carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of A. It saw solid earnings estimate revision of 11 cents this month for the fiscal year and has a solid Industry Rank in the top 40%. Foot Locker occupies the ninth spot in the fund’s basket with a 4.8% share.Macy’s (M  -  Free Report): This stock occupies the second position in the fund’s basket with 7.4% allocation.

575,NTAP,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced a number of tools and initiatives to promote social good at its second Social Good Forum held in New York.Facebook’s continuous attempts to provide social security goes on to prove its new mission, which is to “give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.""Facebook’s VP of Social Good Naomi Gleit was quoted saying, “We are constantly inspired by all the good that people do on Facebook and are committed to continuing to build tools that help communities do more good together.”We believe these initiatives will help the company to improve its brand image and in turn draw more advertisers to its platform. Notably, Facebook has gained 52.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 26.5% rally.New InitiativesFacebook declared that it is forgoing the 5% transaction fee that it used to charge on donations made to non-profitable organizations via its platform. Facebook will however continue to levy 6.9% payment processing fees in addition to charging 30 cents per donation on individual-established fund raisers in the United States.Facebook also expanded its charitable tools to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and in European countries. Donations made to charitable organizations and individuals in Australia, New Zealand and Europe are free from any transaction fees per Facebook’s donation guidelines.A Facebook Donations Fund of annual $50 million is also being set up to provide financial assistance during times of natural disasters or other important fundraisers.The company also announced the launch of new Fundraisers API and Community Help API. The Fundraisers API will enable people to expand the reach of their Facebook fundraisers beyond the platform, thereby helping them to garner more support. Community Help API will provide disaster response organizations access to information related to the needs of crisis-affected people posted in Community Help section.Facebook is also expanding its blood donation campaign. It plans to roll out the service in Bangladesh early next year.The social networking giant also unveiled a new “Mentorship and Support” program that will connect users who require help from experts at non-profit organizations. For achieving this, the company is collaborating with iMentor for education related support and The International Rescue Committee for support on crisis recovery.Facebook is considered to have pioneered the concept of social networking, which is why it enjoys a first mover’s advantage in this market. We believe that with the launch of more such initiatives, the company will witness an uptick in user base and engagements that will enable it to draw more advertising dollars.Facebook, Inc.

577,NTAP,"Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has conducted a security review of Intel Management Engine (ME), Intel Server Platform Services (SPS), and Intel Trusted Execution Engine (TXE) related to issues identified by external researchers.Outcome of the ReviewThe company has acknowledged the areas of concern that can be potential risks for the systems, which have been deployed since 2015. The company’s ME firmware displayed weakness through which the entire system could be hacked.Per Intel’s review, a hacker can access its platform and third-party information taking advantage of the system’s vulnerabilities, thereby posing a huge risk for users.Notably, Dell and Lenovo have stated that a huge number of systems have been affected by this. Though there have been no reports of a breach so far, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security wants a quick solution to avoid an unfavorable situation.The FixIntel has a launched a new tool that is available for downloading from its website to detect if a user’s system has been impacted. Windows and Linux users will be able to use the tool.However, the company will not be providing the patches for fixing the vulnerabilities.

Intel’s move seems to be in sync with this statement.Although quite late, Intel’s current approach related to the review process will likely help it regain customer confidence.

578,NTAP,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put NetApp, Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, NetApp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 19.5, as you can see below:This level compares somewhat favorably with the market at large, as the PE ratio for the S&P 500 comes in at about 20.7. If we focus on the long-term trend of the stock the current level puts NetApp’s current PE slightly below its highs over the observed period, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares slightly higher than the Computer and Technology sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is slightly overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that the company has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.7, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too.PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, NetApp has a P/S ratio of about 2.3. This is lower than the sector’s average, which comes in at 3.6 right now.Notably, NTAP is actually towards the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P/S metric, which suggests that the company’s stock price has already appreciated to some degree, relative to its sales.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, NetApp currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes NetApp a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though NetApp might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of F. This gives NTAP a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been trending downwards. The current year has seen 10 estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has also seen 10 upward revisions and no downward revision in the same time period.    This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has jumped 13.3% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has moved north by nearly 11%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteIn spite of the slightly bearish analyst opinion, the stock’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineNetApp is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics. Its industry ranks among the Top 43% out of more than 250 industries, signaling that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. However, the industry has underperformed the broader market over the past six months, as you can see below: Also, given the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

580,NTAP,"Tech has come a long way from the dot-com fiasco to a preferred trade by Wall Street pundits. Computer and software makers are having a ball as the White House’s initiative to trim tax rates are providing the much needed windfall to companies that have mostly hoarded money outside the United States. Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, while the lawmakers, regrettably, have been divided on the same so far this year.Substantial growth in cloud computing and the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launches of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech will keep rolling, at least for now. Lest we forget, the “FAANGtastic five” – Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) have gained in double digits this year. Amazon, in particular, topped the $1000-a-share level, highlighting the stellar show put up by tech stocks this year.Let us, thus, keep an eye on tech stocks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season that has unofficially kicked off this week.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions Under Trump Tax Plan Investors continue to pour money into Internet and tech companies, and the most basic thing that is driving them at this point is taxes. Trump has promised to deliver historic relief to corporate America by lowering tax rates. The corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. This helps tech multinationals to bring funds held overseas back to the United States at a decreased tax rate. Bringing back the tech companies massive overseas cash pile would let it do a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle ORCL hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.The tax plan, in the meanwhile, aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%. The current top rate is 39.6%. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force in the continued strength of big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest in such bellwethers. Q3 Should be Good for TechThe third-quarter earnings season, historically, is one of the best seasons for tech stocks.As per hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, 30 days after the start of the third-quarter earnings season, the information technology sector gained an average 4.6% in the last 19 years. Meanwhile, other major sectors including industrials, materials and financials have gained 2.8%, 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively. In fact, the S&P 500 index gained a meagre 2.3% during the said period.Tech stocks had an impressive 2017 so far, while earnings for tech companies in the third quarter are expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues (read more: Handicapping the Q3 Earnings Season).Tech Earnings Preview: Cloud Business is a Game Changer International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) will lead the tech earnings parade on Oct 17. Can the company break it’s more than five-year long streak of quarterly revenue decline? It’s cloud revenues had increased 15% in the second quarter, but, that too was nowhere close to the triple-digit growth Microsoft witnessed in the same quarter and 40% growth Amazon reported over the last couple of years. This time around the tech major could, however, see a boost in hardware sales on the back of the security-fortified z14 mainframes introduced in July.Things are looking up for SAP SE SAP, which will report before the market opens on Oct 19. It saw 33% growth in cloud revenues and a whopping 70% growth in its S/4 Hana business suite in the second quarter. With little competition in its core market, the software and service provider is expected to see strong results in the third quarter in the aforesaid segments.Meanwhile, all await the releases from Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft on Oct 26. Alphabet’s dominance in the search marketing business seems to be getting stronger with each quarter, while Amazon continues to lead the cloud space. Investors, however, will be keen to see how Diane Greene-led Alphabet does in the cloud business. In the second quarter, Alphabet reported 33% growth to $2.2 billion in the category “other revenues” that includes cloud.Microsoft, in the meantime, has almost doubled in the three-and-a-half years since Nadella took over as CEO. The big question is whether the company can maintain growth in its cloud business. So, all eyes are on its Azure product. After all, if we combine Azure and other software-as-a-service products, Microsoft will gain an edge over Amazon in the cloud business.5 Solid ChoicesTechnology companies, nevertheless, are likely to see solid growth in Q3 on the back of favorable government policy.

However, financial terms of the deal remain disclosed.The Netherlands-based Logicalis SMC was founded in 1998. This company is one of the leading providers of technology-enabled solutions for the service management sector in the Netherlands and the U.K.Moreover, Logicalis SMC is one of the biggest integrator of ServiceNow Inc.’s (NOW  -  Free Report) software and solutions, which mainly attracted DXC Technology to make such a move. It should be noted that Logicalis SMC was the first European company which became ServiceNow’s Master Solutions partner around 15 years ago.DXC Technology intends to integrate the to-be-acquired business with its Fruition Partners business which is the company’s leading global ServiceNow platform provider.The integration of Logicalis SMC business will further fortify DXC Technology’s position as a leading global software integrator for ServiceNow. The acquisition will help the company expand its presence across Europe. Also, it will strengthen its “scale, reach, industry experience and skills portfolio in the fast-growing enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) market.”Apart from this, DXC Technology will also benefit from Logicalis SMC’s strategic partnerships with companies like Cisco, International Business Machines and NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report).DXC Technology came into existence from the merger of the Computer Sciences and the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE  -  Free Report). The buyout of Logicalis SMC will mark DXC Technology’s second acquisition post its formation.This July, the company acquired privately-held Tribridge. Founded in 1998, Tribridge caters software services and cloud solutions needs of mid-market and enterprise customers in the areas of finance and operations, customer engagement, and human capital management.Since its first trading on Apr 4, 2017, DXC Technology has gained 26.3%, significantly outperforming the industry, to which it belongs to, return of 19.7%.We believe the recent buyouts will further solidify DXC Technology’s position as one of the leading IT services provider in the world.Post merger, DXC Technology has become the world’s second largest end-to-end IT services providing company after Accenture plc. We believe the merger has opened up a number of growth opportunities for the combined company. Following the footsteps of Computer Sciences, DXC Technology may be seen making strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio, which will likely drive growth over the long run.Nonetheless, the market is very competitive, with companies like CACI International Inc. and Accenture, which could hurt DXC Technology’s top and bottom lines. Additionally, a challenging macroeconomic situation and uncertain IT spending environment remain other headwinds.Currently, DXC Technology carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

582,NTAP,"NetApp Inc. (NTAP  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2018 results on Aug 16. Notably, the company’s earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters, with an average positive surprise of 23.5%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.88%. Non-GAAP earnings (excluding stock-based compensation) surged 56.4% from the year-ago quarter and almost 5% sequentially to 86 cents.Revenues increased 7.3% from the year-ago quarter and 5.5% from the previous quarter to $1.48 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 billion.The fiscal first-quarter 2018 guidance has been affected by seasonality. Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of 49–57 cents per share, which reflects 15% growth year over year at the midpoint. The unimpressive outlook has adversely impacted the share price momentum. NetApp stock has gained 19.4% year to date, underperforming the 21.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to ConsiderNetApp is now focused on expanding its total addressable market (TAM) by growing product portfolio and strengthening its dominant position in all-flash arrays and converged infrastructure markets. We believe that continuing penetration into Tier 1 SAN market will drive top-line growth.NetApp, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise NetApp, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | NetApp, Inc. QuoteMoreover, the company’s introduction of new hybrid cloud offerings such as NetApp HCI, an enterprise-scale hyper converged solution, is a positive for the company and may add to its customer base. Moreover, NetApp plans to expand its strategic partnership with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) for enhancement of hybrid cloud services. This is also anticipated to drive the top line growth.We believe that the growing adoption of NetApp’s SolidFire (acquired in 2016) is a major tailwind for the company’s top-line growth. Further, the company is also focusing on expanding its international operations, which will further drive results.However, tepid IT spending raises concerns about the company’s near-term performance. Intensifying competition from Western Digital and HP Inc. add to its woes.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that NetApp will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, currently stands at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 42 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: NetApp has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a couple of stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +2.57% and a Zacks Rank #2.
