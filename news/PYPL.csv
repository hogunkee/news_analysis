18,PYPL,"China will open up its massive electronic-payments market to foreign companies, a move that would pit newcomers against licensed, already established firms in the nation such as Tencent's (TCEHY) WeChat Pay and Alibaba (BABA)-backed Ant Financial's Alipay.XCompanies that apply for a payments license in China will need to store the information they collect within the nation's borders. Those firms will also need to establish a commercial presence in China, payment service facilities and disaster-recovery systems.The decision, the People's Bank of China said on Wednesday, was intended to encourage innovation and competition. But it also comes as President Trump, who has long complained that China has taken advantage of the U.S. on trade, readies a plan to hit the country with at least $30 billion in tariffs.The loosening of the payments market comes after Beijing last year eased rules for foreign banks to do business in China, potentially allowing U.S. giants like JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) to increase their presence in retail banking and financial services.JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also among the more than 30 U.S. banks that are in a consortium for mobile payment service Zelle, which transferred $75 billion through 247 million transactions in 2017.PayPal (PYPL), which owns Venmo, already has ties in China.

But several Dow Jones stocks have been solid performers. Nike (NKE) has sprinted to the top of the class of 2018, with Visa (V), Microsoft (MSFT), Boeing (BA) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) also in the top five.Their performance is in stark contrast to the five biggest Dow Jones losers in 2018..The sneaker powerhouse stock has soared 27.4% since the start of the year. That includes 11 % surge in Friday's stock market trading to a record high.The sportswear behemoth vaulted over Visa to become the top-performing Dow stock after Nike released stellar earnings late Thursday. North America sales rose 3% after three straight quarters of declines. And Nike announced a $15 billion buyback plan.The stock has now blasted out of buy range after breaking out from an 11-week flat base on May 16.

Visa stock found support at its 50-day moving average this past week, MarketSmith analysis shows.In what could be a key development in the online shopping era, Visa could abandon its faster-online-checkout option. Instead it would adopt a single shared-payment button for online payments with Mastercard (MA).Visa also has an alliance with PayPal. Users can now even draw on their Visa to pay for something via their phone in physical retail locations. This has given PayPal (PYPL) a foothold in this space, while increasing business for the credit card company.Microsoft has been the third-best performer in the Dow Jones. Indeed its annual price increase of 15.3% for the year has easily outstripped that of its more glamorous long-term rival Apple (AAPL), up 9.4%. In its most recent quarter the Redmond giant scored a double beat, with EPS up 36% to 95 cents and sales jumping 16% to $26.8 billion.In a somewhat similar pattern to Visa, Microsoft stock hasn't rallied much since clearing a six-week flat base in May. The stock remains in buy zone from its 97.34 buy point, closing at 98.61 on Friday.The Dow Jones stock got a boost back in March when Chief Executive Satya Nadella made sweeping changes by establishing two main divisions, continuing his transformation.

38,PYPL,"Last week's rally, led by the Nasdaq composite, signaled the stock market is looking healthier. But which stocks and sectors are likely to lead?The FANG+ stocks of Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) generally have been performing well. Salesforce.com (CRM) and other software stocks have been winners. Payment stocks are a pocket of strength. Many retail names, from Lululemon (LULU) to TJX (TJX) have been strong. Energy stocks from Chevron (CVX) to Marathon Oil (MRO) are doing well, but are subject to the ups and downs of crude oil prices. Biotechs are trying to make a recovery, with Biogen (BIIB) skyrocketing Friday on positive Alzheimer's drug news.Meanwhile, chips are still well off their highs, a bad sign for any stock market rally. Financials are near 2018 lows, with JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) kicking off earnings season Friday.Dow futures rose 0.5% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.5% above fair value. Keep in mind that Dow Jones futures and other overnight action doesn't always translate into actual trading in the next regular session.China's Shanghai composite roared 2.5% higher on Monday, after tumbling into a bear market in recent weeks. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1.3%. and Japan's Nikkei 1.2%. European markets showed modest gains intraday.During last week's holiday-shortened week, the stock market averages were volatile but ultimately rallied. The Nasdaq composite rallied 2.4%, the S&P 500 1.5% and the Dow Jones 0.8%. Friday's post-jobs, post-China tariffs rally was particularly significant. If you haven't already, you should read the latest Big Picture column.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe stock market came under pressure amid Trump trade war tariffs and threats over the past several weeks. President Donald Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, quickly matched by Beijing. Trump also threatened tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports. But for now, Wall Street has decided the Trump trade impact has been priced into stocks.If you look at the Nasdaq composite over the last several months, the tech-heavy index looks like it broke out on June 1, rallied for a few weeks, then erased those gains before rebounding again last week from its 50-day moving average.The S&P 500 index and Dow Jones have been consolidating since late January, with the S&P 500 in somewhat better shape.Stocks, even top stocks, tend to track the broader stock market. But sector rotations into and out of China internets, software stocks and energy names have left many individual stock charts looking more volatile.Amazon stock and especially Netflix stock have been two of the biggest stock market winners in 2018. Facebook stock, after a scandalous spring, is at record highs, slightly extended from a buy point. Apple stock is in buy range from 179.04 double-bottom entry. The Dow Jones component has pulled back to its 50-day line and could be working on a new consolidation. Alphabet (GOOGL) is below a buy point after a low-volume breakout last month and hitting resistance at its old high.Software accounts for four of the top 10 groups in the 197 industries that IBD tracks. Two more are in the top 20.Buying and holding individual software stocks has been a challenge. Salesforce, the top stock in the No. 3-ranked enterprise software group, staged a low-volume breakout in early May, then promptly undercut the buy point. It didn't trigger a 7%-8% loss that would trigger an automatic sell. By the end of May, following quarterly earnings, Salesforce stock was back in buy range and is now modestly extended.Meanwhile, some stocks did trigger the 7%-8% loss sell rule, like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT), while others round-tripped double-digit gains, such as Qualys (QLYS).Software Stocks To Watch: Okta (OKTA), an April 2017 cybersecurity IPO, is finding support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since a late April breakout. A solid gain in heavy volume could offer a buying opportunity. Alternatively, Okta could continue to consolidate for a few weeks, forming a new base and buy point.Collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) broke out last October. Anyone holding Atlassian stock since then would be sitting pretty. Since then the stock has staged a few failed breakouts but still moved up, generally following its 50-day. Atlassian stock is once again finding 50-day support but needs at least another week to form a proper base.Lululemon Athletica and Canada Goose (GOOS) are among the trendy apparel retail stock that have boomed in 2018. Specialty discounters such as TJX are faring well too, with TJX rival Ross Stores (ROST) stock in buy range currently. Five Below (FIVE) and Dollar General (DG) are setting up near buy points.An improving jobs market and Trump tax cuts have fueled consumers' wallets and confidence. Most retailers also aren't that exposed to Trump trade wars with Europe, China and others.Energy stocks are tricky to play because they tend to rise and fall with crude prices. (Refiners tend to benefit from a wider ""crack spread"" between crude and gasoline prices.)EOG Resources (EOG), a recent IBD Stock of the Day, broke out in early May and ran up for a couple of weeks as crude futures rallied. But the EOG stock pulled back below the buy point and found support at the 50-day line in June as crude also backed off multiyear highs. EOG Resources, known as the ""Apple of Oil,"" is setting up in a new base with crude hitting its best levels since 2014.Marathon Oil, another IBD Stock of the Day, also broke out in early May and ran up. Marathon Oil stock also pulled back to its 50-day line, but never undercut the buy point. Shares are now in a flat base within a base-on-base formation.Biogen shot up nearly 20% to 357.48 on Friday, racing toward a 370.67 cup-base entry. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) also is closing in on a buy point. But both Biogen and Vertex Pharma have relative strength lines, while improving, that were in downtrends for several months. The relative strength line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 indexNotable biotech ETFs, including iShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) and the triple-levered Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull (LABU) also are approaching possible buy points, but with RS lines that have made much headway over the past year.Payment stocks have been a pocket of strength. Mastercard (MA) and Dow Jones component Visa (V) have been consolidating near record highs for a few weeks, finding support around their 50-day or 10-week lines. Square (SQ) has also been acting well.

42,PYPL,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) keeps on shining. Lead manager Thomas Galvin has been at the helm almost 15 years. And over the past 15 years this growth fund has outpaced 86% of its large-cap growth fund rivals tracked by Morningstar.com, with an average annual return of 11.44% vs. 9.65% for its peers, going into Thursday.That outperformance has been fueled by focusing on stocks with superior earnings growth opportunities and attractive valuations. The ""select"" part of the $4 billion fund's name refers to the managers' concentrated approach, focusing on just their highest conviction ideas such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM) and Nvidia (NVDA).And the managers apply quantitative tools to manage risk. In a nutshell, a key step is to limit holdings' correlations, so their stocks are not vulnerable to the same risks. Ideally, any one torpedo in the form of a market problem won't sink more than one holding.This growth fund has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods on an annualized basis through June 20. Year to date, the fund is up 14.95% vs. the S&P's 4.46% and 10.67% for large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar.com.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseManagers Thomas Galvin, Richard Carter and Todd Herget each focus on different sectors, looking for companies that sustain above-average earning growth. They look for companies driven by secular opportunities rather than cyclical ups and downs.""We try to find companies that will grow their sales and earnings two times over the broader market,"" Carter said.On average, companies in the S&P 500 Index grew earnings about 6% annually from 1960 through 2017, Carter says. He and his teammates look for companies that are growing earnings more than 12% a year. On average, they end up picking companies posting earnings growth closer to 18% to 20%.""If we can find companies that are growing faster than the broader market, while improving and maintaining margins and returns on invested capital, we think that's a high-growth opportunity,"" Carter said.It's a best-ideas growth fund that holds 25 to 35 stocks. Carter says they're not trying to benefit from easy earnings comparisons year-over-year or quick spikes in energy prices or interest rates that are more cyclical in nature.Instead, this growth fund seeks firms benefiting from secular themes involving demographics, innovation, productivity and low costs. They want companies gaining market share, generating returns on equity above the market and balance sheets with little or no debt.Carter says 50% of the portfolio consists of established growth companies. The other 50% consists of emerging growth companies.Established growth companies are familiar names with stable profits, growing earnings by about 10% to 15%. This includes names such as Visa (V) and Nike (NKE).Emerging growth companies are raising earnings much faster, typically between about 20% and 30%, such as Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA).With only a $15 billion market cap, Ulta is a one-stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, which is stealing market share from both department stores and drugstores. Its sales growth is four times the entire retail sector, Carter says.One of this growth fund's long-term plays is Booking Holdings (BKNG), which includes online travel agencies Booking.com and Priceline. The fund originally bought the stock in 2009 at 100 per share. Now it's trading around 2,122.""In 2009, it was growing earnings north of 30%,"" Carter said. ""Today it's closer to 15% to 20%. We've owned it the entire time. It's gone from an emerging growth name to a more established growth name. It had high returns on equity when we bought it and it still does.""PayPal (PYPL) benefits as e-commerce grows as a share of U.S. GDP.

45,PYPL,"In a welcome move, Worldpay (WP) saw its Relative Strength Rating rise from 67 to 71 on Tuesday. X When looking for the best stocks to buy and watch, one factor to watch closely is relative price strength.This exclusive rating from Investor's Business Daily measures market leadership with a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score. The score shows how a stock's price performance over the last 52 weeks compares to all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the market's biggest winners typically have an RS Rating north of 80 as they begin their largest climbs. See if Worldpay can continue to show renewed price strength and hit that benchmark. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereWorldpay broke out earlier, but is now about 3% below the prior 83.94 entry from a double bottom. In the scenario where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to form. Also understand that the most recent consolidation is a later-stage base, and those involve more risk. The company reported 19% earnings growth in its most recent report, while sales growth came in at -8%. Worldpay earns the No. 14 rank among its peers in the Finance-Card/Payment Processing industry group.

47,PYPL,"SAN FRANCISCO — A top SEC official said Thursday that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities, adding that a key point in deciding whether a coin is a security is whether a cryptocurrency network is sufficiently decentralized.XNot being securities means transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't subject to SEC rules.""(When) purchasers no longer have expectation of managerial stewardship from a third party, a coin is not a security,"" said William Hinman, the head of the SEC's division of corporate finance, at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto.However this also means that initial coin offerings, which have in the past been launched by centralized teams, could fall under SEC rules.This is because initial investors could be buying coins in the belief they can profit when they go public and increase in value. In addition, at such an early stage they are not sufficiently decentralized.Bitcoin, which has been falling in recent days, was up 5.5% at $6,645.48 late Thursday, according to Coindesk. Ethereum jumped 9.1% to $519.51. Among Bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) rose 3.9% on the stock market today, Overstock.com (OSTK) gained 3.3%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) added 2.5%, and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied 9.25%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe SEC had indicated in the past that Bitcoin was not a security, but this was the first time an official has said the same about Ethereum, whose status was in question after it was launched by a core group of creators.""Putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,"" Hinman said.He also said applying the disclosure regime of federal securities laws to current transactions in Ethereum ""would seem to add little value.""Meanwhile, TruStory founder and CEO Preethi Kasireddy, whose young company uses tokens to incentivize users to uncover ICO scams, thinks the SEC has made the correct decision.However, she said there will be more trouble in the future, as she believes the SEC will have a ""hard time figuring out what's a security and what's not.""And she predicted cryptocurrency prices have much further to fall, and the drops so far this year are ""minor"" compared to what is to come.""I thought correction would be a lot more,"" she said. ""I think there'll be an even bigger correction.""Legal experts at the event welcomed the SEC's clarification. Grant Fondo, who chairs the digital currency and blockchain practice at the Goodwin Procter law firm, said it will help him structure potential token sales.He also believes more clarification will help America become more competitive in the cryptocurrency space.""I do think now more token sales (will) stay in the United States,"" he said. But ""it's a long way to see how it plays out. In the last six months there has been a big push offshore; hopefully this will help people come home.""However, it still remains an open question whether cryptocurrencies are actually good investments.Venture capital giant Keith Rabois, who is known for startup investments and his executive roles at the likes of PayPal (PYPL) and Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn, said there are ""no clear use cases at the moment.""The Kholsa Ventures managing director also said it is difficult to pick the best digital currency just now, when it is still unknown which has either a clear use or the best underlying technology.He added that it has been clear for a ""very long time"" that large swathes of ICOs have been violating U.S. securities laws.But Baiju Bhatt, co-CEO of the Robinhood investment app, said he believes that in the future cryptocurrencies will be an ""awesome store of value,"" though he said it is too early to pick a winner.""Don't believe the hype, pay attention to the details. There is going to be a lot of good that comes out of this,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

""Further, the company has sustainable growth opportunities in aftermarket sales, which are high margin, and also due to strong demand for active safety and improved emission products that they produce.""On news of its agreement to merge with the diesel locomotive business of Dow Jones industrials veteran General Electric (GE) in an $11 billion deal, Wabtec was full steam ahead on Monday, chugging forward nearly 4%. Shares retreated 1% on Tuesday. It lost about another 1% on Wednesday and was up Thursday morning. That left the stock ahead about 19% for this year. Wabtec shareholders will own 49.9% of the combined company. Lewis said, ""We believe the structure of the merger makes sense and view favorably that Wabtec management remains in control and is leading the merged company.""The fund's managers hope to hit similar jackpots with other holdings in leading stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Abiomed (ABMD).

Still, there are some broad themes that make some industries more likely ponds for the managers to reel in catches.One is the technology sector, where the managers see lots of growth stock stories. Information technology ended Q1 as the portfolio's largest overweight. ""We continue to find strong growth opportunities through bottom-up fundamental analysis,"" managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke told shareholders in their latest commentary. In the first quarter, the fund added to its stakes in Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL).Netflix has IBD's highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. Netflix offers TV shows and movies to subscription customers via the internet.Netflix is the most-watched streaming service, viewed by 46% of respondents, up from 42% a year ago, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley (MS). Original programming is the main draw for Netflix.Amazon Prime Video is the third most-watched streaming service. It now captures 30% of viewers polled by Morgan Stanley. That was up from 27% a year ago.Amazon's earnings per share were flat then grew 40% and 121% the most recent quarters. Trading around 1,584, shares are just above a 1,568.62 buy point.PayPal, a tech name to which the fund added, in November agreed to sell its U.S. consumer credit business to Synchrony Financial (SYF) for $5.8 billion. Last week, PayPal agreed to buy Sweden's iZettle for $2.2 billion. That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary. ""Despite potential measures to control drug pricing, drug pipelines are robust, with ample clinical trial readouts.""A maker of cardiac pumping devices, Abiomed is another stock with IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Trading around 390, shares are extended from a 304.38 buy point in a late-stage base.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's medical-products industry group. In turn, that group ranks a very strong No. 3 out of 197 groups. Leaders in strong industries get that way by showing superior earnings growth and sales.

Spotify directly listed its stock on April 3, bypassing an IPO.Square met earnings views, with revenue topping forecasts as Bitcoin transactions helped.

74,PYPL,"Look out, index huggers! The stock market is shifting in a direction that favors active managers and stock pickers, says T. Rowe Price fund manager Ann Holcomb. That should boost prospects for the stock mutual funds she helps run, whose portfolio holdings include leading stocks like Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Red Hat (RHT) and Mastercard (MA). Two of her funds have already done well in a variety of past markets, having outperformed the S&P 500 in calendar 2017 as well as over the three, five and 10 years ended Dec. 31.Only 10% of U.S. diversified stock funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that four-for-four feat, which makes them winners of the 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.The market is rotating to the benefit of active managers and stock pickers because of heightened volatility, says Holcomb, one of three managers of $635 million T. Rowe Price Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) and its institutional clone, $654 million Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX).Holcomb's funds bear an additional distinction. While Holcomb and her co-managers Jason Polun and Tom Watson oversee the portfolios and keep their eyes on the big picture, T. Rowe Price lets a team of some 30 analysts make buy and sell decisions for the fund. Each analyst runs his or her own sleeve, or segment, of the portfolio. It's like a professional sports team. Coaches oversee the team, but it's the players who score and play defense. Delegating that much responsibility to analysts is rare in the stock mutual fund world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHolcomb, who is 46 years old, discussed the funds' investment approach with IBD from her office in Baltimore, Md.IBD: How does the market environment impact Capital Opportunity?Holcomb: We've had years of low volatility, high correlations (among stock performances) and compressed dispersion. That's challenging for stock pickers. There's no extra reward for good stock picking if all stocks move together.But now, volatility is increasing and correlations are going down. That should continue as interest rates rise. That helps active managers in addition to stock pickers. They're the ones who can take advantage of mispricing vs. underlying stock values that our analysts discover.IBD: Why do rising rates cause that dispersion?Holcomb: They're not necessarily the cause, but they help. Companies that have been supported by free or low-cost money now get (somewhat) taken out of the market. High quality companies take market share.IBD: Your two funds are the only T. Rowe Price portfolios that let analysts make buy-sell decisions. Why use that approach? Is it because 30 minds are better than three?Holcomb: It was the idea of our current CEO, Bill Stromberg, when he became director of research in the late 1990s. Our analysts are experts. Bill wanted to showcase their stock picking by having them manage a portfolio within a risk-controlled framework. We limit how much their industry and sector weights deviate from the S&P 500.IBD: What's left for you portfolio managers to do?Holcomb: We have what we call an oversight committee. It consists of the named PMs and portfolio specialist Jennifer Martin. We decide which analysts join the team. We also look at how much of the S&P each analyst covers.We monitor the overall profile of the portfolio daily. This comes in the form of risk monitoring, looking at components of active risk, any tilts that develop in terms of looking more growthy or valuey. We're also analyzing the analysts' performance.We're also ensuring that there is consistency between their positioning in this portfolio and what they advocate (for other funds). We engage with our large, institutional clients as well.Also, we manage a monthly rebalancing process in which any positions that are outside our risk limits are brought back in line.IBD: Intuitive Surgical has been volatile since November. But it's in a long uptrend. What's driving that?Holcomb: Its fundamentals continue to improve. Analysts have raised their estimates. When companies deliver like that, sometimes it takes time for the market to catch up.We've had a big position for some time. Our analyst Jon Wood has a very favorable view. It's a bet on computer assisted robotic surgery, a bet that it becomes more mainstream. It's been adopted in urology and gynecology. Our analyst sees it being used more in general surgery.IBD'S TAKE: Learn why Intuitive Surgical hit a record high after reporting first-quarter results.IBD: The fund has trimmed its exposure to Red Hat. Do you still like it?Holcomb: Red Hat is the prime beneficiary of the increased use of open source software, driven by cloud computing. They have leadership in Linux. So Red Hat has a strong core, which is successfully expanding into cloud software.Analysts change their positioning for many reasons.... (In trimming the position in) Red Hat, which remains overweight in the fund relative to its weight in the S&P 500, analyst Ken Allen used it as a source of funds to reduce his underweight in Oracle (ORCL) (due to) the analyst's view that its prospects are improving.IBD: You hold Mastercard as well as Visa (V). Do you like one more than the other?Holcomb: They are largely doing the same thing. Looking at Mastercard, our analyst Jon Friar sees it as a sustainable mid- to high-teens earnings per share grower. Both companies benefit from the movement of payments from cash and checks to electronic. They have high incremental margins, pricing power and strong free cash flow conversion.With regard to Mastercard, they have a willingness to invest in next generation products, such as their acquisition (last year) of (U.K.-based payments technology company) Vocalink.Mastercard has a very attractive business model, with high barriers to entry.IBD: Why has the fund trimmed its stake in PayPal (PYPL)?Holcomb: Our analysts prioritize within their own sleeves. Our PayPal thesis has been that it can materially outperform due to monetizing their Venmo asset, or using their balance sheet to buy back shares or for some accretive M&A or if they have some core business surprises.Our trim in PayPal was because its valuation was not as attractive as some other names. We used it as a source of funds for those more attractive names. But, long-term, we see some PayPal characteristics that can still be in play, so it's still in the portfolio.IBD: Earnings per share growth in SVB Financial (SIVB) has accelerated for five quarters in a row. What's your thesis for this stock?Holcomb: Generally, SVB does well heading into a Federal Reserve (money) tightening cycle like the one we're in, and the market has not fully valued its deposits strength. We're looking at the potential for it paying a dividend. Usually, paying a dividend opens your investor base. So we started a position in March.IBD: Which do you prefer with S&P Global — its index business or its ratings business?Holcomb: It does have a lot of businesses. It is a compounder. It should grow earnings per share at a double-digit pace. It should improve its margins through cost cutting and price increases.Its ratings business has a market-leading share. And it is returning capital to shareholders.Also, its tax rate fell with implementation of tax reform.After the financial crisis, regulation of its space increased, but that just made it more difficult for competitors to get into their business, deepening the moat around their business.Like PayPal, Red Hat and Mastercard, S&P Global is a leader that is pulling further ahead of rivals.They're also shifting to a recurring revenue model, which makes their financials less lumpy and can lift their valuation. About 75% of their revenue is recurring vs. less than 60% five years ago.IBD: What's your thesis for Salesforce.com (CRM)?Holcomb: It pioneered SaaS (software as a service) applications. It remains by far the biggest company in that market. It benefits from a large ecosystem of software, hardware and IT services partners to make its products more valuable and make its market position even larger. And they're another company with a recurring revenues model.IBD: How does Diamondback Energy (FANG) fit into a growth portfolio?Holcomb: Well, we're a core portfolio with exposure to all S&P 500 sectors, including energy. Diamondback is one of the leading operations in the Permian Basin, where they've got a lot of low-cost acreage and can grow production faster with better results than a lot of competitors.They have low financial leverage, and their execution over the last several quarters has been excellent.IBD: Give me an example please of a play that is not part of the S&P 500.Holcomb: Worldpay (WP) is one. They're a combination of merchant acquirer and payments processor. This was Vantiv (until its takeover of Worldpay early this year). It has the best collection of assets among public merchant acquirers, and should grow earnings per share at a mid-double-digit pace for an extended time.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THESE:Want To Be A Millionaire?

Revenue of $11.97 billion also beat consensus views, and user numbers met expectations. Premarket action suggested the stock could open back above its 10-week moving average.

So TI's results are a good indicator for chips and end markets.STMicroelectronics (STM), chip-gear maker MKS Instruments (MKSI) and LED-chip maker Cree (CREE) also jumped overnight on their results.But big-cap chip-equipment maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled overnight on weak guidance. Teradyne warned of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices.That's not the most recent chip warning directly tied to smartphone weakness. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which makes a lot of chips for Intel, Nvidia and others, cited phone woes in its grim outlook last week.Still, the SOXX ETF rose a fraction in premarket trading.Intel, which reports earnings Thursday, rose 0.5% in Wednesday's premarket. On Tuesday, Intel closed up 0.7% at 51.45 after hitting 53.64 intraday, nearly retaking a 53.88 flat-base entry.Nvidia was indicated slightly lower after initially showing a modest gain.Remember that after-hours action in stock futures as well as individual stocks and ETFs doesn't always translate into regular-session gains.Chip stocks are a huge share of the market, especially in the Nasdaq. Chips are in so many products, from PCs, servers and smartphones like the Apple iPhone, to also ""non-tech"" products such as cars and appliances. So if semis are faring poorly, it's not a good sign for end demand in many industries. That's a big reason why last week's weak outlooks from contract chip giant Taiwan Semi and equipment makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML) have hurt the broader stock market.  Apple lost 1.4% on Tuesday after undercutting its 200-day line Monday. The iPhone maker has lost 8.6% over five sessions.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Is The Bull Market Finally Over?Despite Today's Market, Baozun And Solaredge Technologies Join This IBD Stock ListApple Stock Falls For Fifth Straight Day As Wall Street In 'Full Panic Mode'Google Earnings Raise Questions On Amazon.com Rivalry, SpendingFacebook, Twitter, Boeing, PayPal, Visa Earnings: Action Plan

83,PYPL,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq tumbled during the week as Alphabet (GOOGL), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) earnings and a 3% Treasury yield spooked investors. The stock market averages pared losses amid strong earnings from Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA), Visa (V) and others.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq found support near their 200-day moving averages, rebounding to close the week with fractional losses. The 10-year Treasury hit 3% for the first time in four years, hitting 3.02% during the week before pulling back to 2.96%. Short-term yields continued to rise faster than long-term rates, squeezing the yield spread. Alphabet (GOOGL) expenses and ongoing chip weakness also hit stocks. But Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Visa (V) rallied on strong results. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) initially hit buy points Friday, but pulled back.Amazon's first-quarter earnings skyrocketed, more doubling the EPS estimate.

Fellow Dow Jones stock United Technologies (UTX) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion.

Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study.

AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) both topped profit views and raised full-year guidance, though Bristol's sales missed some estimates. Shire (SHPG) said it's considering a raised $64 billion takeover bid by Japan's Takeda. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) topped views, though sales declined vs. last year. Vertex said it'll move another triple-pill regimen into Phase 3 studies.Domino's (DPZ) delivered a 59% EPS gain while revenue leapt 26% to $785 million, blowing out views. Shares rose 7.3% on Thursday. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) stock vaulted 24% to a 10-month high after EPS unexpectedly jumped 33%. Same-store sales also topped.

Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million.

New Oriental and TAL shares popped on their respective earnings days, but were slightly lower for the week intraday Friday.PulteGroup (PHM) on Tuesday crushed views with a 111% EPS jump to 59 cents, with home sale revenue leaping 21% to $1.9 billion. Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates. Fifty-two customers now spend over $5 million annually, a metric that is up 108% year over year.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) topped sales and adjusted profit views, but shares tanked as sales of transcatheter heart valve replacements lagged.Illumina (ILMN) beat the consensus. Adjusted profit rose 127% per share as sales swelled 31% to $782 million.Align Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share and $436.9 million in revenue, handily beating views for 98 cents and $408 million, respectively.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) delivered impressive Q1 EPS and revenue growth, but fell short of some lofty expectations. Shares fell 4.7% for the week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit. Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

Earnings are expected to grow 11% this year and 20% in 2019. Revenue growth is pegged at 82% this year and 9% next year.The market capitalization of Worldpay is roughly $25 billion and the company is carving a base with an 85.63 buy point. The stock is 4% off a new high.Georgia-based Fleetcor Technologies (FLT) is far along in a new consolidation. The stock is near a 213.84 buy point.Fleetcor's relative strength line is at a high, which is bullish. The RS line measures a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500. When the RS line hits a high before a breakout, that is especially bullish.Annual earnings grew 23% in 2017, the best gain in three years. Revenue also increased 23%.Fleetcor provides payment solutions to businesses. The company, which has a market cap of about $19 billion, partners with other firms such as Chevron (CVX), Uber and Sem Parar. The latter is a leader in electronic toll payments in Brazil.Global Payments (GPN) grew earnings 26% in 2017, the best gain in the past 12 years.

Bulls prefer to see a stock consolidate above that key support line.Global has a market cap of about $18 billion.Which of the three stocks is best? If an investor wants one quick test, the RS line at a high gives the nod to Fleetcor.Four stocks in the credit card space have gigantic market caps.Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL) and American Express (AXP) have market caps that are roughly three to 10 times bigger than the three payment stocks in the Big Cap 20.While the big four are not in the Big Cap 20, they deserve attention.

89,PYPL,"With Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) among its top holdings, First Trust Dow Jones Internet (FDN) plays the role of a FANG-themed ETF.The four stocks symbolize the largest internet companies, and as a group they had a phenomenal 2017.This year, the FANG trade has broken down somewhat.Shares of Alphabet, the parent of Google, remain deep in a price correction. Facebook — under fire over protections of personal data — is shaping a similarly weak chart.But Amazon and Netflix are near record highs, extending their impressive advances. Both have climbed back above the 50-day moving average after shaking off the March sell-off in technology and other shares. Netflix rallied after its latest earnings report, which showed strong subscriber gains.Despite the mixed performance, First Trust Dow Jones Internet remains an ETF Leader, with a gain of 15% so far this year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTo be sure, the FANGs are just four stocks in a portfolio of about 40 companies. But the FANGs do have the greatest weightings. Amazon accounts for nearly 10% and is the single largest holding. Facebook is nearly 8%, Netflix about 6%, and Alphabet class C shares and class A shares nearly 5% each.Another internet stock, PayPal Holdings (PYPL), has slightly more than 5%; most other holdings represent less than 3% of the portfolio. So the fund is definitely tilted toward the largest internet companies. Salesforce.com (CRM), the cloud-based customer management software firm, has been one of the ETF's winners this year, up about 13% from a breakout in January.The ETF tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which selects stocks with a three-month average market capitalization of at least $100 million and other liquidity measures. It is weighted by market cap, which explains why the big internet stocks are at the top.  The median capitalization is $8.29 billion, making the fund more of a mid- and large-cap vehicle.Internet stocks tend to trade at a premium valuation, and that's reflected in First Trust Dow Jones Internet's average price-to-earnings ratio of 52.4 (as of March 29).First Trust Dow Jones Internet certainly wasn't launched as a FANG exchange traded fund when it started trading in 2006. But it has tracked the fortunes of the internet sector, including the 2008 bear market.The ETF plunged 62% from a peak in October 2007 to the bottom in November 2008. It swooned 28% in another painful time in 2011, but since then has trended mainly upward. Its five-year performance (through the end of March) was up 22.8%, the three-year gain was 22.9%, and the one-year increase was 9.7%.RELATED:Amazon Prime Subscriber Numbers Revealed In Bezos Shareholder LetterHow To Invest In The Fast-Growing Cybersecurity IndustryChinese FANGs Are In KraneShares China Internet Fund

90,PYPL,"A key part of a swing trading strategy is how it minimizes losses in stock market corrections. But you also need nimbleness to get back in quickly when the market turns. Otherwise your performance can lag.This most recent correction in March started with little exposure in IBD's SwingTrader. Taking profits on the way up left us in cash at the Nasdaq composite's closing high on March 12 (1). We tried a trade in PayPal (PYPL) on March 14 (2) when the market was still close to its highs. We started scaling out the next day as the stock reversed.After a quick drop in the market, we put HubSpot (HUBS) on SwingTrader. It was only a half position. Though HubSpot was breaking out, the Nasdaq's rally attempt never cleared the high from two days earlier (3), which made us cautious. HubSpot exited the same day, ahead of its stop loss, because it reversed from its highs. It was a rare day-trading example for SwingTrader, but the negative action spurred us to protect capital.The Nasdaq composite had a more powerful rally attempt on March 26 (4). This time, the index was up over 3% and cleared the previous day's high. A spike in the Cboe Market Volatility Index, otherwise known as the VIX, also suggested a possible short-term bottoming signal. IBD's Psychological Market Indicators page shows this signal's history for the past year.We tried Netflix (NFLX) that day because of its relative strength at the time. Whereas the Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average, Netflix was well above its 50-day line. But this didn't pan out either. As the market and the stock reversed, we started scaling out of the Netflix position early in the day and removed the remaining shares at day's end.The Nasdaq had another rally attempt that failed quickly on March 29 (5). GoDaddy (GDDY) joined for only a day. We didn't wait for the stop loss and removed the stock as it and the market both showed bearish reversals. The early removal kept the loss small at just over 1%.IBD'S TAKE: SwingTrader is soundly beating the S&P 500 by going to cash before both 10% corrections in 2018. Take a free trial today.It was four losses in a row, but the damage was minimal. First, each purchase was one at a time and HubSpot was only a half position. Second, we cut losses quickly, averaging less than a 2% loss for each trade. That would keep the hit to your portfolio well under a half percent per trade. The Nasdaq by contrast fell 10.9% during that time.One of the psychological aspects of markets is a tendency to find success on the third try. It's a pattern that repeats itself. Often these waves down can last weeks or months. In the swing trading strategy, time is condensed and focused more on days.This latest third rally attempt began on April 3 (6) after another VIX spike suggested a short-term bottom. This time the Nasdaq had more substance to its pullback, with more than a 10% drop from its high. While the index gained 1% on this first day, it was an inside day. That's where both the high and low fall inside the trading range of the previous day. They tend to be questionable signs of direction changes.The following day, however, showed more power with a 1.5% jump on an outside day (7). Both the high and low fell outside the previous day's trading range. The Nasdaq closed near its peak, and it broke above the high from two days prior. We started adding stocks to SwingTrader the next day.The biggest headwinds have come from headlines, mostly on tariffs and fears of a trade war. Still, the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day (8), increasing the chances of the rally continuing, at least in the short term. The index poked its head above its 50-day line but closed the week back below it. Some retracement here wouldn't be unusual. The four names currently on SwingTrader held up through last week. Their performance this week will inform our market outlook and whether we'll need to go into defensive mode again.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Stay For The Stock Gains, Avoid Corrections With Swing Trading  Know The Three-Waves Rule In Bear Market DeclinesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

91,PYPL,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite rose strongly early in the week, but then erased most of those gains by Friday's close. Netflix (NFLX) soared on subscriber growth and guidance, while energy stocks busted higher as crude oil prices kept rising. Alcoa (AA), American Express (AXP) and UnitedHealth (UNH) jumped on their Q1 reports. That offset weak outlooks from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and chip-gear giants Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML). The broader chip sector and Apple (AAPL) came under pressure.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite were all up more than 1% through Thursday, but by Friday's close were up about 0.5%. The major averages rallied through Wednesday on Netflix (NFLX) earnings and oil-fueled energy stocks. Stocks pulled back as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) warned on the rest of 2018, citing weak smartphone demand. Already pressured by weak ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) guidance, chip stocks sold off. Apple (AAPL) also came under heavy pressure Thursday and Friday on iPhone demand concerns. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.958%, a four-year high.Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) added 7.41 million streaming subscribers in the first quarter, beating its target for 6.35 million. It ended the March quarter with 125 million subscribers worldwide. Netflix expects to add 6.2 million subscribers in Q2, topping Wall Street's target of 5.2 million. Netflix also topped Q1 EPS and sales figures and guided higher for those metrics in Q2. Q1 subscriber numbers benefited from new original content such as science-fiction series ""Altered Carbon"" and fresh seasons of comic-book series ""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" and comedy ""Grace and Frankie."" Shares shot up to a record high.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) cut its sales outlook for the rest of the year, largely on softer smartphone demand, slamming chip stocks and Apple (AAPL). Taiwan Semi is the world's largest contract chipmaker and counts Apple, Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) among its customers. Meanwhile, chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML Holding (ASML) pressured semiconductor stocks a day earlier with weak outlooks. Lam's equipment shipment view for the rest of the year came in light, while ASML forecast a lower gross profit margin for the current quarter.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

100,PYPL,"AB Large Cap Growth (APGAX) is in an elite group of top mutual funds. It is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. That takes extraordinary consistency. For $6.3 billion Large Cap Growth and other U.S. stock mutual funds, the bogey they've beaten is the S&P 500. Across all categories, only 22% of eligible funds managed the four-time feat.More impressively, AB Large Cap Growth outperformed in all four time periods in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. How hard is it to gain entry to the winners' circle? Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.To become a top mutual fund like this, lead manager Frank Caruso, co-manager John Fogarty and senior research analyst Vinay Thapar have assembled a diversified portfolio that includes leading stocks in auto parts, health care, financials and technology such as Copart (CPRT), Edwards Lifesciences (EW), Zoetis (ZTS), S&P Global (SPGI) and Nvidia (NVDA).Holding periods vary, but the stocks in the past 12 months have risen from 48% for Edwards to 49% for S&P Global, 55% for Zoetis, 63% for Copart and 116% for Nvidia.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Caruso and his team have been trimming one of those leading stocks because of a growing competitive threat. Below, Caruso describes which of those stocks he has reservations about and why.Meanwhile, overall finding stocks that persistently outperform the market depends, Caruso says, on finding ""idiosyncratic opportunities to invest.""Sixty-one-year-old Caruso and his colleagues — Fogarty, 48, and Thapar, 39 — discussed that and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from their offices in Manhattan.IBD: This portfolio is a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. What does it take to outperform so consistently over periods as short as 12 months to 10 years?Frank Caruso: We focus on looking at businesses, not stocks. We are attracted to businesses with differentiated competitive positions, companies that produce higher than average levels of profitability, profitability that exceeds the fair cost of capital.Here's our secret sauce: we start by looking for good businesses, then we obsess over each company's idiosyncratic opportunities to invest and to earn high returns on capital.IBD: What exactly do you mean by 'idiosyncratic opportunities to invest'?Caruso: It is an investment opportunity that is company specific. It occurs when a company takes action that can put upward pressure on profitability. Take Nike (NKE). They've been chasing low-cost labor since the 1960s. We noticed patent filings that looked like new manufacturing technology. If they could build shoes with robotized machines, they could build plants closer to consumers, saving on tariffs, duties and shipping.IBD: The fund is fairly concentrated, with just 47 stocks as of Jan. 31. Why do you prefer a concentrated approach?Caruso: First, we think we're good at researching companies. And we want to get paid for research.Second, having around 50 names allows us to get exposure to some larger-cap companies and also seed the portfolio with sometimes younger and more exciting companies.Forty-seven is near the small end of our portfolio size range. We may have been in the low to mid sixties when we first took over this portfolio in 2012. We were still shaping the portfolio to our vision.IBD: Auto auctioneer Copart is one of your smaller names with a market cap under $12 billion. It has posted three straight quarters of earnings per share growth acceleration. What's the driver?Caruso: They're probably not the type of business in a lot of growth portfolios. They have high profitability, and they are high versus their cost of capital. Yet it's surprisingly stable. One secular trend that gives us confidence in the sustainability of their performance is that as autos become more complex, it leads to more attractive salvage rates. With more and more cars, it's too expensive to repair ones that get damaged. So Copart's supply of inventory gets bigger.IBD: You began your current stake in August. Why then?Caruso: Over a multiyear period, Copart's infrastructure did not perform efficiently to exploit new inventory when it arose due to (hurricanes). So the company invested money to upgrade its capabilities. In the August hurricane season, investors questioned whether Copart had done enough, lowering Copart's share price. We bought on that uncertainty.IBD: For the most part, you've been building your stake in Edwards Lifesciences. Why?Vinay Thapar: They pioneered development of transcatheter aortic valves. Before that, patients had to do through open-heart surgery and go on a bypass machine to have their valves repaired. Edwards got around that by engineering a product that could be inserted by snaking a catheter through an artery in the leg.It is far more minimally invasive and results in faster discharge from the hospital. The average patient cost is 10% to 15% less than the open-heart procedure. Yet the product has higher than average gross margins and operating margins. We expected an uplift in return on the company's invested capital (ROIC), and that has occurred. There's about an 18% ROIC, which is close to the upper echelon in other companies.The company forecasts the market to be about $5 billion-plus by 2021, and it's only $2.5 billion to $3 billion now. Beyond that, they're looking at using the same procedure for a different valve, the mitral valve, which would be a new market.IBD: Zoetis is another name in which you've been building your stake. What's fueling your interest?Thapar: They're the leader in pharmaceuticals for animal health. Our thesis is that after their spinout from Pfizer, they had an opportunity to improve their operating performance. They right-sized their number of SKUs (items for sale), they closed manufacturing facilities. Those improved their gross margin. And they committed to investing in higher returning R&D projects.Their single-digit top-line growth above the market growth rate, along with cost improvements, had led to higher returns. Going forward, their pipeline of products is yet to be reflected in their stock price. And they've committed to reduce their inventory balance, which will improve their return on invested capital.IBD: S&P Global is another holding whose EPS growth has accelerated. Why has that happened?Caruso: We're modeling annual revenue growth in the 6% area for the next four or five years, along with low single digit earnings growth.Their index business has been a big part of their success. And their ratings business is a best-in-class franchise. In a low-rate environment with a good level of volatility, the expectation is that if there's an increase around the world, their ratings business should benefit and maybe some parts of their index business.IBD: You've been in Nvidia a long time. Does this story have much runway left in front of it?Caruso: It's been in this portfolio since 2014. Their graphical chips have found new applications. Think AI (artificial intelligence), think hyperscale data centers, think VR (virtual reality), think auto vision.But Nvidia's GPUs are general purpose chips. And we think there are application-specific chips from early-stage companies that will become competitive for market share in the next 15 to 18 months. So we've been trimming our position.IBD: Booking Holdings (BKNG) is Priceline's new name. Why do you like that particular online travel agency?John Fogarty: They changed their name to reflect their primary assets in the online travel portfolio. Their appeal is their dominant position in Europe, where the hotel market is far more fragmented than in the U.S., where the industry is dominated by chains. Booking can take advantage of Europe's fragmentation, so they enjoy a higher commission rate as a result.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio. Why did you introduce it?Fogarty: We began to buy it in the fourth quarter of 2017. The growth of PayPal is essentially riding the increased adoption of online payments and, in particular, mobile payments. We're attracted to their rising return on assets trajectory — not just their growth, but their increased profitability.IBD: Anyone want to add any comments?Caruso: John summarized our thoughts about PayPal. It's taking market share, we expect it to grow in the high teens over the next three years and it complements our Visa (V) exposure.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal is a former stock on IBD's SwingTrader, an exclusive IBD feature that helps you take advantage of short-term trends by applying the rules of IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System in a swing trading environment.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average traded 1.2% and 1.3% lower.

103,PYPL,"The major market averages were mostly unchanged in early trade Thursday, as they mounted a furious rebound following an early dive. Social media giant Facebook (FB) jumped to a new high in the stock market today. All three major indexes — the Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq and S&P 500 were only slightly below their break-even marks.X Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin fell over 8% to $9,300 on CoinDesk after India's government said it will take all measures to eliminate payments using the cryptocurrency.Among companies reporting earnings, Facebook beat Q4 earnings targets. The stock moved up over 2% to hit a fresh record high. Its 5% buy range from a 184.35 flat-base entry runs up to 193.57, so shares are barely still in buy range.Ferrari (RACE) raced 5% higher to break out past a 121.24 cup-shaped base buy point. Early Thursday, the luxury-car maker reported strong quarterly results.Meanwhile — after the closing bell — three tech heavyweights will report their quarterly results: Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL).Alphabet sits well-extended from a 1,006.29 flat-base buy point. Analysts expect the search giant to report EPS of $10.12 on revenues totaling $25.66 billion.Amazon fell 0.6% and is extended from its most recent buy point — a 1,213.51 flat-base entry. Analysts estimate EPS of $1.85 on revenue of $60.03 billion.Apple rallied 0.3% Thursday ahead of its much-anticipated fiscal-Q1 earnings release. Consensus estimates show EPS rising nearly 14% to $3.82 on a 10% boost in revenues to $86.29 billion.Among retailers, Ralph Lauren (RL) posted declining same-store sales globally and in North America, sending its shares 2% lower. The stock has had a near-100% recovery off its lows set in May 2017. Shares are extended above a 97.30 cup-with-handle entry.Inside the IBD 50, Alibaba (BABA) dropped over 3% after its earnings fell short of analyst targets, sending shares back into buy range from a 191.85 cup-shaped base buy point. But potential investors should wait for signs of strong support before considering a new purchase of shares.Payment processor PayPal (PYPL) plunged over 8% after eBay (EBAY) said it will switch to a new payments provider, Adyen. Shares of PayPal gave back all of their gains from a 79.49 flat-base entry and found themselves fighting for support at the 50-day line.RELATED:Avoid This Major Investing Mistake: Trading Without Any Rules, DisciplineBring Your A Game As Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Alibaba Report: Action PlanHow To Sell: Don't Freeze If Double-Digit Gain In A Stock Shrinks FastLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

104,PYPL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were mixed vs. fair value early Thursday. Alibaba (BABA) fell 3% as the Chinese e-commerce giant fell shy of earnings estimates. Apple (AAPL) reports later tonight, along with Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)X Overnight, iPhone chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) shot up on its earnings after Broadcom (AVGO) released positive sales figures early Wednesday, offering some hope for Apple's stock.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) sold off initially on earnings late Wednesday but then rebounded. PayPal (PYPL) fell modestly in early after-hours action, but then plunged late in the session,S&P 500 index futures were fractionally higher vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures fell 0.1%.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open or close in the followingvvv regular session. Volume will be much heavier, while analysts and investors will have more time to sift through the figures and comments.Facebook topped adjusted earnings and sales growth estimates, but shares sold off more than 4% in early after-hours trading after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said changes to its News Feed reduced users' time on the site by 50 million hours every day. Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada fell for the first time ever, falling to 184 million users from 185 million in Q3.But late in the post-earnings call with analysts, Facebook said ad rates have soared. COO Sheryl Sandberg said News Feed changes may reduce how much time people spend on Facebook but shouldn't affect profitability. Facebook turned higher and was up about 1% in premarket trading.Facebook closed down 0.1% at 186.89 in Wednesday's stock market trading.The online payments processor reported a 30% earnings-per-share gain for the fourth quarter. PayPal also gave largely in-line guidance for 2018. Shares initially fell modestly in late trade after rising to a record high during Wednesday's regular session. But then former parent eBay (EBAY), which also reported earnings after hours, said it would drop PayPal as its online payment provider for Dutch firm Adyen. The eBay deal with PayPal doesn't fully end until 2020 and eBay said it'll accept PayPal as an option until at least July 2023. But PayPal fell much further, trading down more than 8% in premarket action.Qorvo reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results late Wednesday, but guided low for the current Q4, citing weaker handset sales. That offered further, implicit confirmation that Apple will cut guidance when it reports holiday-quarter results Thursday night.But Qorvo shot up 11.5% to 80 in late trade. That's after rising nearly 6% so far this week, retaking its 50-day and 200-day moving average. Admittedly, Qorvo's late-night gains likely reflect the company's hints that it will get a bigger share of chips in the iPhone.But Qorvo's recent action also suggests the bad news may be priced in, at least for iPhone chipmakers.Before Wednesday's open, Broadcom, another Apple chipmaker, reported preliminary sales that were above estimates, while also guiding high for current-quarter revenue. Shares rose 2.9% during the regular session, though they closed below their 200-day moving average.As for Apple itself, the tech titan's shares closed up 0.3% to 167.43.Apple is still down for 2018, trading well below its 50-day moving average and a 176.35 flat-base buy point. Worse, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is holding at its worst levels since mid-June. Investors should be focusing on stocks that are truly leading the market.Qorvo and other suppliers and other measures suggest that Apple is seeing weaker iPhone X demand.

119,PYPL,"Holding through a stock's significant decline that could lead to a new potential base is a challenging prospect. Who wants to sit through a potential 15% or 20% drawdown for an indeterminate period of time with virtually nothing but a belief that the stock will head higher? Yet that is one way to make long-term outstanding gains with true leaders in a healthy stock market.Let's take a look at PayPal (PYPL), which had a big move from its first-stage base in late April 2017 until its sell-off in the first two weeks of February this year.The stock moved sharply above its first buy point — a shallow six-month cup with handle with a 43.90 entry — on April 24, 2017, just days ahead of the company's quarterly results. A strong first-quarter report sent the stock soaring more than 6% on April 27; volume surged 459% above its 50-day average.At least four aspects factor into a decision to hold a stock long-term.First and foremost is the stock's fundamental story. PayPal has become a household name; users ""venmo"" each other money. Venmo is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases and has become one of PayPal's strongest-growing services.Second, check out the company's quarterly earnings and sales. PayPal has recently posted five quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. Accelerating growth means that earnings showed a larger percentage gain in the latest quarter than in the prior quarter. At least two quarters of accelerating earnings growth is a bullish fundamental metric shared by many of the stock market's big winners. IBD Stock Checkup shows the number of quarters of accelerating EPS growth for every stock.Third, a nice profit cushion is a requisite for holding a stock. A flat base can correct up to 15% and still be proper. Meanwhile, the math off the top can be brutal. A 15% decline erases an almost 18% profit, so starting off with a greater than 20% gain is a solid idea.Finally, patience is the last necessary quality, and only when the market is in a solid uptrend. Letting a stock idea bake requires the ability to focus on the macro picture and not the daily price swings from high to low.Remember, weekly charts — found on IBD and MarketSmith — come first. It's easy to lose your way in the daily volatility of a stock's action, and the weekly chart smooths out that choppiness. A simple longer-term sell rule is the first significant close below the 10-week line (or the 50-day moving average on a daily chart). Leading stocks can go months, even years, without taking out that institutional support level.Even when PayPal built a 13.6%-deep flat base at the end of 2017, the 10-week line guided the stock higher. The new base featured a 79.48 buy point, 10 cents above the left-side high.In the week ended Feb. 2 this year, PayPal plunged through its 10-week line, closing down over 10% on the week in volume surging 105% above the 10-week average. It was the stock's first significant close below that level since the start of its move back in April, over nine months ago. On Feb. 6, PayPal fell more than 7% below the latest buy point, triggering a key loss-cutting sell rule. Driving the stock lower was news that its former parent, eBay (EBAY), would be ending their relationship by switching to a new digital payments provider.While that seems like a big giveback off the top, even selling at the Feb. 6 session low of 72.25 still captures a gain of at least 64% from the early cup-with-handle buy point of 43.90, while giving the stock room for an ever bigger move to the upside. You have to be willing to sacrifice a portion of your profit for greater potential upside, which underscores the importance of maintaining a lower-cost basis.It's great to have conviction, but only as long as the stock is going up. Remember, while buying a stock is primarily driven by its fundamentals, selling a stock is most definitively based on the chart. When it starts to trigger classic sell signals, it's time to listen to the stock and lock in hard-fought gains, especially when the market environment is falling apart.If the market regains its stride and the stock constructively builds a new base, you can always buy the stock back at a new risk-optimal buy point.(A version of this article was first published on Feb. 9, 2018.)Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Which Way Is The Stock Market Headed?

121,PYPL,"If you want to make money in stocks this year, it's not too late to first take a few steps back before you go forward. Take some serious time out to review your past trades.You could dramatically improve the results of your portfolio performance going forward.It's always fun to see how your good investments worked out. But looking back also lets you see how and why the bad trades emerged. A sober analysis will give you a leg up for the rest of 2018. If you learn how you made your mistakes, you can write a rule about them and vow to always follow it. This disciplined approach will help you avoid making the mistakes again.First, print out charts of your disappointing trades. Mark the day or week when you bought shares and when you sold.Print a chart of the Nasdaq or the S&P 500, and study the market trend in which you made the trades. Did you tend to buy when the market was falling or flat-lining? Were breakouts from proper buy points fizzling fast? If yes, then write down this rule: I will deploy cash only when IBD's Market Pulse outlook states ""confirmed uptrend.""Your chances of catching a rising stock are now instantly greater.Note the price and volume of the stocks you buy. Do you home in on cheap shares priced in the single digits? If so, you might want to write a rule in which you focus only on those that trade for at least 15 a share. Also, focus on those with an average dollar volume of $25 million to $50 million or more. Institutions — the main drivers of big stock winners — tend to favor higher priced stocks with ample volume.Such a rule would likely have steered you toward big-cap winners such as PayPal (PYPL), which on April 21, 2017, cleared a 43.90 entry in a long cup with handle in active turnover, 45% above its 50-day average. At that time, the digital payments firm traded 5.52 million shares on average over the prior 50 sessions. So the average dollar volume was a hefty $240 million per day.When the market is in the late stages of a bull run, it's sensible to take gains quickly. Instead of waiting for each stock winner to rise 20% or 25% from the proper buy point, start taking gains at 10% to 15%.Avoid round-trips in good stocks. Don't let a gain of more than 10% gain evaporate to zero or become a loss. If you get shaken out of a stock, you can always buy it back when it presents a new buy point.Study the volatility of the stocks you traded. Do they swing, say, 10% or more from weekly low to high on a regular basis? Such stocks tend to chase people out after rushing to new highs.Are you trading too much? Take a break from all new buys if the number of losing trades begins to exceed your winning ones.Also, study your equity curve. Do it by plotting your monthly account balance on a graph. Over time, is your equity rising steadily and holding up well during long periods? That's ideal. But if the graph looks like a string of hairpin curves, you're more prone to taking too many trades that ultimately erase your hard-earned profits.One of the most important keys to achieving steady gains and staying in sync with the market is to watch the market every day.It takes only two minutes at most to check IBD's Market Pulse and scan the Big Picture column so that you know when to be in the market.If you don't make such a daily habit, your results will likely suffer.""Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm — to forget to plant in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest?"" Stephen R. Covey wrote in ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People."" ""The farm is a natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.""For serious IBD readers, post-trade analysis is part of the price that must be paid.(A version of this column was published in the Jan. 5, 2015, edition of IBD.

134,PYPL,"Technology stocks fell again on Monday as Republicans met to meld the Senate and House tax reform measures and investors fretted that the tech sector's gains may disappoint vs. those of banks and other industries.While financials have rallied, the technology sector has given back some of its year-to-date gains. One reason tech leaders — including FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — are getting hit is that fund managers are raising cash to buy financials, says BMO Capital Markets.From a macroeconomic perspective, JPMorgan says that higher bond yields are another factor in a market rotation out of growth stocks such as technology and into financials.There's also the nitty-gritty of tax reform. The Senate's version, passed late Friday, would cut the U.S. corporate rate from 35% to 20%; limit interest deductibility to 30% of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization); and lower the tax on repatriated overseas cash to 14% from the current full 35%.It also will allow the immediate expensing of capital spending over the next five years, which was helping telecom and cable companies on Monday. Comcast (CMCSA) surged 4.9% to close at 40.32, AT&T (T) was up 2.1% to finish at 37.27, and Verizon Communications (VZ) gained 0.9% to end the day at 51.72.The trouble for tech companies, though, is that they hold the most cash overseas, and the Senate's proposed 14% tax rate on such earnings is higher than expected. President Trump had proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings, while the House has proposed an 8.5% rate.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among companies with the most overseas cash.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.While tech companies may bring back some cash if Congress passes tax reform, the legislation disallows some accounting measures by multinational companies. Another concern for tech companies is what happens with the research-and-development tax credits many companies use.Many biotech, pharma and manufacturing companies benefit from a research-and-development credit under which firms recoup some of the costs for spending on innovation, according to the Wall Street Journal. This is often for the wages of scientists and engineers.The GOP tax plan could hurt the R&D tax credit in lieu of retaining the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision that was initially expected to go by the wayside in the plan. Companies worked over the weekend to change congressional opinion on the tax ahead of the late-hour Senate vote.Amazon was down 2.4% to close at 1,133.95 on the stock market today, Netflix fell 1.5% to finish at 184.04, Facebook slid 2.1 to end at 171.47, and Google dropped 1.3% to 1,011.87.

138,PYPL,"The major stock indexes were modestly higher heading into the close after briefly turning negative following the Federal Reserve's policy meeting. The central bank left its key lending rate unchanged at 1.25% to 1.5%, but made slightly more hawkish comments about inflation.Before the meeting futures traders saw a 75% chance for a quarter-point hike at the March meeting to 1.50% to 1.75%. After the decision and statement, traders now see an 82% chance. That's according to data from CME Group FedWatch.X A 1% intraday gain for the Dow Jones industrial average faded to end with a 0.4% gain.

139,PYPL,"An ugly day turned even uglier as key stock index funds sold off hard Thursday as Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) weighed, and the Nasdaq gave up its 50-day moving average.

140,PYPL,"Newell Brands (NWL) appointed four directors picked by billionaire investor Carl Icahn to its board, the consumer goods company announced Monday.Newell, whose portfolio spans includes Rubbermaid containers and Sunbeam toasters, also will speed up plans for a revamp. The troubled New Jersey-based company is looking to slim down and focus on brands with attractive margins and growth potential.Icahn, who owns about 6.9% of Newell's shares, agreed to vote in favor of Newell's nominees for directors at an upcoming annual meeting. That could help Newell fend off another activist investor. Starboard Value is engaged in a proxy war with Newell, proposing its own director slate. Starboard told shareholders earlier in March that Newell is poorly run.Icahn said Monday the new board will create significant value for shareholders. He also noted that Icahn Enterprises has previously played a similar role at companies such as eBay (EBAY)-PayPal Holdings (PYPL) and Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Investors may believe that the Icahn deal eases pressure on Newell to make more radical changes.They have nearly halved in value over the past year, with losses accelerating after Newell missed profit and sales expectations in November and cut its guidance.Tupperware Brands (TUP) dropped 2.4%.Icahn's directors include his son Brett Icahn; Patrick Campbell, former chief financial officer of 3M (MMM) Company; Andrew Langham, general counsel of Icahn Enterprises; and Courtney Mather, portfolio manager of Icahn Capital.Monday's news comes just days after Icahn disclosed buying a minority stake in Newell Brands and said that he could seek a board seat.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Facebook Furor Hits Futures; S&P 500 Set To Break Key SupportThese 5 Stocks Have Dipped Below Buy Points, But Don't Give Up On ThemQ1 Earnings: Who Joins Netflix, Twitter On List Of Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth?New To Looking At Base Patterns?

141,PYPL,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, your watch list names this week are five hot stocks that are working on bases and nearing buy points: Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA), Visa (V), Electronic Arts (EA) and STMicroelectronics (STM). All five have relative strength lines that are all at or near the highs of their consolidations, which is bullish.In addition to the relative strength line, there are many other technical factors to consider before adding a stock to your portfolio, including volume, base structure and base stage. It's important to make note of base stages, because later-stage bases carry greater risk.Alphabet, Alibaba and STMicroelectronics all boast Composite Ratings above 95. The Composite Rating, which runs from 1 to a best-possible 99, combines proprietary ratings on earnings and several other key metrics. All-star winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their runs.Visa isn't far behind with a 93 Composite Rating. Electronic Arts has an 88 Composite Rating.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoogle parent Alphabet is working on a base with a 1,198.10 buy point, and shares are currently trading about 5% below the entry point. While Alphabet's base isn't technically a late-stage one, the stock has surged 95% since an early-stage breakout in 2015. Alphabet could potentially form a handle, with an earlier entry at 1,178.26, but a handle has not yet finished forming.Alphabet shares fell 2.2% soon after the open on the stock market today, undercutting its 50-day line as Facebook (FB) pressured techs early.Chinese internet giant Alibaba is trading 3% below a 206.30 buy point from a consolidation base, with shares getting a boost in heavy volume Thursday on reports that Alibaba is considering a dual listing in China. Alibaba's base is a third-stage base, which is a later-stage base. Breakouts from first- and second-stage bases are more optimal.Alibaba retreated 2.1% early Monday.Visa is working on a second-stage base, and shares are less than 1% below the cup-with-handle buy point of 125.40. If and when Visa shares break out, look for heavy volume as that indicates institutional support.Visa fell 0.4% Monday morning.Visa is one of several payment-related stocks, including Mastercard (MA), Square (SQ), PayPal (PYPL) and PagSeguro (PAGS), that are performing well.Chipmaker STMicroelectronics is trading 3.5% below a 25.40 buy point from a cup base. STMicro lost 0.7% Monday morning.An earlier entry could present itself if a proper handle forms, but one hasn't yet. STMicroelectronics' base is in the first stage, meaning it has greater potential to succeed.Electronic Arts is forming a first-stage base as well in a base-on-base pattern. Electronic Arts shares tried to clear a 131.11 buy point intraday Friday, but hit resistance at that level and turned tail, closing down 0.5% at 128.52.EA slid 1.3% early Monday.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 5 Stocks Have Dipped Below Buy Points, But Don't Give Up On ThemFacebook Dives As Data Debacle Highlights 'Systemic' RisksQ1 Earnings: Who Joins Netflix, Twitter On List Of Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth?New To Looking At Base Patterns?

143,PYPL,"The best growth stock mutual funds rewarded investors with returns between 26% and 46% in 2017, handsomely beating the S&P 500's advance of 21.83%. This strong performance partly explains why 113 funds landed an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Award in the growth category vs. just nine the prior year.By comparison, no value stock funds made the winners' list this year, and the number of award-winning blend funds that have both growth and value components got cut in half to just 11.One year's outperformance is not all that's needed to win a Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds need at least $100 million in assets and must beat their benchmark for the past one, three, five and 10 years ended December 2017, showing they can do well as stock market trends and conditions evolve over the long haul.So, what exactly contributed to these results and what's in store for the rest of 2018?Among the top five award winning growth funds, Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) tops the list with one- and 10-year average returns of 33.59% and 15.06%, respectively. The S&P 500 returned an average annual 8.5% in the past 10 years. The $11 billion fund invests in stocks across all sectors and market caps, targeting companies with prospects of rapid earnings growth that may not be reflected in their stock prices.At the end of 2017, the fund held 22% in small and micro caps — a significant overweight vs. the index's 1%. It also had major overweights in health care and technology — both sectors that were strong performers. Managers are not afraid to make strong sector or stock bets if they see solid long-term potential.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTop 10 holdings represent 33% of assets and include Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), Sony (SNE), Abiomed (ABMD), BlackBerry (BB) and Micron Technology (MU), which rallied between 52% and 386% last year.T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) came in second, with returns of 31.49% for one year and an average annual 13.16% for 10 years. Midcaps and small caps comprise 69% and 25% of the $23 billion fund. Manager Henry Ellenbogen seeks out small companies that can become much larger. This usually includes disrupters and companies that promise durable growth.""Market leadership is likely to narrow as the bull market ages. As always, unforeseen risks, such as geopolitical turmoil, also pose challenges,"" Ellenbogen said in an email. ""Global macroeconomic events, including commodity price volatility, could affect performance."" He also pointed out that a regulatory attack on leading technology and internet companies is possible, which could have unintended consequences and heighten inflationary concerns.""As such, we will closely monitor global economic and political conditions and be cautious around new bouts of risk taking,"" Ellenbogen added. ""Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to find and hold smaller companies that can compound wealth by becoming durable and sustainable businesses, even through the downturns and valuation adjustments that are part of every market cycle.""American Century Select (TWCIX) surged 28.93% last year and an average annual 8.62% for the past 10 years. Veteran manager Keith Lee and his team run the $3 billion large-cap growth fund by selecting high-quality companies with strong growth prospects, while also limiting risk. As a result, the fund sports a turnover of just 19%.""We're looking for very long-term, durable franchises that have sustainable growth over long periods of time, and that allows us to really limit the amount of turnover we have,"" said co-portfolio manager Chris Krantz. Traits of such companies include strong management teams, strong competitive positions, good returns on capital and the ability to achieve a higher return on capital over time, he added.In addition, the fund is valuation-sensitive, so it looks to buy stocks that are reasonably priced. Top 10 holdings represent 43% of the fund and comprise leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Last year, the fund benefited from consumer staples companies that have ""stronger-growing franchises that weren't as impacted by consumer preferences,"" said Krantz.Beauty product maker Estee Lauder (EL) was a strong contributor with a 68% jump in share price. ""They have wonderful brands, a great management team and the ability to continue to grow. A lot of consumer staples companies are struggling to sustainably grow,"" Krantz said.Costco (COST), which rose 22% in 2017, ""is another company that while there are some concerns out there about online competition to Costco, Costco is a value proposition to the consumer, because the prices they offer is a competitive advantage that we think will be enduring. They provide value to the consumer that you just can't find anywhere else,"" explained Krantz.With consumers spending more money online, global electronic payment firms such as Mastercard and PayPal (PYPL) have a ""great business model that has high margins, high returns on capital and as consumers change their shopping preferences, whether by channel or by category, they're still spending with the same means. That's a secular growth area,"" he said.Blend funds are part of the mutual fund style box and combine growth and value investing. This year's cream-of-the-crop blend funds include Carillon Scout Mid Cap I (UMBMX), sporting a one-year return of 24.02% and a 10-year average annual return of 11.13%, and Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) with 25.96% and 10.3%, respectively.T. Rowe Price's Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX) and Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) rose 24% last year and an average annual 9% the past 10 years.Manager Ann Holcomb says that both funds follow the exact same strategy through a team-managed style where each research analyst is responsible for making the buy and sell decision within their own area of expertise. About 30 analysts are responsible for their own slice of the portfolio, overseen by three managers who oversee the big picture and make sure the portfolio is constrained in terms of the level of active risk.Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Last year, about two-thirds of the fund's outperformance came from stock selection, plus one-third from being underweight energy and telecom and overweight information technology.For 2018, Holcomb has ""cautious optimism for the rest of the year. Valuations are still pretty full, but fundamental underpinnings for earnings growth are still there. We have tax reform — it hasn't really made its way into earnings yet. We should still be the beneficiaries of further regulatory relief. Rates are still low, though rising. The consumer is healthy.

144,PYPL,"Investors preferred to continue investing in U.S. stocks and trimming their stakes in Bitcoin-related securities on Tuesday as the Nasdaq continued to stage one of its biggest month-to-date gains.X The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7% while the Nasdaq 100, capturing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose 0.8%.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), meanwhile, flashed a warning sign that a prolonged correction may be in the works. The popular fund dropped 2% to 1,653.90, sinking for a third straight session and giving back all of last Thursday's strong rebound. The fund is also losing more ground below its critical 50-day moving average.Bitcoin Investment Trust gave astute chart readers a pair of sell signals in December when it showed some clear signs of a climax run, one of the most important sell signals featured in IBD market columns. Bitcoin also slashed through its 10-day moving average, a good sell trigger for short-term traders.The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, is now at 169.49. The heavily traded ETF extended its overall gain since a Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016, to more than 57%. A follow-through is a vital market-turning signal that was noted by The Big Picture back then. Typical follow-through rallies occur on the fourth day or later after an initial rally attempt that follows a significant market correction.Meanwhile, some blue chips took a break as the Dow Jones industrial average finished practically at breakeven. At least seven of the 30 member stocks in the Dow Jones industrials fell 1 point or more, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) following its plan to take a $13.6 billion charge following the new tax code and repatriate billions in profits back into America immediately. The company also suffered a setback in court over a drug patent.The S&P 500 lifted 0.2%. Breadth was positive on both exchanges; on the Nasdaq, winners smashed losers by a nearly 4-3 margin. NYSE winners crushed losers by nearly 9-to-5.J&J slid 4% to 141.83 in heavy turnover, but the uptrend remains in place as the diversified medical products giant remains above its 50-day line. At its recent peak, the stock held a 14.9% profit since clearing a 129.10 buy point in a long base on base, a key pattern for those who want to buy the most bullish growth stocks.Apple (AAPL) edged slightly higher to 177.04 and trades just a few points off its all-time peak of 180.10. At that peak, the largest company in the U.S. exchanges by market cap ($900 billion) has run 52% since the pivotal breakout from a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Apple is also up nearly 10% from its latest true base, a second-stage cup with handle that provided a 160.97 entry. The base formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. Volume on the Oct. 27 breakout came in strong, 64% above the 50-day average. It later tried to break out from a flat base at 176.34 but has not climbed much from that entry.While the iPhone and digital services titan has sort of set the standard over the past 12 months on how a giant company can turn things around and rally nicely from key breakouts points, the market's rally across techland means that IBD-style growth investors can possibly find other big cap names that could present even richer stock profit potential.Four names to consider include:Lam Research (LRCX), a play on semiconductor equipment, $34 billion market cap: The stock rallied nearly 3% to 215.05 and is crafting the right side of a new cup-style base since peaking at 219.70 on Nov. 21.Lam, which had been regularly featured in IBD Big Cap 20 throughout 2017, is expected to grow fiscal second-quarter earnings by a whopping 64% to $3.68 a share. In contrast, Apple's profit in the just-ended fiscal first quarter is expected to rise 13%.PayPal (PYPL), digital payments pioneer, $101 billion market cap: The stock floated 0.2% higher to 84.18, a fifth straight gain, and is now up 5.9% past the recent breakout from a good flat base at 79.48. Shares are thus a tad extended from the proper buy zone.Earnings are seen rising 24% to 52 cents in Q4, following year-over-year gains of 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31%.Salesforce.com (CRM), a business software innovator, $81 billion market cap: The Marc Benioff-led cloud-based enterprise software giant is nominally in buy range at 113.24, 3.6% above a 109.29 entry in a six-week flat base.Earnings in the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter are seen rising 18% to 33 cents a share following EPS increases of 26%, 14%, 47%, 17%, 38% and 62% in the prior six quarters. The average gain over the time span: up 34%.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis on growth stocks, charts and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneYou're Invested In Stocks And Equity ETFs; What To Do Now?

145,PYPL,"The L in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment system stands for Leader. In other words, it highlights a critical factor for choosing good stocks. Always ask yourself: Is the stock a leader or a laggard?X At times, the difference between these two is as stark as day and night.Other times, it can be difficult to distinguish between the two. Correctly pinning stocks as leaders — and not laggards — can mean the difference between a good year and a great year.To Google something was first popularized in the early 2000s, well before Google — now Alphabet (GOOGL) — was even public. ""Google"" was even added as a verb to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006 — meaning to perform an internet search via the Google search engine.The debut of Google in August 2004 and its breakout on Sept. 15-16 (1) past a 113.58 buy point (before splits) would lead to one of the first identifiable IPO bases. From there, the stock would appreciate 557% by November 2007.And today the stock is still pursuing new high ground.If the name of a company or one of its key products becomes part of the common vernacular, then it's definitely a company worth watching.Some of the best leading growth stocks in the stock market today have similar associations with their products and services.Netflix (NFLX) popularized ""binge-watching"" in 2013 when the video streamer started to bulk-release episodes of its original content. Since then, shares have surged, rising over 50% in 2017 alone. And they may not be finished yet.On Oct. 5 last year, the stock surged above a 190.05 cup-with-handle entry. On that day, Netflix announced subscription price increases.Analyst firm Bernstein commented that the company's ability to raise prices while growing its membership indicates substantial pricing power.After the close on Oct. 16 last year, Netflix announced mixed Q3 results. Shares fell almost 2%, but they held above the correct buy point.On Monday, Netflix roasted analysts' views on net subscriber growth in the fourth quarter as earnings leapt 173% to 41 cents a share on a 33% pickup in revenue to $3.29 billion.Net margin improved dramatically, rising 290 basis points to 5.6%, the highest in three quarters.Netflix shares now trade 37% above that 190.05 proper entry point.As seen in IBD's stock research tables, the Leisure sector remains a leader, ranked No. 8 among 33 sectors as of Wednesday.Amazon.com (AMZN) has the ""Amazon effect"" — the ongoing disruption and radical transformation of the e-commerce industry. Amazon has its fingers in cloud services, video streaming, and even grocery stores, thanks to the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Next, the company could be heading into health care with the acquisition of a prescription-benefit management company.The longtime Leaderboard member is now extended after rallying past its latest buy point at 1,213.51 in early January.Earlier, Amazon had broken out with a lovely gap-up in price on Oct. 27 near 1,083. The stock spent much of its time forming a 13-week base underneath the 50-day moving average. But the overall decline from the base's 1,083.31 peak was a supermild 14%.PayPal (PYPL) laid the foundation for the current phrase ""I'll Venmo you"" — meaning ""send money electronically."" Venmo is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases.In October of last year, PayPal shares reached the 20%-25% profit-taking level from a 55.24 flat-base entry, allowing investors to lock in some gains before the earnings results. Yet those with strong conviction in the stock could have decided to hold as PayPal cooled off in November, forming a new base in the process.Notice on a weekly chart how PayPal held firm during sell-offs to the 10-week moving average.On Jan. 9 of this year, PayPal broke out again, this time moving past a 79.48 buy point in a six-week flat base.The mobile payment leader will report its Q4 earnings after the close on Jan. 31.PayPal had cleared an earlier buy point in a much-longer flat-base pattern at 44.62 in late April 2017.Facebook (FB) has its ""Like"" button, with its iconic thumbs-up symbol. In the third quarter, year-over-year earnings and sales growth increased 77% and 47%, respectively. Apparently, the Law of Large Numbers — as a company grows rapidly, it cannot maintain that growth pace indefinitely — doesn't apply to the social media giant just yet. Over the past four years, revenue has grown about 50% year after year.The stock has continued its choppy advance, rising past a flat-base buy point at 175.59 in a breakout on Oct. 17. The buy point can be found by adding a dime to the high on July 27.

It's expected to report on Apr. 24 and is currently approximately 11% shy of an 86.42 entry. The pattern is a third-stage consolidation, which is less likely than an earlier-stage base to generate a big new run.

148,PYPL,"Keeping losses as small as possible is a key tenet of swing trading or any type of stock trading. A recent stock trade in PayPal (PYPL) shows a simple trick to keep those losses small.Payment processing giant PayPal was a recent swing trade that didn't work out. Still, there is something to learn in losses as well as profits. In this case, scaling out of PayPal in two separate sells reduced the damage.IBD's SwingTrader put the stock on as a current trade March 14 as it broke out in volume well above average (1). The relative strength line also got to new high ground before the price (1). PayPal could have easily produced a 5% return by getting to its previous high. With an early base count and the stock's proven ability to make a strong move, it had the potential to return even more.That didn't come to pass on this stock trade. The next day saw early strength fade into a bearish reversal day (2). Though volume was lower than the breakout, it was an early indicator that the trade was in danger of failing. SwingTrader removed half the position at the time out of caution.IBD'S TAKE: SwingTrader is beating the S&P 500 by more than 300% over the past six months. It was also completely in cash when the market started correcting in February. Take a free trial today. 
"
149,PYPL,"In this case, the remaining shares exited two days later when PayPal gapped down at the trading session's open (3).  Market weakness was a contributing factor to the gap down as IBD switched its market outlook to under pressure that day. The early warning reduced the damage and the stock fell another 5% from our average exit price over the next few days.Before entering a trade, you should already have your exit planned, the line in the sand that will trigger you into action. With breakouts and reversals, that line in the sand will usually be the low of your entry day. For PayPal, the low on the entry day was 80.64. If the stock can't stay above that level, it usually means you've made a mistake in your analysis. Sure, they can recover and you may kick yourself for not having faith. However, further weakness happens often enough to be cautious. At the very least, the stock probably needs more time.It's important to remember that not every swing trade will be favorable. And that's OK. Even being right half the time can be very profitable — as long as you keep the size of your losses small. When losses get too large they cause two problems. First, the losses detract from your winning positions. One large loss can wipe out a handful of your smaller profits or cancel out the effect of a big winner. Second, the large loss can leave you with less capital to work with on the next trade. That can include your psychological capital. Oversized losses can make you more hesitant to take advantage of future opportunities.Having a set price to watch for is a good first step. You also need the flexibility to recognize early warning signals that a swing trade may be heading south. Breaks below moving averages, bearish reversals, or just a lack of progress can all foreshadow problems ahead. It's a balancing act. Cut a loss too quickly and you might find a small wiggle causing you to miss out on a larger gain.Selling half the position is a suitable compromise when faced with early warning signs of trouble. If the weakness is temporary, you still participate in the move should the stock come roaring back. On the other hand, scaling out early reduces the loss if the weakness continues. Trade decisions don't have to be all or nothing. Breaking a swing trade into half positions on the way up or the way down can serve to maximize profits while minimizing losses. The early sell in PayPal was half the percentage loss of the final sell. It turned what would have been a 2.6% loss into a loss under 2%. The difference may seem small, but practiced over many trades those differences can make a big impact.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionKeeping Losses Small Is Critical To Portfolio ProgressSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

166,PYPL,"Shares in technology companies fell sharply Wednesday with so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — among the hardest hit as investors rotated into banks and value-stocks, one market strategist said.The Nasdaq dropped 1.4% to close at 6,824.39. The Dow rose 0.4% to 23,940.68. Telecom and financial stocks rallied amid the tech sell-off.Among the FANGs, Facebook lost 4% to 175.13 on the stock market today, and Amazon was off 2.7% to finish at 1,161.27. Netflix plunged 5.5% to 188.15. Alphabet retreated by 2.4% to 1037.38.The last rotation out of big-cap internet stocks occurred after President Trump's surprise election in 2016. But FANG stocks and other techs bounced back in 2017, accounting for most of the Nasdaq's gains.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, says the breakout by banks is significant.""One day does not make a trend but we are seeing signs of a rotation,"" Belski said. ""Does (the tech sell-off) mean that value investing strategies are beginning to become more prevalent — banks and financials being the biggest part of the value index — I think the answer to that is yes.""""The money has to come from somewhere. So it doesn't surprise us that the FANG/technology companies are across-the-board being used to fund this move into banks. Does that mean the tech boom is over? Absolutely not. It just seems natural, healthy that a reallocation of portfolio money is occurring.""Wednesday's sell-off in tech came even as Republicans moved closer to passing tax-reform legislation. One expectation is that companies such as Apple and Alphabet will get a boost on lower taxes for cash brought back into the U.S. from overseas. A sell-off in Chinese tech stocks, meanwhile, has gained momentum amid investor worries that its communist government is backtracking on some economic policies. Alibaba Group (BABA) tumbled 5.9% to 175.60, Baidu (BIDU) dropped 3.5% to finish at 235.49, and Tencent (TCEHY) gave back 4% to 52.Among U.S. tech stocks, Apple (AAPL) dropped 2.1% to 169.48, Tesla (TSLA) fell 3.2% to 307.54, and Nvidia (NVDA) plunged 6.8% to finish at 196.42.Chip companies and makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment also sold off.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Ichor Holdings (ICHR) fell 7.7% to 28.01, while Applied Materials (AMAT) also fell 7.7%, going to 52.91.

It hit 86.97 intraday, a new all-time high and briefly topping an 86.42 buy point.PayPal's relative strength line, which compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500, hit an all-time high. That offers bullish confirmation PayPal's breakout attempt.PayPal previously cleared a flattish double-bottom-base entry of 84.09 last month, but the move came in light volume, which is not a great sign.Wednesday's rally also appears to be on below-average trade.Analysts said Wednesday that PayPal is gaining scale against rivals such as Square (SQ) thanks to recent acquisitions. PayPal on Tuesday said it would buy Hyperwallet Systems for $400 million. In May, PayPal agreed to buy iZettle, a European mobile-payment rival to Square and others, for $2.2 billion.A key to PayPal stock's ongoing success is its stellar fundamentals.

183,PYPL,"A bit of jockeying for position occurred among the top-performing funds the past month, as the stock market recovered from a turbulent February.X First Trust Dorsey Wright Dynamic Focus 5 (FVC) moved up three spots to take the lead, with year-to-date gain of 9.4% through March 7. The $443.4 million fund provides exposure to five First Trust sector and industry-based ETFs and the Nasdaq US T-Bill Index.Sharing the No. 1 spot is sibling First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 (FV), which has amassed $2.7 billion in assets. The ETF comprises five First Trust sector and industry-based ETFs that Dorsey, Wright & Associates thinks could outperform others in the selection universe. It was ranked third last month.PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) hopped up three notches to the No. 3 spot, with an 8.5% YTD gain, according to Morningstar Direct. The tech-heavy index tracking fund, with $63 billion in assets, was also the best performing of the 10 biggest ETFs. The QQQs held a five-session win streak as of Thursday as the underlying index leads this year.Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist for BlackRock, expects tech stocks to keep outperforming.""Extraordinarily strong earnings momentum, corporate tax cuts and fiscal stimulus underpin our positive view,"" he wrote in a recent report. ""We like the momentum and value style factors, as well as financials and technology.""Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportMoving on to sector funds, biotechs fell out of the top three. ARK Innovation (ARKK), which counts Tesla (TSLA) and Twitter (TWTR) among its top holdings, scored a 17.6% YTD gain. The $700.5 million fund invests in companies that rely on or benefit from advancements in three key areas: genomic revolution, web x.0 and industrial innovation.ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector (ARKG), last month's No. 1 sector fund, came in second with a 17.2% return.

184,PYPL,"What accounts for USAA Aggressive Growth Fund's (USAUX) tidy gain so far this year? In terms of holdings, the credit goes to Amazon (AMZN), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Booking Holdings (BKNG) (formerly Priceline).X They're among the fund's best performing stocks this year, and have helped propel it to a 6.17% gain going into Thursday vs. 6.09% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar and 2.35% for the S&P 500.But those stocks might not have had meaningful positions in the portfolio were it not for new fund managers John Jares and Craig Behnke, who took the reins of the fund in August last year.For the board of the USAA Aggressive Growth Fund, 2016 was the straw that broke the camel's back.After years of consistently trailing its benchmark — the Russell 1000 Growth Index — in 2016 the fund posted a return of 0.72%. That year the Russell 1000 Growth rose 7.08% and the S&P 500 Index gained 11.96%. The fund's parent company knew drastic action needed to be taken. It fired the subadvisors managing the fund, Winslow Capital and Wellington Capital, and gave it to two in-house portfolio managers, John Jares and Craig Behnke, in August 2017.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersSince then, the managers have looked at each of the 125 stocks in the fund and done their own fundamental research. They've sold many stocks, narrowing the fund down to a smaller, lighter, more concentrated portfolio of 80 stocks with the goal of hitting around 70.""I don't know what was going on before, but by virtue of having two subadvisors, it was over diversified, and had little chance of outperforming,"" said Jares. ""We want to differentiate ourselves based on security selection, keep the beta in line with the benchmark, and add alpha through stock selection. We're nearly done with the process. We have 15 names to go.""The fund kept the top five holdings: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), which is the parent of Google, Visa (V) and Amazon. It also kept Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL). Among the names sold were Alibaba (BABA), Expedia (EXPE), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Amdocs (DOX), Teradyne (TER) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).They're not just selling. They've also been adding new stocks and boosting the concentrations of the ones they like. When they took over the fund, 15 stocks made up 30% of the portfolio. Jares said by the time he's done, 15 stocks will make up about 40% of total assets.""It's a tale of two different time periods,"" said Behnke. ""From Sept. 1, 2017, to Dec. 31, 2017, when we were in the process of turning over a lot of the portfolio, our performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth trailed by 200 basis points."" Even so, the fund ended 2017 up 30.05% vs. the Russell's 30.21% and the S&P's 21.83%.Now that the fund is closer to the managers' ideal portfolio, from Jan. 1 through March 4, it beat its benchmark by 105 basis points.Jares said the fund has performed well because of its holdings in technology and the consumer discretionary sector. Despite this, the managers have reduced the fund's technology weighting to 40% from 46%. And they increased the consumer discretionary weighting to 16.2% from 13.1%. Overall, they've broadened the fund's sector exposures by diversifying the number of sectors, while concentrating the number of stocks.Among the new stocks, they like Vulcan Materials (VMC)) so much that it became a top 10 holding. Based in Birmingham, Ala., the company supplies crushed stone, known as aggregates, along with concrete and asphalt to make roads and bridges.""Those aggregates have seen nice pricing power,"" said Jares. ""And in an improving economy where you may have infrastructure programs coming down the pike, their volume outlook is excellent.""The company has grown earnings at a 48% annual clip the past three years, but the stock is 14% off its 52-week high and trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bearish sign.Edwards Lifesciences (EW), which makes catheters to treat heart disease, has grown earnings at an annual pace of 29% in the past three years.""The original estimates of that market were $3 billion over the next three to five years,"" said Behnke. ""But with lower death rates and lower complications compared to surgery, those numbers are so strong that the total addressable market increased and the current estimate is $5 billion. Through our research and our industry contacts, over the next 12-24 months estimates for that market could push to the $6 billion-$8 billion range by 2025.""Jares also likes HP (HPQ), which he expects to become a growth company again. Best known for making computer printers, HP, Jares notes, is launching a new line of copiers. As 3-D printing kicks in, the company will become a leader again, he says. Jares says he expects HP will see growth return in the mid-single-digit range.The fund charges a below average expense ratio of 0.81%.RELATED:Look At What Hot Stocks Are Driving This Market-Beating Mutual FundDow Retakes 50-Day As Apple Pegs New Closing High; Bitcoin Dives

185,PYPL,"The Nasdaq composite is trading near session highs in late-afternoon trading Friday with a nearly 0.5% gain. The leading index in 2017, up 28.2% that year, looks poised to stage a third up week in a row. At 7316, the tech-centered index is up nearly 0.8% for the week.XThe Nasdaq rallied 3.4% and 1.7% in the first two trading weeks of 2018 in what is shaping up to be one of the strongest starts in recent years.Digital payments firms continue to lead the market upside. PayPal (PYPL), a member of the IBD 50, added another 0.8% to 83.63 in below-average trade and is now mildly extended past a 79.48 buy point in a third-stage flat base.PayPal had first broken out of a long saucer-like pattern around 44 in April 2017, rallied more than 37%, then built a narrow five-week flat base that produced a 55.24 entry. PayPal broke out of that second-stage base on July 10 and rallied nearly 44% before correcting quickly in price for two weeks in late November to early December.Great stocks have the ability to keep running higher even after forming two, three or even four bases. But such market leaders are rare, as noted in this column in IBD's Investor's Corner, a longtime feature dedicated to helping readers how to buy and sell stocks more profitably.Meanwhile, Google site operator Alphabet (GOOGL) has gotten off to a roaring start, at least among megacap names, in 2018. Shares are down slightly, yet the stock has now advanced 7.7% since Jan. 1.Apple (AAPL)  is up 5.5% since Jan. 1. The iPhone giant, though, has had a masterful run since breaking out of a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12 back on Jan. 6, 2017.More recently, Apple cleared a 106.97 entry in an eight-week cup with handle Oct. 27, just ahead of reporting robust quarterly results.Nevertheless, both stocks are acting in healthy fashion following recent breakouts. Alphabet has rolled nearly 13% since it cleared a 1,006.29 entry in a 10-week flat base on Oct. 11.At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 rose 0.3% on the back of gains in meat, tobacco, truck, electronic parts, shoe retail, specialty retail and lodging shares. Breadth is positive on both exchanges. Winning issues are exceeding losers by a more than 2-1 margin on the Nasdaq and roughly 9-5 on the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average reversed from small losses to edge slightly higher. But IBM (IBM) is weighing on the Dow, sliding more than 7 points or 4% to 161.56 following a big gap up Wednesday. IBM, which has been struggling for years to post meaningful gains in the top line, is still in the early stages of building the right side of a bottoming base.An additional four of the 30 components in the Dow industrials, including American Express (AXP) and Visa (V), are down 1 point or more. Amex dropped more than 3% to 96.75 and is undercutting the key 50-day moving average in whale-like volume. It's the first time Amex has probed the medium-term support level since early September.The financial services powerhouse reported a net loss of $1.41 a share on a 12% revenue increase to $9.42 billion.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) backed off 57.93 to 1,799 in very light volume. The closed end fund that tracks the popular alternative digital currency is trying to hold above its fast-rising 50-day moving average.While a pullback to the 50-day line and subsequent rebound can serve as a legitimate follow-on entry, keep in mind that the fund has already made a tremendous price run following a Nov. 22 breakout past 985.10 in a very deep cup with handle. The gain from that buy point reached as much as 257%.In addition, climax-run-style action also makes it more likely that Bitcoin Investment may need more time to shape another potential good base and supply a better entry point.One major differentiator between Alphabet and Apple for investors is the fact that for years, the former has been investing in self-driving technology that in the future could become standard in all vehicles. Some observers believe that its software development may eventually become a significant new revenue driver.For now, digital ads remain Alphabet's bread and butter. In the past six quarters, revenue has climbed 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21% and 24% vs. year-ago levels. That fantastic growth has boosted earnings as well, up 42%, 27%, 7%, 28%, 27% and 32% vs. year-ago levels over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings jumping 32% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $10 a share, which would be a quarterly high. Alphabet has 694 million shares outstanding across all share classes and a float of 295 million. Revenue is seen rising 22% to $31.85 billion.Alphabet is slated to report Q4 results Feb. 1 after the close. The stock earns a top-notch 99 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup, as well as an A for SMR Rating that tracks sales growth, profit margins, and return on equity.Apple continues to be on a solid growth track as well. The Street sees earnings in the December-ended fiscal first quarter rising 13% to $3.78 a share, then accelerating to a 38% gain to $2.90 in the March-ending second quarter, on revenue gains of 10% and 29%.Elsewhere, the Dow utility average flipped 0.3% lower amid another sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond up to 2.64%, eclipsing the March 2017 high of 2.62%.WTI crude oil prices fell 0.9% to $63.36 a barrel but are still up 5% since Jan. 1.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on growth stocks, charts and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Latest In Investor's CornerWhere Is The Stock Market Headed In 2018?

186,PYPL,"The 2018 stock market has not been for the faint of heart, having already notched all-time highs and the biggest correction in two years. But some stock mutual funds have found ways to both post gains and surpass major indexes, often with investment strategies that include such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Adobe (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX) and Salesforce.com (CRM).X For the year through March 8, Fidelity Investments' Will Danoff and John Roth have deftly ridden such stocks to a nice 6.48% gain in the fund they manage: $28.5 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX). That compares with the S&P 500's 2.84%. The legendary Danoff is best known for managing the $129.6 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) since 1990, and with which he's outperformed every other stock fund with $100 billion or more in assets in the past 15 years.Many of their top holdings are riding a megatrend — people spending more time on the internet — that they see driving earnings growth and price appreciation for years to come.A key to the winning investment strategies they've used since New Insights' inception in 2003 is change. ""We always look for change,"" Danoff told IBD, ""and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition.""While New Insights is solidly in the large-cap growth camp, Roth brings in expertise in midcap stocks and a slight value tilt, which adds a level of flexibility to the managers' investment process as they navigate 2018 stock market trends.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportIn a wide-ranging Q&A, Danoff and Roth share how their flexible investment strategies allow them to uncover opportunities even as the bull market ages and many growth stocks get pricey. They also discuss their major holdings, including why they're bullish on Amazon, Netflix and Adobe.IBD: What is the strategy of your fund?Will Danoff: Fidelity Advisor New Insights is a capital appreciation fund with a growth bias. Both John and I believe that stocks over time follow the underlying earnings per share of the companies. I've joked in the past: You get two fund managers for the price of one. We created a sleeve structure two years ago: Will is running 60% of the fund, John is running 40% of the fund. John has a more value orientation, I have a more growth orientation.IBD: What is the main trend in the market today and how are you integrating it in the fund?Danoff: I'm looking for the best stocks in the market and companies that have a sustainable competitive advantage but are growing in this environment, gaining market share, are able to leverage technology and find certain trends like Cloud or SaaS (Software as a Service) or just more and more people and more and more companies spending more time on the internet. That's probably the megatrend that we're all living in.John Roth: I've spent half my time at Fidelity as a value-ish analyst and half as a growth analyst. I prefer to buy growth stocks — I think they're more fun, more interesting. But I think you can also make money in turnarounds and other things that the market has left by the wayside.Nine years into a bull market, I think there's some valuation concerns on the growth side, so that's taken some of my growth money out, but I still have a growth bias. I think the key is to be versatile and really take advantage of the opportunities the market gives you.Danoff: We're flexible and we'll go anywhere, so I really think that helps the fund. There aren't many constraints on what we can do. And John has been really good at anticipating which out-of-favor groups might come back into favor. And by looking for out-of-favor groups, that forces you to look at your existing names and say ""Wow, maybe all the good news has been discounted here.""IBD'S TAKE: As an individual investor, you want to stay in sync with the market. Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.IBD: Speaking of which, could you give a few examples of trades in the past 12 months?Danoff: We were up 28% last year and tech helped a lot. Amazon was a nice overweight, Activision Blizzard (ATVI), PayPal (PYPL), Facebook (FB), Adobe — these were larger technology companies that grew very nicely.We always look for change and change is an opportunity: when there's a new management team, a new product, a spinout or a big acquisition. When something's happening, Fidelity can hopefully move quickly.Last year was about avoiding some of the defensive names, General Electric (GE) obviously struggled with their earnings. ... We were underweight in a big way.IBD: Your fund profile talks about companies that are undervalued by the public. But obviously the public is focusing on the big tech names, so how are they undervalued or what is the additional value that you're seeing in them?Danoff: John and I are looking for misperceptions by the public. If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook messenger (and) video. ... We're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer. I think I am more bullish on Facebook than the consensus and I own a lot of it.Roth: A lot of times these big names are right in front of you and it doesn't mean they're not going to be great stocks. Apple (AAPL) has been the poster child. Back in 2007, people got excited about the potential for the company to have $6 billion in revenue, and no one thought they'd go to $250 billion. And it unfolded slowly over the years right in front of you.IBD: What are your thoughts on the fact that we're late in the economic cycle and valuations are high?Danoff: Yes, we've had a long run since the bottom of the spring of 2009, earnings have more than doubled, stocks have more than tripled. The crisis of 2008-2009 I think was felt more deeply than people realize. … (The economic impact) was quite drastic.There was this massive footrace to put on the brakes — cutting costs, cutting capital spending. Sort of the whole world froze. I think Apple and Google were two of the only companies I'm aware of that grew earnings in the first two quarters of 2009.My point is, the starting point was quite drastic. And so even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing the costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending.The other observation I have is the world is much more global and U.S. companies are now able to sell their products all over the world. The big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive; they're high margin, they're high growth and they're highly cash generative. Yes, I think the market is expensive, but the market is not what it used to be. The quality of the companies is higher and estimates are going up.IBD: Would you look more outside of the U.S. to find good stocks?Roth: Our philosophy is turn over as many rocks as you can. The more you turn over, the higher the probability to find something good. If we find that the U.S. has less opportunities, then maybe we'll look harder in Europe. Europe has been slow to recover and there are some interesting names there. And the same would be true in Asia. You might see more names in the fund because we're trying to find new ideas.Danoff: The global research effort helps us so much. The global economy is much more integrated. We can talk to Asian tech companies who are part of the supply chain, or Samsung, which is a supplier and a competitor to so many of the big tech companies, and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). It's hugely helpful to understand where we are in the cycle in that particular industry.The trends we're seeing overseas are often similar, sometimes ahead of the trends that we see in the U.S., sometimes behind. But in terms of the big global companies, often the Nestles (NSRGY) and Unilevers (UN) are more defensive, and right now defensive is out of favor. So we're trying to pay attention to out-of-favor, but right now these stocks are not leading the market. This is the tension and the balance we have to find.IBD: The market had a short correction recently. How do you react in this kind of environment?Roth: We went through a very long period of no volatility and to the extent we see more volatility in the future as the economy heats up and the Fed gets more aggressive, it just means that we have to tighten our game up and look for dislocations every day. We've had some really big swings in the market where you could open up and then all of a sudden be down a fair amount, and so on an individual stock basis we're looking for bargains on the names that we really like. We do have some cash in the fund and we can be opportunistic. So a little bit of volatility is not a bad thing at all.IBD: Do you sell anything in those times?Danoff: You have to stay flexible and when fundamentals change, we all have stories when a top 10 position discloses some bad news and the stock is down and you start saying, ""Oh my God, one of my big positions is under pressure."" If there's competition from Amazon, or there's regulatory changes, or there's unexpected margin pressure, you can't stand still in this business.When the whole market sells off, John and I are looking for higher-quality companies that we can upgrade to.IBD: Considering the current increasing inflationary pressures, do you see any sector rotation or areas that may pop up that would be more advantageous for investors in 2018?Roth: We are seeing wage inflation. Everyone from Walmart (WMT) to most big companies have started to pay their employees more. These bonuses that are coming as a result of the tax cut will have the same effect.Who benefits? It's probably the financials to some extent, probably the energy companies, materials, gold. We have exposure to all of that, and we can easily shift if it looks like it's going to become more prevalent.IBD: What is your outlook for some of the big names in your fund?Danoff: Good news is good news. In an expansionary environment, Netflix is crushing it overseas. They're adding 5 million subs overseas a quarter and a couple million subs in the U.S. They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding, it's a subscription model offering great value for roughly $10-$11 a month. The average subscriber is spending 10 hours a week watching their content. Margins are going up and I am quite positive.Adobe has made a shift from licensed to Software-as-a-Service to the recurring revenue model. More and more people are spending more and more time on the web, so companies and individuals purchase Adobe software more frequently. Revenues are growing more than 20%, margins are going up and the company is generating a huge amount of free cash flow, so the outlook is very bright for Adobe. Could it sell off because it's expensive? Yes, both Adobe and Netflix could see multiples compression near-term, but I think over time both companies are very well positioned to grow, looking out three to five years.Amazon — wouldn't you want to partner with the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos? A week does not go by where somebody doesn't tell me, ""I love Amazon."" AWS, which is their cloud-computing business — they started before anybody else realized that could be a business — it's now I think an $18 billion business, growing roughly 40% a year; it's nicely profitable. In e-commerce, he's pushing hard into India, into food, in apparel — he's gaining market share. He's got a long way to go. Maybe I'd like him to show a little more profit because I think stocks follow earnings over time, but I'm confident that everything Amazon is investing in is ultimately going to generate a very strong return, and if that's the case, then profits will come over time.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners401(k) Experts Warn When NOT To Use A Target Date Fund2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltThe New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles And Ciscos?

196,PYPL,"When PayPal (PYPL) split from online auction site eBay (EBAY) in 2015, Wall Street wondered whether the digital-payments provider would truly find its place in the world of ushering money between people online.XCould it stand up to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), they wondered. Would it be able to justify its existence alongside Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google? Could it compete with basically any of the large banks, who had plenty of reasons to offer payment services themselves?Rather than go to war, PayPal has reached truces, of sorts, with those and other companies since the spin-off from eBay. The strategy has sent its stock on a marathon run higher. It's also extended the company's reach online, into the muscle memory of smartphone users, and into any moment where someone might think to pay for something. It has also given PayPal a foothold in actual, physical stores, which still make up the vast majority of retail.Today, PayPal users can draw on a Mastercard or Visa card or their bank account to pay for something via their phone in such retail locations. In May, PayPal said users would be able to pay for stuff on Gmail, YouTube and other locations in the Google ecosphere. PayPal last year struck a deal with Facebook that allowed someone to send money via Facebook Messenger.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""That's really helped them become much more of a partner, obviously, than a competitor with a lot of these companies,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""I think that's helped ease Wall Street's concerns about whether a big tech company would just leapfrog them or make their technology obsolete.""The company also counts Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as partners, and is trying to attract more people without bank accounts. In moves abroad, the company last year struck a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) to let Baidu Wallet holders buy things from PayPal merchants.In May, it announced the $2.2 billion purchase of iZettle, a Stockholm-based company sometimes called the Square (SQ) of Europe. The deal is likely to put PayPal's technology into retail outlets across that continent as well as Latin America.How sustainable these partnerships are over the long term remains an open question. Competition from Square, best known for the card readers often used by small businesses, is nothing to sneeze at. PayPal's margins have been under pressure as it chases bigger customers, Olson says. EBay's decision this year to eventually handle more payments on its own — rather than PayPal — is a big deal.But for now, analysts suggest that more freedom from eBay has allowed PayPal to come into its own. The collaboration-over-competition approach, along with the growing ease and popularity of online payments, has sent its stock up 126% since the company's 2015 spinoff. Over the past year alone, the stock is up nearly 60% and maintains an IBD Composite Rating of 96. Shares were down fractionally to 85.31 Friday.Even as competition escalates, the company in May said it was targeting around a 20% compound annual earnings per share growth rate over the next three to five years. Over that time, it also forecasts expanding adjusted operating margins and 17%-18% compound annual sales growth, when factoring foreign exchange fluctuations.In years past, the firm tried to encourage customers to link their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts. The practice helped the company avoid paying fees to the credit card networks, making those companies dyspeptic. Visa's chief executive in 2016 warned that the card network could try to compete with the payments company ""in ways that people have never seen before.""PayPal eventually backed off, agreeing later that year to partner with Visa. The agreement expanded the ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled,"" according to a statement announcing the deal.The deal also allowed customers to instantly move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via a Visa debit card, that statement said. Shortly after, PayPal and Mastercard announced a similar pact that expanded an existing partnership.""It just made it a lot easier for individual consumers to sign up for PayPal,"" William Blair analyst Bob Napoli said of its increased flexibility.The company's active customer accounts grew 15% last year. In the first quarter, reported in April, it added 8.1 million active accounts, with payment transactions up 25%. The company has 218 million active users in more than 200 markets. It processes around one in every six dollars spent online, according to Edward Jones.""Embracing the traditional payment ecosystem was a positive in many investors' eyes,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said.What's more, analysts say, the company's technology is good, and it works on lots of things with which you can make payments. Its One Touch technology allows customers to buy things online without entering their password and other information. The company rolled out its own cash-back credit card last summer. The company was testing a Venmo debit card, Recode reported earlier last year.As PayPal makes it easier to pay for things, businesses have taken notice. The company has some 19 million merchant accounts, most of them small to midsize businesses.""I think, (they) have signed up, and continue to sign up, more merchants post-spinoff from eBay that maybe wouldn't have been able to sign when they were part of eBay,"" Napoli said.Still, a big chunk of PayPal's financials hinge on eBay's auction activity. EBay acquired the company in 2002 to make it easier for eBay's buyers and sellers to pay or get paid online. Last year, PayPal drew around a fifth of its revenue from customers on eBay's Marketplaces platform.But in January, the online auction platform said it would begin managing payments on its own. It said that process will be a ""—multiyear journey."" EBay also said it would use Adyen, a Netherlands-based company, as its payments processor. PayPal's stock crashed on eBay's announcement. PayPal will remain a payment option on eBay until mid-2023.The payments company seems likely to compensate by reeling in bigger retailers elsewhere. But Olson notes that its pursuit of larger customers has weighed on margins. Those companies have more bargaining power to negotiate lower fees, he says.Analysts also debate whether it has the upper hand on Square, the payments company best known for its credit-card readers used by small businesses. Square also is stepping up efforts to compete with PayPal via acquisitions.On one hand, PayPal has a massive network of millions of users. The purchase of iZettle would unite PayPal's immense digital platform with iZettle's card readers and software tools for small businesses. But small businesses comprise the turf upon which Square has built much of its reputation.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) still has Apple Pay, although PayPal last year landed a deal to allow iTunes users to buy things with PayPal. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon (AMZN) was looking into developing something similar to a branded checking account. As long as tech and financial companies work in the payments business, friction could wear at PayPal's partnerships.""Long-term, it's harder to say,"" Sebastian said of how those partnerships will hold up. ""PayPal still has many elements of duplicating what a credit card offers.""So there's always the prospect, if PayPal were to potentially turn (to) a competitive angle vs. a partnership angle,"" he said. ""But I certainly don't foresee that in the near term or the medium term.""RELATED LINKS:Square, PayPal Lead These 5 Financial Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStock Spotlight List Adds 8 For Your Best Stocks To Buy And WatchSquare Rival Testing Buy Zone After Biggest Acquisition Since eBay Spinoff

203,PYPL,"Square (SQ), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), PayPal (PYPL) and Verisk Analytics (VRSK) held up nicely Tuesday even as financial stocks overall tumbled from Italy's political woes. Square, which tried to break out amid the selling Tuesday, moved back above the buy zone Wednesday, while Mastercard and Visa remain above entry points.Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) tumbled between 4% and 6% Tuesday each as investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys, pushing the rate on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.79%. The two-year yield skidded, but not as much, to 2.34%, squeezing the yield spread and banks' profitability on loans. (These Wall Street giants rose modestly Wednesday, with Treasury yields recouping some losses.)But financial stocks with less exposure to falling interest rates were relatively unscathed. Visa and Mastercard, for example, oversee vast payment networks but don't issue credit cards directly, unlike fellow Dow Jones components JPMorgan and American Express (AXP). That means they aren't exposed to lower rates or credit risk directly. Payments firms PayPal and Square also are largely insulated from interest rates, though Square does make some loans to small businesses. Verisk provides underwriting data analytics to the insurance industry.Here's how these five financial stocks, each of which is in a buy zone or near a buy point, are performing.

204,PYPL,"In the past 12 months, the Big Cap 20 and a ""buy high"" strategy could've made the individual investor some nice profits. A look at how success unfolded could help the next time around.Few stocks have done better than PayPal (PYPL) in price performance. A year ago, the Big Cap 20 stock was too extended to buy. Some individual investors might've wondered about that.If the stock is too high to buy, why should it appear in the Big Cap 20? The question points to two misunderstandings. First, the Big Cap 20 is more of a watch list than a buy list. Second, ""too high to buy"" suggests the IBD-style investor is looking for bargains. Not so.An IBD investor would rather buy a stock at a higher price that is likely to work than a lower price that is unlikely to work. While that sounds counterintuitive, it's a sound strategy.In PayPal's case, the stock was extended in late May 2017 when it appeared on the Big Cap 20. But a patient investor was able to act on a valid buy point in mid-July. The stock crossed above a 55.24 buy point in a second-stage flat base and rose 42% in 20 weeks.That's how the IBD-style investor likes to make money.Let's look at some additional Big Cap 20 success stories from the year-ago lineup.Hotel chain Marriott International (MAR) was extended. The stock began to consolidate in early June. By mid-September, it had sketched a double-bottom base with a 107.73 buy point. Marriott broke out Sept. 20 in heavy volume.From there, Marriott rose 38% in 19 weeks.Chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX) was extended. The stock began to consolidate in early June. Lam formed a cup-without-handle that went nowhere. A second side-by-side cup with handle led to a mid-September breakout. The stock cleared a 169.25 entry and advanced 29% in 11 weeks.Another chip-equipment maker, Applied Materials (AMAT), also consolidated in early June. The stock completed a cup-with-handle pattern over more than three months. Applied Materials broke out in mid-September. The stock rose 27% in 10 weeks.The two chip stocks succeeded despite being late-stage bases. Three factors may have helped the stocks overcome the odds.First, the chip sector was ranked No. 2 among 33 sectors. Second, the chip-equipment group was No. 18 among 197 groups. Third, the market was in the midst of a confirmed rally that would last 112 sessions.Nvidia (NVDA), a chip designer, was extended in May 2017. The stock broke out of a stage-two base in mid-September. Nvidia cleared a 174.66 entry.In nine weeks, Nvidia rose 25%.In each of these five cases, waiting to buy higher worked.RELATED:Morgan Stanley Raises Price Target On Apple StockBest Buy Gaps Down, Loses 50-Day Line16 Steps To Turn $15.26 Into $1 MillionMarketSmith: Four Weeks For $29.95

The retailer lifted profit and sales guidance for the year. Smaller rival Dillard's (DDS) topped, but J.C.

Nordstrom delivered surprise earnings growth and lifted the bottom end of EPS guidance, but quarterly sales matched views and comps fell short.The home-improvement retailer beat first-quarter earnings estimates, but revenue and same-store sales came up short, as a cold spring season kept people from buying gardening and other outdoor supplies. Home Depot first held to its full-year financial outlook, citing ""a favorable housing and macroeconomic backdrop."" Online sales jumped, and rising prices of lumber, copper and other materials bumped up sales. Credit Suisse analysts also expected a rebound for Home Depot in the second quarter, but said ""we expect that the near-term direction of the stock to be dictated by weather in the coming weeks.""Retail sales data for April showed that the consumer soft patch to start the year has given way to strength, likely helped by delayed tax refunds. April data only matched expectations, rising 0.3% on the month, with the matching rise in sales excluding autos coming in below expectations.

210,PYPL,"Rising interest rates aren't bothering Joseph Eberhardy, a manager of Wells Fargo Growth Fund (SGRAX), so maybe they should not scare you either. Instead, rising rates have whetted investors' appetites for quality growth stocks vs. defensive, dividend paying stocks in general, Eberhardy says.And history has taught Eberhardy and lead manager Tom Ognar that as long as the 10-year Treasury rate stays below 5%, leading growth stocks are safe. That bodes well in general for top holdings like Paycom Software (PAYC), Netflix (NFLX), Splunk (SPLK), Amazom.com (AMZN), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) that continue to drive the $4.7 billion portfolio's returns.""My gut says (the hindrance threshold for growth stocks) may be something less than 5% this time around, but we're not overly concerned with rates now around 3%,"" Eberhardy said.Going into Wednesday, those stocks were up this year 2% for PayPal to 60% for Netflix. Still, in the always-fluid mix of the market, the Eberhardy-Ognar team is hedging its bet on one of those leaders. (Lower in this story, we explain which one and why.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeanwhile, the overall strategy has paid off. So far this year the fund's 5.28% advance tops 88% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and outstrips the S&P 500's 0.9% setback. Over the past 12 months the fund is up 24.23% vs. 18.56% on average for its direct rivals and 13.17% for the broad market benchmark.Key trends trump rising rates for Eberhardy. Growth stocks that Eberhardy and Ognar like the most are those with a tailwind from key secular trends. One such trend is the migration toward software as a service (SaaS). An example is Paycom, a provider of cloud-based human capital management software.But the fund has made big trims in Paycom in recent disclosures. ""Valuation was the key component for our trimming Paycom, as we thought the gap between our expectations and the market's expectations narrowed significantly,"" Eberhardy said.Paycom is trading at roughly 10 times its calendar 2019 enterprise value to sales ratio. ServiceNow (NOW) is a SaaS stock that the fund likes more. ""We like NOW better,"" Eberhardy said. With its slightly lower valuation of calendar 2019 nine times EV to sales ratio, ""we see a little more opportunity for margin expansion with NOW as they accelerate new investments into areas like HR,"" he said.The rise of cloud computing and storage is another trend the fund plays. Splunk is a hybrid play in cloud computing and SaaS, Eberhardy says. This company's software helps customers crunch big data, ""whether it's real-time monitoring for cybersecruity or helping locomotive operators optimize their driving to cut fuel costs,"" he said.Amazon is a long-time top holding and the poster child for a company capitalizing on the growth of online retail. ""They are the dominant provider in that space, and we see that continuing going forward,"" Eberhardy said. ""They also fit the cloud computing trend through their web services side. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is roughly 10% of their revenues but 90% of their total operating income.""PayPal is a leader in the digital payments trend. ""The shift from paper to digital payments benefits them, Global Payments (GPN) and Square (SQ), Eberhardy said, citing two additional holdings. ""We still feel that there's a big opportunity for all of them. PayPal stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries.""A fifth trend the fund aims to exploit is the rise of the Internet of Things. Chipmaker Nvidia is one way to play that trend. ""Whether it's on the gaming side or in autonomous vehicles, Nvidia is the clear leader,"" Eberhardy said. ""Nvidia has been the dominant provider of chips in those two spaces. Their lead, their competitive moat, is relatively stable.""Of course no stock or sector rises forever, Eberhardy cautions. ""There's still lots of opportunities in those five areas,"" he said, referring to the five trends. ""But some areas in particular, like SaaS in the last few months, have been trading toward the high end of their historical valuation ranges. That's something to watch. The other four are more fairly valued. To a lesser extent, cloud computing is closer to its higher end than its lower end.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Want Tax-Free Retirement Income?

213,PYPL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose Friday morning after the Senate approved a budget resolution late Thursday, paving the way for up to $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years.XS&P 500 futures rose 0.2% vs. fair value, while Dow futures climbed 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.25%.It's unclear how much tax cuts are already priced into the stock market, which has rallied significantly since President Trump's election in large part on hopes for lower corporate tax rates and other reforms.Also, Trump and GOP lawmakers may have unrealistic expectations about the size of the tax cuts given the budget constraints. But the budget blueprint, passed by a 51-49 vote, is still a key step. It allows Republicans to push for deficit-financed tax cuts of up to $1.5 trillion without Democratic support, but they can afford only two defections.Before the budget vote, highly rated Celgene (CELG), PayPal (PYPL) and Atlassian (TEAM) were active in late trading on earnings and other news.Meanwhile in Thursday stock market trading, the S&P 500 index and Dow erased losses to close slightly higher, but the Nasdaq retreated as FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) drifted below recent breakout entry points.PayPal, Celgene, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and Atlassian all have Composite Ratings of 95 or better. The Composite Rating, which runs from 1 to 99, combines several proprietary IBD ratings into one number. All-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big runs.Facebook fell 0.8% to 174.56, closing off intraday lows for 172.64 but still ending below a 175.59 buy point cleared on Tuesday. Thursday's slide wasn't that impressive, but neither was the breakout, though Tuesday's upside move came on above-average volume.Alphabet dipped 1.1% to 1,001,84 on Thursday, below its 1,006.31 entry topped on Oct. 13. Again, the Google parent's retreat was rather modest, though it did come on volume that was 11% above trend.The problem with lackluster breakouts, which have been all too common in recent months, is that they suggest a lack of institutional support. And by creeping just over buy points and not advancing, stocks such as Facebook and Google are vulnerable to going underwater on modest market, industry or company-specific news.Then again, any piece of good news or market momentum could push these stocks back into buy zones.Facebook rose 0.4% to 175.22 in premarket trading Friday, while Alphabet was up 0.3% to 1,005.11.PayPal, 98 Composite Rating: PayPal reported a 31% earnings per share gain, with revenue up 21% to $3.24 billion, both better than expected. The online payments processor gave Q4 EPS and revenue guidance basically in line with analyst views. PayPal rose 3.9% in early trading. PayPal closed down 1 cent to 67.25 on Thursday, but was up 70% so far in 2017.Celgene, 99 Composite Rating: Celgene announced that it is discounting two trials for a Crohn's disease drug and will not start a third. It said mongersen (GED-301) failed an interim futility analysis. Celgene had spent $710 million in 2014 to obtain mongersen. Shares of the biotech giant tumbled 6.1% early Friday. Celgene undercut a 139.10 buy point about two weeks ago and last Friday fell below its 50-day moving average.Atlassian, 98 Composite Rating: Atlassian earned 12 cents a share in its fiscal Q1, up 20%, with revenue up 42% to $194 million, both topping the consensus. The maker of project-management and collaborative software raised guidance. Atlassian was not yet active Friday morning, but jumped 12.5% in after-hours trading. During Thursday's regular session, the stock dipped to 39.06 intraday, below a recent 39.35 buy point, but rallied to close up 1.1% at 40.25.RELATED:The Big Picture: Bears Lose Their Grip, Stocks Continue To Break OutCelgene Falls After Scrapping Crohn's Disease Drug TrialsPayPal Earnings, Revenue Top Expectations, Shares RiseAtlassian Revenue, Profit Blow Past Estimates, Shares JumpFANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

227,PYPL,"Big-cap techs Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are all well-known S&P 500 index components ended last week within 2% of buy points. But that doesn't mean they're all equally enticing. Nvidia broke out on Monday to a new high, but even that chip leader has some question markets.XApple outpaced the S&P 500 from May 2016 to May 2017, but since then has been moving with the market, lagging in the past couple of weeks. Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe Systems and Salesforce.com have a more recent history of S&P 500 outperformance than Apple. Unlike Apple, they significantly outperformed the market in the last week as they built the right side of bases.Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce are all the No. 1 stocks in their industry groups. Then again, so is Apple.Nvidia, PayPal and Adobe are all members of the IBD 50. PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce.com are also on the IBD Big Cap 20.Apple closed Friday at 175, less than 1% from its 176.34 flat-base entry. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been slumping for the past two months. Apple rallied 3.4% last week, but that wasn't much better than the S&P 500's 2.6% gain and even with the Nasdaq's 3.4% rise.Apple shares fell 0.4% to 174.35 on the stock market today, as the major averages rallied once again.The RS line is actually below where it was last May, when Apple was last significantly outperforming the S&P 500.Apple briefly broke out past the buy point on Dec. 18, but just barely and on volume that was only slightly above normal. The RS line wasn't close to confirming the breakout. Shares quickly fell back until finding support near their 50-day line.Apple could easily retake its buy point in the near future, and that move could work. But the odds of success are lower than with a truly leading stock.Nvidia jumped 3.1% to 222 Monday in strong volume, clearing a 218.77 cup-base entry.Nvidia's RS line is still lagging somewhat vs. its prior high. You'd like to see that RS line confirm the breakout.Keep in mind that Nvidia is a late-stage base. Late-stage bases are more likely to fail.Nvidia shot up 11.3% to 215.40 last week. It crossed its 50-day moving average in heavy trading on Wednesday, offering an entry point for aggressive investors.Chip stocks, which had struggled in late 2017, are roaring back. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index popped 5.8% last week, with several chip stocks moving back above their 50-day lines and carving the right side of bases. Chip stocks rose modestly overall Monday.Nvidia will have a presence at the CES 2018 tech show in Las Vegas this week. Nvidia on Sunday, in a pre-CES event, said it is teaming up with Uber on self-driving cars and expanded an artificial Volkswagen (VLKAY) partnership announced in mid-2017.Nvidia is already involved in several significant autonomous driving initiatives with various automakers and tech companies.IBD'S TAKE: Check out this Investor's Corner or on how the 50-day moving average or 10-week line offers buying opportunities.PayPal climbed 6.9% last week to 78.70, 1% below a 79.48 flat-base buy point. PayPal retook its 50-day line on Wednesday, but volume was only 11% above normal.PayPal rose 0.4% to 79.05.Leading stocks' performance is closely tied to their industry groups. And payment stocks are once again acting well. Square (SQ) moved back over its 50-day line Friday after a big retreat. Mastercard (MA) broke out past a buy point during the week, but on below-average volume.Adobe Systems advanced 5.8% last week to 185.34, less than 1% from a 186.37 flat-base entry. Adobe also reclaimed its 50-day line, but on below-average trade.Adobe dipped 0.2% to 185.04.Salesforce.com rose 5.7% to 108.10 last week. That's about 1% from a 109.29 entry in a flat base. Salesforce moved above its 50-day on Tuesday, but in average volume.Salesforce climbed 0.7% to 108.86, advancing to 109.14 intraday.One more observation on Nvidia, PayPal, Adobe and Salesforce. After running up so much last week, these stocks — and the overall market — are ripe for a pullback. That would not necessarily be a bad thing. Ideally, the stocks will ultimately break out in heavy volume, moving convincingly past the buy points to let their RS lines confirm the advance.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Alibaba Leads 5 Top Chinese Stocks Setting Up In BasesAdobe, PayPal Lead 5 Stocks Near Buy Points With Rising Earnings EstimatesStocks To Watch: Who Joins Apple, BofA On List Of New Buys By Top Funds?The Top 16 China Stocks Surge, In A Fast-Moving Start To 2018

245,PYPL,"A solid concentration in top-performing stocks, including Facebook (FB,) Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC), and a strong fund management team have helped Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX) beat the S&P 500 and its large-growth Morningstar category in the past one, three and five years.X Those leading stocks, along with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), account for nearly a fifth of the $30 billion fund's assets.Since its inception in 2003, New Insights has been managed by the legendary Will Danoff, who ran it identically to its widely followed $134 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). In 2013, John Roth, who also manages $8 billion Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock (FMCSX), joined as co-manager, bringing with him his midcap expertise. Since late 2015, Danoff and Roth have been splitting the management of the fund 60%-40%.The fund focuses on companies that have strong growth prospects, solid management teams and whose potential is misperceived by the public.""If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, video ... we're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer,"" Danoff told IBD.Having two managers may well be the reason why New Insights is more diversified at the top than Contrafund with top 5 holdings representing 17.3% vs. Contrafund's 24.1%. In addition, 26.7% and 37.9% of each fund's assets are in the top 10 holdings, further drawing the distinction.New Insight also holds nearly 10% more midcaps, is somewhat underweight technology and has a lower overweight in financials vs. the benchmark and its peers than Contrafund. Both sectors have been strong performers in the past several years.As a result, New Insight's performance has been trailing a bit that of Contrafund's, returning 22.91%, 11.89% and 14.35% the last one, three and five years vs. Contrafund's 27%, 13.45% and 15.92%. Both funds pulled back slightly in the recent, albeit short, market correction, but quickly recovered ground and are up 5.44% and 6.57%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 2.41% year to date.Regarding concerns that we're late in the economic cycle, Danoff notes the differences between now and conditions that led to bear markets like 2008-09.""The starting point (after the crisis) was quite drastic,"" said Danoff. ""So even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing their costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending. ... The world is much more global, U.S. companies are able now to sell their products all over the world and the big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive, so they're high margin, high growth and they're highly cash generative.""But it's not just the top hot stocks that determine a fund's longevity and strong performance. Other winning names include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), PayPal (PYPL), Visa (V), Estee Lauder (EL), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and United Health (UNH), each of which soared between 40% and 87% last year, compared with the S&P 500's 21.8% return.Netflix, which the fund has owned since early 2015, has been benefiting from a strong international momentum for its brand and stronger-than-expected subscriber additions in the U.S. and overseas."" Netflix is crushing it overseas,"" said Danoff. ""They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding and it's a subscription model offering great value.""The top name for creative design programs, Adobe has successfully transitioned to a recurring revenue model by moving its product lineup to the cloud. Last month, the company said that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring, though he'll stay on until they find a replacement. Adobe's earnings jumped at least 40% in each the past four quarters, while revenue increased 22% to 27%. The company also raised its fiscal Q1 and 2018 guidance after adjusting for President Trump's tax cuts. Adobe's stock is up 12.5% year to date.Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder has been experiencing strong growth. Its most recent Q2 results saw a 25% EPS rise on sales that grew 17%, primarily driven by strong advances in its skin care product lineup. Analysts expect the company to grow its market share from a current 15% as the company further builds out its e-commerce business. It also stands to benefit from the recent tax reforms. The stock is up 9.8% this year.Customer relationship software maker Salesforce.com (CRM), which rallied 49.3% last year and has risen 6.6% so far in 2018, stands to benefit from a growing product offering and low customer attrition despite strong competition in the sector. The company earnings accelerated in the past two quarters, jumping 63% in the most recent one. Sales grew 25%. Salesforce.com also raised its 2018 sales guidance to $12.5 billion and plans to reach $20 billion by fiscal 2022. Earnings guidance was also upped. It is due to release its next earnings report Feb. 28.In the midcap arena, the fund holds names such as Under Armour (UA), U.K.-based Metro Bank and LogMeIn (LOGM). The fund bought Under Armour last quarter as a starting position and Roth says they'll continue to work on it going forward.""It's a great brand, the stock got to be pretty expensive and expectations were pretty high, they struggled a bit and they got massively re-priced, the Street turned on them and investors turned on them, and then it became an interesting opportunity. ... The ultimate bet is that brand's still good.""RELATED:In A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course?

251,PYPL,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

258,PYPL,"Cash-rich PayPal Holdings (PYPL) is likely to pull the trigger on a big acquisition soon, and may be eyeing Europe or a big target like Square (SQ), says a Wall Street analyst.X""We believe the timing likely has been made more urgent by the recent Vantiv (VNTV)-Worldpay merger announcement and Visa's (V) recently announced minority stake in Klarna, as both Worldpay and Klarna were acquisition candidates for PayPal,"" Lisa Ellis, a Bernstein analyst, said in a note to clients. ""In addition, (Alibaba Group's (BABA)) Alipay has been aggressively making investments outside of China.""Since it was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments. In its core business, PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards.Ellis says PayPal has $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet and could raise $4 billion or more by selling off its consumer credit business.""While there are a number of potential candidates, we see the acquisition of a European payments asset as the most likely,"" added Ellis in the report.

260,PYPL,"As manager Joseph Fath closes in on his fourth anniversary at the helm of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) in January, the $50.7 billion portfolio continues to outperform. Its 28.73% gain this year going into Thursday outpaced 88% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct. Over the past three years it has notched a 14.54% annual gain, topping 92% of its direct rivals.XThe fund has managed its torrid pace by targeting leading stocks like e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group (BABA), graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and online payment processor PayPal Holdings (PYPL). Those stocks are up 94%, 81% and 80% so far this year. Alibaba and PayPal have been in the portfolio since the third quarter of 2016 and fourth quarter of 2015, respectively.Nvidia has been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters.Fath and his growth stock team look for companies that have one or more of these traits: superior growth in earnings and cash flow; sustainable earnings momentum even in economic slowdowns; and a lucrative niche in the economy and ability to grow — even amid slow GDP growth.Take Alibaba. ""Alibaba continues to benefit from improving user engagement amid its ongoing social commerce and mobile monetization efforts,"" Fath told shareholders in his semiannual report. ""The massive amount of data that its users generate also provide the company with a competitive advantage that could drive long-term earnings growth.""The Chinese Amazon's earnings-per-share growth has accelerated, having grown 30%, 37% and 60% the past three quarters. Annual EPS has grown for four years in a row. Consensus among analysts is that it will rise 44% this year.Alibaba is a longtime member of the Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Nvidia was been in and out of the portfolio in recent quarters as the fund initially took profits and then returned to the stock as we gained more conviction in the investment thesis, the growth stock team said.The stock's EPS growth is part of that process of persuasion. Its growth was at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters. Still, operating costs have risen as the company invests in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.The stock is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. That's due to achievements such as a 54% annual EPS growth rate over the past three years.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Nvidia other fundamental and technical traits stack up against its rivals' in IBD's easy-to-understand Stock Checkup.PayPal EPS has also sped up, growing 9%, 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31% in the past six quarters.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processor industry group thanks to traits such as four straight years of annual EPS growth.The 31% September-quarter profit topped analysts' views. So did the 21% revenue increase. PayPal issued a current-quarter sales forecast that topped analyst estimates.PayPal is among the IBD 50 roster of fast-growing companies.""We have a high conviction in PayPal as digital online payments are growing significantly on a global scale,"" Fath told shareholders. ""The company's strong balance sheet and the potential to monetize its Venmo peer-to-peer payment platform could lead to further outperformance.""Can Fath keep his streak going? That hinges partly on the performance of new stock buys, such as credit reporting bureau TransUnion (TRU), credit-card payment processor Vantiv (VNTV) and security software firm Symantec (SYMC).TransUnion shares got clobbered in the second week of September amid consumer anger and congressional inquiries sparked by the Equifax (EFX) data breach. But shares have rallied since then, resuming an uptrend that began late in 2016.While credit bureaus suffered withering criticism after the Equifax cyberattack, most of TransUnion's business comes from corporations. Only 23% of its revenue is from what the company calls its consumer interactive segment.And TransUnion has reinforced the corporate-focused part of its business with steps like its acquisition of Datalink Services, a leading provider of vehicle and driving records. The acquisition should enable TransUnion's DriverRisk to offer insurers a full-driving record platform.TransUnion, due to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct. 27, was expected by analysts to post a 21% increase in earnings.Vantiv provides credit, debit and prepaid payment processing. It ranks No. 10 in PayPal's IBD industry group.Last summer the company beat rivals like PayPal to the punch by acquiring British-based Worldpay Group. The deal greatly expanded Vantiv's online capabilities.Third-quarter EPS, reported Thursday, rose 27% to 90 cents, up from Q2's 19% gain. Charles Drucker, president and CEO of Vantiv, said in a release, ""We are investing in high growth segments of the market, including our combination with Worldpay, which will position us as a global acquirer with a leading position in e-commerce.""Symantec develops internet and network security, storage and systems management applications for consumers and enterprises.Shares initially jumped on news of the Equifax breach. They've pulled back a little since early October, but have found support at their 50-day moving average.EPS grew an average of 21% in each of the past three quarters. Analysts estimate a 43% increase for the current stanza and 53% for the current fiscal year.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeTop Mutual Fund Manager Has Several Stocks In Buy Zone

264,PYPL,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) will test a mobile app for Apple (AAPL) iPhones that enables people to create and control a bank account via their phone and — in an effort to draw smartphone-anchored millennials — ""sort their spending with emojis,"" according to a Reuters report.XThe bank also plans to market the app, called Finn by Chase, on Android phones next year.The app arrives as banks try to determine how to reach customers that are more likely to do business online. Banks are also grappling with what the purpose of their branch locations — where people for generations have gone to cash checks or make deposits — should be in a landscape where financial technology allows more people to manage their finances over their phones.JPMorgan's own mobile customers grew by 12% in the third quarter. But mobile payment options from an array of fintech startups and bigger competitors like PayPal (PYPL) Venmo, Facebook (FB), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google have proliferated.Zelle, a payment platform that has the backing of Chase and giants like Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC), launched a peer-to-peer payment app last month.JPMorgan will first test the Finn by Chase app for Apple users who have ZIP codes in St. Louis, Reuters reported. Chase has no branches in that city. The bank will expand marketing of the app to other U.S. cities in 2018, Reuters said.Mobile enrollment for standard checking and savings accounts will be offered at some point this year, Reuters said. Finn by Chase debit cards will be mailed to enrollees, Reuters said.The bank last year said that millennials made up ""the majority of our new deposit customers"". But Reuters notes that JPMorgan has become too large to get new depositors via an acquisition.In researching how to develop the Finn by Chase app, Reuters said, Chase found that many of the millennials it interviewed found wanted a better way to manage their spending than simply trying to adhere to a budget — something they've found difficult to do. Finn by Chase's developers created the app to enable users to tag certain types of spending with emojis according to how that spending made them feel.During the bank's third-quarter earnings call this month, JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said that ""branches still matter,"" but that it was responding to technological changes in banking and closing and consolidating branches when necessary.JPMorgan fell 0.2% to 99.34 in the stock market today, at the high end of a range from a 95.32 buy point.

"
283,PYPL,"U.S. stock indexes lingered just under the break-even line midday Thursday, as the Dow Jones utility average advanced modestly.The Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 were flat, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 trimmed 0.1% each.XThe Dow Jones utility average, a defensive play, rose 0.5% early but then the gain faded to 0.2%.Volume in the stock market today rose on both major exchanges compared with the same time Wednesday.The session at midday had a lackluster tone. Besides utilities, another caution instrument rising was food and dairy stocks. Going into Thursday's session, dairy ranked last among 197 industry groups. But dairy was up 1% in midday action.Blue chips in the Dow Jones industrial average were about evenly split between advancing and declining issues. Microsoft (MSFT) rose almost 1%, pegging a new high. McDonald's (MCD) also marked a new high as it popped 0.4%. On the negative side, Walt Disney (DIS) gapped down about 1.5%. Guggenheim lowered its price target on Disney from 122 to 105. The stock was trading above 97 midday Thursday.In the Nasdaq 100, construction supply store chain Fastenal (FAST) led with a 3% thrust. The stock is consolidating and is about 13% off its high. Fastenal reported that Q3 earnings rose 14%, matching the Street's consensus estimate. Full-year earnings growth is expected to roll in at 11%, which would be the best growth in five years.Meanwhile, the IBD 50 was mixed. Gainers included chip equipment maker Lam Research (LRCX), payment processor PayPal (PYPL) and flat-panel-display provider Universal Display (OLED). On the downside, the day's losers included managed health care provider Centene (CNC) and China-based wealth manager Jupai (JP), which has been soaring this month and seems due for a breather.Two major banks reported quarterly results. Citigroup (C) reversed to a 2% loss in heavy volume after  a slight miss on earnings, according to William O'Neil + Co.  calculations. William O'Neil + Co. is a sister company of IBD. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) slid 1% despite topping earnings estimates by about 7%.Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) will report quarterly results Friday before the market's open. Both were down in midday trade.RELATED:JPMorgan, Citigroup Beat Q3 Estimates Despite Weak TradingOnline Auto Broker Launches IPOSelf-Education Is A Key To Investing Success
"
284,PYPL,"Key indexes remained near the breakeven point Thursday afternoon after the first set of top-tier banks Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported decent third-quarter results, officially kicking off Q3 earnings season.XBoth Citi and JPMorgan fell in heavy turnover, but are not triggering any sell signals.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, quietly retook its former buy point from a flat base at 156.75 while social media phenom Snap (SNAP) jumped sharply for a second straight session.Apple is trying to stretch its win streak to four sessions and got as high as 157.37. Investors with conviction or a big cushion of gains in the stock may purchase shares, but volume is largely absent. Another strategy would be to wait for the iPhone giant to climb back above the 50-day moving average, currently near 158, or wait even longer and see if it can form a new base.At 2:30 pm ET, The Nasdaq composite edged slightly lower after marking a new all-time high of 6613.50. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Powershares QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were all virtually flat.Volume was running higher vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.Apple had rallied a little more than 5% after clearing its 11-week flat base on Aug. 2 following its best EPS growth in nearly a year. The pullback to below the 156.75 entry and drop below the 50-day moving average reflected a sobering of investors' minds after the company unveiled its iPhone 8 and X models.However, such drops back to a proper buy point are not unusual, even among big market winners. IBD has noted in the past that as many as four out of 10 true leaders will backtrack to or near the buy point in a proper base, shaking out weak holders, before resuming its rally.Plus, Apple did not trigger the golden rule of selling.Apple has gained more than 39% since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle. Investors who bought at that prime entry would be justified in taking gains, but those who wish to see if there is room to run may hold until the stock shows a devastating break of the 10-week moving average (as seen on an IBD weekly chart; the 10-week line is painted in red) in massive volume.That has yet to occur.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column on Wednesday, the iPhone, Apple Watch and iMac marketer is in the middle of a slow yet steady turnaround in its fundmentals. IBD research has pointed out that nearly one out of four of the best stock market winners in history were corporate turnaround situations.In such cases, the stock's recent price-and-volume action, RS Rating, relative strength line and changes in current quarterly numbers matter far more than conventional IBD measures of growth that look at longer time periods. For instance, IBD's EPS Rating looks at both annual profit performance over the past three to five years as well as those in the past few quarters.For this reason, IPOs tend to have weaker EPS Ratings, because they have a younger record of profits.Snap, however, did trigger the golden rule of investing after it tried to rally back following a fireworks-like debut on the NYSE and a spectacular 34% free-fall in two weeks' time in March. Those who tried to buy later that month broke a key IBD rule, which is to never buy a stock before its base fully forms.While the rebound from an 18.90 low on March 17 to as high as 24.40 six sessions later was impressive, Snap was still in basing mode. Those who bought on the way up were forced to cut their losses at 8% or less.Now, shares in the money-losing social media network are trying to fashion an authentic first-stage base following a 62% slide from its all-time high of 29.44.Snap has lost money every year since 2015 despite showing excellent top-line growth. Shares are rising amid bullish comments made by Credit Suisse. Morgan Stanley is Snap's chief investment banker.In the second quarter, Venice, Calif.-based Snap lost 16 cents a share even though revenue soared 153% to $181.7 million, a quarterly record. Snap showed gross margin of $29.5 million, or 16.2% of total revenue. However, Snap also marked an operating loss of $449 million as R&D costs rose 608%, sales and marketing expense jumped 270%, and general and administrative costs ran up 308%.Defense firms continue to rally amid an ongoing threat of military conflict between North Korea and the U.S. Lockheed Martin (LMT) rose 0.7% to 320.95 to mark its 10th straight gain. The F-35 fighter jet maker is up nearly 19% after rising past a 269.84 flat-base entry in mid-March.Lockheed's earnings per share have climbed 49%, 24%, 8% and 12% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters amid revenue increases of 15%, 19%, 7% and 10%.Are there other relatively young IPOs (going public in the past five years or later) that are making money and doing well in the market today? Sure.Square (SQ), Five Below (FIVE), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), eBay spin-off PayPal (PYPL), YY (YY), Jupai (JP) and others are just some examples. Most of these inhabit the IBD 50. Watch for follow-on entry points or new bases to develop.On Thursday's economic news, weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to 243,000, below the Econoday forecast of 252,000 and 17,000 claims less than the prior week.Crude oil dropped hard after U.S. inventories slumped by 2.7 million barrels, a smaller drawdown than the 6 million barrel decline in the prior week. WTI futures on the NYMEX fell 1.4% to $50.56 a barrel. Gold jumped more than 0.6% and futures hit a session high of $1,299.80 a troy ounce.IBD'S TAKE: Did you know that the flat base, which reflects an unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares, often serves as a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains for many growth stocks?

286,PYPL,"The end-of-summer blahs and elevated geopolitical uncertainty took their toll on the stock market and stock mutual funds in August, which notched their first losses of the year.XAfter having fallen nearly 2% around mid-August, the broad stock market in the form of the S&P 500 rallied to close the month with a 0.31% gain. It was lifted by such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Visa (V) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) as well as technology leader Grubhub (GRUB).Lagging, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds lost 0.35% on average. Large-cap growth funds did best, tacking on 1.47%, while small-cap value funds did worst, losing 2.44%. ""Overall, investors generally treaded water in August,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial (AMP). ""The good news pretty much offset the bad news. The market did not turn decisively either way.""The broad benchmark's modest gain extended the market's winning streak to 10 months. The S&P 500 edged up to an 11.93% gain year to date. U.S. diversified stock funds were left with a 9.05% year-to-date return.Mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD expect many of their opportunities for new gains to come from technology innovators and from ""quality"" companies — firms capable of churning out earnings growth even in a slow economic growth environment.Factors that heartened investors last month included a weak dollar, which boosted U.S. exports, said manager Daniel Strickberger, whose $211 million Touchstone Large Company Growth Fund (TSAGX) topped 95% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct in August. In addition, manufacturing showed strength, based on the monthly Institute of Supply Management report. Overall U.S. employment posted gains, though less than in July.""Retail sales and consumer sentiment were pretty good,"" Joy said.But negative factors included soft inflation numbers, which is a sign of tepid overall economic growth. The defeat of health care reform signaled that tax reform and infrastructure spending are uncertain, Joy said.And geopolitical tension involving North Korea contributed to investors' skittishness, Strickberger said.In addition, low inflation could help persuade the Federal Reserve to slow its interest-rate hikes. ""Interest rates are heading to where they were six to nine months ago,"" said Stephen DuFour, manager of $1.7 billion Fidelity Focused Stock Fund (FTQGX), which topped 97% of its large-cap growth rivals last month. ""Over the long run, falling rates usually help utilities and hurt financials.""In contrast to U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, world stock mutual funds eked out a 0.84% gain in August. Latin American funds led that charge, rising 4.35%.Many investors sought safe havens last month. Taxable bond funds in general advanced an average of 0.51%. They were led by U.S. Treasury bond mutual funds, which gained 1.93%. Muni funds also advanced on average. And precious metals stock mutual funds topped sector fund categories, racking up a 6.10% advance.Despite August's market blahs, Ameriprise's Joy is guardedly optimistic going forward. U.S. economic growth remains muted but positive, he said. Global growth, at least in developed markets, is at its strongest since the recession. Many foreign central banks are continuing monetary policies that support stocks. And he expects large U.S. businesses to continue to benefit from a weak dollar through at least year-end.Model portfolios that Ameriprise recommends to its financial advisors' clients remain overweight in the technology sector, which in general still has room to run, Joy said. Those model portfolios' weightings in emerging markets stocks have also been boosted but are still underweight.China remains strong. Latin American economies are healing, he said.Fidelity's DuFour also sees attractive trends in the tech sector. Digital advertising, electronic payments and the growth of exchange traded funds (ETFs) ""are areas to get excited about,"" he said. He cited holdings as of July 31.A digital advertising name in which he had a stake was Adobe Systems (ADBE). Its business model has morphed. It used to sell its programs via computer disks through brick-and-mortar retailers. Customers would have to upgrade by buying new disks every few years.""They've evolved into software-as-a-service, where you pay on a monthly basis, and you've always got access to the latest version of a program,"" DuFour said.Once you create your digital product, Adobe also can monitor the online traffic it attracts and help clients manage online advertising campaigns. In addition, they have a commercial image library. That multiservice approach positions Adobe to benefit from the growth of digital media and online advertising, DuFour said.""PayPal (PYPL) is growing with the growth of electronic payments around the world,"" DuFour said. ""They have done a good job of increasing the number of places that accept PayPal, and they have a higher percentage of online transactions than physical store ones. As online commerce grows at the expense of physical stores, they are net gainers.""PayPal also owns Venmo, which is a payments service that lets users divvy up payments for shared goods or services. It is popular among millennials.S&P Global (SPGI) is poised to benefit from the growth of ETFs. The company has exited education books and ownership of Businessweek to focus on three areas in which the company provides data to clients. One of those areas consists of the indexes that customers like State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) license for the ETFs that they build and operate. ""S&P Global's business is very exciting and has very substantial margins,"" DuFour said.In other sectors, Touchstone's Strickberg cites Zoetis (ZTS) as ""the sort of quality, predictable growth company we like. We want companies that will prosper whether U.S. GDP growth is 0% or 3%,"" he said.Roughly half of sales by the developer of animal medicines and vaccines are for livestock rather than pets. Commercial agricultural sales don't fluctuate much in economic ups and downs. That steadiness makes it ""the kind of business we look for,"" Strickberger said.The $9.8 billion Vanguard Primecap Core (VPCCX), a large-cap growth fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner, edged up 0.36% last month. It owns ASML Holding (ASML), a Dutch maker of lithography systems used to create computer chips. Shares have climbed 39% this year.The stock has a very strong 98 Composite Rating from IBD and an A SMR Rating. Scored on a scale of 1 to 99, stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.IBD'S TAKE: ASML's A SMR Rating means the semiconductor equipment maker is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula. Buying stocks with high SMR ratings at proper buy points increases your chances of investment success.  RELATED:Here's An Easy Routine To Get You Started In Stock InvestingWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Some Investors Turns More Defensive Even As Market Rises Again

292,PYPL,"When Fidelity Investments needed a new manager of $17.4 billion OTC Fund (FOCPX) in September, it didn't need to look far. The Boston-based mutual fund behemoth tapped its own Sonu Kalra. Kalra was the manager of Fidelity's market-beating $23.3 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX).X With help from leading stocks like Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal (PYPL) and Five Below (FIVE), Blue Chip Growth gained 34.93% this year through Nov. 30, outperforming 91% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct as well as the S&P 500's 20.49%.He was also the manager from early 2005 through mid-2009 of OTC. Now he remains helmsman of Blue Chip Growth and lead manager of OTC.Kalra is on track to guide both funds to IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner status. As of Dec. 1, both funds had outperformed in all four time periods — year-to-date and trailing 3-, 5- and 10 years — needed to join the elite club, if they maintain those outperformances through year end.In a talk with IBD from his office in Boston, 46-year-old Kalra discussed his investment strategy, his early mentors at Fidelity, why shareholders should not fear that he is stretched too thin by adding OTC to his workload, and more.IBD: You nearly doubled your assets under management by taking on OTC Fund. How do you know you can handle two funds that large?Kalra: I have gotten that question a few times. There are a couple of reasons why I'm not spread too thin. The biggest reason is that I have a co-manager on OTC, Christopher Lin. He was an integral part of the growth team here, a research analyst in the tech sector.List Of Mutual Fund Six Month LeadersBest Performing Mutual Fund CategoriesSome Mutual Funds Get A Boost From Value Stock TiltWhich Stocks Are The Top Fund Managers Buying?Bond Fund Decline In November: Turning Of The Tide?So he covered some of the larger growth stocks in the technology sector, companies like Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN). And those companies have been key contributors to strong performance by both OTC and Blue Chip Growth funds. For him to come on as co-manager makes it possible for us to manage and for me to not be stretched too thin.Another reason is that I ran OTC before, so I'm familiar with this product. And overall, 80% of the assets in OTC I owned in Blue Chip Growth.IBD: Are the funds run the same way?Kalra: There is a lot of overlap in the portfolios. But the nature of the funds differ (at the individual stock level). Their risk profiles are different. There are similar names but different weightings. They are both growth funds. But their mandates differ.Blue Chip Growth is more of a large-cap Steady Eddie growth fund, whereas OTC is more aggressive and has more smaller names as well as some younger, faster growing companies. Blue Chip Growth is benchmarked to the Russell 1000 Growth. OTC is benchmarked to the Nasdaq (Composite). That's why OTC has a larger tech component, given the Nasdaq's larger tech component.IBD: Summarize your overall investment approach for these two funds, Sonu.Kalra: I'm trying to find companies where the market is not only mispricing the absolute rate of growth but also the sustainability of that growth. We think of ourselves as long-term investors, trying to take advantage of the market's myopic short-term focus.IBD: Do you think of all growth stocks as the same?Kalra: I try to look at three buckets. One is the business model, how a company makes money. What's the company's potential to generate free cash flow? At the end of the day, the value of a company is all of its future cash flow discounted backward. Some companies get mispriced by some investors misunderstanding its potential to generate free cash flow in the future.Second, I pay attention to whether a company's incremental business opportunities are going to be better than they are today or are they deteriorating?Last, I focus on revenue growth. It's a number you can't make up. I'm really trying to find companies that can grow regardless of what's happening in the economy.IBD: As of your latest disclosure, tell me why you hold Alibaba in both funds.Kalra: I've owned it in Blue Chip Growth for some time. I introduced it to OTC in September when I took over. They are leaders in China of e-commerce, and e-commerce is growing there. About 15% to 20% of overall retail sales happen in China online. That's higher than in the U.S. because retail infrastructure is not as developed in China. So they don't have to compete with entrenched bricks-and-mortar competitors there.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba has agreed to let Netflix (NFLX) globally distribute a popular detective drama series owned by Youku, which is owned by Alibaba.IBD: Why have you built your Blue Chip share count in PayPal?Kalra: The investment thesis is about the online growth of e-commerce. They provide the payment mechanism that makes it easy to purchase online. Their hidden gem is Venmo, a peer-to-peer payment mechanism. It lets people share payments with a social twist that's appealing to millennials. If they go out together for dinner with friends, they Venmo each other. It's almost become a verb. Eventually PayPal will begin to monetize it, but now they're piggybacking on the growth of online commerce. My guess is we're still a few years away before Venmo makes a material impact on the parent company from monetization.IBD: Five Below is another name you've been building. Is their secret sauce the fact that they sell products for $5 or less to a teen audience?Kalra: You hit the nail on the head. Brick-and-mortar stores have difficulties. What does work is when you have a great value proposition. That enables companies to drive traffic into stores. Having a price point of $5 says it all. They have iPhone cases, power cords, chargers. They are a beneficiary of the spinner (fad) inside schools.But there's more to their story. They have a fast supply chain. They can spot trends quickly and come to market fast and provide unbelievable value to consumers.They have a differentiated store model and also a store rollout that is growing their square footage more than 10% a year. So that shows healthy top- and bottom-line growth.IBD: Do you like the way Facebook is developing new platforms?Kalra: I started as a media analyst at Fidelity. One of the first things I learned was that advertising dollars follow eyeballs. Facebook has been a key contributor to and beneficiary of the change over the past five to 10 years in how people spend time across various media.Facebook is a core platform, but they also have Instagram and WhatsApp. Those have audiences spending more time on their applications, driving up ad dollars.IBD: OTC also has stocks that are not household names, like Atlassian (TEAM). What's your thesis?Kalra: They provide project management and collaboration software — software as a service. They went public in late 2015. Their software lets teams work on projects. They can seamlessly collaborate inside an organization. They're showing strong revenue growth, in excess of 30% a year for the past two years. They're in an underpenetrated market, and they are one of the leaders.IBD: What made you introduce Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) to OTC fairly recently?Kalra: They use technology to change the way surgery is done. Their system enables doctors to do surgery through robots. The outcomes are better. Fewer injuries. Safer. More cost-efficient for hospitals as well. It's a win-win for everyone, hospitals and patients.IBD: Which Fidelity managers have been your mentors?Kalra: I feel fortunate to be at an organization with a history of great investors and to be able to learn from them, watch how they work.Will Danoff (who runs giant $124.6 billion Fidelity Contra (FCNTX) and $28.1 billion Advisor New Insights (FNIAX)) and Steve Wymer (manager of $41.7 billion Fidelity Growth Company (FDGRX)) have been wonderful mentors. I've watched their work ethic, their ability to identify great growth companies early and stick with them for the long-term.I've worked closely with Steve Wymer. We've been on the same growth team here. We've traveled together, visiting companies, attending trade shows. Same with Danoff — we've been part of the same team.I was a tech analyst starting in 1998. For six years I was part of the research team focused on tech, so I supported guys like (Robert) Stansky (who ran Fidelity Growth Company and now-$16.9 billion Magellan Fund (FMAGX) from 1996 to 2005), Danoff and Wymer. So I've worked with some high profile managers here at Fidelity, identifying great companies.RELATED:Where To Find Income Without Taking Big Risks

301,PYPL,"Best known for processing credit card payments for small businesses like food trucks and farm-stand vendors, Square (SQ) has expanded into a host of financial services as it aims to become a more critical support partner for its customers.XAmong its latest ventures, Square recently revealed that it plans to create a banking arm to offer business loans, take deposits and provide other services. It already offers small loans through its Square Capital unit.""The premise is small businesses don't have access to capital to start, run and grow their business,"" Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar said. ""Our typical loan type is about $6,000. This is not a playground that the banks typically can serve in any sort of profitable way. So we felt there was a market need.""It's all part of Square's master plan to continue serving the often neglected small business market, as well as to move upmarket to larger businesses.""Today where we're being most successful is that move upmarket,"" Friar said. Square is more than a payments company, she adds. Speaking at a recent technology conference, she said Square provides the financial hardware and software to get small businesses up and running and to grow.""That's really what Square revolutionized,"" Friar said. ""We bring to a seller a cohesive commerce ecosystem.""San Francisco-based Square broke into the financial technology scene in 2009 with its tiny credit-card swipe dongles — hardware attachments that plug into computers, smartphones and tablets. Since then it has grown in scope, scale and ambition.In addition to processing payments, Square provides software for point-of-sale and back offices in order to manage inventory and other tasks. It also offers customer relationship management software so businesses can do targeted marketing to their clients.Square's software and services have proved to be incredibly sticky, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Josh Beck said in an Oct. 2 report.Square's rivals, mostly traditional payments firms, have tried undercutting it on price, but customers appear to be sticking with Square, according to a recent survey by KeyBanc.Among the larger businesses that Square serves — those doing more than $200,000 in annual sales — 60% have received lower-price offers from Square's competitors, Beck said. But 80% say that they plan to stay with Square for more than a year.Square has created a stickier business by offering payroll and lending services to the small businesses that already rely on it to process payments.The survey results suggest that ""the value and breadth of services (from Square) exceeds the potential expense savings"" of lower fees for processing payments through rivals, Beck said.Square has created a business platform that is differentiated by ease of use, transparency, system integration and innovation, he said.""The survey data indicates to us that Square is rapidly innovating new features to accommodate a variety of needs, forming a platform that generates a substantial moat,"" Beck said.He reiterated his overweight rating on Square stock and raised his price target to 32 from 29.Square went public in November 2015 at $9 a share and reached an all-time high of 30.90 before ending trades Thursday at 30.76. Shares were unchanged Friday.Square is one of 28 companies in IBD's Finance-Credit Card and Payment Processing industry group, which currently ranks No. 51 out of 197 groups. The biggest companies in the group by market cap are Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), American Express (AXP) and PayPal (PYPL).The company is scheduled to announce third-quarter results on Nov. 8 after the market close. Square has guided to adjusted earnings per share of 5 cents on sales of $565 million. In the third quarter last year, Square earned a penny a share on sales of $439 million.In the second quarter, Square earned an adjusted 7 cents a share, up from 5 cents in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 26% year over year to $552 million, ahead of the $536 million consensus view.IBD'S TAKE: With an IBD Composite Rating of 96, Square ranks third among companies in its industry group. For analysis of Square stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.In the first six months of 2017, Square got 87.4% of its revenue from handling transactions, 10.7% from subscriptions and 1.9% from hardware.Square has several drivers that could sustain revenue growth and margin expansion, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane said in a Sept. 14 report. They include continued penetration of its core small business market, its move upmarket, and expansion into e-commerce and international markets.""The power of Square's platform continues to be undervalued by investors,"" Keane said. He rates the stock as buy.Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider sees Square continuing to grow its user base and to sell them more services. He rates Square as buy.""We expect the company to achieve significant growth driven by further growth in payment processing, and bolstered by cross-selling subscription and service-based products to its base of nearly 3 million merchants,"" Schneider said in a Sept. 11 report. ""We believe Square can continue to drive margins higher as it builds scale outside payments.""Square's other offerings include Square Cash, a way for businesses and people to send and receive money, and Caviar, a food ordering service for popular restaurants.On Sept. 28, Square announced a deal to process payments for ticketing service Eventbrite as part of its push into online commerce, an area dominated by larger players like PayPal. Square will handle Eventbrite's online, mobile and in-person payments.Square also invested $25 million in Eventbrite, which lets event organizers sell tickets and promote and manage live events.RELATED:PayPal A Buyer, Not Seller, And May Seek A Big Target: AnalystSquare Goes Retail To Offer Hands-On Support For Merchants

Celgene (CELG) saw its rating cut from equal weight to underweight at Morgan Stanley. Shares declined almost 5%. The leading biotech was back in buy range, just above a 139.10 flat-base entry. But potential investors should wait for a sign of strength to avoid trying to catch a falling dagger.Meanwhile, Citigroup downgraded Leaderboard member Grubhub (GRUB) from buy to neutral. The food-delivery service had just reclaimed its 50-day line, but was back below it, falling almost 3%.Among companies reporting earnings, Constellation Brands (STZ) jumped 4% after reporting strong fiscal-Q2 earnings and sales results early Thursday.

304,PYPL,"Jack Dorsey's latest bet is positively old-school.Square (SQ), the mobile payments processor run by Dorsey, unveiled its first physical store on Thursday to offer hands-on support for merchants using its technology and showcase some of their wares.To most passers-by, the cozy space looks like any other boutique store in Manhattan's Nolita neighborhood, with eclectic merchandise for sale like handmade jewelry, candles and bags. The difference is the iconic white Square design outside the store and the point-of-sale hardware products on display inside.""We're (within) walking distance from hundreds of Square sellers,"" said Jesse Dorogusker, the company's hardware lead. ""We want to develop the idea that you can merge sales, support, merchant showcase, and a retail store. That scales with more brick-and-mortar locations, or pop-ups, or something more mobile over time.""There's a support desk where sellers can make appointments with Square employees to get help with its software — akin to an Apple Genius Bar for retailers and other merchants. Dorogusker isn't expecting the store to be a big driver of hardware products, which are already on sale at numerous national retailers like Best Buy. Rather, the goal is to improve the customer experience, boost sales for Square's merchants, and introduce shoppers to the Square brand.IBD'S TAKE: Square's numbers look solid for IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processing Group. It holds a 96 Composite Rating out of a possible 99 and its Relative Strength rating is 98. But it's not the top stock in the group, ranking eighth. The top stock is PayPal (PYPL), which holds a Composite Rating of 99.Square started by selling smartphone plug-ins that let food truck vendors and other small businesses accept credit cards. The company has since attracted larger merchants by offering a suite of services and software that make running a business easier. Those more profitable services, including loans, food delivery and inventory management software, have boosted the company's financial performance and its stock.Less than 5% of Square's revenue comes from hardware, which includes a variety of credit card readers and a stand that turns an iPad into a point-of-sale terminal. Square sells its hardware cheaply, or gives it away, to attract merchants onto its platform, where it profits from selling software services.

305,PYPL,"The stock market's ascent has slowed since June. But Wells Fargo Growth Fund's Tom Ognar sees a buying opportunity for the kinds of growth stocks his fund holds, which include PayPal (PYPL), Alibaba (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX).X""The market has been a little more defensive, and it seems some higher multiple stocks have corrected a little — but nothing too discouraging,"" said Ognar, who is lead manager of $4.4 billion Growth Fund (SGRAX). ""To us, it opens opportunities. It has made many secular growth stocks more attractively valued.""Those are the kinds of stocks that Ognar and co-managers Bruce Olson and Joseph Eberhardy aim for and that have fueled the fund's long-term outperformance. ""The Growth Fund has always had a bias (in favor of) investing in longer-term secular growth companies that exhibit robust and sustainable growth,"" Ognar said. Many are built for vigorous growth in a variety of economic conditions.That focus has driven the fund in the long term. Ognar has been a manager of this portfolio since May 2002. Going into Thursday, over the past 15 years the fund's 11.53% average annual gain outpaced 93% of its peer group tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the big-cap bogey's 9.01% average yearly gain.This year the fund has tacked on an additional 22.16%, topping 80% of its direct rivals, despite a rocky past three months during which the fund beat only 43% of its peers.Olson has been a co-manager since the start of 2005. Eberhardy has been a manager since late April 2008.The recent downturn is certainly not the only time that the managers have added to names they like. They added to positions in recent quarters in several favorites, including PayPal, Alibaba, Nvidia and Netflix.PayPal benefits from the shift to electronic payments for transactions. That trend is driven by the need to make electronic payments for online transactions. It's also driven by global governments' desire to track transactions so they can assess taxes. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.PayPal isn't the only holding that benefits from that trend. ""Square (SQ), Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Global Payments (GPN) all benefit from the transition away from cash,"" Ognar said. ""The other big push for that (group) is the movement from offline, brick-and-mortar retailers to online retailers.""In addition, a change in PayPal's business strategy has cut a source of risk. ""PayPal has evolved its business model,"" Ognar said. ""It no longer fights with peers. It has made them more partners. It has signed partnerships with Visa and Mastercard, where it no longer creates barriers (for consumers) using Visa and Mastercard. Now it makes it easier for consumers to make payments through Visa and Mastercard using the PayPal platform.""Alibaba, China's leading online retail marketplace, benefits from the growth of online retail, the same trend that helps Amazon, Ognar notes, and it is diversifying geographically. ""We've felt there was an opportunity there since the (Alibaba) IPO,"" Ognar said.Both stocks are on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.A third trend that the fund plays is ""the digitization of the economy and consumer,"" Ognar said. He added, ""It's a compelling growth opportunity for semiconductor firms,"" Ognar said. Chipmaker Nvidia, which is another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, driverless and driver-assisted cars, and cryptocurrencies, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Portfolio newcomer Netflix is too small of a holding to be the poster child for any broad investment theme for the fund, Ognar says. Still, the stock popped 3.5% on Wednesday. IBD readers saw that the video-streaming service bounced off its 50-day moving average, rising toward a buy point.Among other holdings, Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another chipmaker that benefits from digitization of the economy and consumer. ""Electronics and digitization are influencing more of what we do and the products we use to do those things,"" Ognar said.Microchip Tech's products include signal microcontrollers. ""They're like little full-blown computers within thermostats in your home, the entertainment system of your car, or camera, or brake system of your car,"" he said.While the fund has trimmed its Microchip stake, the stock is still the fund's largest chipmaker. Shares are up 34% so far this year.The fund has trimmed stocks that have been big share-price gainers this year, including software titan Microsoft (MSFT) and video game publisher Activision Blizzard (ATVI), to reduce their weightings. ""It's more of a risk-management move as they've grown in position size, not because of a degradation in growth opportunities,"" Ognar said. RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

306,PYPL,"When the stock market awards Ph.D.s, they are given for prudence, humility and disaster survival, not piggishness, hubris and denial.Disaster survival is the most important item because until investors have lived through a bear market, they have no idea how contagious panic can be.Fortunately, marketwide disasters are rare. Individual mistakes are more common, and the art of investing is all about surviving those mistakes and learning from them.The first mistake that new investors make is thinking the stock market is all about them. You buy a stock because of one brilliant reason or another, and the market eventually comes around to your brilliant idea, or so you believe.The stock market, though, isn't about you. The money you put into the stock market is pocket lint compared to the big funds that power and shape the market.So, experienced investors ask a set of preliminary questions before researching a stock further:A recent look at the Big Cap 20 found three stocks that are above their 50-day lines and had quality fund support.Electronic Arts (EA) is trading well above its 50-day moving average. The number of funds holding shares increased almost 5% over the past three quarters, while the overall stake fell 8%. But quality funds like the stock. Fidelity Magellan (FMAGX) bought shares in the most recently reported quarter. Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) increased its stake about 10%.PayPal (PYPL) is above its 50-day line. Fund participation and exposure are up from three quarters ago. Quality funds buying shares include these three A+ rated funds: T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX), Fidelity OTC Portfolio (FOCPX) and Contrafund.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is above its 50-day line and forming a base with a 167.95 buy point. Funds' overall stake declined over the past three quarters, but the number of funds increased. Quality funds buying shares include Contrafund and T. Rowe Price Growth.Passing these minimum tests aren't enough to qualify a stock for a buy, but the tests are a good way to cull for stocks that deserve a closer look.Going into Friday's session, the Big Cap 20 outperformed the S&P 500, 8.4% to 3.8% in the past six months. But be careful: In the past three months, the S&P 500 is up 1.7% vs. a decline of 1.3% for the Big Cap 20.RELATED:What's This? GM Stock Breaking Out?The Chip Stock You Probably Never Heard Of Is Back

311,PYPL,"Even honest poker players yearn to know what cards other players are holding. Investors can gain a bit of the same insight into the stock market today by knowing what Fidelity Investments — whose army of stock mutual funds includes many that are actively looking for winning equities, not just passively tracking this or that index — is up to with its buys and sells.XIn the second quarter, among Fidelity's 100 top holdings, the biggest net buys by the Boston-based fund complex's stock mutual funds as a group were in Aetna (AET), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Oracle (ORCL), Marriott International (MAR) and British American Tobacco (BTI).Fidelity funds boosted their cumulative net share count in health insurer Aetna by nearly 36%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, working from the Capital IQ database and Fidelity's June 30 13-F filing with the SEC. IBD recently reported that Aetna is talking with Apple (AAPL) about offering free or discounted Apple Watches to Aetna customers.Fidelity managers increased their collective stake in online payment processor PayPal by 34%, in database and e-commerce software leader Oracle by nearly 34%, in hotel giant Marriott by just under 30% and in cigarette maker British American Tobacco by almost 21%.PayPal is the No. 1-ranked stock in IBD's Finance-Creditcard/Payment Processor industry group. It sports a best-possible Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Consensus among analysts is that earnings per share will rise 22% this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare PayPal's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Oracle's EPS grew 8% and 10% the past two quarters after sliding 3% in the prior stanza. The stock has an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return-on-equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Marriott and Alibaba (BABA) have agreed to a joint venture that will let Alibaba users use the e-commerce giant's travel service platform, Fliggy, to book Marriott rooms, as IBD recently reported. Earlier this months Marriott reported better-than-expected earnings for the June quarter but gave weak guidance.Marriott International's (MARS) shares are forming a flat base, while Alibaba's are extended from an optimal buy point.British American Tobacco is 16% off its June 6 high and has a weak 31 Composite Rating.Individual Fidelity funds and managers can deviate from the overall net patterns.The technology sector remained Fidelity's largest cumulative sector, with a 27% weighting, Rosenbluth reported this week. The complex's six top individual stock holdings by combined market value in Fidelity portfolios were in fact tech stocks.Consumer electronics colossus Apple led the way with a $20.3 billion portfolio value, accounting for a 2.94% weighting. Social media mammoth Facebook (FB) was next, with an $18.1 billion portfolio value, with a 2.63% weighting.Third was Amazon (AMZN), a giant in e-commerce and web services, with a $14.4 billion portfolio value and 2.09% weighting. Classes A and C of Alphabet (GOOGL) were fourth and fifth, with values of $13 billion and $10.4 billion and weightings of 1.88% and 1.51% respectively. Software titan Microsoft (MSFT) was worth $9.5 billion to Fidelity, with a 1.38% weighting.Still, several of those favorites' allure faded in Fidelity's eyes. Fidelity sold 6.6 million shares of Apple, trimming its share count by 5%. That left Fidelity's Apple exposure at its lowest level since June 2016, Rosenbluth wrote.It disposed of about 1 million shares of Facebook, or just under 1% of its total.It sold 404,426 shares of Amazon, or 2.64% of its total.Fidelity added 102,000 shares of GOOGL, raising its share count by 0.75%. But it sold nearly 50,000 shares of class-A GOOG, or 0.43%.And it got rid of 5.3 million shares of Microsoft, a 3.9% cut in shares.Other big tech names suffered big share-count cuts. Fidelity trimmed its share count in Nvidia (NVDA) by nearly 11%, in Broadcom (AVGO) by 10.5% and Cisco (CSCO) by 10.2%.Financials stayed the second-largest Fidelity sector with a 16% weighting. Fidelity added exposure to big banks Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) by boosting share counts 4.4% and 3.8% respectively.But Fidelity cut share counts in Goldman Sachs (GS) by 9.8%, in Morgan Stanley (MS) by 8.1%, in Wells Fargo (WFC) by 7.9%, and in JPMorgan Chase (JPM) by 7.5%.It also trimmed share count in credit card network Mastercard (MA) by 2.2%.The $39.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) and $22.7 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) both held top-10 positions in Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and electric car maker Tesla (TSLA) as of June 30, Rosenbluth reported.TIPS & TOOLS:Is this a good time to buy Fidelity's top holdings?

318,PYPL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index rose slightly early Tuesday morning, as markets prepare for the first trading day of 2018. For the new year, here are five leading stocks that just formed flat bases at the very end of 2017: Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Mastercard (MA), Splunk (SPLK), RingCentral (RNG).X Facebook and Mastercard are members of the IBD 50 list. Facebook boasts a best-possible 99 Composite Rating while Mastercard has a 98. Splunk (96) and RingCentral (95) also have 95+ Composite Ratings. That's important, because all-time stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their runs.Amazon.com, for its part, has a 78 Composite Rating, reflecting its uneven profits.S&P 500 futures climbed 0.2% vs. fair value. Dow futures rose 0.2%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.1% above fair value. Bitcoin futures retreated.Amazon, like all the stocks on this list has a five-week consolidation, the minimum for a flat base. It's really a base-on-base formation above an October base. The e-commerce giant has a buy point of 1,213.51. Shares closed Friday at 1,169.47.Amazon appears to have been a big standout in the best holiday shopping season in years. The stock's Relative Strength line is near record highs. The RS line tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Ideally an RS line should lead or confirm a breakout by at least hitting a short-term highOn the downside, Amazon is in a late-stage base.

Take a free Leaderboard trial today.Facebook rose 53% in 2017. But its standout performance peaked at the end of July and the RS line has trended slightly lower since Nov. 1. The stock hasn't made much headway since late July either, while the broader averages continue to add to gains.Facebook, which closed Friday at 176.46, technically is still within range of an older 175.59 buy point from an October breakout, but hasn't made much progress since then and is currently below its 50-day line.Facebook has now created a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. That may be what investors should focus on now.Facebook and Amazon are both members of the FANG group of stocks. Including AppleAAPL, the FANG+ stocks are all at key technical levels right now.Mastercard's stock gradually outperformed the S&P 500 index for most of 2017, consolidating since late November. The RS line is modestly below record highs. Payment stocks, from traditional peers like Visa (V) to PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), were big winners in 2017.Mastercard tumbled through its 50-day line in early December, but was back above that key support within a few days. Since then it's been holding just above that moving average, closing Friday at 151.36. The buy point is 154.75.The data analytics firm began forming its latest consolidation shortly after gapping higher on strong earnings released Nov. 20.

319,PYPL,"MainStay Large Cap Growth Fund (MLAAX) is racing at a gallop, thanks in part to thoroughbred holdings like Alibaba Group (BABA), Nvidia (NVDA), PayPal (PYPL) and Facebook (FB).XThe first two have gained more than 100% this year. PayPal is up nearly 100%, and Facebook has climbed nearly 60%.Fund lead manager Justin Kelly describes where the $12.4 billion fund's giddy-up has come from in broad terms: ""During what we called the QE (quantitative easing) bubble from 2012 to 2016, growth stocks were (largely) out of favor,"" he said. ""Value and safety stocks were (generally) in favor because interest rates were so close to zero."" Now investors' appetite for growth has returned. ""People feel better about the growth outlook and (generally) are willing to pay more for growth stocks,"" he said.That appetite has enabled the fund to jump 32.05% so far this year going into Friday. That's well ahead of the S&P 500's 18.11% gain and the fund's large-cap growth peers' average of 25.74%. It's also nearly triple the fund's own three-year average annual gain and more than double its five-year pace.The fund itself shows a preference for three flavors, or buckets, of growth. One bucket holds consistent growers. ""Those are companies that tend to grow through positive as well as more-challenged economic times,"" Kelly said.The second bucket holds what Kelly calls dynamic growth companies that he and his colleagues estimate will grow revenue and earnings an average of 10% or more for each of the next three or so years. ""They've been growing market share in markets that are expanding,"" Kelly said, and their industries tend to be newer.The third bucket holds cyclical growth stocks operating in more economically sensitive sectors. ""We believe those companies are in the right part of their cycle,"" Kelly said about bucket No. 3.In any bucket, a holding must be addressing a growth opportunity, gaining market share or have a leading share, and have high or rising return on invested capital. It also must have sustainable competitive advantages and strong, innovative management.Managed care provider UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is an example of a stock in that first bucket. Steven Hamill, who tracks health care stocks for the fund, says the fund team believes UnitedHealth benefits from membership growth, driven by rising employment and by increased use of managed care by the U.S. government to control costs. The firm also benefits from its use of data analytics.That's a payoff from UnitedHealth's acquisitions of information-technology companies over the past 15 years, Hamill says. With more insight into patient trends and cost trends, UnitedHealth has been able to offer services at prices below those of its rivals. ""That's allowed them to gain share and have profit-margin growth,"" Hamill said.Salesforce.com (CRM) — whose cloud software helps businesses organize and handle sales operations and customer relationships — is an example of a stock in bucket No. 2 for dynamic growers. On Tuesday the company reported adjusted third-quarter profit and revenue that topped expectations, but its profit outlook for the current quarter slightly disappointed most investors, IBD reported.""Our belief is that they can grow free cash flow at (an average of) 25% annually for the next three years, and that the market is underestimating the duration of their growth,"" Kelly said.Netherlands-based ASML Holding (ASML) is an example of a company in the fund's third bucket, holding cyclical growers. ASML makes lithography systems used to fabricate integrated circuits. The fund began its current stake in June.""We saw a big upward earnings cycle developing,"" Kelly said. ""We believe the company (looked poised to) make more money in the next two years than Wall Street's consensus view expected. So our analysis differed on both the size and duration of their expected free cash flow and earnings.""MainStay Large Cap Growth's big gainers this year include Alibaba, which is in the dynamic-growth bucket.

325,PYPL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials were little changed early Friday morning despite weak guidance from Oracle (ORCL) and a new North Korean missile launch. That follows a mixed Thursday session for the major averages, but leading stocks were more upbeat: Tesla (TSLA) and Square (SQ) broke out. Boeing (BA) closed just below a buy point, offsetting another dip by fellow Dow titan Apple (AAPL), which is still in buy range.XS&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.1% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.1% against fair value while Dow futures rose nearly 0.1%.

328,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings' (PYPL) relationship with former parent eBay (EBAY) bears watching, says Morgan Stanley, which upped its price target on the e-commerce stock but maintained an equal-weight rating.Analyst James Faucette on Tuesday bumped his price target on PayPal to 62 from 49. PayPal climbed 1.1% to close at 59.69 on the stock market today. Shares in PayPal are up 50% in 2017.Since it was spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.EBay's online marketplace still uses PayPal for processing payments. According to Faucette, eBay represented 22% of PayPal's 2016 revenue and ""likely a higher percentage of profit.""""PayPal's preferential relationship with eBay is scheduled to end in 2020, with eBay able to experiment with new payment structure from 2018. We think it is probably safe to assume that there will be some (earnings) drag as the end of that agreement approaches,"" Faucette said in a note to clients. ""However, for now, our assumption is that any changes would serve to slow pricing and margin expansion rather than causing measurable negative impact. However, a worse case than we currently build in is certainly a possibility and a key source of investor concern.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal shares have remained well above their 50-day moving average since breaking out in April. The stock holds a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and continues to surge. It's now the No. 1-ranked stock in its group.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online checkout deals with credit card firms Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).  PayPal announced in June that consumers will be able to use their PayPal account for purchases across Apple (AAPL) platforms.""With nearly 100% revenue exposure to e-commerce, a big online acceptance lead and good exposure to cross-border consumer spending, (PayPal) has significant industry tailwinds,"" added Faucette.RELATED:BitAuto Earnings Cruise Past Estimates, Guidance StrongHow Google And Others Could Be Profit Machines For AppleComcast Could Partner With Altice To Acquire Charter, Says Citigroup

331,PYPL,"It may seem a bit far out — plans to send humans on a roughly seven-month, 34-million-mile ride to Mars, all for the privilege of standing where temperatures can get to 100 degrees below zero.XBut colonizing Mars is a central reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (TSLA),  founded his rocket-ship company SpaceX 15 years ago. Musk, who spends equal time between Tesla and SpaceX, is one of four billionaires who are using their fortunes to fulfill a passion for space exploration and tourism.The four have attracted a fleet of venture capitalists, big corporations and other investors into a private-sector space race of sorts. They imagine a world where entrepreneurs can create business opportunities in space that include galaxies of small satellites controlling gadgets on the ground and initiatives to send humans on thrill rides to the moon, all outside the reach of government budget battles and a fickle voting public. Musk has said many times that the ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make Earth's population a space-faring society.SpaceX, based in Los Angeles County, already has taken a step into the heavens, ferrying supplies to the International Space Station. It's keeping an eye on further commercial exploration of the final frontier.""It's a fantastic time to be in the industry,"" said Carissa Bryce Christensen, founder of Bryce Space and Technology, a research and consulting firm for space and satellite industries.Startup space ventures have attracted more than $16.6 billion in investments since 2000, Christensen says. That money has funded 140 new companies, two-thirds of them in the last five years and most of them in the satellite business, she adds. Last year alone, $2.8 billion was pumped into 43 startup space ventures.""Musk changed the narrative, transforming the way people think and talk about space technology in a very inspirational way,"" Christensen said.Other billionaires doing business in the great beyond include Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, who established Blue Origin 16 years ago to make rocket ships for space tourism and science missions. Bezos recently said he sells about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen has Stratolaunch Systems, which he co-founded to build the world's largest aircraft by wingspan, able to carry rockets to the edge of space to deliver small satellites into orbit. It has a partnership with Orbital ATK (OA).And Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is another space enthusiast. His company, Virgin Galactic, aims to be ready to launch its first passengers on thrill rides to suborbital space later this year. The cost per seat? $250,000. The spacecraft seats six with a two-person crew. Science missions are also planned.Musk, Bezos, Branson and Allen have brought back to life a U.S. space business that was demoralized by the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, Christensen says. Of the four, Musk has done the most to demonstrate an economic case for space, enticing previously reluctant venture capitalists to invest billions in the commercial transports outside the stratosphere.Musk founded SpaceX with $100 million of his own money, acquired from the sale of PayPal (PYPL), which he co-founded, to eBay (EBAY) for $1.4 billion. SpaceX now has a private-sector valuation of about $12 billion and holds multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and deliver astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX also has extensive contracts to launch commercial satellites.Bezos' Blue Origin has made several test flights of its rocket, New Shepard, which is designed as a reusable spacecraft for space tourism that will fly passengers to the edge of space, about 62 miles high. It has made several successful launches but has not yet begun commercial operations.Blue Origin is building another rocket ship, called New Glenn, that it says will be taller and more powerful than the biggest rocket in development by SpaceX, the Falcon Heavy. The company's rockets are named after two of the original seven NASA Mercury astronauts, Alan Shepard and John Glenn.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. New products or services are what ultimately generates stellar profitability. None of the four billionaire-founded space startups in this article trades publicly, but you can scroll our IBD 50 list of top stocks to discover other innovative companies. Bezos made billions from his creation of Amazon, which he has used to self-fund most of Blue Origin. He's pumped an estimated $1 billion in Blue Origin. In 2015, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX.SpaceX initially fueled the jump in space activity by pushing down the cost of rocket launches. That put the ability to catch a ride to space well within the reach of entrepreneurs to create various commercial space operations.Phillip Spector, counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, says lowering the cost of space access was critical for commercial expansion. Before joining Milbank, Spector was executive vice president of business development and general counsel at Intelsat (I), one of the largest satellite operators worldwide.At Intelsat, ""The biggest issue we faced was around launch, the pricing for launch and availability. There were not enough suppliers,"" Spector said. ""The addition of competition from SpaceX was very welcome.""Investors have yet to benefit from this new wave of enthusiasm.Shares of many large space companies and government contractors have long traded on the public markets, including Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Orbital ATK, Harris Corp. (HRS), ViaSat (VSAT) and Orbcomm (ORBC). Boeing and Lockheed Martin have a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance that provides spacecraft launch services and competes against SpaceX.But there has yet to be a high-profile IPO from the crop of startup companies now flooding the market. The company best positioned for a possible IPO is SpaceX, which would undoubtedly draw widespread attention. But SpaceX recently shot down rumors that a public stock offering was in the planning.""Musk has been clear about not wanting to take SpaceX public,"" said Spector. ""We're not seeing a rush to IPOs among space companies out here today. I don't see Bezos or Branson having the need to take their company public.""But that hasn't stopped the chunks of money flowing into the market.""The funding environment for startup companies is robust,"" said Spector.Startup companies have focused on a number of narrow business models. One is building and launching fleets of small satellites to circle the Earth in a low orbit.They're using the satellites to study agriculture trends, track ships, produce high-frequency weather reports and study water pollution patterns, among other things. There's also a big market in the making with the advent of what's called the Internet of Things, which includes machine-to-machine communication.""These startups are doing some truly innovative things, using off-the-shelf technology and getting near the performance of assets that were 10 times the cost,"" said Dara Panahy, a Milbank partner who represents clients in aerospace and communications. ""That is a real game-changer.""Then there are massive projects such as OneWeb, which plans to launch the first of 700 satellites next year to provide high-speed internet and other communication services. Partners in the OneWeb venture include Branson, Qualcomm (QCOM), SoftBank (SFTBY), Airbus (EADSY) and Coca-Cola (KO). Investors plowed $1.2 billion into OneWeb in 2016.""The market has matured and grown and, along with some of the other enabling technologies, that lowered barriers to getting into space,"" said Panahy. ""So now you have true venture-capital-funded startups and angel-funded startups that can now launch on maybe less than $100,000.""That compares with launches in the tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases today.Among the space startups is Rocket Lab, which has developed a rocket from scratch that's designed for frequent launches to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab had the first test of its rocket, called Electron, in May. It plans to conduct two more test flights in 2017 and launch customer payloads next year.At full production, Rocket Lab expects to launch more than 50 times a year. In comparison, last year saw 22 launches from the U.S. and 82 internationally, according to Rocket Lab.Acquisitions have helped draw venture capital. They're the primary way VCs get a return on investment. Fifteen space-related companies have been acquired for a total value of $3.2 billion since 2000, demonstrating a return on investment that venture capitalists want to see.Among the acquisitions, Europe-based satellite operator SES paid $703 million to buy the other half of a company called O3b it didn't already own. O3b is a big player in the small-satellite communication field.Another startup is Planet, a maker of small satellites, with about 100 now in orbit, some about the size of a shoe box. Planet, previously known as Planet Labs, can image the whole Earth every 24 hours, providing data that can be used to solve commercial, environmental and humanitarian challenges.RELATED: In Jeff Bezos-Elon Musk Space Race, Score One For Amazon's BezosSpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskSpaceX Jumps Aboard Space Tourism With Planned Moon Flight For TwoBezos To Launch Blue Origin Rockets At Cape Canaveral

341,PYPL,"""Buy now"" with one click.Online shoppers know the payment tool well. It's a good example of how innovating in digital payments can take a company and its stock a long way. XJust ask founder Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com (AMZN), whose shares have approached the 1,100 mark.Other digital-payment players — think PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Square (SQ), and hot startup Stripe — also make it easier for merchants to nail down purchases, whether shoppers are on a PC, using a smartphone or in a store. PayPal and Square have shined in 2017, with their stocks climbing 50% and 92%, respectively, for the year vs. a gain of 10% for the S&P 500.Innovation in digital payments is making cash and checks go away and someday may even eliminate plastic credit cards. As technology evolves, a battle is raging to draw in merchants to payment ecosystems, along with billions of dollars in transaction fees.Payment processors are wooing merchants with new software-based sales tools and website services and, in some cases, cash loans to grow their businesses.""Anything a merchant can do to reduce the amount of friction in the transaction has an immediate effect on the top line, in terms of incremental sales, and the bottom line, in terms of lower transaction costs,"" said Thad Peterson, analyst at Aite Group.IBD'S TAKE: Keep an eye on credit card and payment-processing stocks, which have risen in weeks to rank 31st in price performance among 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. A leader in the group, PayPal's stock climbed to a record high after earnings. Use the IBD Stock Checkup to see how PayPal and other stocks stack up on crucial fundamental and technical measures.But competition is fierce in the crowded digital-payment industry, with well-funded startups challenging corporate giants from the credit card, e-commerce and consumer electronic fields. It's a tight-margin business, but huge.Online payment processors generally garner around 2.9% of a transaction value plus a 30-cent fee from merchants. They may pay partners, such as banks, to use their systems. ""It has to be a scale (volume) business to make it work,"" said Peterson.The good news is that e-commerce is booming. Global e-commerce sales will jump to $4 trillion by 2020, up from $2.35 trillion in 2017, accounting for nearly 15% of all retail spending worldwide, says research firm eMarketer.Competition is about to get even rougher.Amazon's U.S. patent for 1-Click technology, which stores payment and shipping information, expires in mid-September. When that happens, analysts say Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to jump in with their own versions of the technology, intensifying the battle for merchants. While the credit card networks offer their own speedy online payment systems, such as Visa Checkout, they still require a user name and password to complete a transaction, while 1-Click does not.Amazon grew into an e-commerce giant by leveraging its 1-Click technology, rolled out in 1997. Apple (AAPL) licensed 1-Click for its app store, paying Amazon for the friction-free payment option.Keep Up With Stocks Near A Buy Zone At IBDMore recently, Amazon has been using 1-Click to attract merchants to its payments platform. If online shoppers log in to their Amazon accounts at third-party websites, 1-Click speeds up the checkout process. Partners include luxury retailer Moda Operandi, Nine West and L'Occitane.Amazon in February announced that 33 million consumers are using its payments service at both its site and third-party sites, up from 23 million a year earlier. That still trails PayPal's 210 million active customer accounts worldwide. Amazon reported earnings late Thursday and fell far short on earnings views due to high expenses.As digital-payment rivals target merchants, they're tapping a new tool — loans. Banks have stepped back from lending to small businesses since the 2008 recession. But Amazon, Square and PayPal have expanded their lending. Shopify (SHOP), a provider of e-commerce platforms that uses Stripe technology, has jumped into the lending game, too.Amazon in early June said its lending to small businesses has topped $3 billion, including $1 billion in loans over the last 12 months. Some 20,000 small businesses have received loans ranging from $1,000 to $750,000. Amazon uses internal data to identify creditworthy clients.PayPal in May announced that it has issued more than $3 billion in loans to 115,000 businesses globally since 2013. Square's lending has topped $1.5 billion over three years.One weapon that Square has been able to wield is making credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. That enables Square to drill down deeply into the small-business realm by targeting ""micro-merchants"" — very small entities that may not have accepted credit cards previously. A handyman, lunch-truck operator or masseuse might be among them.Square in March unveiled a new platform enabling its retail customers to process payments on custom websites, getting into competition with Stripe and PayPal. Jordan McKee, analyst at 451 Research, says payment processors aim to add higher-margin products.""Everyone wants to be a solutions provider,"" said McKee. ""The payments space is difficult. Margins are very slim. It's a game of scale. These companies are using payment processing as a linchpin to offer software-based services with higher margins that are sticky.""""Payments is a hard business to make money in. But if you can offer software with monthly fees and get recurring revenue then you build a bigger business,"" he added.What companies will find long-term success? It's hard to say, but here's a snapshot of new developments involving three big digital-payment players that illustrate the industry stakes, strategies and ambitions.The iPhone maker says Apple Pay, the mobile payments service rolled out in 2014, is on track to be accepted at 50% of U.S. retailers by year-end. ""It's a commendable milestone but pales in comparison to the ubiquity of Visa and MasterCard in physical stores and PayPal (online) acceptance,"" said Josh Beck, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst in a report. Loup Ventures says only 13% of Apple's 680 million iPhone users have activated Apple Pay.Apple launched its first large-scale marketing campaign targeting mainland China in late July, notes research firm Analysys Mason. Apple has lagged in gaining traction vs. local mobile payment incumbents, Alipay and WeChat.Looking to gain traction with millennials, Apple in June introduced a rival to PayPal's Venmo and Square Cash, both person-to-person payment systems. Consumers link a bank account to a smartphone app and send money to friends or family using an email address.While the money-transfer services are mostly free for consumers, PayPal and Apple see the apps as acquisition and engagement tools. PayPal also aims to get fees from merchants that accept the money transfers as payment.The San Francisco-based startup maintains it has no plans to go public, despite speculation that it could pull the trigger next year. Stripe's latest funding round in December gave it a whopping $9.2 billion valuation. In all, Stripe has raised $440 million.Investors include American Express (AXP) as well as Visa, which has placed multiple online- and mobile-shopping bets, also investing in Sweden's Klarna and Square.Stripe's software enables companies to accept and track online payments made via credit or debit cards as well as smartphone apps and cyber-currencies such as Bitcoin. Stripe's customers build its tools into their own apps and websites. The tools help businesses bypass complex relationships with banks and older payment providers.Stripe's technology lets companies focus on their products rather than back-end payment processing. Customers include Salesforce.com (CRM), Uber-rival Lyft and Target (TGT). Stripe's closest rivals are PayPal's Braintree unit and Dutch startup Adyen.""Braintree and Stripe are similar animals,"" said Aite's Peterson. ""They take the payment processing load off of a merchant along with the risk. Both of them need to find ways to add value, to broaden their platform.""Stripe on July 10 unveiled a partnership with Alipay, part of Alibaba Group (BABA), and WeChat, part of Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), two of China's biggest digital-payment services. The deal gives Stripe access to hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.Amid worries over competition from Apple, Amazon, and Stripe, PayPal has nonetheless raised 2017 revenue guidance and its three-year revenue outlook. Since spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.PayPal in February said one-third of all its transactions are now mobile while three-fourths of the top 100 online retailers accept PayPal. PayPal has forged new alliances with Visa, Mastercard, Google and Facebook (FB).Apple has also warmed up to PayPal. PayPal announced in early July that consumers in North America, Australia, Israel and seven European nations will be able to use their PayPal accounts for purchases across Apple platforms, including the App Store, Apple Music and iTunes.A deal with Amazon remains elusive.""Convincing Amazon to accept PayPal seems unlikely given it already has its own payments-tender type, its own private-label card, and it recently added a staged-wallet feature for Prime members, which we see as a direct threat to PayPal,"" said Thomas McCrohan, a Mizuho Securities analyst in a June 27 report. Pacific Crest Securities says PayPal could be a takeover target of several companies, though nothing seems imminent.More In-Depth AnalysisSmart Ideas In Artificial Intelligence And Early Investing Hot SpotsHere's One More Thing Amazon Is KillingFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru

Shares of Twitter had been on the comeback trail in recent months, rising almost 50% from their mid-April lows.Meanwhile, analyst firm Summit Redstone called the competition between Facebook and Snap ""no contest"" in Facebook's favor, due to Facebook's increasing pricing power with respect to ad prices.

Analysts estimate that PayPal will earn 43 cents per share, up 19% from a year earlier, with revenue rising 16.7% to $3.09 billion.""PayPal's recent momentum has investors wondering what exactly is baked in,"" Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said in a note to clients. ""Investors don't seem to expect massive blowout results, and instead are focused on key levers that can deliver upside.Faucette has an equal-weight rating on the stock.At Jefferies, analyst Ramsey El-Assal said in a note: ""Given elevated investor expectations going into Q2 earnings, this quarter has less catalyst potential than last.""Shares in PayPal edged up 0.8% near 58.75 in premarket trades on the stock market today.Since it was spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online check-out to mobile payments.Like Amazon.com (AMZN), analysts expect PayPal to gain as consumers shift to online shopping.Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar says other second-quarter metrics investors will be watching include user growth and total payment volume. PayPal had 203 million active consumer accounts as of March 31, up from 197 million in the previous quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Which companies are hitting 52-week highs? That easy to find at IBD's New Highs, but that list goes one big step better. That is, it ranks the companies making new highs by Composite Rating. So the best are at the top, making this a quick and easy read to find stocks for your watch list.PayPal announced in June that consumers will be able to use their PayPal account for purchases across Apple (AAPL) platforms.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online checkout deals with credit card firms Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA).Analysts have been looking for an update on PayPal's ""asset-light"" strategy.

346,PYPL,"Apple (AAPL) initially fell more than 1% Monday but trimmed its losses to around 0.6% at 156.70 as the major indexes continued to avoid an eclipse of their strong year-to-date gains.XBy late afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 were nearly break-even, while the Nasdaq composite limited its loss to 0.2%. The Nasdaq 100 was also off 0.2% and is trying to stay near its flattening 50-day moving average.Volume was running sharply lower on both main exchanges; Friday saw the expiration of weekly and monthly equity and index options.Apple on Aug. 2 cleared a 156.75 flat-base entry and only has gained roughly 3.7%. As seen on a daily chart, the stock has shown zigzagging action, briefly slipping below the proper entry three times already. However, no sell signal has triggered for now.At 156.68, shares are just 3% below the all-time peak of 162.51, while small-cap indexes have dipped more. The S&P SmallCap 600, off 0.1%, has fallen 6% below its all-time peak of 878.At 5779, the Nasdaq 100 is up 18.8% since Jan. 1, far outstripping the S&P 500's 8.4% lift.Losing stocks are edging out winners on the Nasdaq by a 4-to-3 margin. But on the NYSE, advancers are leading decliners by a slim margin of fewer than 100 issues.As e-commerce activity does not show signs of letting up anytime soon, at least five top operators in the retailing space have fallen much more than the major equity benchmarks. All but one have triggered new sell signals.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) continued to fade, sinking nearly 4% to 235.49. The cosmetics and hair care products chain has broken through support at the 200-day moving average near 270 and failed to lift back above the long-term support line. Notice, too, how the stock's 50-day moving average has crossed below the 200-day line. That's bearish.Wall Street expects July-ended fiscal Q3 earnings rising 24% to $1.78 a share. That's a decent gain, but a little shy of the 25% increase one would expect from a CAN SLIM market leader. Plus, it would mark a considerable slowdown from EPS gains of 26%, 33% and 41% in the prior three quarters.Target (TGT) (18 Relative Price Strength) is trying to bottom out after falling as much as 17.6% in the past three months. Check out the week ended July 28, when the giant discount chain fell hard during the week but ended it with a solid 1% gain in sharply higher gain. Such reversals at the bottom of a stock's decline are bullish.But Target, which still depends a lot on consumers to visit their stores to keep sales flowing, needs to rise back above the 40-week moving average (roughly equivalent to a 200-day moving average on a daily chart) to show that institutional investors are seriously accumulating shares. For now, Target is just 11% below the 52-week high.Target is forecast to grow FY 2018 earnings by 11% to $3.92 a share. But the 1.8% annualized dividend yield is inferior to the S&P 500 (around 1.9%).Home Depot (HD), the biggest gainer in the 30-stock Dow, rose more than 1.3% to 149.62 and is currently forming a new base. It recently posted a 14% EPS increase for the second quarter, marking a 14th quarter in a row of double-digit earnings-per-share growth.The IBD Big Cap 20 doesn't currently hold any traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. However, consumer-oriented firms help pack the list, including Mastercard (MA), PayPal (PYPL), energy drink marketer Monster Beverage (MNST) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL).Michael Kors (KORS) and Five Below (FIVE) are trying to buck the general sell-off in the apparel and discount retail sectors, respectively.Michael Kors, famous for its jet set-styled handbags and clothing, may be working on a new bottoming-base pattern, which would be first stage. The stock had collapsed more than 60% from a February 2014 peak near 101. But shares are now up more than 15% in August so far and are on track for a third monthly advance. Quiet action from here would possibly yield a new buy point near recent upside resistance, at 46.Kors' Q2 profit dropped 11% to 80 cents a share, but that was a far smaller decline than viewed. Sales fell 4% to $952.4 million, marking a fourth quarter in a row of shrinking sales.Five Below, which sells toys, accessories and clothing for $5 each or less, rallied more than 3% to 48.58. A cup-with-handle base is forming. For now, the Philadelphia-based retailer shows a legitimate entry of 51.62, 10 cents above the two-week handle's high. The base barely passes the midpoint test (handle's midpoint is 49.29, base midpoint 49.21).Five Below holds a decent Composite Rating of 87 on a scale of 1 to 99 from Stock Checkup, second only to group peer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI). Five Below shows an excellent A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + ROE) but the 54 RS Rating needs more work.RELATED:Here Is The Easy And Fast Way To Spot Major Market Tops Before Stocks CrashIBD Sector Leaders: Why YY Is Leading The Market, Fundamentals And Technicals-WiseStocks Near A Buy ZoneThe Best Large Cap Growth Firms Today: Inside Big Cap 20

349,PYPL,"If there was an exchange traded fund for FANG stocks, this one might be it.XFirst Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN) counts the four FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — among its six largest holdings. That's more than 30% of the fund's weighting in just those four stocks.FANG is the acronym for four companies that dominate the internet industry. Their shares have been a focal point of this year's strength in internet and other technology sectors, especially the big caps.Although the four stocks have had success this year, their charts at this point are uncertain. Alphabet is trading in the lower parts of a base it's forming. Netflix gapped up sharply July 18 on earnings, but has erased most gains. Amazon is drifting below its 50-day moving average. Facebook is holding up better, still near its highs.The fund started trading in June 2006, long before FANG became an investor buzzword. It's had good long-term performance, with shares rising 7% last year, 21.7% in 2015, 2.4% in 2014, 53.6% in 2013 and 20.7% in 2012, according to Morningstar.com.To be in the fund's underlying index, companies must earn at least 50% of annual sales from the internet. They must also have a three-month average market cap of at least $100 million, and certain liquidity requirements. Stocks are picked using a combination of market capitalization and average share volume, according to the First Trust website.First Trust Dow Jones Internet has more than 40 holdings. Other major components are electronic payments leader PayPal (PYPL), cloud-based business software firm Salesforce.com (CRM) and e-commerce pioneer eBay (EBAY).Of course, the well-known internet brands such as Twitter (TWTR), Expedia (EXPE) and Groupon (GRPN) are also in the ETF.Not all are in the technology sector. Online brokers E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD), as well as health care technology company Veeva Systems (VEEV) are in the portfolio.First Trust Internet's shares are testing support after pulling back to the 50-day moving average. A good bounce from the line would put the ETF in a buy area. Shares already are near the 98.18 buy point of a flat base from a breakout about a month ago. But market risk is higher than normal right now, and that applies even to a diversified investment such as an ETF.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

350,PYPL,"Fidelity National Information Services (FIS)and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) could figure in as buyers during the next round of mergers in the payment processing industry, says one analyst.XStifel analyst John Davis says Fidelity could acquire Total System Services (TSS) while PayPal looms as a buyer of Netherlands-based Adyen, though other companies could jump in.""We believe a bidding war could break out for private European e-commerce merchant acquirer Adyen next year,"" said Davis in a report. ""While we expect PayPal to be the ultimate acquirer given its significant funding advantage, we wouldn't completely count out Global Payments (GPN) or someone out of left field (like Google-owned Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN)).""Vantiv on July 5 agreed to buy British payment processing company Worldpay Group in a stock-and-cash deal worth about $10 billion. That deal has sparked more merger speculation. French payments specialist Ingenico last week agreed to buy Stockholm-based rival Bambora from Nordic Capital for $1.5 billion.""We think the deal that makes the most sense would be (Fidelity) acquiring Total System Services given the significant potential accretion coupled with the undeniable strategic and cultural fit,"" said Davis in the report. ""We believe strategically it is a home run as it would give (Fidelity) significant scale in issuer credit processing as well as afford the company entrance into the faster growing, higher multiple merchant acquiring business.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is up 48% in 2017 and is extended following the run-up. Global Payments, Total System Services and Square all have a Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, in the high 90s out of a possible 99.

351,PYPL,"JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) is barreling down the fast lane. Manager Giri Devulapally's fuel? Lots of financial and technology stocks, including Morgan Stanley (MS), Mastercard (MA) and Applied Materials (AMAT).X (IBD)And amid a Friday rally by the broad market as of midday, key fund holdings are rising too.Chip gear maker Applied Materials was up 2.92%. Internet television network Netflix (NFLX) was up 1.77%. Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN), maker of the Eylea macular degeneration eye treatment, was up 1.35%. Consumer electronics colossus Apple (AAPL) was up 0.84%. And credit card provider Visa (V) was up 0.69%.The $12.5 billion fund was up 23.04% this year going into Friday, topping 94% of its large-cap growth fund peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 15.66%. The S&P 500 was up 9.96%. The mutual fund's 23.23% gain the past 12 months topped 96% of its peers as well as the S&P 500.How has the fund achieved such eye-popping gains? It starts with the fund's investment approach. Fund literature boils it down to: ""Targeting companies with large markets, sustainable competitive advantages and strong price momentum, the Large Cap Growth Fund seeks to harness the return potential of America's fastest-growing companies.""The fund is rare in its naming strong price momentum as a trait sought in stocks and indicates acknowledgement that technical analysis plays an important role in its stock selection.Financials and tech were JPMorgan Large Cap Growth's largest sector overweights as of June 30 vs. its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.Devulapally recently told shareholders that among financials he still has ""a positive view on companies with exposure to capital markets and interest rates."" His information technology overweight, he added, ""continues to be driven by a variety of industries, such as payments, semiconductors, video games, software and mobility.""That outlook has led Devulapally's fund to such holdings as money-center bank Morgan Stanley. The stock is up 9% so far this year.Brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW), up 1% this year, benefits from the float on customers' cash. Float is profit on cash between the time a customer authorizes disbursement and when the cash actually leaves the account. Rising interest rates lift the profit on float.In the tech stock grouping, credit payment processor Mastercard is up 28% this year. Chip gear maker Applied Materials is up 38%.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA), another member of the IBD 50, is up 49% this year. Earnings per share grew 40%, 70% and 343% the past three quarters. That's a nice rally from the prior two quarters, in which EPS fell.In the software space, digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) vaulted past Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal second quarter on June 20, reporting accelerating sales and earnings growth for the period. It also guided analysts higher for Q3. EPS grew 45%, 42% and 44% the past three stanzas.Its digital media segment provided 68% of total corporate Q2 revenue.And online payment processor PayPal (PYPL), an IBD 50 stock, is up 51% this year.Among other holdings, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) has an IBD Composite Rating of 98.Share price has soared 104% this year. Strong data for a triple-pill to treat the underlying genetic mutations tied to cystic fibrosis have been a key driver of the stock. The biotech company expects to spend more in research and development costs for the year as it continues development of its triple-pill.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), yet another member of the IBD 50, benefits from the shift toward more use of graphics processing units, away from regular CPU computer chips, because of their faster processing speeds in applications such as gaming, artificial intelligence and self-driving cars.EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in four of the past five quarters.Nvidia is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It earned that spot in part by posting a 56% jump in sales last quarter and a 27.6% annual pretax margin. You can compare its other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.What else does the fund have going for it? Large-cap stock mutual funds have outperformed other U.S. diversified stock fund categories over the past six and 12 months as well as the past two, three and five years. Reflecting this fund's commitment to large-cap stocks, it owns four Dow Jones Industrial stocks: Visa, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple and Home Depot (HD).Visa, which is also one of the fund's payments stocks, is up 32% this year.Software titan Microsoft is up 17% this year.IPhone maker Apple, up 37% this year, is another one of Devulapally's mobility stocks.Home improvement retailer Home Depot fell nearly 3% on Tuesday. The company reported Q2 results that beat Wall Street expectations.

357,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) stocks have been on a roll, and now a Loop Capital analyst says it would be a good idea if the two digital payment companies merge.XPayPal's Venmo person-to-person payments system would get a boost from Square's merchant relationships, Loop Capital says.Square stock popped 6.3% to 25.44 on the stock market today, clearing a 25.07 buy point. PayPal shares edged down 0.3% to 54.76 after flirting with a 55.23 buy point for a second straight session. Square stock is up more than 80% in 2017 while PayPal has gained 39%.""PayPal's strategic objectives over the next several years should be to maximize Venmo monetization opportunities, extend PayPal's reach in brick-and-mortar retailers, and stem transaction margin deterioration,"" Loop Capital analyst Joseph Vafi said in a report. ""The acquisition of Square helps check the boxes. Such an acquisition also fits with PayPal's vision of transforming itself into a true, two-sided network. Timing-wise, such a deal makes more sense now that Square is pro-forma profitable.""Vafi added that PayPal can offer a 30% premium for Square without overstretching its balance sheet.Since spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments. PayPal stock is up sharply in 2017, despite worries over competition from Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and startup Stripe.San Francisco-based Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. While Square's primary customers are small businesses, it's attracting bigger customers, analysts say. Square has expanded into financing loans to small businesses.IBD'S TAKE: Square on Tuesday was added to IBD's Swing Trader list, where the CAN SLIM strategy is employed for quick hits — most trades will last five to 10 days, with a goal of a 10% profit and any loss capped at about 3%. ""With millions of active merchants, Square's customer base makes for a tantalizing monetization opportunity for Venmo,"" Vafi said. ""Many of Square's core SMB merchants should be open to accepting Venmo, given it provides access to one of the fastest growing sources of payments around. Merchants could even be incentivized to offer 'Pay With Venmo' while transactions would still be accretive to PayPal's overall transaction margin. Technologically, turning on Venmo would not be difficult, as Square is already integrated with PayPal.""Apple last month introduced a rival to PayPal's Venmo.RELATED:This Hot Payment Stock Flirts With Breakout As 3 Peers Forge Buy Points

Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled after fiscal-Q3 same-store sales and revenue missed; EPS matched views. The coffee chain said it would close all 379 Teavana retail stores.Several industrial Dow giants rolled past Q2 estimates Tuesday thanks in part to improved global growth. Caterpillar (CAT) surged to a 52-week high after the company saw EPS of $1.49, up 36.7%, on revenue of $11.33 billion, up 9.6%. United Technologies (UTX) saw earnings climb 1.6% to $1.85 per share on a 2.7% revenue rise to $15.28 billion. Shares tumbled to their lowest level since May despite raised full-year EPS and revenue guidance. DuPont (DD) also beat on the top and bottom lines. Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure. Proofpoint rose modestly Friday morning. Fortinet (FTNT) posted mixed Q2 results that beat on EPS and revenue, but billings growth disappointed. The outlook for providers of computer-security software has yet to improve despite recent  ransomware attacks. Fortinet shares tumbled.TAL Education (TAL) topped earnings and sales estimates, as per-share profit of 43 cents and revenue of $321.9 million came out ahead of forecasts for 28 cents and $307.8 million. For the current quarter, the China-based education company sees revenue of $428.4 million to $433.8 million, above views for $424.8 million, per Yahoo Finance estimates. Meanwhile, peer New Oriental Education (EDU) also pulled ahead of forecasts with 41 cents EPS and $486.4 million, in addition to a 36.9% bump in total student enrollments; the midpoint of Q1 revenue guidance pulled just ahead of current views. TAL and New Oriental shares rose 4.8% and 0.9%, respectively,  but the latter's breakout failed Thursday.Mastercard (MA) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue. Shares reversed modestly lower from a record high but remained in buy range.Baidu (BIDU) earnings rose 143%, well over views, while revenue climbed 14% to an in-line $3.08 billion. Shares of the Chinese search giant rose 9.45% on Friday.Electronic Arts (EA) reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, but the video game publisher gave cautious revenue guidance. EA shares rose Friday after briefly falling below a recent buy point.
"
375,PYPL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and especially the Nasdaq 100 rallied early Thursday, fueled by Facebook (FB) rallying late on its strong Q2 earnings. Facebook's fellow FANG stock Amazon.com (AMZN) is on tap Thursday evening, with Amazon shares currently in buy range. Electronic Arts (EA), Baidu (BIDU) and Mastercard (MA) also are in buy zones with earnings set for Thursday.XAmazon, Electronic Arts and Mastercard all have stellar Composite Ratings of 95 or above, while Baidu's is a solid 83. But three of the four stocks have already moved into the upper half of their 5% chase zones, with Amazon's chart offering additional reasons to be wary.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.55%, with Facebook trading 4% higher in the after-hours session. PayPal (PYPL) and Lam Research (LRCX) also contributed with after-hours earnings gains. Futures for the Dow industrials ticked 0.1% higher.All eyes will be on the e-commerce giant Thursday. Economists expect a 21% earnings per share drop to $1.40, with revenue up 22% to $37.214 billion.Amazon apparently had a successful Prime Day on July 10, with big sales of its Alexa-enabled Echo speakers as well as new Prime memberships. But those won't be included in Q2's results.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Amazon rose 1.2% to 1,052.80 in Wednesday stock market trading. That's above a 1,016.60 flat-base buy point. The 5% chase zone rises to 1,067.43, so Amazon is still buyable. However, it's always better to buy as close to the entry point as possible to minimize the potential losses. Amazon is 3.6% above the entry as of Wednesday, and was trading at 1,061.50 in premarket trading.Meanwhile, Amazon cleared a fourth-stage base. Late-stage patterns are more prone to failure. Also, Amazon's breakout came on lackluster volume.On the upside, Amazon's relative strength line is at new highs, a bullish sign and reflecting the stock's outperformance of the S&P 500.Amazon has a 98 Composite Rating, which means it outperforms 98% of all stocks based on a variety of fundamental criteria. Big stock winners often have 95+ Composite Ratings near the start of their big runs.The Chinese search giant has struggled in recent quarters, especially in comparison to many other Chinese internet giants. Baidu is making a big throw on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. In the meantime, analysts expect Baidu to report Q2 EPS of $1.42, up 16%, on revenue of $2.78 billion, up 1%.Baidu climbed 2.1% to 201.17 on Wednesday. The stock was still within buy range from a cup base at a 193.84 entry, though it's nearly 4% above that point. You could also view Baidu as being within a pattern going back into 2016, but the buy point would remain the same.Baidu has the opposite problem of Amazon. Baidu is in a first-stage base, but because the stock has largely gone sideways over the past year, its relative strength line is lagging.Electronic Arts is expected to report EPS of 28 cents, up 300% vs. a year earlier. Revenue should climb 12% to $766 million.The video game publisher's stock broke out on Wednesday, rising 3.8% to 118, clearing a 116.14 flat-base buy point with volume that was 41% above normal. Electronic Arts has a 95 Composite Rating and a strong RS line.Activision Blizzard (ATVI) is at new-high ground, while Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) cleared an entry point on Tuesday.Mastercard reports before the market open. Analysts expect an 8% EPS gain to $1.04 with revenue up 10.5% to $2.978 billion.Mastercard rose 0.8% to 130.99, its 14th straight gain, mostly in small doses. The stock cleared a flat-base entry of 126.29 on July 14 and is now 3.7% above that level. Mastercard has had a few above-average-volume days in its breakout move, but not many.Visa (V) and American Express (AXP), which reported earnings last week, are in the upper end of buy ranges. PayPal, which topped views late Wednesday, and Square (SQ), are among the other recent stock breakouts in the finance-payment group, though they are both extended.RELATED:Facebook Earnings Soar; Users Hit New Milestone4 Big Earnings You Can't Miss Thursday: Investing Action PlanVideo Game, Chip Stocks Climb To New Buy PointsHere's What Analysts Are Saying About Amazon Ahead Of Earnings

376,PYPL,"Stocks rattled off solid gains at Wednesday's open as the market hauled in a large dose of positive early earnings news and oil prices continued their recent rebound.XThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 0.4%, the S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite scaled up 0.2%, enough to knock out a new high.Investor attention will be spread thin Wednesday, a powerhouse session for big-name earnings reports ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement and an after-hours session in which quarterly results are due from Facebook (FB), PayPal (PYPL) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW), among others.The Federal Open Market Committee wraps up its two-day meeting today in Washington, D.C., with a policy announcement this afternoon at 2 p.m. ET. Expectations are low for any sort of material change in policy following last month's rate hike, but the release will be closely scanned for any hint of future hikes, and particularly for any clue as to Fed action on beginning to reduce its $4.5 trillion bond debt amassed during its 2008-14 quantitative easing period.Other economic news for the day is light, with the release of June new home sales figures set for 10 a.m. ET from the Commerce Department. At 10:30 a.m. ET, the Energy Information Administration delivers its weekly oil inventories report.Oil prices climbed 1%, looking to add a third day to their recent bounce and lifting West Texas Intermediate back above $48 a barrel.The premarket session was buzzing on earnings news: AT&T (T) opened 4% higher, U.S. Steel (X) vaulted 10% and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) dropped 11%; Ford (F) fell 2%, following quarterly reports.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gapped up to an 11% gain after earnings accelerated into triple-digit growth and a 19% jump in revenue topped expectations. The strong volume move left shares extended above a 14.77 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) took a 7% stumble a the starting bell, after reporting second-quarter results late Tuesday. A 10% earnings gain and a 45% surge in revenue topped analyst estimates. The loss sent shares below their 10-week moving average in heavy trade, a sell signal.Boeing (BA) hauled the Dow higher, surging 6% after reporting earnings of $2.89 per share, up from a 44 cents per share loss a year ago. The stock is extended, and up 22% since clearing a flat base in early June.Dow peer Verizon (VZ) swung up up more than 1% ahead of its second-quarter report scheduled for early Thursday.Apple (AAPL) and all four of the FANG stocks traded higher in early action. Amazon.com (AMZN) and Netflix (NFLX) each rose more than 1%. Facebook opened with a 0.2% gain heading toward its second-quarter report after the close.Electronic components manufacturer Amphenol (APH) popped 2% in powerful trade, marking a breakout past a 76.77 buy point in a six-week flat base. The Wallingford, Conn.-based operation turned in a strong second-quarter earnings win, revenue also topped expectations and management ratcheted its third-quarter revenue and earnings guidance to above consensus views. Share remained in a buy range.Triumph Group (TGI) dived 15% at the open, after its second-quarter revenue and earnings missed forecasts. The stock had been advancing since May, attempting to climb out of a 27-month correction.RELATED:Futures: These 4 IBD 50 Stocks Report Earnings As Apple Nears BuyThe Big Picture: New Breakouts EmergeMcDonald's, TI And AMD Get Price Target Hikes; Electronic Arts Is A Buy
"
377,PYPL,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average edged higher early Wednesday ahead of a new wave of big earnings and the Federal Reserve's latest policy announcement.Strong results late Tuesday from Texas Instruments (TXN) and AT&T (T), are good news for Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem ahead of Apple's own earnings. Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are among four IBD 50 stocks with earnings due Wednesday, with Facebook providing further evidence that is beating back Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP).XThe Dow industrials rose 0.5% in Tuesday's regular session, led by earnings from Caterpillar (CAT) and McDonald's (MCD) as well as strength in financials. The Nasdaq composite, weighed down by Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), closed just above break-even, but did hit a new all-time high. The S&P 500 index rose 0.3% to a fresh record.Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, hit yet another record intraday low on Tuesday. VIX lows are a sign of investor complacency and often associated with at least short-term market tops.Still, S&P 500 and Dow futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value and Nasdaq 100 futures 0.2% as equities generally advanced across the globe. Crude oil prices continued to climb after big gains Tuesday.The Fed is not expected to make any policy changes Wednesday afternoon, though policymakers could surprise and announce a plan to let the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet start to decline. Most analysts see that shift happening at the September meeting.President Trump told the Wall Street Journal that Apple will build three plants in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before. Apple had no comment Tuesday. U.S. operations would ease political pressures, but would likely be more expensive. It's possible that Foxconn, a key assembler of iPhones, could set up some plant in America.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. That options strategy is highlighted in IBD's weekly Earnings Preview column.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments reported better-than-expected earnings late Tuesday and gave bullish guidance. Texas Instruments is big in automotive chips and many other segments, as well as in mobile devices like the Apple iPhone. But TI follows a beat-and-raise last week from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), another Apple iPhone chipmaker and an IBD 50 member.AT&T reported better-than-expected wireless subscriber figures, while churn hit a record low. That's a good sign for Apple iPhone sales during what could be a spring lull ahead of the iPhone 8 later this year. Relatively strong iPhone 7 demand is key, given the likelihood that the next-generation iPhone will be delayed.Apple shares edged higher in premarket trading. Apple closed up 0.4% to 152.73 in Tuesday's stock market trading. Apple is approaching a 156.75 flat-base buy point.Facebook, PayPal, Lam Research (LRCX) and Edwards Lifesciences (EW) are IBD 50 stocks reporting earnings on Wednesday. Also, Facebook, PayPal and Lam Research all boast a best-possible 99 Composite Rating, which means they outperform 99% of all other stocks based on proprietary fundamental and technical ratings. Big stock winners often have Composite Ratings of at least 95 near the start of their big price runs.Facebook will be the third FANG (Facebook, Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet) stock to report Q2 results, following Alphabet late Monday and Netflix last week. Amazon is set to close out FANG earnings on Thursday.Facebook will presumably provide some new figures about the growing popularity of Instagram Stories and other offerings that clone Snapchat features. But here's a stat that's already out. Since Snap's March 1 IPO, Facebook's market capitalization has increased by about $81 billion to $479 billion. Snap's market value has retreated to just $16.4 billion. So Facebook has added the equivalent of nearly five Snapchats in Snap's brief history as a public firm.Facebook dipped 0.4% to 165.28 in Tuesday stock market trading after hitting a fresh record high on Monday. Facebook is extended from any possible entry. Snap fell 1.35% to 13.89, hitting a new record low.PayPal dipped 0.55% to 58.26, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 55.24 flat-base buy point cleared earlier this month. The mobile payments firm expanded its reach via deals this month with Apple and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Chip-equipment maker Lam Research is in cup base just below a possible buy point. Edwards Lifesciences has fallen back below a buy point in a big cup-with-handle base, undercutting its 50-day line on Tuesday.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), D.R. Horton (DHI), ServiceNow (NOW) and Fortinet (FTNT) are among the many other top-rated stocks set to report earnings Wednesday.RELATED:Texas Instruments, AMD Beat Q2 Targets, Guide HigherAT&T Q2 Adjusted Profit Beats, Pay-TV Video Subscribers FallWill Facebook Earnings Support Its Strong Stock Growth?The Big Picture: Nasdaq Lags On Alphabet Loss, But Industrials, Financials LeadHow To Win With Growth Stocks Like Netflix, Nvidia During Earnings

378,PYPL,"Since Justin White took charge as portfolio manager of T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund (PRWAX) in April last year, the large-cap growth mutual fund has increasingly gained momentum. The strong performance has come even amid his stated aim to make the fund less volatile than it was before he took over the reins.Such is the power of a favorable stock market. Stocks in fast-growing areas — like Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL), all of which benefit from the explosion in internet use — have helped drive the fund to a 20.13% gain this year going into Wednesday, topping 94% of the fund's direct rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. and more than doubling the S&P 500's 9.13% return. On the flip side, in months when the market has lost ground over the past year, he has limited the fund's declines to less than 65% of the market's.Amazon is up 30% this year. Alphabet is up 20%. Facebook is up 31%. PayPal is up 34%. Amazon and Facebook were also top sells by the fund in its latest disclosure, a sign of profit-taking and/or portfolio rebalancing.Yet Amazon and Facebook were still top-10 holdings as of March 31. They and six more of the fund's top 10 had an IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating in the 80s or 90s. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.Amazon stock climbed most days after news of its Whole Foods Market (WFM) buyout bid broke. And last week Amazon's Comp Rating increased to 96 from 94.Portfolio newcomers also show promising Comp Ratings, which combine IBD's five performance ratings.

Software maker SS&C Technologies (SSNC) has earned a 98.Alibaba is an IBD Leaderboard stock as well as a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals. Its shares are trading around 142.As IBD reported recently, a Pacific Crest analyst has raised his price target on Alibaba to 160 from 137. The analyst said that technology initiatives and enhancements will drive new growth at the e-commerce giant.At an investor conference, Alibaba said it expects revenue to grow 45% to 49% this fiscal year, well above analysts' estimates of 37%.SS&C Technologies provides portfolio-management software for money managers. IBD has reported that some investors see the firm taking share from in-house software providers and other third parties. The company sold off last year at the height of investors' fear about a decline in hedge-fund growth. But it is up 32% this year.IBD'S TAKE: SS&C ranks No. 1 in IBD's Computer Software-Financial industry group. It has four straight years of annual growth in earnings per share. Its three-year sales growth rate is 33%. You can check out more of its fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.SS&C has benefited from fund-administration industry consolidation, company founder and CEO Bill Stone told IBD via email through a spokesperson.

It has four straight years of annual growth in earnings per share. Sales have climbed 20% or more for at least 18 straight quarters. The company's return on equity was 25.1% in the most recent complete year.

The online travel firm is expanding in China and elsewhere in Asia. Shares are up 27% so far this year.

379,PYPL,"Visa (V) announced Tuesday that it's taking an equity stake in a Swedish fintech startup that has been valued at more than $2.25 billion, joining giants like Apple (AAPL) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in the payments-innovation race being led by apps such as PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo.Visa and Klarna, which serves 60 million consumers and 70,000 retailers, intend to form a strategic partnership to roll out new products. The exact terms of the stake were not disclosed.Klarna, founded in 2005, has a 10% e-commerce market share in Northern Europe, helped by its after-delivery payment strategy, which lets buyers receive ordered goods before any payment is due.The Klarna investment follows Visa's previous ones in fintech startups like Stripe, Square (SQ) and LoopPay. Recently, it extended a partnership with former rival PayPal to spur adoption of digital and mobile payments in the Asia-Pacific region.And as Visa eyes more tech startups, Klarna looks to establish itself more in finance and received a full banking license in Sweden earlier in June, opening up the possibility of issuing loans and credit cards.Meanwhile, Visa and Mastercard (MA), together with 30 U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC), are rolling out a peer-to-peer payment service that allows near-instant cash transfers between bank accounts via their Zelle payment processing network.Shares of Visa dipped 0.3% to 94.95 on the stock market today.

Analyst Budd Bugatch sees the 13% share decline on the Amazon (AMZN) deal to buy Whole Foods (WFM) as unwarranted. He expects minimal effect on Costco's business model that's benefiting from member growth and strong renewal rates.Shares of Costco rose about 2% to 160.20 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Wall Street is still expecting another bidder to emerge for Whole Foods, which could force Amazon to raise its price. Here's who might and might not make a competing bid.Morgan Stanley downgraded the online food ordering company to equal weight from overweight, paring its price target to 43 from 47. Analyst Brian Nowak sees competitor UberEats ""gaining traction"" as well as a serious threat from Amazon restaurant delivery. He notes that scaled restaurants could subsidize one-hour PrimeNow delivery.Wedbush analyst Aaron Turner has said that Grubhub would be a logical buyout target for Amazon after Whole Foods.Shares of Grubhub sank 6.4% to 44.64, below the 46.93 buy point cleared last week.BTIG raised its price target for the online payments company to 63 from 53, keeping a buy rating.

384,PYPL,"XPayPal (PYPL) will reap upside from recent deals with Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) while threats from Apple (AAPL) Pay and banks are overblown, says Pacific Crest Securities, which upgraded the payment processor to overweight.Analyst Josh Beck set a price target of 60 on PayPal stock. Shares in PayPal closed up 1.9% at 53.54 on the stock market today. PayPal stock is up about 34% in 2017.""Our industry works suggests 'Choice' (a more consumer-friendly checkout experience) and Venmo (a person-to-person social payments application) are on the precipice of moving from an investment to a harvesting phase,"" said Beck in a report.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online check-out deals with credit card firms Visa and Mastercard. PayPal had used mainly banking partners to process payments.As part of its 2013 acquisition of Braintree, a mobile payment service, PayPal also acquired Venmo, a hybrid mobile payment app and social network for millennials.

401,PYPL,"The Nasdaq outperformed Wednesday afternoon amid a mixed and mostly unchanged performance for the NYSE indexes.XOil- and gas-related groups in IBD's database were among the day's worst performers, following the lead of August WTI crude oil, which was down 3.9% to $45.39 a barrel after Russia said it would not support further production cuts.The Nasdaq composite added 0.75% shortly after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its June meeting.

That's normal after a big price move.Inside the IBD 50, PayPal (PYPL) continues to show good action around the 10-week moving average.

Also in the group, Square (SQ) is trading tightly and holding near highs. It's getting support at the 10-week moving average for the first time after a breakout.Yum China (YUMC) lost 1% ahead of its earnings report after the close. The stock has been a solid performer since Yum Brands (YUM) spun the company off late last year.Yum China was featured as a potential call-option idea in the latest Earnings Preview column. When shares were trading around 39.60, a monthly call option with a 40 strike price (July 21 expiration) came with a premium of around $1.40, presenting a trade with downside risk of 3.5%. The contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares of Yum China at 40 for a cost of $140, excluding commission. If Yum falls on earnings, the maximum loss for the option trade would be $140, the amount paid for the contract.RELATED:Yum China Earnings Due: What To Expect From Hot Restaurant StockTesla Slammed By Goldman Sachs As Sell Rating ReiteratedIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index Hits 10-Month Low On TrumpCareCrude Prices, Exxon Fall As Russia Says Nyet To More Cuts

406,PYPL,"American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) is on a roll, outperforming the S&P 500 and its peers year to date and in the past 12 months. The $9.2 billion large-cap growth fund is benefiting from strong showings by stocks in the fund's wheelhouse: fast-growing large-cap companies.And the fund's managers have been busy refreshing the portfolio in recent months with highly rated stocks that have advanced to or near new highs this year.Ultra was up 15.19% this year going into Thursday vs. 8.27% for the S&P 500 and 13.36% for the fund's large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.

408,PYPL,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

409,PYPL,"If you're in the National Basketball Association playoffs, you want Steph Curry or LeBron James on your team. If you're managing a retirement account or taxable portfolio, why not tap into the Fidelity Investments' brain trust, which includes an army of analysts? Knowing cumulative stock moves in Fidelity's many mutual funds can help you choose your own buys and sells.Not all Fidelity funds make the same buys and sells, but it's instructive to see which leading stocks Fidelity overall bet more of its shareholders' money on the first quarter and where it lightened its weightings. Normally you'd have to track down and then sift through Securities and Exchange Commission filings by each of Fidelity's 358 stock and balanced funds. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has done that and crunched the numbers for you already.What CFRA found is that Fidelity's biggest sector weights were in information technology and consumer discretionary. By the end of Q1, Fidelity had nearly 27% of its shareholders' money at work in tech. It had more than 15% of its shareholders cash placed in consumer discretionary stocks.""Heading into 2017, economically sensitive information technology stocks were poised to benefit from a risk-on environment,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and mutual fund research. ""Further, Fidelity offers a number of growth-oriented strategies that tend to favor tech stocks.""Among Fidelity's 75 largest stock positions across all of its stock and balanced portfolios, PayPal (PYPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were tech-sector stocks in which the Fidelity complex increased its Q1 share-count percentage the most.Fidelity added 6.4 million shares of PayPal, for a 16.8% increase. It added 4.3 million shares of Qualcomm, for an 8.3% hike.Fidelity's $110.7 billion Contrafund (FCNTX) — the firm's largest stock mutual fund — and $15.5 billion Magellan (FMAGX) were among the funds investing in PayPal as of their latest disclosures.Fidelity's $14.8 billion OTC (FOCPX) and $30.5 billion Balanced (FBALX) funds were holders of Qualcomm.Still, Fidelity made an even bigger percentage increase in its share count in LyondellBasell Industries (LYB). Adding 5.2 million shares across its funds, Fidelity's share count jumped nearly 31%.The Netherlands-based company makes chemicals and polymers that are used packaging, home furnishings and automotive components. A materials manufacturer like that stands to benefit from any global expansion in GDP, such as the one that appears to be underway.Fidelity's Magellan, Balanced and OTC funds were investors in LyondellBasell.Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had the third-largest Q1 percentage boost in share count by Fidelity funds. The 2.7 million share boost was a 9.9% increase.Amgen is a leading seller of LDL cholesterol-battling drugs. A judge recently sided with Amgen in a patent lawsuit against Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY). The ruling is under appeal.Fidelity's $9.4 billion Select Biotechnology (FBIOX) and $21 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) funds were Amgen holders.Fidelity's fourth-largest share-count percentage hike was for Charter Communications (CHTR). Fidelity's increase of nearly 800,000 shares was a 9.8% boost.Charter is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Telecom Services-Integrated industry group. Earnings per share rose 131% in the latest quarter on a 302% rise in sales.

432,PYPL,"Facebook's (FB) integration of a payments feature in its Messenger app didn't slow down PayPal's (PYPL) Venmo service and Google's new Gmail-based wallet likely won't do much damage either, analysts say.Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google announced Wednesday that Gmail users will be able to use Google Wallet and store their debit and credit card information for sending money to friends or family. Google's payment feature is available only in the U.S. on smartphones using its Android software, not Apple's (AAPL) iPhones.""If Google can roll this out on Apple iOS, and roll this out to other major countries, that would open up the addressable market,"" said Neil Doshi, an analyst at Mizuho Securities.PayPal stock finished 0.7% at 42.39 on the stock market today. PayPal stock has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern and has a technical buy point of 43.17. Alphabet stock rose 0.3% to end at 868.39, breaking out from a buy point of 867.10 off a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal, spun off by eBay in 2015, is a high volume stock. But it's been in a trading range for the past year. Learn more about PayPal's technicals and growth prospects at IBD Stock Checkup.As part of its 2013 acquisition of Braintree, a mobile payment service, PayPal also acquired Venmo, a hybrid mobile payment app and social network for millennials. Facebook, meanwhile, introduced a payments feature in Messenger in mid-2015.But, that didn't slow down Venmo. Venmo's user base doubled in 2016 to nearly 9 million, CNET reported. Most Venmo users are millennials — young adults.Doshi doesn't expect Google's new Gmail payments feature to impact Venmo or Square's (SQ) payment service.""Venmo likely has a lock on millennials, and Square Cash is now being integrated into Square point-of-sale systems as an alternative method of making and accepting payments,"" Doshi said in a report. ""Long-term, we wouldn't count Alphabet out. The company has massive scale across Gmail and Android, and we could see Alphabet integrating Wallet across other core Google products and services.""PayPal in 2015 also acquired Xoom for $890 million, putting it into competition with Western Union (WU) in international money transfers.RELATED:Amazon Payments Volume Nearly Doubles As It Expands To New MarketsAmazon, PayPal Partnership: 'Could Be A Win-Win'

433,PYPL,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer (PFE) could boost its value by $5 billion in a takeover of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), an analyst said Monday, acknowledging Bristol-specific and macro uncertainties limit the likelihood.Still, it's been a common question ""given some of the challenges Bristol-Myers Squibb is facing and the activist involvement in the name,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says. Questions of a takeout center on the next nine to 12 months, he said in a note to clients.""Pfizer commentary in our recent 'Meeting with Management' and at other investor conferences makes us think they are certainly looking at all possibilities when it comes to business development,"" he wrote.Overall, Credit Suisse sees Bristol having a positive impact on Pfizer's return on capital. An all-cash deal, assuming Pfizer pays a 25% premium and can extract 30% synergies, would lead to value creation of 80 cents a share.But if Pfizer opts for a cash-and-stock deal, ""dilution from issuing 'undervalued' shares will offset the initial value creation,"" analysts wrote. ""A deal partially financed with an 18% stock issuance would be a break-even for Pfizer shareholders.""IBD'S TAKE: Bristol-Myers has two immuno-oncology drugs approved, meaning it competes against other FDA-approved treatments from Roche and Merck. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown of this drug sector.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol was up fractionally to 56.04 while Pfizer ticked up 0.5% to 34.18. Shares of Bristol have been under pressure this year and are down 4.4% since January.Activist investor Carl Icahn reportedly took a stake in Bristol-Myers in February. Icahn is known for his investments in companies like PayPal (PYPL), Xerox (XRX) and Allergan (AGN). Jana Partners, another activist investor, bought a stake in Bristol in during the fourth quarter.That, compounded with added pressure from the likes of Merck (MRK) and Roche (RHHBY) are adding to macro uncertainties for Bristol-Myers. In February, Bristol lost share in the immuno-oncology market to Merck while Roche remained flat on a month-over-month basis.RELATED:Bristol-Myers Partner Hits 18-Month High On Immuno-Oncology DealMerck Could Be Nearing This Rival With Another Keytruda ApprovalIncyte Spikes To Record High On Rumors Gilead Could Acquire It

434,PYPL,"ServiceNow (NOW) announced Chief Executive Frank Slootman will step down as of April 3, to be replaced by John Donahoe, chairman of PayPal (PYPL) and a former CEO of eBay (EBAY).Slootman will continue to serve as the chairman of ServiceNow's board.ServiceNow stock fell 4.4% to 87.75 in the stock market today, still up more than 15% in 2017 but down 7% from its all-time high of 93.97 set on Feb. 15.Donahoe was president and CEO of eBay from 2008 to 2015. EBay spun off PayPal in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Western Alliance Bancorp and Primerica are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Analysts were surprised by Slootman stepping down amid intensified competition with Salesforce.com (CRM).""We are not thrilled to see Mr. Slootman moving to the chairman role,"" said Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a research report. ""In our view, Slootman has been the key architect, or at least a key architect, in ServiceNow's strategy of moving into new good growth opportunities beyond ITSM.""Founded in 2004, ServiceNow developed software for information technology service management (ITSM), basically IT help desk tools for tracking internal company issues. ServiceNow has expanded into new markets such as human resources, customer service management and security.Slootman has been ServiceNow's CEO since 2011. He earlier headed Data Domain, which was sold to data storage networking giant EMC in 2009.ServiceNow's 2016 sales boomed 38% to $1.4 billion. ServiceNow has forecast 2017 revenue growth of 32% to $1.835 billion at the midpoint of its guidance.""While we expected Slootman would not remain CEO forever, we expected more signs of succession process before an announcement like this,"" said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, in a report. ""We believe the company had looked at bringing in an apprentice like successor, they opted to go with an exec (Donahoe) that has managed a $20 billion business.""Santa Clara, Calif.-based ServiceNow has set a goal of $4 billion in revenue by 2020.""Software CEOs have a history of handing off the job at 'the top,'"" added Pritchard. ""We expect near-term investor sentiment will reflect concern around this, even though there are no obvious signs of peaking momentum.""ServiceNow has prospered by taking away the customers of BMC Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), CA Technologies (CA) and others.""As with any new leadership, we believe that there could be some turnover within the senior management layer as Mr. Donahoe looks to build out his team,"" said Mizuho Securities in a report.RELATED:Meet The 'Fastest-Growing' $1 Billion Enterprise Software FirmWill Microsoft Stymie Salesforce.com's Stock Turnaround?

It relaunched Amazon Payments in 2013 after years of experiments in the online payments field.Payment processor PayPal (PYPL) recently said it's in talks with Amazon about a partnership. PayPal already has agreements with Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), as well as with Facebook (FB).Cowen analyst George Mihalos, in a research note, said he does not believe a PayPal deal with Amazon is imminent, and he expects the companies ""likely will remain competitors on multiple fronts.""Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 812.50 in the stock market today. PayPal stock rose 0.7% to 40.02. PayPal stock has retreated from an all-time high of 44.15 set on Oct. 21. The company was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in July 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts mostly gave Amazon a thumbs down on its fourth-quarter earnings report posted late Thursday, which missed on revenue, as did its Q1 outlook, sending the stock down on Friday.With Amazon Payments, merchants can choose to integrate services such as Pay with Amazon, offering simpler ways for online shoppers to authenticate with their Amazon account on a third-party website.The increase in users of Amazon Payments is attributable, in part, to the expansion of Amazon Payments into France, Italy and Spain and into new markets such as government payments, travel, digital goods, insurance, entertainment, nonprofits and charities.Amazon Payments competes with PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and others in the payment processing field.""As consumers shop in more and more ways — online, in store, and on the go — their expectations for speed, convenience and personalization continue to grow,"" said Patrick Gauthier, vice president of Amazon Payments, in the company's press release.RELATED:Workday Adds Amazon As Customer, After Wal-Mart Deal

436,PYPL,"The $679.9 million First Trust U.S. Equity Opportunities (FPX) just became the first ETF to add mobile-messaging upstart and new IPO Snap (SNAP) to its portfolio.The exchange traded fund was expected to include Snap at the next quarterly rebalance, on the close of March 17, but the index provider used discretionary powers to add the Snapchat owner at the close of business March 2 due to ""extraordinary circumstances,"" Ryan Issakainen, ETF strategist at First Trust, told IBD in a phone call Friday.Snap currently has a minuscule 0.3% weighting in the FPX portfolio but that could change after the rebalance, Issakainen added. Weightings in FPX are determined by float-adjusted market capitalization.FPX closed modestly higher Friday as it trades near all-time highs at around 57.The First Trust ETF tracks a market-cap-weighted index of the 100 largest and most liquid U.S. IPOs. It holds new stock market entrants for roughly four years, and also invests in spinoffs.Its 102 stock holdings include Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Facebook (FB), PayPal (PYPL) and Twitter (TWTR).Year to date through March 2, FPX ETF has advanced 6.0% vs. roughly 6.6% for the S&P 500. It has gained an annual average 10.9% over the past 10 years, outpacing the S&P's 7.9% gain over the same period.Snapchat-owner Snap jumped more than 40% Thursday after its long-awaited public debut and extended its gains on the stock market today, despite analyst warnings about its prospects.It could be years before the company, which is behind the popular disappearing-message app, lands in core exchange traded funds. Search giant Alphabet (GOOGL) waited roughly two years after its debut to join the S&P 500 index.Fledgling, newly public companies can be tricky to research and risky to invest in. They are also missing from the major market indexes, and the ETFs that track them, until they become seasoned stocks.That doesn't mean ETF investors get left out of the IPO party, thanks to exchange traded funds such as FPX that make IPOs, or initial public offerings, their business.A smaller and newer rival, Renaissance IPO (IPO), is set to include Snap on March 20 during the quarterly rebalance of the underlying index, David Sieber of Renaissance, an IPO ETF manager, told IBD in a phone call.""This will set up the ETF, which is now up 10.5% this year compared to 7.0% for the S&P 500, to be one of the first to include Snap,"" he said Wednesday.Sieber expects Snap to be a top-10 stock in the IPO ETF portfolio, given its size. Snap had a market capitalization of $31.32 billion as of the March 3 market close.The $13.5 million Renaissance IPO ETF currently holds 46 stocks, with hefty stakes in First Data (FDC) and TransUnion (TRU).Renaissance IPO typically acquires new issues within 90 days of listing and boots them out after two years of public trading. It can fast-track the entry of sizable new companies such as Snap.Neither IPO ETF captures the first-day pop, or drop, in any new issue. They tend to include IPOs only after a few days of public trading.Snap scored big with its IPO, raising $3.4 billion, making it the biggest U.S. IPO in years.Snap's IPO was priced at 17, opened trading at 24 Thursday and closed out the week at 27.09.

437,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings has discussed letting shoppers pay for purchases on Amazon.com using their PayPal accounts.The deal highlights how PayPal can attract new partners since its 2015 split from Amazon rival eBay.""We have been in conversations with Amazon,"" PayPal (PYPL) Chief Executive Dan Schulman said late Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg. ""We're closing in on 200 million users on our platform right now. At that scale, it's hard for any retailer to think about not accepting PayPal.""There are no details to announce, but Schulman said the conversations have focused on ""how to use one another's assets to the mutual benefit of our customers.""A spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon (AMZN) declined to comment.The prospect of a deal couldn't keep PayPal shares from plunging in morning trades Friday on disappointing earnings results released late Thursday. Shares ended Friday trade down 3% to 40.27. Amazon slipped 0.4% to 835.77. EBay was up 2.4% to 32.51.PayPal separated from eBay (EBAY) — Amazon's onetime arch rival — to concentrate on expanding its electronic transactions business without being shackled to the slow-growing online marketplace. Schulman, who became CEO after the split, has been forging agreements in an effort to increase the number of people using PayPal and the frequency with which they use it.Amazon has its own payment ambitions and hired Patrick Gauthier from San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal in 2015 to lead its initiative. Amazon is balancing its desire to control payments with its customer-centric philosophy, given PayPal's reach.PayPal on Thursday reported 197 million active customer accounts in the fourth quarter, with 31 transactions per account in the trailing 12 months. Amazon shoppers have asked whether the company would accept PayPal in Amazon customer discussion forums.Amazon revived its own payments business in 2013 by letting shoppers use Amazon accounts to make purchases with other online merchants.

444,PYPL,"Ant Financial, the Alibaba Group (BABA) affiliate controlled by billionaire Jack Ma, stepped up its international expansion by buying U.S. money transfer service MoneyGram International (MGI), it was reported Thursday.The $880 million acquisition marks Ant's first deal with a U.S.-listed company, as it begins to explore markets beyond a home arena it already dominates. The transaction will connect MoneyGram's network of 2.4 billion bank and mobile accounts with Ant Financial's customers, who use a broad suite of technology-based financial services, including payments, credit and insurance.""This gives us a very attractive businesses that's already quite engaged with a substantial consumer base in the U.S.,"" said Douglas Feagin, who runs Ant Financial's global operations, in a phone interview. ""Remittance is a very important activity, and we think this is a great way for us to build a presence around U.S. consumers.""Ant Financial is offering $13.25 per share in cash, according to a statement Thursday. That's about an 11.5% premium to MoneyGram's closing price of 11.88 Wednesday. The company will continue to be based in Dallas and operate under its existing brand.The deal ""seems rational,"" as Alibaba could help MoneyGram obtain a more robust presence in big global corridors, said Andrew Jeffrey, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. MoneyGram shares gapped up 11.5% to 13.25 in early trading, then settled back for a gain of 9.6% in recent action.MoneyGram lets consumers and businesses send cash to one another, generating revenue from transaction fees and spreads on foreign-exchange rates. MoneyGram and larger rival Western Union (WU), the dominant players in the global remittance industry, have been battling increased competition from cheaper digital alternatives such as PayPal's (PYPL) Xoom, WorldRemit and TransferWise.Ant Financial, whose Alipay handles the majority of transactions on Alibaba's online shopping sites, last year appointed a new chief executive officer to steer its next phase of growth and possibly oversee a public market debut in 2017.Formally known as Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group, the Chinese company has begun making investments abroad, notably in India and Southeast Asia, to take its model of online finance and local services to emerging markets. Last year, executives of Ant Financial visited Silicon Valley to size up potential investments and lay the groundwork for an IPO.Ant started out as a unit of Alibaba before Ma spun it out in 2010, inviting objections from shareholders like Yahoo (YHOO).

The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 7.5%, topping last year's 5.7% gain but lagging the other two closely watched indexes.""While equity issuance in 2017 is expected to be considerably higher, we don't expect to see anywhere near the pressure from supply that we saw in 2014 when Alibaba Group's (BABA) IPO and Facebook's use of equity to purchase WhatsApp drove supply issuance to an all-time high in internet,"" added Terry in the report.Facebook and Alphabet rose 1.6% and 2%, respectively, in the stock market today, with the latter retaking its 50-day moving average.

But shares have been retreating since then, undercutting the pivot point earlier this month and closing below the 50-day line on Friday.PayPal was flat before Tuesday's opening bell.Global Payments (GPN) and Vantiv (VNTV) also have retreated.It's unclear what it is hurting Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. They make their money from transaction fees, letting card-issuing banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) get the risk and reward from customers' balances. With the yield curve steepening sharply in recent weeks and especially since Donald Trump became president-elect, card interest rates may rise. Bank stocks are soaring on widening yield spreads generally.IBD'S TAKE: While Visa and MasterCard slump, investors continue to rush into bank stocks. They're mostly extended from proper buy points, but you should pay close attention to this new leading group for entry points down the road.That could be why American Express (AXP), Capital One Financial (COF) and Discover Financial (DFS) are soaring. All three carry customers' balances. American Express rose 2.7% Monday to its best levels since November 2015. Capital One jumped 3.4% to its highest since July 2015. Discover Financial advanced 3.3%, hitting an all-time high intraday.Jefferies analysts said Tuesday that the sell-off in some payment stocks is unwarranted.""Major payments stocks including V, MA, PYPL, GPN and VNTV are off 5-10% in the four trading sessions since Election Day. We don't believe this is because of fundamental concerns on these stocks, but rather because of investor rotation into core Financials which have significantly lagged the payments stocks for years, but are now expected to benefit from rate and regulatory tailwinds under the Trump Administration.""Jefferies added that financial deregulation could repeal the Durbin limit on interchange fees and rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""If Trump's general plans for deregulating the financial services industry ends up including a repeal of the Durbin Amendment and a less-powerful CFPB, this should generally be a tailwind for the Payments industry, though impacts to PYPL/SQ/merchant acquirers may be less clear.""

457,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL) expects to grow its consumer accounts by making its sign-up process easier and expanding its partnerships with technology companies such as Facebook (FB), says Nomura Securities.Nomura analyst Bill Carcache says PayPal is taking steps to clinch consumer sign-ups that have slipped away. Having announced a mobile payments deal with Facebook in October, PayPal is in talks with other tech companies, though Amazon.com (AMZN) is not a candidate for a partnership, says Carcache, who has a buy rating and price target of 54 on PayPal stock.""There's an increased willingness to consider partnering with PYPL because of its consumer choice stance,"" said the Nomura analyst in his research report Tuesday.Carcache says he recently met with PayPal management, including CFO John Rainey.IBD'S TAKE: Cardtronics, the world's biggest nonbank automated teller machine operator, MasterCard and PayPal are the top-rated stocks in IBD's Finance-Credit Card Payment processors group. Learn more about these and other companies at IBD Stock Checkup.PayPal has nearly 180 million active consumer accounts.""Roughly 1 million customers go to PayPal to sign up each month and enter their card information but never activate their accounts due to friction in the sign-up process (for example, requiring users to input bank account information when they prefer to use payment cards),"" Carcache said. ""By enabling customer choice and streamlining the sign-up process, (CFO Rainey) believes PayPal will be able to activate these customers.""By our math, adding 1 million active accounts per month (12 million annually) could translate into 8% to 10% EPS upside (although we note that incremental customer service and support costs could dampen the upside).""PayPal recently announced partnerships with credit card networks Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA).The payment processor in October posted Q3 earnings and revenue that edged Wall Street views and raised its revenue growth forecast for a three-year period to 16%-17% from its previous guidance of 15%.PayPal stock is up 15% in 2016 but has slipped from its all-time high of 44.52, touched on Oct. 24, and is near its 50-day moving average.

""Square has demonstrated success moving up market amid stronger competition ... .""While Square's primary customers are small businesses, it's attracting bigger customers, analysts say. Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. It has expanded into providing financing and bank loans to small businesses, and also has moved into the food delivery business.Square went public at 9 per share last November. Square stock has been down about 15% in 2016 as of Tuesday's market close.Neil Doshi, analyst at Mizuho Securities, said in a report that ""we expect to see material EBITDA margin expansion over the coming years.""""Square Capital loans totaled $208 million in Q3, growing 70% year over year,"" Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg said in a report. ""This is a deceleration from the 123% growth seen last quarter, and the slower pace of loan growth could be well-received given sensitivities to the credit environment.""RELATED:PayPal Hikes Revenue Outlook As Payment Ecosystem GrowsSquare, The Other Firm Led By Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Also Challenged

The electronic-payments giant would also get access to Visa's token and other digital services, in turn enhancing transaction security and expanding ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled.""The deal would also allow customers to immediately withdraw money and move it to their bank account from their PayPal and Venmo accounts via Visa Direct, the companies said.PayPal and MasterCard announced a similar agreement last month.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal's partnerships with Visa and MasterCard are the latest among many struck by the company. Analysts say such partnerships, including ones with Facebook and China's Alibaba, could bring more upside. Earlier Monday, Visa and Intel (INTC) said they would work together to develop stronger payment security for connected devices.

464,PYPL,"When Hong Kong-based financier Michael Nock wanted a place to escape in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, he looked beyond the traditional havens of the rich to a land at the edge of the world, where cows outnumber people 2-to-1.Nock, the founder of hedge fund firm Doric Capital, bought a retreat 5,800 miles away in New Zealand's picturesque Queenstown. In the seven years since, terror threats in Europe and political uncertainty from Britain to the U.S. have helped make the South Pacific nation — a day by air away from New York or London — a popular bolt-hole for the megawealthy.Isolation has long been considered New Zealand's Achilles' heel. That remoteness is turning into an advantage, however, with hedge-fund pioneer Julian Robertson to Russian steel titan Alexander Abramov and Hollywood director James Cameron establishing multimillion-dollar hideaways in the New Zealand countryside.""The thing that was always working against New Zealand — the tyranny of distance — is the very thing that becomes its strength as the world becomes more uncertain,"" Nock, 60, said by phone from Los Angeles during a recent business trip.Nock's five-acre estate is named ""Giverny"" after artist Claude Monet's iconic home and garden in northern France, and the ""funny old farmhouse"" is surrounded by ponds and mature plants, he said. Nock is converting a barn into an art studio on the property, which overlooks Queenstown's Shotover River — a fast-flowing, turquoise stretch of water that tourists speed down on jet boats and white-water rafts.Twice the size of England, but with less than a tenth of its people, New Zealand ranks high on international surveys of desirable places to live, placing among the top 10 for democracy, lack of corruption, peace and satisfaction. With its NZ$250 billion ($180 billion) economy dominated by farming and tourism, the nation last month overtook Singapore as the best country in the world to do business and was rated second to the Southeast Asian nation as the top place to live for expatriates in a survey by HSBC Holdings (ADR) in September.House prices in New Zealand increased 12.7% in the year through October, and the average price in largest city Auckland has almost doubled since 2007 to more than NZ$1 million.Jack Ma, founder of e-retailing behemoth Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) and China's richest man, told Prime Minister John Key in April that he'd like to buy a home in his country, according to the New Zealand Herald. At least 20 of Ma's 40-something colleagues have retired there, the newspaper said.Key, a former currency trader, once described New Zealand as ""England without the attitude."" It's changed leaders just twice in almost 17 years and the last hint of terrorism came a generation ago, when French spies bombed a Greenpeace campaigning ship docked in Auckland harbor in 1985.It's that kind of stability that's attracting a wave of Brexit-inspired migration to the island nation that gained prominence as the otherworldly backdrop to the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" films.New Zealand received 998 registrations from U.K. nationals interested in moving to the country the day after the referendum on European Union membership, vs. 109 the day before the vote, according to data from the immigration department. That grew to 10,647 registrations in the 49 days after June 23, more than double the same period a year earlier.""If the world is going to go to hell in a hand basket, they're in the best place they could possibly be,"" said David Cooper, director of client services at Malcolm Pacific Immigration in Auckland, the country's biggest migration agency. ""People want to get the hell out of where they are and they feel that New Zealand is safe.""Cooper has seen an uptick in inquiries from U.S. citizens over the past few months, he said, with the raucous presidential contest, as well as the recent spate of mass shootings, cited as reasons to flee.""The world is heading into a major crisis,"" said internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom in an Oct. 31 Twitter post. ""I saw it coming and that's why we moved to New Zealand. Far away & not on any nuclear target list."" The German-born founder of Megaupload was granted residency in 2010, but is now fighting attempts to extradite him to the U.S.Successful Kiwis who have worked in investment banking and other lucrative professions in New York and London are also returning home to raise their families, said Ollie Wall, an agent with Auckland-based Graham Wall Real Estate. The firm helped broker New Zealand's most expensive house sale in 2013, when a seven-bedroom mansion on the city's Paritai Drive was sold to a China-born businessman for NZ$39 million.""The world has got smaller,"" Wall said in an email. ""You can run multinational corporations from paradise now. So why wouldn't you?""Fidelity National Financial (FNFV) Chairman Bill Foley owns a luxury homestead in the Wairarapa region north of Wellington, and Julian Robertson, chairman of Tiger Management in New York, owns two of the nation's most prestigious golf courses and a luxury lodge overlooking Queenstown's Lake Wakatipu. He says New Zealand is ""the most beautiful place on Earth.""Billionaire Facebook (FB) backer Peter Thiel described New Zealand as a ""utopia"" in 2011 and is reported to have bought residential property in Auckland and Queenstown. Thiel and a spokesman for the PayPal (PYPL) co-founder didn't respond to emailed requests for comment.New Zealand has actively courted the wealthy. For an investment of NZ$10 million in local assets or funds over a three-year-period, migrants can qualify for residency provided they spent 44 days in New Zealand in each of the two latest years. These investors don't have to speak English or live for a set amount of time in the country after the qualification period. They also don't have to become tax residents.Since the program started six years ago, 121 people have gained so-called Investor Plus visas, and more than 800 have secured a residency pass that requires a NZ$1.5 million investment over four years, government data show.""It provides a bolt-hole, a place for 'just in case,' "" said Willy Sussman, a partner at Auckland law firm Bell Gully, which has worked with wealthy migrants from all over the world.The desire for a haven nestled among snow-capped alps close to an international airport helped house prices in Queenstown increase at more than twice the pace of Auckland in the year through October, reaching an average of NZ$974,564.Mark Harris, managing director of the town's Sotheby's Realty office, said he has sold properties for more than NZ$20 million, including ones with private landing strips.""We hedge fund people all love optionality,"" said Nock, the part-time Queenstown resident from Hong Kong. ""Will I live in New Zealand permanently? I'm not sure, but I want the optionality of being able to do that.""MORE ABOUT GETAWAYS: 3 Ways To Turn A Second Home Into A Gold MineEntrepreneurs Fit A Tiny House Into An 'Anti-Vacation' PackageThe Election Is One More Reason For Canadians To Sell U.S. Homes

485,PYPL,"The stock indexes were off session lows in afternoon trading Wednesday, as Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) led a sell-off in organic-food stocks, but PayPal (PYPL) fortified broad gains in financials.The Nasdaq was down 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were each off 0.2%. Apple (AAPL), a major component of the main indexes, was little changed in the stock market today when it announced what's expected to be a new iPhone model.Volume was tracking higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE. Despite index losses, winning stocks led losers by 7-to-5 on the NYSE and by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Sprouts Farmers Market gapped down to a 13% loss in huge volume, touching the lowest level in more than a year. The company warned that same-store sales in Q3 will be flat, and it forecast full-year comps growth of 1.5% to 2.5%. Analysts had expected closer to 4% comps growth in Q3 and the full year. The natural-foods grocery chain's forecast for full-year profit of 83 to 86 cents also was below views for 94 cents.The company sees weak pricing. ""The prolonged deflationary environment, competitive landscape and industry dynamics have prompted heavy promotions across the industry, adversely impacting retail deflation and traffic generation,"" it said.The news sparked selling in related stocks.Natural and organic-foods wholesaler United Natural Foods (UNFI) fell 4.5% to the lowest level since mid-June. United Natural reports earnings Monday after the close. Whole Foods Market (WFM), a longtime laggard stock, gapped down 5% to a four-month low.In other retail, Casey's General Stores (CASY) plunged 10% in huge volume after the chain missed profit expectations for its July-ended quarter. The company earned $1.70 a share, an increase of 8%, while sales fell 4% to $1.97 billion. It was the seventh straight decline in quarterly sales. Wednesday's plunge ruined a chart that had been shaping up well for Casey's, which was forming a base-on-base pattern.The financial sector performed much better Wednesday, with credit-card firms, payment processors, real estate investment trusts, some banks, and savings and loans bucking the market's decline.PayPal shot up more than 3% in active trading after the payment processing firm announced an agreement with MasterCard (MA) that makes it easier for PayPal users to pay with MasterCard. PayPal users also will be able to select a MasterCard as a default payment option, and they'll be able to transfer money to their MasterCard debit cards instantly.PayPay climbed back above its 50-day moving average as it works on a new pattern. MasterCard, which is forming a base with a 100.10 buy point, rose a fraction.Tempur Sealy (TPX) broke out of a large cup-with-handle base, clearing an 80.88 buy point. But volume was only about average for the maker of mattresses and bedding products. Despite a deep stock correction of nearly 40%, Tempur Sealy has a top IBD Composite Rating.RELATED:Western Digital Ups Targets, HD Supply Outlook Weak, Sprouts WarnsApple iPhone 7 Leaks Point To Waterproofing, New Colors, Better Cameras

486,PYPL,"Square (SQ) reports earnings after the close Wednesday, with analysts looking for an update on its newest offering -- loans to small business that use its payments processing system -- and an update on its food delivery business.San Francisco-based Square makes credit card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. Adjusted revenue growth appears to be slowing, though Square could be a takeover candidate, analysts say.Analysts estimate Square will report a wider non-GAAP loss of 11 cents per share vs. a 9 cent loss in the year-earlier period. Adjusted revenue -- sales minus transactions with Starbucks (SBUX) and other partners -- is expected to rise 43% to $157.8 million, with net revenue growing 31% to $406 million.""We are expecting Q2 adjusted revenue of $158 million, slightly above guidance, reflecting our bullish payment-processing outlook,"" said Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a research report.""The bigger question in our mind is 'What could the business look like next year?',"" he added, referring to new lending initiatives and the food delivery business.In Q1, Square's adjusted revenue jumped 64% to $146 million.In the September quarter, analysts estimate adjusted revenue growth of 39% to $164 million, with a narrower 10 cent per-share loss vs. a 16 cent loss in Q3 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Jack Dorsey has been serving as CEO of both Square and Twitter, which last week reported disappointing Q2 results.

Square had $444 million in cash on its balance sheet as of March 31.""Given Square's large scale (2 million small-business customers) and strong technology platform, we continue to believe Square would make an excellent acquisition target for Visa (V), American Express (AXP), PayPal (PYPL), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google or others,"" said Neil Doshi, a Mizuho Securities analyst, in a July report.Square stock fell 1.4% to 10.05 in the stock market today.

488,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL) and Visa (V) late Thursday announced a wide-ranging partnership, easing tension between the online payment processor and credit card network.PayPal's online payment system will no longer steer customers away from Visa's credit card network. Visa cards will be a payment option for PayPal users. The companies said their pact would make transactions more efficient and secure. PayPal will gain access to Visa's ""tokenization services,"" starting in the U.S., for in-store PayPal transactions. These services boost security.""PayPal is walking away from steering their customers to ACH (automated clearing house) as the preferred payment type,"" Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group, told IBD. ""PayPal is essentially making Visa the preferred payment option for PayPal customers.""From a customer experience perspective, the agreement will allow issuers to provide more detail for PayPal transactions on customer statements, and (processing) will be much simpler and faster than with ACH.""PayPal's online checkout service has used an ACH system set up by bank partners, bypassing credit card companies.Both companies also released mixed earnings for the quarter ended June 30.

That poses issues for Visa, and PayPal may cooperate more with credit-card companies, says Perlin.He says it's also possible that Visa ""plays hardball"" and imposes new digital wallet fees. PayPal may need to explain the economic impact of whatever happens with Visa, Perlin speculated in the report.PayPal shares rose 1.7% to 40.05 on the stock market today. Visa climbed 0.8%.

494,PYPL,"Small-business payments services provider Square (SQ) got an upgrade Friday, but it was merely to neutral and included a price target below the stock's current level. The company is struggling to inch closer to profitability in a brutally competitive field against such big rivals as PayPal (PYPL), Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Android Pay.Square stock rose 2.4% to 9.27 in the stock market today. That still leaves shares far below the 13 they were at when Square issued disappointing earnings and guidance in early May, sending its stock crashing 22% on May 6, to just above 10.Square is best known for its little electronic device -- popular with small businesses -- that attaches to smartphones or tablets and is used to take credit or debit card payments. The company's other services include Square Capital, which grants loans to certain small-business customers but which has come under scrutiny from the U.S. Treasury Department.Wedbush analyst Gil Luria, who upgraded the stock from underperform, wrote in his research note that ""Square is (a) rapidly growing a business that may never reach peer profitability, which will become apparent as growth slows over the next couple of years on competition.""And in a research note May 15, Luria said ""we expect further scrutiny"" for Square's lending business, which could hike the company's compliance costs, among other potential problems.Luria said he upgraded the stock to neutral because of its steep decline in less than two months, but he maintained his price target on Square stock at 8.The analyst expects Square's Q2 numbers to be close to his estimate of adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $5 million, with adjusted revenue of $168 million. But he said investors would be disappointed if those Q2 numbers instead come in close to Square's own guidance of $4 million on $151 million to $156 million.Among its other products, Square rolled out a new tool in March that enables payments to be processed from any website, putting it in more direct competition with PayPal, Apple Pay and Android Pay, among others.PayPal stock fell 0.4% on Friday, while Apple advanced 0.3% and Alphabet 1%.

496,PYPL,"The major indexes were near break-even levels in mid-afternoon trading Tuesday, showing a light reaction to Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen's mostly no-surprises testimony on the economy to Congress. However, some leadership-quality names -- namely Planet Fitness (PLNT) and Adobe Systems (ADBE) -- showed big moves in heavy trading.Planet Fitness, an August 2015 IPO that had been on a tear since the February market bottom, collapsed more than 7% on news of a share offering. Yet the base work has not yet been decimated.Meanwhile, Adobe, part of IBD Leaderboard, will be the focus of news after the 4 p.m. ET market close as it steps up to the earnings plate. The Street sees the graphics and PDF software giant posting a 42% rise in May-ended fiscal Q2 earnings to 68 cents a share on a 21% revenue increase to $1.4 billion.The Nasdaq composite was slightly lower, but the Nasdaq 100 eked out a 0.1% gain. The S&P 500 climbed 0.1% despite a sell-off in crude oil futures, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose by a hair. The Dow utility average rallied nearly 0.5%.Planet Fitness, which came public at 16 a share, plunged back to a prior buy point for aggressive traders. On June 7, the no-nonsense gym operator for budget-minded customers blasted past an 18.15 handle entry on its 10-month cup-like pattern. After stumbling back to that entry point a week later, Planet Fitness jumped as high as 8% before Tuesday's gap down.The company announced late Monday plans for the sale of 10 million Class A shares by certain holders, or 38% of the current float of 26 million shares. Over time, the expansion of the float can be positive for a stock as it generates more liquidity for institutional trading desks who desire to enter or exit the stock.Keep in mind that it appears that the lion's share of stock in Planet Fitness is held by insiders, as shares outstanding actually 98 million. Planet Fitness is a small cap with a current market value of $1.8 billion. It's steadily grown earnings (25 cents a share in 2012, then 26 cents, 42 cents and 53 cents the next three years), and Wall Street sees FY 2016 earnings rising 23% to 65 cents a share. Revenue climbed 26%, 8%, 10% and 8% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, No. 23-ranked VCA Antech (WOOF) rose more than 1% to 67.26 in volume running double normal pace. The vet clinic operator recently bounced off its 10-week moving average near 63.76 for the first time since a mid-April breakout past a 58.76 handle buy point, giving a follow-on buy opportunity.PayPal (PYPL) dropped more than 2% to 36.10 and undercut its newly formed 200-day moving average in fast trading.

Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster reportedly gave a cautionary note on the online payments giant, saying Apple Pay may provide a formidable rival in the upcoming Christmas shopping holiday season.As seen in Monday's Big Picture column and Market Pulse table, the market's current outlook was downgraded from ""confirmed uptrend"" to ""uptrend under pressure.""

497,PYPL,"PayPal's (PYPL) revenue growth surpasses that of Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), but it might not be as well positioned as the credit card networks, says Oppenheimer & Co., which initiated coverage on PayPal stock Friday with a buy rating.Oppenheimer analyst Glenn Greene set a price target of 43 on PayPal stock.""We believe PayPal's positioning within the payment processing ecosystem is less attractive than that of the card networks (MasterCard and Visa). However, PayPal's revenue growth of perhaps mid-teens over the next few years is more robust than either the networks or merchant acquirers,"" wrote Greene in his research report.Paypal stock ended unchanged in the stock market today. PayPal, which faces increasing competition from Apple (AAPL) Pay and other digital wallets, has an IBD Composite Rating of 73 out of a possible 99. It's been trading below the key 50-day moving average for the past month.PayPal recently launched its redesigned mobile app, which works on Apple iPhones and Android-based devices, in 145 countries. Prior to being spun off by eBay (EBAY) nearly a year ago, PayPal acquired Braintree, a mobile payment service, and Venmo, a hybrid peer-to-peer mobile payment app and social network targeted at millennials.PayPal's relationship with Visa remains a topic of interest, said Greene in his research report. He says that, based on comments by Visa executives, there could be closer ties or more direct competition coming.""To quote Visa CEO Charles Scharf on May 23, 'Anyone that's trying to take your customers and disintermediate you is not a friend. … We'd love to figure out a different model with them (PayPal) where it's consumer choice first where they're not disintermediating. … The other door is where we go full steam and compete with them in ways that people have never seen before.'  We suspect this rhetoric wasn't meant as loud as it sounded,"" Greene wrote.

498,PYPL,"Square (SQ) stock dipped Tuesday while PayPal (PYPL) rose as investors digested upgrades to Apple Pay announced at the start of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.Apple (AAPL), as expected, said Monday that Apple Pay would be extended to its Safari mobile browser, making it easier for consumers to shop online via iPads and iPhones. In a surprise move, though, Apple also introduced a “Pay with Apple Pay” option for its Mac computer users, in direct competition with payments leader PayPal.Apple also announced peer-to-peer payments would be available though third-party apps on its iMessage platform. At WWDC, Apple showcased a feature that lets Square Cash users send money via the Apple iMessage messaging app.“Square Cash was featured in the iMessage App Store, and a demonstration was provided that involved exchanging $200 via iMessage, Apple's most highly engaged application,” Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a research report late Monday. “We view this as a positive for Square, which could substantially increase the number of Square Cash users and potentially brand awareness.""For (PayPal’s similar peer-to-peer payments service) Venmo, we believe increased competition could create a headwind to monetization, though it could also create opportunity if Venmo were to partner with Apple.”Square closed down 0.3% to 8.89 in the stock market today, four-month closing low. PayPal rose 1.7%, rebounding off its 200-day line and snapping a seven-day losing streak. Apple stock rose 0.1% to 97.46 after falling 1.5% on Monday.Rolled out in 2014, Apple Pay has supported in-store shopping at retail checkouts, as well as in-app purchases for Uber, Disney (DIS) stores and others.

499,PYPL,"Apple Pay could share the spotlight at next week’s Worldwide Developers Conference, as Apple (AAPL) makes the mobile payment system a stronger rival to PayPal (PYPL), Square (SQ) and Visa (V).Apple is expected to showcase Apple Pay as part of its Safari mobile browser. There’s also speculation Apple could unveil a Apple Pay service similar to PayPal’s Venmo, a person-to-person mobile app for millennials.Apple’s annual WWDC will run June 13-17 in San Francisco.“We expect Apple to extend the domain of Apple Pay to include in-browser functionality and possibly person-to-person payments through iMessage,” said Andy Hargreaves, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, in a report.Apple Pay supports in-store shopping at retail checkouts, as well as in-app purchases for Uber, Disney stores and others.Apple Pay built into the Safari browser could be rolled out in time for Q4 holiday shopping.“Given the growing importance of mobile, a more robust Apple Pay offering could increase competitive pressure on PayPal,” said Hargreaves. “This likely would not generate meaningful revenue, but would add value to the platform and would suggest an elevated effort to compete with other messaging services around advanced functionality. Apple P2P payments would also potentially increase competition with PayPal/Venmo and Square.”Apple Pay will also be more competitive with Visa CheckOut. Visa has made minority investments in Chain, Stripe and Square.Apple shares fell 0.8% on the stock market today. Paypal slid 1%, Square lost 2.1%, and Visa was down 1.3%.

500,PYPL,"Apple (AAPL) Pay's threat to PayPal (PYPL) is increasing, owing to its edge in in-store payments, says 451 Research.Needham, meanwhile, initiated coverage on PayPal with a hold rating, citing heavy competition.Apple plans to expand its mobile wallet, now available in six countries, across Europe and Asia, according to a TechCrunch report.451 Research surveyed mobile payment users. Apple is displacing PayPal among “early adopters,” the research firm said. Early adopters are using mobile wallets more for in-store payments, an area where Apple Pay is strongest, says 451 Research. PayPal’s roots are in PC-based online payments.“Apple Pay’s footprint in-store continues to grow, while PayPal is predominantly still a service used on the Web,” Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 research, said in an email. “PayPal will need to double down on its offline strategy as mobile payment users transition from the Web to the physical world.“What we have found is that the general population is still cutting its teeth with mobile Web transactions,” McKee added. “For these users, PayPal scores very high in terms of planned usage and overall satisfaction, given it has incumbency and ubiquity on the mobile Web.""Needham, in its initiation report late Thursday, says PayPal might make more acquisitions as competition mounts with Apple, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, Visa (V) and others.“PayPal is positioned at the heart of the digital payments space, a market it pioneered,” said the Needham report. “We are concerned about the increasing competition that has the potential to further pressure PayPal’s take rate and in turn weigh on long-term growth and profitability.""Accordingly, we believe PayPal could be under pressure to constantly innovate, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, which could be potentially dilutive,” it said.Apple and PayPal shares were little changed on the stock market today. Apple fell early, paring its loss to end at 100.35, down 6 cents. PayPal rose 2 cents to 38.09.

501,PYPL,"E-payments giant PayPal (PYPL) announced Wednesday that it will release an updated mobile app for the Apple (AAPL) iOS and the Alphabet (GOOGL) Google Android operating system next month But it also offered further evidence that also-ran mobile operating systems from Microsoft (MSFT), BlackBerry (BBRY) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are obsolete.PayPal said in a blog post that users of its Apple iOS and Android OS mobile apps must update to version 6.0 between June 3-30. As for Windows Phone, BlackBerry and Amazon Fire, there's no app upgrade. In fact, PayPal will discontinue apps for those services as of June 30, though they can still access PayPal via browsers.Windows Phone and BlackBerry have seen continued market share losses, with Windows Phone market share falling below 1%. Amazon, which uses a modified Android, killed its ill-fated Fire Phone, though its Kindle tablets remain numerous.""It was a difficult decision to no longer support the PayPal app on these mobile platforms, but we believe it’s the right thing to ensure we are investing our resources in creating the very best experiences for our customers, wrote Joanna Lambert, PayPal's vice president of consumer product.Microsoft announced plans Wednesday to cut another 1,850 smartphone jobs.

502,PYPL,"Gawker Media filed for bankruptcy after losing a $140 million invasion-of-privacy suit brought by former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan and funded by tech billionaire Peter Thiel.The digital media company listed a $130 million claim from the litigation as “disputed” in its Chapter 11 petition, filed Friday in Manhattan. The bankruptcy would shield New York-based Gawker from paying the potentially crippling damages award while it seeks a buyer. The company also asked the court to shield its founder and chief executive officer, Nick Denton, from the Hogan suit and other litigation.Ziff Davis has signed an agreement to buy Gawker assets for around $100 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. That proposal would be open to competing bids, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the offer isn’t public.Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, sued the celebrity-focused news website in 2012 over the publication of a tape showing him having sex with a friend’s wife, claiming the publication cost him endorsements and inflicted emotional harm. Thiel, the libertarian-leaning venture capitalist who co-founded PayPal (PYPL) and sits on the board of Facebook (FB), made a financial contribution to the suit.Gawker and Thiel have a contentious history: The website outed him as gay in 2007. Thiel has since publicly acknowledged that he’s gay, and called Gawker’s now-defunct blog Valleywag the “Silicon Valley equivalent of al-Qaeda.” The dispute has evolved into a clash of tech titans, as First Look Media, a news organization founded by Silicon Valley billionaire Pierre Omidyar, has said it will support Gawker.In an internal memo to employees, Ziff Davis CEO Vivek Shah said acquiring the Gawker websites Gizmodo, Lifehacker and Kotaku “would fortify our position in consumer tech and gaming.”Shah’s memo did not mention the Gawker.com flagship site. Ziff Davis is focused on the Gawker brands in the tech, gaming and lifestyle categories, which contribute the vast majority of Gawker Media’s revenue, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ziff Davis has not decided on what it would do with Gawker.com if it buys the company, the person said.

503,PYPL,"World-renowned San Francisco is a city of contrasts:San Francisco's sharp divide is taking shape amid the financial euphoria and venture capital frenzy for game-changing startups such as Uber and Airnbnb. But this boom has a character that's proved more divisive than those of the past. The tech bosses, money men and well-educated workers who have flocked to San Francisco have been called ""some of the most ruthless capitalists around,"" and they have transformed the city's character in a few short years.""The historic power center, the traditional political interests in San Francisco have been destabilized by tech becoming very political in San Francisco,"" said San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin. ""Historically, the landlord industry had power in the city, the traditional Chamber of Commerce had power. But all of them have been eclipsed by the tech juggernaut. It’s as simple as money.""Privately held Airbnb -- a website that lets people rent their homes and apartments to travelers -- is one such recent example of the tech industry's political influence. During the last election cycle, the company spent more than $9 million to defeat a measure seeking to expand regulation over the firm's activities in the city (illegal rentals make up 76% of the listings, according to a local news report). Its opponents spent less than $500,000. Ultimately the company defeated the legislation.And according to city data, Airbnb recently added $245,000 to its campaign war chest, days after elected officials announced another legislative effort to more tightly regulate short-term rentals -- the bread and butter of Airbnb's sales. The company did not respond to several requests for comment. Sf.citi, a nonprofit lobby group backed by tech companies and venture capitalists, also declined to comment.To be sure, Airbnb's business model relies on friendly legislation more than most others do, but the dollar amount of the contributions has raised eyebrows.The tech industry was largely unwilling to discuss the issue on the record with IBD, though some firms issued prepared statements that pointed out charitable donations and volunteer work performed by the companies and their employees.Twitter (TWTR) declined to make executives available for comment but provided IBD with a written statement, as did Salesforce (CRM) and privately held ride-hailing app Uber. Like Uber, Twitter and Salesforce are based in San Francisco. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is a San Francisco native, and his father ran a chain of apparel stores. However, the company would not make Benioff available for comment.Cisco Systems (CSCO), Facebook, PayPal (PYPL) and privately held companies Dropbox and Stripe are among those that, through spokespersons, declined to comment.But for people in certain jobs, it's not easy to avoid commenting on a hot-button issue. Jim Lazarus, senior vice president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Salesforce's charitable contributions as an example of how a number of tech companies are giving back to the community. (Salesforce.com, Alphabet (GOOGL) and many tech companies are members of the S.F. Chamber.) But he acknowledged that the younger people employed by tech companies are, in general, ""not as engaged"" in the community as some would like, though he expressed hope that would change.Lazarus concedes there is a divide, stemming from the significant wage disparity between those employed in high-pay tech and those not so employed.""That's tech in California,"" he said.Lazarus says it's wrong to look at the divide solely through the narrow lens of technology. He says big job growth in sectors such as biotech, health care and education also contribute to the income inequality. And he notes that the services industries also bring some higher-paying jobs for lawyers, accountants and others. ""There is a significant professional service economy,"" he said.Regardless of the complexities of the divide, city residents often express frustration with the high cost of living by protesting -- either in court or on the street -- one of the most visible symbols of the tech industry's supposed hubris: the commuter shuttle. The shorthand is ""Google buses,"" but they are not just shuttles provided by Alphabet's Google.""At least once a week, someone on the street makes an obscene gesture toward our shuttle,"" Genentech employee Michael Stevens wrote to the Board of Supervisors in an email obtained through a public records request by IBD. ""I don't understand this, but I think that kind of behavior is typical of those who resent the shuttles.""IBD obtained more than 1,200 pages of documents about the shuttles, which included dozens of complaints from residents, unions and neighborhood associations. At their core, the idea of the shuttles is to reduce freeway traffic -- which is legendary in Silicon Valley -- as well as pollution, while also providing a perk to tech employees, of course.Google's liaison to the San Francisco government, Rebecca Prozan, declined to comment, referring IBD to the press unit, which did not respond to multiple email messages.Of the buses, Lazarus says that they're a sign that San Francisco is highly desirable place in which to live. ""It's a problem most American cities would love to have,"" he said.The shuttles are often the target of derision, however, and longtime city residents say they helped change the character of the neighborhoods, along with the new residents who have moved in.""It's a top-down, structured environment,"" Erich Werner said, referring to how new communities are being planned. Werner is an electrical contractor who has lived in the city for 32 years. ""What would keep a hamster happy? In this case, the hamster would need a restaurant, some place to party, some kind of light rail to take them there. All the attention is geared toward analysis and addressing perceived needs of a demographic. That's conceptual and literal engineering.""More than changing neighborhoods, the influx of young, well-educated tech workers has created a new breed of tech companies that serve a niche of customers in a city that in many ways is not representative of the broader market. ""There are a lot of products and services being created for San Francisco, and I'm not sure that's sustainable,"" said Myles Weissleder, who has lived in the Bay Area and worked in technology since the 1990s. He's founder of SFNewTech, which puts together monthly networking events focused on technology.""Are there efficiencies in private transportation services?,"" he said. ""Certainly. But there are impacts on neighborhoods, there are costs -- all of those little things are impacts, they are unforeseen consequences.""Despite increasing wariness among venture capitalists to fund startups, rents keep rising, and business carries on as usual. But even people connected to the technology industry feel some uncertainty.""These companies will run out of steam,"" Weissleder said, ""and I foresee some kind of shake-up as the money dries up.""

504,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL) shares fell Thursday, after the digital payments giant's investor day showcased ambitious plans but failed to alleviate Wall Street's fears of competition.Management emphasized the breadth of the platform, covering not only the traditional online payment capability but newer technologies at point of sale, ATMs, social media and customized applications for merchants. Executives hope to entice consumers to put more of their spending through PayPal by offering budgeting and money-management capabilities, while enticing merchants with the PayPal Credit offering.The OneTouch payment app has also taken off as a response to the increasing number of purchases made over mobile phones. Management also discussed the rise of ""contextual commerce,"" the trend toward technologies predicting consumer buying habits and bringing products to the consumer rather than the consumer going out and seeking them.Repeatedly, they pointed to the sheer size of PayPal's network, after 17 years of existence, as bringing a key advantage over competing platforms in penetrating these new markets. However, Pacific Crest analyst Josh Beck wasn't so sure.""PayPal highlighted a dramatic shift in commerce, underscored by diverging performance at Target (TGT) and Amazon (AMZN), which creates opportunity and risk,"" Beck wrote in a research note. ""Whether PayPal will be able to retain its competitive moat as Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Stripe and Visa (V) focus on mobile and contextual commerce remains unclear to us.""Beck retained a sector weight rating on PayPal stock.Management affirmed previous financial guidance, including that profit margins will be ""stable to up."" Pretax margins took a definite hit last year as the company has invested in new projects, such as the recently acquired financial-remittance company Xoom.""While we believe management did an exceptional job explaining Paypal’s differentiation (serving both consumers and merchants; expanding relevance by providing solutions from Braintree, Paydiant, PayPal, Xoom and Credit), an intensifying competitive landscape, combined with the company’s margin outlook remain our biggest concerns,"" wrote Sterne Agee CRT analyst Moshe Katri in a research note affirming his neutral rating.Credit Suisse analyst Paul Condra, who holds a buy rating on the stock, emphasized the positive.""Our conviction on the stock was strengthened from (1) commentary that the credit business is not more than high single digits percent of profit (well below speculation of around 25%) and will likely not grow beyond 2% to 3% of payment volume; and (2) increased visibility on growth outlook as management expects to double payment volume in four years, implying 20% total payment volume growth through 2019,"" Condra wrote.PayPal stock fell 3.4% to 37.65 on the stock market today. It was seventh straight decline for the stock, which is now below entry points at 40.03 and 38.62.Apple stock fell 0.4% Thursday, while Visa dipped 0.7% and Amazon climbed 0.15%.RELATED: Apple Pay Rival MCX, Visa Loom At PayPal Analyst Day

505,PYPL,"Delays and staff cuts at Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), a mobile payments consortium, will likely boost Apple Pay, while PayPal (PYPL) management’s view on MCX’s woes should be a hot topic at PayPal's analyst day on Wednesday.MCX said Tuesday it will cut 30 jobs and again delay the launch of its mobile app, a potential rival of Apple (AAPL) Pay and others. MCX has been courting retailers, Apple, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, PayPal, Samsung, Visa (V) and others in the mobile payments space. Wal-Mart (WMT) has been MCX's main backer.PayPal will be hosting its first analyst day following its 2015 spinoff from eBay (EBAY) last year. The event will be held in San Jose, Calif. PayPal recently launched its redesigned mobile app, which works on Apple iPhones and Android-based devices, in 145 countries.While Apple and MCX were rivals, PayPal has aimed to partner with different players in mobile payments. PayPal in March 2015 acquired Paydiant, which had close ties to MCX and retailers.MCX had aimed to reduce the clout of credit card firms in the nascent mobile payments business, analysts say. Prior to the latest MCX announcement, Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar said in a research report that PayPal’s relationship with Visa and MasterCard (MA) was one area of interest heading into its analyst day.At Jefferies, analyst Jason Kupferberg was also hoping for an update on Visa.“PayPal’s relationship with Visa remains a topic of interest for the Street, but we wouldn't be surprised if there is limited commentary at the analyst day on this topic, given ongoing negotiations,” Kupferberg wrote in a report.Prior to the eBay spinoff, PayPal acquired Braintree, a mobile payment service, and Venmo, a hybrid mobile payment app and social network for millennials.Daniel Perlin, an analyst at RBC Capital, expects mobile to be a big theme at PayPal’s analyst day. “We believe management will outline its plans to shift from its legacy e-commerce platform into a leading mobile-first platform for payments, with its Braintree asset being front and center.”

510,PYPL,"The past decade felt like a volatile period that constantly sent investors scrambling in pursuit of safe havens. But there were still long stretches in which the market notched gains.One result was that growth mutual funds outperformed value funds, more of which traditionally invest in defensive and higher-yield stocks. Growth mutual funds averaged a 6.20% annual gain over the past 10 years. Value funds averaged a more modest 5.38%.Value funds did outperform for much of the financial meltdown period in 2007, 2008 and 2009. But financial services stocks -- the bulk of which fall into the value camp -- got clobbered during the downturn. In quarters in which growth funds outperformed, they tended to outperform by more than value funds did when they outperformed.Value funds led the way in Q1 -- and have led so far in Q2 -- but it hasn't been by enough to catch up to growth funds. If you had invested $10,000 in a cross-section of growth funds on March 31, 2006, after 10 years your money would have grown into $18,775. The same amount invested in a cross-section of value funds would have risen to $17,687.In those 10 years, the now-$12.2 billion Fidelity OTC Fund (FOCPX) was one of the best performing growth funds. It racked up a 10.28% average annual gain. The S&P 500 averaged a 6.91% yearly return in that span.Managed by Gavin Baker since mid-2009, the large-cap growth fund had 92% of its shareholders' money in U.S. stocks as of Feb. 29. Technology was its biggest sector by far, with a 57% weighting. Health care was next, with a 17% weighting.Facebook (FB) has been a key contributor recently. Shares are up 33% off their Jan. 20 low. The stock gapped up Thursday when the company reported earnings-per-share growth of 83%. EPS grew 16%, 33% and 46% in the prior three quarters, respectively.Trading around 119, Facebook is just above its 117.09 buy point.Facebook's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved slightly to D from E. That shows that that deep-pocketed institutional investors like mutual funds aren’t participating wholeheartedly in buying shares. That could change if the stock’s up-on-volume days start outnumbering its down-on-volume days.

511,PYPL,"Mobile ads continue to generate strong returns for the social network.PayPal (PYPL) is another recent contributor. Shares are up 25% since their Jan. 20 low.PayPal is below its 40.03 buy point, as gains sparked by its earnings report last week fade. There's no sell signal, but it's important for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average, which it is testing now.So far, the 38.62 entry is holding up. The eBay (EBAY) spinoff is one of the leading players in the electronic payments industry.Nvidia (NVDA) is a third recent contributor. It's up 42% off a Feb. 11 closing low.The share price is extended from a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point.EPS grew a respective 13%, 18% and 21% the past three stanzas.All three of those stocks have IBD Composite Ratings in the 90s.

515,PYPL,"Shares of the self-proclaimed ""future of money"" payments giant PayPal (PYPL) rose Thursday after the company late Wednesday posted Q1 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street views, as did its sales outlook, earning praise from a number of analysts.PayPal stock was up 2.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, above 41 and surpassing a 40.03 buy point, after the earnings beat.

Perlin raised his price target on PayPal stock to 46 from 42.Wedbush analyst Gil Luria bumped his price target to 47 from 45. In a research note, Luria wrote that accelerating growth and market share gains -- especially in mobile -- set PayPal apart from others. The payments space, however, has attracted a bevy of big tech rivals, including Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.""We believe competitive concerns continue to be exaggerated, considering completing solutions have all failed to get through PayPal’s incumbency on both consumer and merchant side for the last two to 10 years,"" Luria wrote.BTIG analyst Mark Palmer reiterated his buy rating, saying PayPal is one of the most ""direct means by which investors can participate in the rapid global growth of mobile payments and e-commerce.""Palmer said competitive concerns about Apple Pay moving to Safari, Apple's Web browser -- thereby making it simple for shoppers to make purchases with the technology within the browser -- would hard to gauge for ""some time.""Palmer  wrote that it remains to be seen whether PayPal will be able to make much money from Venmo, its peer-to-peer payments app.But Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg said the Venmo pilot -- allowing Venmo customers to pay with Venmo at a small number of merchants -- was ""well received,"" and the company plans to accelerate its deployment.
"
516,PYPL,"Going solo suits PayPal (PYPL). The payments giant Wednesday beat analyst Q1 revenue and earnings estimates, sending shares rising after hours, as Q2 sales guidance edged views and EPS guidance met expectations.Delivered after the market close, PayPal said it logged $2.54 billion in Q1 sales, up 19% from the year-earlier quarter, while earnings per share minus items rose 28% to 37 cents. It's the third straight quarter PayPal has beat earnings estimates. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $2.5 billion and 35 cents.""Our first-quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our global payments platform to attract and engage consumers, increasing our global scale and in turn attracting new merchants and partners to PayPal,"" CEO Dan Schulman said in the earnings release.For Q2, the payments company expects revenue to rise 16% to 18%, to $2.57 billion-$2.62 billion. The company estimates EPS ex items at 34 cents to 36 cents, up from 33 cents in Q2 2015. Wall Street had modeled $2.57 billion and 35 cents.The company reiterated its full-year guidance of sales growth of 16% to 19% and non-GAAP earnings of between $1.45 and $1.50. In 2015, sales rose 15% and EPS ex items came in at $1.30.PayPal said it increased its total active accounts 2% to 184 million from the 179 million it reported in its Q4 results. In Q4, the company added 6.6 million accounts, up 3% over Q3.PayPal says now has 14 million merchants using the platform, up from 13 million in Q4, with new merchants that include Panera Bread (PNRA) and Crate and Barrel. And PayPal said it added new countries and merchants in its partnership with China e-commerce giant Alibaba's (BABA) Alibaba Wholesaler unit.In its earnings release, the company said it continues ahead on its plans to monetize Venmo, the company's peer-to-peer payments app popular with millennials. There is no charge for users, but the company has started to make its ""pay with Venmo"" option available to select merchants, charging fees to merchants for those transactions. It plans to expand the service to more merchants but hasn't given a timeline.The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which last July spun off from former parent eBay (EBAY), saw its stock rise 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company released its earnings. PayPal stock rose a fraction in Wednesday's regular session, to 40.01. The stock is just below a 40.03 buy point, but in buy range from a lower 38.62 entry.PayPal is an IBD Leaderboard stock, with a strong Composite Rating of 92, where 99 is the highest. Yet, PayPal competes with a bevy of tech leaders that have been expanding into payments and digital wallets, including companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Apple (AAPL).Since its spinoff from eBay, PayPal stock has dipped as low as 30 in last August to 41.75 in March, its highest point since touched 42.55 in its July 20 debut on Nasdaq.With more freedom, PayPal has taken on such initiatives as running a multimillion-dollar commercial in this year's Super Bowl  telecast.

520,PYPL,"With a potential $1 billion in 2016 revenue and $803 million in funding, e-tail startup Jet.com has some heft, but it's still a lightweight compared with e-tail king Amazon.com (AMZN).But that doesn't faze Jet CEO Marc Lore, who has a strategy, which he laid out for IBD in a phone interview from the company's Hoboken, N.J., headquarters. It boils down to two big ideas: that e-commerce overall will soar from a $300 billion market to $1 trillion in the next 10 years; and that Amazon can't possibly take the whole thing.His third point underlying both big ideas is that Jet is targeting shoppers that Amazon is not -- those obsessive about saving money.""We're going after a different type of customer with a different need,"" Lore said. ""We are about saving people money and empowering them to shop in a smarter way. And our technology is built to help consumers and retailers pull costs out of the overall ecosystem. So it is a more efficient way to buy product.""Jet aims to present shoppers with an experience that more closely matches what they'd find in a store. Every product, for example, has a single view. That's unlike e-tail giants like Amazon or eBay (EBAY), where shoppers are confronted with multiple, competing listings from a number of sellers. Instead Jet.com finds the best price for a given product after searching multiple sellers and displays.So, for example, in a search for Levi's jeans, a shopper would see a single listing for each style of jeans. The single product view may also help Jet.com avoid the SEO challenges that have plagued eBay, which has a longtime beef with search leader Google.But the real secret sauce for shoppers is the company's dynamic pricing. Essentially, customers are rewarded for buying multiple items, which decreases shipping costs and thus decreases customers' costs. Then, when the customer goes to check out, Jet's algorithm behind the scenes figures out which sellers are the most efficient in terms of shipping and price, so if one seller is closer but charges more for shipping, you'll buy from a more distant seller that charges less for shipping and thus results in a lower overall cost for the customer.""Our technology is built more like a real-time trading system than it is an e-commerce site,"" Lore said. ""As people shop, we're repricing products to reflect the true underlying economics of getting those products to the customer, based on what products are already in the (checkout) basket and based on how far away those products are from where the customer lives.""Jet continues to tweak its website. When Lore launched the venture in July 2015, the company used a membership program similar to Costco's (COST) to generate profit. That didn't last long, and the company changed its business model in October, hiking prices. Though there were reports the change signaled trouble, several analysts interviewed for this report said startups often make strategic changes early on.As shown by its fundraising and number of investors, Jet.com has its believers. Its venture money comes from China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firms such as General Catalyst Partners, and the venture units of financial powerhouses Goldman Sachs (GS) and Fidelity National Financial (FNF), among others. The company is valued at $1 billion, huge for any startup but a blip compared with Amazon's $286 billion market cap.Amazon has annual revenue topping $100 billion -- not including the more than $131 billion in third-party sales -- and is catching up to longtime No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). Amazon also has a nascent payments business that competes with PayPal (PYPL). To facilitate its e-commerce sales, the company has elected to get into the ocean shipping business, which has the potential to generate hundreds of millions in free cash flow. And that's just the e-tail business.Conventional wisdom holds that one strategy to beat Amazon is to pick and choose categories of goods that Amazon is not strong in. One, for example, is fashion -- though Amazon recently launched its own line of apparel and a live-streaming TV show. Alibaba-funded e-tail startup ShopRunner is taking aim at Amazon that way.Lore chose another route.In Lore's view of the e-commerce universe, mass market firms -- those competing across a range of product categories -- are the only viable firms. That's because, Lore says, whether a website is selling one category of products or 10, you need to push them ""through the same set of pipes."" And thus, he says, it makes more sense to leverage the same set of fixed costs to increase sales.""If you have 10 times as many categories and 10 times the gross marketplace value going through the same set of pipes, you're going to get a lot more leverage in your fixed expenses, and your expenses as a percentage of revenue is going to be a lot lower,"" Lore said. ""It makes it really difficult for the specialty guys to compete on price with mass merchants for that reason.""Lore himself has a fair bit of experience with Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos. As founder and former CEO of Quidsi, known for its Diapers.com, Lore spent years facing off against Amazon. Ultimately, Bezos killed Diapers.com with a price war -- the e-tail giant can afford to lose money for longer than its often smaller competitors -- and bought the company from Lore. The CEO stuck around for about three years but ultimately left in 2013.A little more than a year in, Jet.com remains one of the few e-tail companies in the U.S. that's openly challenging Amazon's dominance. With a run rate of $1 billion in gross merchandise value expected to be reached by the end of June -- a figure often very close to revenue for e-tail firms -- and 3.5 million registered shoppers, Lore already has taken Jet on a long flight, with a long runway ahead.

Shares closed Friday at 40.31, up a fraction on the day.Kupferberg, in a research note, also said that if PayPal and Visa (V) revise their operating agreement, it could be favorable for PayPal.Payments has evolved into a fiercely competitive sector, with some of the largest U.S. tech companies making inroads. Apple (AAPL) and Google, which is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), have both built digital wallet technologies. Square (SQ) -- which makes digital cash registers and processes payments -- also has created a technology that may eat into PayPal's top line.San Jose-based PayPal continues to rally after finding support at its 50-day moving average. Volume has been lackluster during its rebound, but not much different from when shares were falling. The stock is just above a 40.03 buy point and also is in buy range from a lower 38.62 entry.Image provided by Shutterstock.

525,PYPL,"Large-cap growth mutual funds outperformed large-cap value funds over the past decade. But they had to overcome a lead that the value-oriented funds initially held for several years.Large-cap growth funds did not take the lead decisively until the third quarter of 2013.Before that, when large-cap value funds outperformed, many of them got a tailwind from investors seeking the relative safe haven of funds holding stocks that paid dividends. Many funds like that are value-oriented.Overall, during the past 10 years large-cap growth funds averaged an annual return of 6.80%, according to Morningstar Inc.Large-cap value funds averaged a 5.39% yearly gain.If you had invested $10,000 on March 31, 2006, in a cross section of large-cap growth funds, after a decade your money would have ballooned into $19,504.The same amount invested in a cross-section of large-cap value funds would have grown to $17,259.That difference would have added a higher octane to your retirement plan's gas tank.In that decade, the now-$1.4 billion Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX) was the best-performing large-cap growth fund with $100 million or more in assets.It racked up an 11.17% average annual gain vs. just 7.17% for the S&P 500.What is it that revs Parnassus Endeavor's engine? Here are some of the keys.Managed by Jerome Dodson throughout that period, the fund had 91% of its shareholders' money at work in U.S. stocks as of March 31, 2016. Another 8% was in cash, and the balance was in foreign stock.Fifty-six percent of its holdings were large- and mega-cap stocks. Another 37% were midcaps. The balance were small caps.The fund's largest sector by far was technology, with a 55% weighting. The second-largest sector was industrials, with a 17% weighting. The fund had a 14% weighting in financial services.Health care and consumer defensive were the only other sectors in the portfolio. They had weightings of about 9% and 5% respectively.Is PayPal a buy or a sell?

526,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL) and its One Touch authentication technology lead all of its competitors in converting buyers online, according to a press release Tuesday from the company, referring to a study by market tracker ComScore.According to the ComScore study, shoppers that pick PayPal converted 87.5% of the time. The runner-up to PayPal was Visa (V), which had a conversion rate of 51.1%. ComScore lumped other competitors such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and MasterCard (MA)  into a single group that converted at 45.6%.In the study, conversion rate measures the percentage of shoppers at the checkout page that select a payment method and complete the purchase. The data are based on a behaviorally-tracked panel and measures panelist purchases on 15 retail domains in the U.S.The perceived friction of inputting all the necessary information -- name, address, credit card number, for example -- at checkout has been seen as a big issue for digital payments services, but the study results suggest PayPal has gone a long way toward solving this issue.IBD Take: PayPal is a Leaderboard stock and ranks high in almost all major metrics.PayPal rolled out its One Touch technology about a year ago. ""The results are really showing the success with the One Touch product,"" PayPal global head of product communications, Anuj Nayar, told IBD Tuesday.In its press release, PayPal touted the 21 million consumers who have opted-in to use One Touch.Visa did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.PayPal stock was down more than 1%, near 39, in midday trading on the stock market today. The stock is finding support at its 50-day moving average. Volume has been lackluster as shares bounce back, but not much different from when shares were falling. The stock is mildly below a buy point at 40.03 but also in buy range from a lower 38.62 entry.The San Jose-based company has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, where 99 is the highest.Photo above provided by Shutterstock.PayPal provided the below infographic with its release.

530,PYPL,"Venture capital firms raised $12 billion in the first quarter -- the largest amount in 10 years and double the amount raised in the previous two quarters combined -- despite growing doubts about startup valuations.The amount raised is a promising sign for entrepreneurs and startups that rely on venture capital funding to launch their companies and expand.The $12 billion was up 59% year over year and more than double that of the previous quarter, said the National Venture Capital Association, which reported numbers tallied by Thomson Reuters. It was the most raised in a quarter since $14.3 billion in Q2 2006.“While it’s unlikely for this strong pace to continue, we do expect this to be a solid fundraising year when all is said and done,” said Bobby Franklin, CEO of the National Venture Capital Association, in a statement.Investors in venture capital funds include pension funds, endowments, insurers, banks, corporations and rich individuals hoping to get above-average returns on their investments.Venture capital firms receive annual management fees as they invest in startups. The funded portfolios are typically active for about 7 to 10 years until profit is distributed to the portfolio investors. Venture capital firms also keep a percentage of the gains.The funding provided to venture capital firms comes even as the value of some highly valued startups has declined and as the market for initial public offerings has cooled. But the overall rate of return from VC portfolios is better than what it might seem.The 10-year return by venture funds for the period ended Sept. 30 was 11% versus 6.8% for the S&P 500 index and 7.9% for the Nasdaq composite, according to Cambridge Associates, a provider of investment advice and research.The largest recipient of funds in Q1 was Founders Fund VI portfolio, which raised $1.3 billion. The Founders Fund venture capital firm was launched by Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal (PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook (FB).Founders Fund is an investor in SpaceX, which has a multi-billion dollar contract to resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX also has numerous contracts for the launching of satellites. Founders Fund is also an investor in accommodations listing provider Airbnb and music streaming service provider Spotify.The second- and third-largest funding amounts, both receiving $1.2 billion, went to Norwest Venture Partners XIII and Accel Growth Fund IV.

531,PYPL,"Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos and Facebook (FB) investor Peter Thiel, as well as the CEOs of Boeing (BA) and Under Armour (UA) and a Tesla (TSLA) director were among those involved in notable insider trades this week.Peter Thiel, a longtime Facebook board member and one of the first to make a large investment in the social-media site, unloaded 857,626 company shares on Monday for $101 million. Thiel last sold Facebook shares in August.Thiel is also a venture capitalist who, along with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, helped found PayPal (PYPL).Other Facebook higher-ups shed shares in filings disclosed this week. Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer sold 20,000 shares valued at $2.3 million. CFO David Wehner disclosed the sale of 7,973 company shares. Director Jan Koum, founder of WhatsApp, continued to sell parts of his stake in the company, disclosing the sale of more than 2 million shares this week.The sales come after Facebook last week reported first-quarter results that breezed past analyst estimates and proposed a stock split that would create new Class C shares.Facebook shares rose 1.6% for the week.Microsoft co-founder and director Bill Gates disclosed the sale of 5.3 million company shares. Gates has sold off similar amounts over the years to fund the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other philanthropic efforts.The tech giant last month reported underwhelming quarterly results and tepid guidance. Sales in its Intelligent Cloud division, up 3%, outperformed slower growth in its More Personal Computing and Productivity segments.Microsoft shares added 1% this week.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos disposed of 1 million company shares this week, valued at $671 million.The sale follows Amazon's strong Q1 report last week. It also comes as the e-commerce giant leased 20 Boeing cargo jets from Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW), doubling the number of leased aircraft at Amazon's disposal. Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) in March said it worked out a deal to lease 20 Boeing freighter aircraft to Amazon.Amazon closed 2.2% higher vs. a week earlier.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg sold 8,700 company shares this week. Raymond Conner, Boeing's vice chairman and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, sold 8,109 company shares this week. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO and a recent addition to Boeing's board, bought 1,850 of the company's shares this week.Boeing last week delivered mixed Q1, with competition from Airbus (EADSY) and costs related to difficulties in developing the KC-46 refueling tanker weighing on profits.Boeing shares fell 1.1% for the week.Director Kimbal Musk, whose brother is Tesla CEO Elon Musk, sold 5,555 company shares this week.The electric automaker, in announcing Q1 results this week, said it hoped to produce 500,000 cars by 2018, two years faster than earlier forecasts, citing “overwhelming demand” for its Model 3 sedan. Tesla also hiked its capital spending forecast and targeted production of 1 million vehicles by 2020.Tesla shares sank 10.8% for the week amid doubts the company can reach its aggressive new targets.Under Armour founder and CEO Kevin Plank this week disclosed the sale of 200,000 recently-issued Class C shares. The disclosure came before the athletic apparel maker said that Chief Merchandising Officer Henry Stafford and Chief Digital Officer Robin Thurston would leave the company in July. Brad Dickerson, who was the company's CFO and COO, left earlier this year.Under Armour shares tumbled 11.9% for the week.Nike COO Eric Sprunk disclosed the sale of 135,764 company shares. Nike dipped 0.9% for the week.CEO David Aldrich sold 15,000 company shares this week. Skyworks (SWKS) is one of the chip suppliers for the Apple (AAPL) iPhone, but shares of it and other chipmakers have faltered amid concerns of lagging smartphone demand.Skyworks fell 3.3% for the week. Apple dipped 1.1%.Insider transactions don’t typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider’s holdings, however, can affect a stock.

532,PYPL,"What does it take to survive in a top job in a competitive, bottom-line industry? Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97% average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.And the fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories — U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests.IBD: What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry?Puglia: We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Categories' PerformanceWe paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like Amazon (AMZN) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis.IBD: What does ""Blue Chip"" in your fund's name say about your overall approach?Puglia: As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon ""worsified,"" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries.Home Depot (HD) is important to us, but so is Lowe's (LOW). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed.IBD: You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions?Puglia: We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and O'Reilly (ORLY) over a decade and Facebook (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by Roche (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth.IBD: Is Ross Stores (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters?Puglia: Historically, Ross and TJX Cos. (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time.IBD: PayPal (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy?Puglia: This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with Visa (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as Uber and Airbnb).IBD: Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become?Puglia: In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS’ margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that.IBD: Are you bothered by Broadcom's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth?Puglia: The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like Texas Instruments (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago).IBD: O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like?Puglia: They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise.AutoZone (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same.IBD: Does Constellation Brands' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions?Puglia: The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow.IBD: Some people love to doubt Facebook (FB). You like the stock, right?Puglia: Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18.IBD: Can Alaska Air (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the Virgin America (VA) takeover?Puglia: This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because JetBlue (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive.IBD: If you had a mentor, who was it?Puglia: I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, ""It can't innovate, it can't grow."" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.

533,PYPL,"In a bid to capture even more of the world's digital wallet, the company has announced the first overseas expansion of its PayPal (PYPL) Credit business -- essentially lending money to consumers at checkout.The move, announced Wednesday, will add pressure in the United Kingdom (where the feature was rolled out) to other payments options -- such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and its offering. PayPal Credit will offer 0% interest during the first four months for purchase amounts of 150 British pounds and higher, afterward subject to the standard variable interest rate, which is 17.9% at publication time.Limits will depend on each person's credit, which will take about 10 minutes.PayPal also faces competitive pressures from relatively new entrants into the digital wallet sector, Google with its Android Pay, and Apple (AAPL) Pay.Google is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL).PayPal stock fell a fraction to 38.64 on the stock market today. The stock is finding support at its 50-day moving average, a positive move just when the stock needed one. Volume, though, has been lackluster as shares bounce back. The stock is still below a potential buy point. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, where 99 is the highest.The U.K. is PayPal's second largest market outside of the U.S., according to Mashable, which notes that of nearly 180 million active customer accounts, 22 million are located in the United Kingdom.The program began in 2014 as a pilot with limited availability.The marketing messaging the company is using -- ""the future of money"" -- is consistent with its global advertising push after its spinoff from eBay (EBAY) in 2015. Thus far the campaign has included the firm's first-ever Super Bowl ad.

"
535,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL)and Visa (V) apparently are in talks about a possible partnership, but whether the companies can reach an agreement remains to be seen, investment bank SunTrust said Wednesday.At the moment, PayPal attempts to push its customers into using cheap funding sources such as direct access to bank accounts and funds stored in PayPal accounts. But, should the company strike a deal with Visa (or MasterCard (MA)) and present credit cards as an equal option, the company would likely see a $300 million transaction-expense increase, SunTrust analyst Robert Peck wrote in a research note.To offset the increased expense, Peck says PayPal would have to either negotiate for some kind of expense offset, see a 7% lift in payment volume funded by credit cards, or see a 3% lift in volume from its cheapest funding sources.San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal, through a spokesperson, declined to comment.PayPal stock was up about 2%, below 39, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. PayPal found support at its 50-day moving average Wednesday, a positive move just when the stock needed one. The stock is still below a buy point at 40.03 but above a 38.62 entry. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, where 99 is the highest, putting it among the top 9% of all stocks on key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.In his research note, Peck upped his price target on PayPal stock to 44 from 38, citing better market conditions. Peck maintained a buy rating on the stock.Peck says that there are ""breadcrumbs"" that indicate a solid Q1 for the company. PayPal is set to report results April 27 after the close.Last week, e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN) announced new features for its languishing payments platform that take aim at PayPal, and rivals such as Square (SQ).
"
536,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL) subsidiary Braintree managed to nab e-tail startup Jet.com, a rising Amazon.com (AMZN) rival, as a client because of its security features, pricing and service, a Jet.com executive said.Katie Finnegan, head of corporate development, told IBD that payments firm Braintree is ""very startup friendly"" and that the PayPal company has a ""clear development roadmap.""""These were all purely commercial impulses,"" Finnegan said, who added that Braintree was willing to implement security features that Jet.com was interested in.""I think they've been a good partner that has supported us as we've grown pretty exponentially since launch,"" she said.Privately held Jet.com had a number of payments services options besides Braintree, including developing its own payments technology, which is the route Amazon.com has taken.Square (SQ), a digital cash register and payments processor, recently announced that it was adding functionality that would allow nearly any website to use it to process payments. Square's clients are mostly small and midsize companies.New Jersey-based Jet.com raised $618 million in a Series B funding round that closed in November.The company has more than 3.5 million registered users as of January and says that as of next month its gross merchandise value -- a figure often very close to revenue for e-com firms -- will be at a $1 billion run rate.PayPal stock was flat, near 38.25, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Shares are below a 40.03 entry and an earlier entry at 38.62.
"
537,PYPL,"While working at Goldman Sachs, Eyal Fruchtman says he saw first hand a fundamental flaw with the world’s financial system: It was great at serving the wealthy, but it wasn't so great at serving anybody else. The stock market was inscrutable, an algorithmic trap door scaring away a younger generation that came of age during the financial crisis and wasn’t saving money.Hoping to make saving and investing easier and more appealing, Fruchtman began developing a no-fee mobile app several years after leaving Goldman in 2007. That app, called Clink, is geared toward younger, novice investors making smaller, lower-risk investments.“We drop the barrier of entry to basically $5 to nothing,” he told IBD.Fruchtman is among the whirlwind of entrepreneurs in financial technology, or fintech, that could leave your local bank branch in a splintered heap of obsolete teller windows and send millions of bank employees out in the cold. But the upstarts promise a new world of lending, investing and paying that's as quick and easy as tapping your phone screen.Clink, which launched in January, offers an automated investing plan connected to your bank and credit card accounts. You can add to your portfolio on a regular schedule or funnel a little money to it every time you make a purchase with your credit card. When you dine out, for example, the app could transfer an ""earmark"" from your checking account to your Clink account, Fruchtman says. From there, the money is invested into a portfolio of six exchange traded funds. And with that, you’re an investor.Within the app, you can adjust how much money you contribute and how often, and you can rebalance your portfolio. Fruchtman hopes to later expand Clink into IRAs and loan refinancing. Another opportunity could be cash-back deals set up with retailers, with some money going to the company and some into users' savings.Along with the small startups storming the banking scene, fintech brings digital and mobile payments provider PayPal (PYPL), online peer-to-peer lenders like On Deck Capital (ONDK), LendingClub (LC) and Prosper, and payment systems from Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.Citigroup analysts estimate that investments in private fintech companies worldwide ballooned to $19 billion last year from $1.8 billion in 2010. As banking becomes more automated and banks slash costs, staff cuts could hit 30% in the next 10 years, they say. The bank branch on the street corner might take on an entirely different character.""Fintech is changing the world of finance. In the U.S. and Europe, we are at a tipping point, especially in consumer banking,"" Citi said in a 112-page report in March. ""To remain competitive, banks need to get innovation before the fintech companies get scale.""Big banks have taken notice. Goldman Sachs (GS) has tried to brand itself as more of a tech company. Barclays (BCS) CEO Antony Jenkins has said that the world of finance has reached its ""Uber moment."" JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned last year, ""Silicon Valley is coming,"" adding that fintech alternatives to banking are ""very good at reducing the 'pain points' in that they can make loans in minutes, which might take banks weeks.""The tone of alarm seems to have softened this year, says Jerry Silva, IDC’s global banking research director. Banks that might have been calling for stricter scrutiny of fintech startups are cozying up to them.JPMorgan has partnered with online lender On Deck to help fast-track loans to businesses, even as On Deck makes loans elsewhere. Bank of America (BAC) and Barclays have tried to woo fintechs through summits and accelerator programs.Analysts see this partnership amid competition continuing. After all, companies like peer-to-peer lenders depend on a bank operating behind them to oversee underwriting and financing. And banks actually want to concede the traditional banking experience and get their brands on customers' phones, Silva said.Big banks, often hamstrung by regulations compliance and their own infrastructure, must show investors that they can stay relevant. And startups need the exposure and resources that big banks already have.""The 'industrialists' need innovation, and the 'innovators' need industrialization,"" Greg Baxter, Citi's global head of digital strategy, said in the firm's report. That need extends across commercial banks to investment banks and to banks that process credit card transactions for businesses.""You mentioned the term 'frenemy'?"" Barclays analyst Darrin Peller said. ""That's exactly what's happening -- everyone's sort of realizing they have to work together.""Amid the upheaval, the bank down the street from you could disappear or, at least, look a lot different.“I think the routine stuff that consumers don’t want to do in physical fashion is the stuff that you can take out of the branch,” said Mark Schwanhausser, director of omnichannel financial services at research firm Javelin.While bank branches are expanding in developing economies to engage swaths of the population that don’t have bank accounts, branches will likely shrink in the developed world, Citi says. It’s already happening in Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands, where bank-branch density has plummeted by 40% to 50% over the past decade.The branches that do remain could focus more on advisory services for bigger financial matters, Citi’s report said. It noted that Virgin Money, which serves the U.K., South Africa and Australia, has turned its branches into lounge-like locations where ""customers can meet, relax and even have a cup of coffee.""But U.S. banks, as we know them, could stick around longer than those in Europe for a number of reasons.For one, analysts say, bank branches don’t exist just for customer service. They exist also for brand recognition.And customers, even millennials, tend to open accounts at the bank with an ATM that's closest to their home or office -- even if they never walk into that branch location, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria says. Most millennials still prefer to open an account via an “employee-assisted location,” Silva says.With mobile payments still a relatively small share of transactions, customers may prefer a combination of services.“The issue now is how to make all those work well together so that a customer at any given time, with any given transaction, under different circumstances, can choose: Do I want to be at a branch? Do I want to be on my mobile device? Do I want to be at a call center?” Schwanhausser said.But with more data from people's financial lives being whisked between devices and accounts, a lengthy debate about data use is certain to accompany the opportunities. You can expect the business, regulatory and security communities all to play a vocal part.And while analysts say that fintech is essential to making finance easier and more inclusive, warnings about the industry are growing louder.Mark Tluszcz, CEO at venture capital firm Mangrove Capital Partners, told Business Insider in April that all ""the bad habits of humans"" will be on display in fintech during the coming years. The former chair of the Financial Services Authority in the U.K., Lord Adair Turner, told the BBC that the peer-to-peer lending industry was bound to crash, making ""the worst bankers look like absolute lending geniuses.""The average interest rates from LendingClub and Prosper range from 12.6% to 15.3%, Citi found, with average loan sizes ranging from $11,400 to $14,000. Those companies make up a sliver of overall lending, but more people could be plunged into debt that they can't repay if lenders expand the size of the loans or try to draw borrowers with lower-quality credit.On the flip side, Schwanhausser says, regulators will have to be on the lookout for issues like high-tech redlining that exclude classes of borrowers.Investment in fintech will likely fall amid oversaturation, Silva predicts. And some small companies will likely fail, get bought up or get squashed as giants dive deeper into fintech. Luria warns that investors face ""a very big risk"" that new lending products will collapse and damage them.For his part, Clink's Fruchtman notes that fintech can open up information that provides a robust understanding of the borrower.""So we have a read on your bank account, we have a read on your credit card, and you gave us the basic information about you -- how much you make and so on,"" he said. ""We have a pretty strong financial profile. If we supplement with a FICO score, it’s a really, really solid profile.""For now, U.S. regulators appear willing to let fintech develop with little interference, though that could change in the event of a high-profile data breach or fraud, such as the alleged $7.6 billion Ponzi scheme recently uncovered at a peer-to-peer lender in China.The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency said in March that it wanted to work toward regulations that fostered ""responsible innovation."" It laid out a plan to encourage ""banks of all sizes to integrate responsible innovation into their strategic planning.""So how far could fintech developments go? Baxter, in Citi's report, described a coming wave of “ 'industrial fintech’ -- where financial transactions and ultimately decisions will become incorporated into 'things.’ ""He also talked about the prospect of a Fitbit (FIT) ""of your financial life, so that your collective financial well-being is being monitored, managed and personally trained continuously.""And eventually, analysts say, insurance policies will adjust more quickly to our driving habits, and smart meters on homes might ""negotiate,"" perhaps more impartially than humans can, with a utility in a real-time back-and-forth, allowing for more precise pricing and payment.""At some point, when your refrigerator wants to order milk, it’s gonna have to pay for it,"" Luria said. He added: “That has to involve fintech. ... For the Internet of Things to really do the kinds of things that people are talking about, there has to be a mechanism for there to be an exchange of value.”

538,PYPL,"Major averages were mixed early Thursday, as pressure from overseas markets supplemented reaction to earnings reports and a weak Q1 GDP estimate.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.4%, the S&P 500 gave up 0.2% and the Nasdaq edged higher.The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to hold interest rates unchanged appeared to be a mild positive for stocks.The stock market today received a mixed early nudge from the Labor Department, which estimated Q1 GDP growth at 0.5%. That was a sharp drop from Q4's 1.4% growth and just below consensus projections for a 0.7% gain. The GDP price index, which gauge's inflation, rose 0.7%, below views for a 0.9% increase.The Labor Department also said unemployment claims climbed to 257,000 in the week ended April 23, up from 248,000 in the prior week, but below estimates for 260,000 claims. The four-week moving average ticked lower to 256,000 --  its lowest level since 1973.Oil traded flat early Thursday after rising 3% Wednesday to leave West Texas Intermediate just above $45 a barrel. Gold gained almost 1%, to above $1,258 an ounce.  Bonds rose, sending the 10-year yield down 2 basis points to 1.83%.The dollar traded lower, particularly against the yen, which spiked sharply after the Bank of Japan surprisingly announced no change to its current stimulus program. The decision sent Tokyo's Nikkei 225 down 3.6%. China's markets closed narrowly mixed, but the losses in Japan spun out into trading in Europe. Eurozone markets traded down more than 1% in afternoon trading. London's FTSE 100 was down 0.9%.UnitedHealth (UNH) bucked the trend in the Dow, rising 0.6%. Early laggards included DuPont (DD), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC).Medical deal news made early headlines.St. Jude Medical (STJ) spiked 25% after Abbott Labs (ABT) agreed to buy the St. Paul, Minn.-based heart device maker in a deal valued at $25 billion. Abbott shares slipped 7%.San Francisco-based biomed Medivation (MDVN) jumped 7% after news reports said France's Sanofi (SNY) offered to buy the company in a $9.3 billion deal.

Facebook gapped up over a 117.09 buy point early Thursday.Losses were equally dramatic. Cybersecurity outfit Symantec (SYMC) lost 6% in early action. The Mountain View, Calif., company lowered its fiscal Q4 sales and earnings guidance, and it announced the resignation of CEO Michael Brown, who will continue to act as chief executive until a successor is found, the company said.PayPal (PYPL) added nearly 3% after a positive Q1 report late Wednesday. The stock has been fighting to get some lift from an alternate entry at 40.03.O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) fell furthest, down nearly 4%. The auto parts chain reported late Wednesday its Q1 sales and earnings topped consensus forecasts. But management guided Q2 earning below expectations.Nutritional supplement chain GNC (GNC) dived 26% after delivering a Q1 miss on its earnings, while revenue slipped slightly less than expected. Full-year EPS guidance was below prior guidance and far below consensus views. Management cited challenges in the company's vitamin lines and said the challenges would continue for the remainder of the year. GNC had managed a 54% climb off a January low through Wednesday, but remained well below an August high.

539,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL), now untied from its prior owner eBay (EBAY), does not face a serious competitive threat in the near future, an analyst said Wednesday.At the Electronic Payments Summit in New York, panelists were ""generally bullish"" on the San Jose, Calif.-based company's chances at holding on to its market share, according to a research note from Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg. The analyst cites the company's installed base of 185 million consumers and 13 million merchants.""This represents a competitive advantage, which is reinforced by new products such as One Touch and Venmo,"" Kupferberg wrote. ""While some large merchants are still somewhat ambivalent about the benefits of PayPal, one panelist highlighted a 14% online sales increase for a big merchant once they implemented PayPal.""Kupferberg also wrote that large merchants are generally reluctant to have more than two checkout buttons or digital wallets available for shoppers because returns ""diminish beyond that number.""Competitors in payments, such as e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN) and digital cash register and payments processor Square (SQ), have been aiming for a greater foothold in payments.Amazon has been at it for some time, but with little to show for it, according to Wedbush analyst Gil Luria.For its part, Square announced last week that it was adding Web checkout capabilities to its array of features, which is likely a direct challenge to PayPal's payments platform.Also at the payments summit, Kupferberg wrote that 10% mobile wallet penetration of U.S. in-store payments could be five years away. Firms such as Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, among others, have developed such technology.PayPal stock was up more than 1%, near 39, in midday trading on the stock market today. PayPal is an IBD Leaderboard stock and has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, where 99 is the highest. Shares are below a 40.03 entry but just above an earlier entry at 38.62.

540,PYPL,"Stocks were mostly quiet as the regular trading session wrapped up Tuesday, but some big names got slammed after hours.The S&P 500 held an 0.2% gain, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.1%, and the Nasdaq gave up 0.2%. Volume swelled across the board vs. Monday, according to preliminary numbers.Car sellers, home furnishings retailers and energy stocks were among the top gainers in today’s stock market action. Oil stocks got a boost as West Texas intermediate crude bounced back up 3% to near $44 a barrel. Biotech, Internet and software stocks lagged.DuPont (DD) led the Dow with a 2% advance after its Q1 earnings topped estimates and the diversified giant raised its full-year outlook. Shares gapped up near a four-month high in above-average volume.Procter & Gamble (PG) was the biggest blue-chip loser, sliding more than 2% in heavy trade, close to a three-month low. The maker of Tide, Pampers and Olay reported fiscal Q3 earnings and revenue that beat views but fell 3% and 7%, respectively, from the same quarter a year earlier.Ethan Allan Interiors (ETH) led home furnishing retailers with an 11% spike in robust trade to its highest level in years. It reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results. Shares are now extended past a 32.20 cup-with-handle buy point.On the IBD 50, fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) rose 3%, while Universal Display (OLED) and discount chain Five Below (FIVE) each added 2%. Whirlpool (WHR) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) underperformed, down 4% each.After the close, Apple (AAPL) crashed 7% after its fiscal Q2 results missed on both the top and bottom lines, and iPhone sales fell 16% to 51.2 million. Shares are poised to breach their 50-day moving average, where they closed during the regular session on an 0.7% decline.Also down late on earnings reports were Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), down 2%, and Twitter (TWTR), which plunged 11% on a revenue miss and soft Q2 outlook. However, eBay (EBAY) rose 2% after hours on an upside profit and sales surprise.On the economic front, March durable goods orders improved from February’s revised figures but fell well short of forecasts. The S&P/Case-Shiller home price index for February just missed views, as did consumer confidence for April.Economic reports due Wednesday include pending home sales for March and the weekly MBA mortgage applications and petroleum status report.

541,PYPL,"Mighty e-commerce firm Amazon.com (AMZN) is launching its payments service on several platforms that cater to small and midsize businesses, the company said Monday.Called the Global Partner Program, the new business will allow firms that build e-tail storefronts on the platforms Amazon is partnering with to integrate the ""Pay With Amazon"" feature. Pay With Amazon aims to reduce any friction when checking out online. By logging in with Amazon, shoppers don't have to enter a 16-digit credit card number and other billing details.Rival payments firms such as PayPal (PYPL) have been working on reducing friction at checkout for years.Partners in Amazon's Global Partner Program include Japan-based FutureShop, France-based PrestaShop and Canada-based Shopify (SHOP).Amazon stock fell nearly 1%, to 593.19, on the stock market today. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, where 99 is the highest. Amazon stock is forming a cup base, with a buy point of 696.54, after touching a seven-month low of 474 in early February.The new payments program ""could help Amazon reach a much larger audience of merchants,"" Colin Sebastian, an analyst with Robert W. Baird, told IBD via email. ""However, I believe there are still channel conflicts that may exist with allowing Amazon to see transaction data. In fact, Shopify and others already have relationships with payment platforms such as PayPal and Stripe. As such, it may still be an uphill battle for Amazon payments to gain a lot more traction with merchants.""That said, Amazon does have a lot of customers who may wish to use Amazon payments, and the plus side for merchants would be higher transaction volumes.""Wedbush analyst Gil Luria says Amazon has struggled for years to make headway in the payments business against firms such as PayPal.Apple (AAPL) and Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), also have entered the payments sector with digital wallet technologies that revolve around use of cellphones for payments transactions.The Amazon announcement is hot on the heels of similar moves by PayPal and Square (SQ).On Wednesday, Square said it planned to add Web checkout capabilities to its payment processing product -- a direct challenge to much larger competitor PayPal, which has more than 13 million merchants vs. Square's 2 million.Also Wednesday, PayPal's Braintree unit -- which boasts that it processes payments for startups such as Airbnb, Jet.com and Uber -- announced that it was partnering with several all-in-one e-commerce platforms, such as BigCommerce.
"
542,PYPL,"Amazon.com (AMZN), PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) are locked in a battle to win business from small and midsize businesses, according to recent announcements and a Bloomberg report.PayPal subsidiary Braintree is adding a service, Braintree Auth, that will allow merchants using all-in-one Web store builders such as BigCommerce to integrate Braintree more easily, the company wrote in a blog post Thursday.""Braintree shares our vision of enabling great e-commerce experiences for retailers all over the world,” said Troy Cox, senior product director at BigCommerce, which offers an all-in-one e-commerce Web platform. “With the launch of Braintree Auth, merchants have greater flexibility and more options to efficiently and securely run their businesses.""PayPal stock was up nearly 2%, above 39, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company is an IBD Leaderboard stock and has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, where 99 is the highest. The stock is below a 40.03 entry, trading just above an earlier entry at 38.62.Square stock was down 5.5% Friday afternoon, near 14.50. The company has a 59 CR, which measures key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.Though Braintree has been collaborating with partners such as BigCommerce for about a year, the announcement comes a day after Square said it was, for the first time, enabling anyone with a website to use Square to process a payment.Both Auth and Square aim their new website technologies at small and midsize companies. Such companies are Square's core market; the company has about 2 million merchants. PayPal has more than 13 million merchants.According to Bloomberg, e-commerce leader Amazon has been succeeding in attracting small and midsize businesses to Amazon Payments, the platform it re-launched in 2013.""There's a market for selling your soul to the devil,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria told Bloomberg. ""When you accept Amazon Payments, you get access to the coveted Amazon customers. The trade-off is you are opening your kimono to your biggest competitor.""Bloomberg says large retailers are unlikely to sign on because they do not want to give Amazon any such access to their customers and data.
"
543,PYPL,"If Google and its Hands Free payments app can achieve a critical mass of brick-and-mortar stores, other digital wallet companies and payments processors could find themselves facing tougher competition -- at least, based on my test of the app.Hands Free is designed to eliminate the need to pull out a smartphone and tap it on a point-of-sale system when paying with Android Pay. It uses a combination of your initials, phone and picture to complete each transaction. And it works. Well.Google, which is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), rolled out Hands Free in March to at least 15 businesses with locations around the South San Francisco Bay Area. Since IBD's Silicon Valley bureau is located near several, I decided to test the idea of ordering and paying for something with only my voice -- part of the future we've been promised.After taking a selfie -- a photo is required to use the Hands Free app -- on my Nexus 5X phone, I headed to a nearby McDonald's (MCD), one of the chains participating in the pilot program. A colleague in the newsroom wanted a Diet Coke, and I was happy to oblige. Phone in my pocket, I walked up to the cash register, placed my order for a medium Diet Coke and then uttered the phrase ""Can I pay with Google?""The cashier skipped a beat and replied, ""Of course you can! Initials?"" I replied with mine. ""M.C. Hammer!"" she said, and pressed a few more buttons on the register.""Wearing a hat today, I see,"" she said, studying my hatless selfie on the register. And then she handed the beverage over with a receipt (I got an emailed receipt as well). Neither my phone nor wallet ever left my pockets.My order was small and the test limited, but it's clear that the implications could be far-reaching if consumers take to the idea. If Hands Free were available widely, I would certainly use it -- paying with just your voice is incredibly easy (and cool, too).At its core, Hands Free takes a swing at a big issue in payments (and e-commerce in general): how to make checkout as frictionless as possible.PayPal (PYPL) and its most recent endeavor on that front, One Touch, also attacks the friction problem. Apple (AAPL) Pay and rival Android Pay are also trying to innovate around the friction Silicon Valley perceives in paying with cash, a credit card or a mobile phone.With Google running a relatively small pilot program, it's hard to say at this early stage what impact Hands Free will have on its digital wallet.I doubt that being able to pay with Hands Free would alter where I go to buy things, but it just might be enough to convince me to pick Android Pay over its competitors.

545,PYPL,"Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V) were all trading at or near buy points going into their quarterly earnings reports last night. But in what could be seen as a big letdown for investors, all four issued disappointing results and/or guidance, which has sent the stocks tumbling below key levels.Not only is this notable because of their big names, but also because most of them are highly rated by IBD. Alphabet currently earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, while Visa has a 92, and Starbucks has a 90. Microsoft has a Composite Rating of 73, meaning it outperforms 73% of all stocks based on fundamental and technical factors.IBD's Take: How do Alphabet, Microsoft, Starbucks, Visa measure up? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupAlphabet gapped down 5.4% in giant volume, breaching its 50-day line. It’s also triggering a sell signal, with shares now more than 5% below the cup-with-handle buy point at 777.41. The stock is trading 9% below its February high.Microsoft plunged 7.2% in heavy volume, with the stock breaking below the 50-day. Shares are now looking for support at the 200-day line. Microsoft was near its 56.95 buy point in Thursday’s session, but it's now trading 9% below that level.Starbucks is dropping below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages in quick turnover, losing 4.9%. Shares are trading 7% below a saucer-with-handle buy point at 61.74, and 10% below their October peak.And Visa is now below its 10-day line, falling 2.1% in fast trade. It’s still holding above the 50-day and 200-day lines, which recently crossed in a bullish manner. Shares are now 3% below their cup-base buy point at 81.11.Whether this is a trend that will continue throughout earnings season remains to be seen, but we will continue to update you as reports from Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and PayPal (PYPL) come in next week.

546,PYPL,"In recent years, no industry has provided shareholder activists with as many opportunities to force changes -- or generate financial gains -- as technology.In its Shareholder Activism 2015 report issued last November, Moody's found that 33% of the 178 shareholder activism cases it had tracked through Oct. 15 of last year focused on tech firms, far more than any other industry.Tech firms, ironically, can blame their successes as well as their failures for their preferred status among shareholder activists. The sector's growth potential attracts the hedge funds and equity investors that are less inclined to sit docilely on the sidelines.""You really have to have a stomach for it,"" said Gerry Granovsky, an analyst at bond rating firm Moody's Investor Service. ""A lot of it is confrontational. You have to not be afraid to ruffle feathers.""Where many of the most famous shareholder activism cases have focused on poorly managed companies that represented turnaround opportunities -- which does include a fair number of tech companies, to be sure -- many tech firms instead have been targeted for not sharing their riches enough.Granovsky points out that as the tech sector has demonstrated historic stability over the past 10 years, it has enjoyed growing access to debt. Meanwhile, as scores of tech firms have grown into thriving global businesses, many have amassed massive amounts of cash overseas and have chosen to keep it there rather than pay U.S. tax rates.It's that cash, and companies' explanations for hording it, that often attracts the attention of shareholder activists more than anything.""Activists don't care about policies. They see Apple having $216 billion in cash,"" Granovsky said. ""To some extent they have a point.""The activities of shareholder activists do at least potentially benefit a larger group of stakeholders, and shareholder activists do function as a sort of corporate watchdog, so they have to be willing to get dirty for the cause.After finding itself on the receiving end of pressure from big-name shareholder activists Carl Icahn and David Einhorn, Apple (AAPL) has in the past couple of years been returning cash to shareholders in programmatic fashion.Similarly, persistent pressure from activists helped spur ATM maker NCR (NCR) to embark on an effort to buy back $1 billion worth of stock, funded by a deal with Blackstone that gives the financial advisory firm three seats on NCR's board -- a deal activist investor and NCR shareholder P. Schoenfeld Asset Management has questioned.Targeting excess cash is not a new shareholder activism strategy. In fact, it appears to have been one of the original strategies.In his just released book, ""Dear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism,"" Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, traces shareholder activism back to the 1920s. Gramm explores a 1927 case in which economist and investor Benjamin Graham, considered the father of value investing, led an effort to get Northern Pipeline to release some of its stockpile of unused cash back to its shareholders.That strategy has been used against tech firms to great effect in recent years, with a number of companies succumbing to similar pressures. And Granovsky says that trend might not peak until interest rates rise, causing tech firms to slow their borrowing and instead start tapping those overseas cash reserves.No worries. Even if all the cash-rich tech companies start giving back to shareholders, there are always underperformers to turn around.Despite the stability in the tech market Granovsky points to, there are plenty of tech companies that have found themselves in activists' cross-hairs for other reasons. In 2013, Microsoft (MSFT) granted its first board seat to an activist -- ValueAct Capital -- after facing widespread criticism for being a step behind a series of emerging tech trends such as cloud computing and mobility.Last year, Qualcomm (QCOM) launched a ""strategic realignment plan"" after activist hedge fund Jana Partners began pressuring the company to spin off its struggling chip business from its profitable licensing business. Also last year, eBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal (PYPL) after pressure to do so from several activists, led by Icahn, who argued that both companies would perform better if separated.More recently, Yahoo (YHOO) has been girding itself for a battle with one of its biggest shareholders, activist Starboard Value, as the Internet giant has been unable to forge much revenue growth in the past decade.Consider the case of Motorola Solutions (MSI). Shareholder activists have besieged the company since 2007, when its former entity, Motorola, was embroiled in a series of legal skirmishes over allegations the company had made misleading financial statements. (It eventually split into two companies in 2011, establishing Motorola Solutions as a communications provider, while it spun off the cellphone business into a separate company, Motorola Mobility, acquired by Google in 2011 and then sold to China's Lenovo in 2014.)Between 2007 and 2015, Motorola granted board seats to shareholder activists Icahn and ValueAct, and also to private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners.Shep Dunlap, an investor relations spokesman at Motorola Solutions, spoke with IBD about the company's experience with ValueAct, describing the relationship as ""generally collaborative"" and nothing like the contentious battles for which other shareholder activists, such as Icahn, have become known.""Their approach has been much more constructive with management rather than using the press and media as a mouthpiece,"" says Dunlap said.He says ValueAct's objectives have been aligned with Motorola's leadership from the get-go, and that ValueAct's guidance has helped streamline the company. In particular, he cites more than $550 million in costs removed since 2012, and $12 billion returned to shareholders, mostly through stock buybacks.""There's been a lot of progress in terms of optimizing our cost structure,"" Dunlap said. ""We're really a pure-play mission-critical communications company at this point.""Naturally, ValueAct has profited from the relationship, and today still owns 4.7% of the company's stock, a stake worth about $619 million based on the current valuation of $13.2 billion.Dunlap points to the fact that ValueAct has been a Motorola shareholder since 2011, longer than most activists stick around, as evidence of its commitment to the company's long-term health. He said not every activist is out to create a firestorm, cash out, and move on.""You have to keep an open mind when you're learning about an investor, whether it's an activist or not,"" he said. ""I think every company should use the feedback that's available to them from the investor community.""Its unlikely that the relationship has been as Pollyannaish as Dunlap paints it. Granovsky stopped short of describing shareholder activism as bullying, but was comfortable calling it intimidation.""Companies don’t want to deal with activists,"" he said.That said, there are times when they're a necessary evil if a company is to thrive, and Motorola may be an example of this.One thing is certain: Shareholder activists aren't going anywhere, and tech companies, and their piles of cash and occasional missteps, are clearly in their sights.

547,PYPL,"Square (SQ) is intensifying its offense against PayPal (PYPL)’s Web checkout products.With details in a blog post early Wednesday, Square says that it has created a new tool that can process payments from any website after the seller adds several of lines of code. Called E-commerce API (application programming interface), it marks the first time that Square has offered sellers the ability to put a Square checkout page on any website.Square's announcement mounts pressure on PayPal, which already is facing stiff competition from tech titans such as Apple (AAPL) Pay and Google's Android Pay, among other offerings.Google is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL).Prior to Wednesday, Square offered its merchants two Web checkout options using its own prebuilt store and two third-party options for using websites prebuilt by BigCommerce and Weebly. But the San Francisco-based company did not have solutions for merchants who opted to build their own websites.Square has more than 2 million merchants and is adding about 100,000 every quarter. PayPal has more than 13 million sellers. Both companies charge 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction in the U.S. for website sales.Square -- which is run by CEO Jack Dorsey, who is also top boss at Twitter (TWTR) -- also is announcing Register API, a method to integrate Square's payments processing into any iOS point of sale. Square says that it's adding Register API in recognition of the fact that some sellers have specialized needs for point-of-sale applications.Square stock closed up 2.5% at 13.74 on Tuesday. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 51, where 99 is the highest. Wedbush analyst Gil Luria said that the stock's recent volatility is largely because the company has a small float -- relatively few shares are traded publicly. The float will change once the lockup period expires in May. Luria also has previously told IBD that Square is popular among short sellers.

549,PYPL,"Many investors began to drool over the energy and financial sectors after the November elections. The prospect of lower corporate tax rates and less restrictive regulatory yokes was a big reason. But Larry Puglia, manager of $34.2 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX), began to place a lot of new bets on the technology sector.That's despite the fact that the tech sector stands to benefit less from changes in corporate taxes. Many tech companies already have less-than-peak rates, Puglia says. In addition, tech industry leaders worry that President Trump's immigration policies could deprive them of skilled workers. Also, investors feared there was friction between President Trump and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, over the newspaper's campaign coverage.But Puglia feels the benefit to corporations — including many tech companies — of repatriation of bank accounts stuffed with cash has been overlooked somewhat. And Puglia thinks the likelihood of antagonism between the tech sector and the White House is overblown. ""We do not think that would happen to a great degree,"" Puglia said.Puglia's warm outlook for tech is reflected in the fund's most recently disclosed top-10 additions in the past six months. They included not only banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but also techies Microsoft (MSFT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Priceline (PCLN) and Facebook (FB).Fast-food restaurant operator Yum Brands (YUM) was another top-10 addition. And the fund began a new position in brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) that was large enough to also enter its top 10.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda continues to steer the stock market, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to find highly rated stocks and sectors poised to move higher.Puglia's moves are worth watching. Going into Thursday, his fund's 14.64% average annual gain over the prior five years outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500's 14% pace also trailed. He's in the top 84% year to date, which marks a rebound from 2016's modest 0.98% gain.JPMorgan shot higher shortly before Election Day. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 1%, 20% and 20% in the past three stanzas. Like other banks, JPMorgan benefits from investors' expectations that this corner of financial services will face a lighter regulatory burden than it would have under a Democratic-held White House or Congress. In addition, banks are expected to carve out wider net margins as interest rates increase. They are not expected to raise interest paid to depositors by much if any, yet they will be able to charge more for loans.Microsoft is well-positioned to keep on generating strong growth in its Office 365 suite of products, Puglia says. He also likes the outlook for its corporate cloud operations and Azure, its public cloud-computing platform.Chipmaker NXP is a leading provider of semiconductor solutions used in automotive connectivity and infotainment, he says. NXP's chips are also used in smartphone near-field communications payment applications. On Tuesday, Qualcomm (QCOM) extended its takeover bid for NXP until April 4.Alibaba offers consumer-to-consumer e-commerce services through its Taobao business and it runs T-Mall, a business-to-consumer platform. Both have dominant market share, Puglia says. Alibaba is also a leader in cloud processing services. The Chinese government is a key customer. Trading around 103 as of early Thursday, shares are below a 104.67 cup-with-handle entry.Money-transfer services provider PayPal has a five-year earnings annual growth rate of 25%. And it has reached deals with Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) that are mutually beneficial, Puglia says. Many investors had feared a more adversarial competition among the three companies. And Puglia likes PayPal's Venmo, Braintree and One Touch services.Trading around 43, shares are still trading just under a 43.17 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 9%, 13% and 17% in the past three quarters.Priceline gapped up nearly 6% on Feb. 28, a day after reporting a 32% increase in fourth-quarter EPS. Its top line grew 17% to $2.34 billion. Both earnings and revenue topped the company's own guidance. Hotel bookings have been the stock's largest growth driver. Airline ticket sales fell. That's despite steadily low oil prices, which have helped keep airfares down. The company's EPS grew 12%, 23% and 32% the past three quarters.Facebook shares are up 20% this year. Investors have begun to appreciate how well the company's advertising products, video strategy and Instagram photo sharing are being received, Puglia says. He adds that its investment in WhatsApp and Messenger also provides solid positioning in the messaging market, which is growing in popularity. ""We especially like the company's efforts to promote the use of video on its platform and to better monetize Instagram and video,"" he said.Facebook reportedly made the launch of its Facebook Live video service a priority last year. But enough users have posted videos of violence and crime to make at least some advertisers wary of the platform, according to CNBC.com. Facebook also has been hit with measurement controversies.Yum shares rose 9% this year through Feb. 13 to a 52-week high, but they've pulled back 7% since then. That has left them a scant 3% above where they were when Yum spun off its China division last Oct. 31. After EPS grew 44% for three quarters in a row, EPS grew 18% in Q4.Schwab has done a nice job of growing customer assets under management, Puglia wrote to shareholders on Dec. 31. ""Its earnings should benefit substantially from rising interest rates,"" Puglia added. ""This is enhanced by the fact that Schwab has a significant bank embedded within the company. That enables it to sweep brokerage deposits into the bank, creating more net interest income.""Rain fell on Schwab's parade recently when it got caught up in a pricing war with Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) over brokerage commissions. But Puglia says Schwab is far less dependent on commissions than TD Ameritrade is.RELATED:12 Blue-Chip Beauties That This Top Money Manager Likes NowDoes Your Mutual Fund Manager Have Skin In The Game?

550,PYPL,"The financial impact of a partnership between e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) would be ""insignificant,"" but both companies would still gain from forging a deal, says a Cowen & Co. analyst.PayPal's CEO Dan Schulman told Bloomberg recently that the payment processor is in talks with Amazon. PayPal has recently announced agreements with credit card networks Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as well as social media firm Facebook (FB).EBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal in 2015, giving the payments company more leeway to make alliances.""A potential Amazon-PayPal partnership could be a win-win, even if the direct financial impact is insignificant,"" George Mihalos, a Cowen analyst, said in a research report Monday. ""It would, however, give the PayPal wallet a more ubiquitous presence, which could lead to greater overall customer engagement — a key consideration behind PayPal's recent in-store payments strategy consummated with the networks Visa and Mastercard.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Inphi and GrubHub are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors. All Sector Leaders show outstanding earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. PayPal stock gained 0.4% to close at 39.74 on the stock market today. PayPal stock has retreated from a high of 44.15 set on Oct. 21. Shares are trading below their 50-day moving average. PayPal has a technical buy point of 44.62.Amazon stock edged down 0.3% to finish at 807.64. Amazon late Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings for the holiday quarter. But sales fell short, and the e-commerce giant's revenue outlook missed, sending the stock down on Friday. Amazon cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 821.75 on Jan. 14.Partnering with PayPal would be a plus for Amazon, Mihalos says.""We think this is much less about creating the next big revenue stream for Amazon and more about deepening its reach with both its existing user base and new merchants, especially small and medium-sized businesses,"" he said.PayPal in October posted Q4 earnings and revenue that met Wall Street expectations, but the midpoint of its Q1 guidance came in a bit light.RELATED:Could Google Bid For Salesforce.com Despite Amazon Cloud Pact?PayPal Q4 Earnings, Revenue In Line; Q1 Guidance Bit LightAmazon Analysts Turn Sour Following Q4 Results Below Views

551,PYPL,"The major indexes were practically flat in afternoon trading Monday, but infrastructure stocks rose after President Trump voiced new support for big spending.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up a fraction. Volume was tracking lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Friday.The Dow Jones industrial average also edged up. The Dow would be lower if it weren't for Caterpillar's (CAT) 2% gain. The heavy-equipment maker rose along with steel and other infrastructure-related stocks after Trump said there's a big need to improve roads, bridges and other public works.Metal, biotech, oil and building industry groups were leading the market today. Some construction supply stocks, in particular wallboard manufacturers, rose in heavy trading.Eagle Materials (EXP) climbed nearly 3% as the stock found support at the 50-day moving average. Shares broke out past a 103.26 buy point on the Jan. 24 earnings announcement. But the stock then went sideways and now looks to reinvigorate its advance.USG Corp. (USG) rose more than 2% and is nearly out of buy range from a 32.03 buy point. Three previous breakouts for the wallboard maker met with limited success, so the latest one (on Feb. 10) has been the most productive since a breakout in January 2014, which resulted in a 24% gain.Earnings from Installed Building Products (IBP) may have pushed the housing-construction stocks higher.The stock broke out of a base-on-base pattern, clearing a 44.40 buy point in heavy volume. The insulation installer this morning reported adjusted earnings of 44 cents a share, an increase of 29% that beat Wall Street expectations. Sales rose 22% to $234 million.But ServiceNow (NOW) slid nearly 4% in heavy trading. A gain of as much as 11% from the 85 buy point is quickly fading, and investors who bought at that entry need to protect the profit that is still left. The cloud-computing company said CEO Frank Slootman will step down in April and is being replaced by John Donahoe, the chairman of PayPal (PYPL) and former CEO of eBay (EBAY).Lumentum (LITE) fell all the way back to its 44.80 buy point, triggering a round-trip sell signal. The fiber-optics company broke out on strong earnings Feb. 8 and had risen nearly 20% from the buy point.RELATED:Infrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big' ServiceNow CEO Shuffle Surprises, Stock Falls

552,PYPL,"Activist investor Carl Icahn has reportedly taken a stake in cancer biotech Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) following an investment by Jana Partners in Q4, according to inside sources cited by the Wall Street Journal.In after-hours trading after the rumor broke, Bristol-Myers stock edged up a fraction. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 54.78, but they're down 27% over the last six months amid investor worries that Merck (MRK) has the upper hand in the lung cancer market.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo both belong to a class of immuno-oncology drugs that target PD-1 checkpoints in a patient's immune system. Roche (RHHBY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Incyte (INCY) are also working on I-O drugs targeting an array of checkpoints.Last month, the Food and Drug Administration accepted Merck's supplemental filing for Keytruda plus chemo in advanced lung cancer. Bristol said it wouldn't accelerate approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combo in the same market. Yervoy is another I-O drug targeting the CTLA-4 checkpoint.IBD'S TAKE: The I-O market could grow to $25 billion by 2025, Barclays analyst Geoffrey Meacham estimates — and those are just the indications we know of in 2017. Dive into the I-O world and its game-changing potential on IBD's Technology page.Bristol declined to comment to IBD regarding Icahn's rumored stake. Insiders reportedly say Icahn sees Bristol-Myers as a potential takeover candidate, the WSJ reported. Bristol-Myers is the ninth-largest biotech by market cap, valued at $91.5 billion.Icahn is known for his investments in household names like PayPal (PYPL) and Xerox (XRX).Last year, he made a big bet on Allergan (AGN), but slashed his stake in November. Shares lost about 11% from the time of his purchase in Q2 to the end of November.Jana Partners, another activist investor, bought a stake in Bristol-Myers in Q4.

554,PYPL,"In a blog post Wednesday, digital cash register and payments processor Square (SQ) announced that it would integrate Facebook (FB) ad buying into its small-business software.The new integration will enable merchants using Square software to buy and target Facebook ads, aiming to help the merchants understand the effectiveness of online ad campaigns on the social network. Square will earn a subscription fee.“There’s a lot of excitement around buying Facebook ads, but the critical missing link is: If I put down $5, how do I know if it worked?” Saumil Mehta, Square’s customer engagement lead, told the New York Times. “The ability to track and close the loop from advertisement to sale -- that’s the holy grail.”The company offers a range of digital cash register hardware as well as software that performs marketing tasks. The company's financial business offers small-business loans -- it assesses risk based on the wealth of transaction data it accumulates -- and other financial services such as payroll.It also does payments processing -- a business that some analysts and investors have criticized for having tight profit margins. Square must share its transaction fees with credit card firms and other financial institutions.Square also has a peer-to-peer payments app called Square Cash that competes with PayPal (PYPL) and its offering, Venmo.CEO Jack Dorsey is also CEO of Twitter (TWTR), which is based about a block away from Square's offices in San Francisco.Square stock was down 4%, near 12.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today but rose earlier to a four-month high of 13.80. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 46, where 99 is the highest, and its November IPO generally disappointed. Shares priced at 9, peaked at 14.05 the first day and have mostly lagged ever since.Wedbush analyst Gil Luria warns that the stock is volatile because it has a large number of short sellers betting on the stock to fall, as well as a small float. Company insiders, including early venture capital investors who can't sell until May under the IPO's lock-up provisions, hold a significant number of shares.Square beat Wall Street expectations for Q4 sales in the company's first release since going public in November. Executives have said that the company will turn profitable this year. In 2015, the company's losses widened to $179 million from $154 million in 2014.
"
555,PYPL,"It's just one example of how PayPal is venturing into the mobile payment game, but like numerous other forays the electronic money handler is making into this rapidly expanding realm of the digital marketplace, it holds immense promise.PayPal (PYPL) is trying to monetize Venmo, a sort of mobile payment processor with a social media soul. Venmo allows friends to send and receive payments from each other, which comes in handy when they want to split dinner bills or a taxi. The social media component comes in when users can chronicle their transactions and let friends know where they've been and what they're buying -- though they can hide amount details.It may not have the cachet of other social media sites like Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR), but analysts say Venmo and other ventures like it are necessary for PayPal to remain relevant.""Venmo gives PayPal a strong inroad into millennials,"" William Blair analyst Robert Napoli told Investor's Business Daily. ""If you are a college student or are in your 20s, if you don’t have Venmo you’re an outcast.""Venmo handled $7.5 billion in transactions during 2015, up 213% from a year ago. Right now, that comprises a small part of the $282 billion in payments processed by PayPal last year, but that could easily change, he points out.""Venmo is growing very fast and now PayPal is monetizing it and allowing people to use their Venmo accounts to spend as opposed to just transferring money,"" said Napoli. ""It is not widely disseminated yet, but I expect it to be over the next year or so. Venmo is a very large opportunity for them.""PayPal is attempting to grow on a number of fronts, particularly its mobile segment and in-store mobile wallet. It is in the mobile wallet arena where PayPal competes with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Android Pay and Apple’s (AAPL) Apple Pay, say analysts.PayPal was spun off from former parent eBay (EBAY) on July 17 and made its market debut on July 20. The online and mobile payments processor has had two straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth and forecasts to continue to grow full-year profits by double digits through 2020.""As money becomes digital and the world goes mobile, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to expand our leadership, transform the way people move and manage their money and deliver increased value to shareholders,"" President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said in the company's earnings release.PayPal has tapped into a number of growth opportunities in recent months. In November, it acquired Xoom, which enables consumers to send money, pay bills and send mobile phone reloads to family and friends around the world using mobile devices.At the Mobile World Congress last month, it announced a collaboration with European carrier Vodafone (VOD), where millions of PayPal’s European customers will be able to fund payments on Alphabet’s mobile operating system Android smartphones at Visa contactless terminals using the Vodafone Wallet. The service will start in Spain and expand to additional European markets later this year.PayPal also has extended its existing business relationship with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) by launching a limited pilot program to accept PayPal payments. It is geared toward select vendors who sell on Alibaba Wholesale, the business-to-business section of Alibaba’s website.PayPal’s technology platform company enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. In 2015, 23% of the 4.9 billion payments it processed were made on a mobile device.Consumers who use its payments platform can shop cross-border by sending payments in more than 200 markets worldwide and in more than 100 currencies. This enables merchants to extend their reach across borders to an expanded customer base. It had roughly 179 million active customer accounts as of Dec. 31. Its $282 billion in total payment volume last year was up 20% over 2014, according to a filing with the SEC.""Through partnerships, and our technology-agnostic approach, we are able to give merchants and consumers more flexibility and choice in how they want to pay and get paid,"" the company said in a press release.Its ""gateway"" products include our Payflow Payments and certain Braintree offerings. Braintree is a mobile payments platform that eBay acquired for $800 million in 2013. Braintree is the global payment platform for thousands of online and mobile commerce innovators including Airbnb and Uber.PayPal also offers consumer the ability to receive a line of credit through its PayPal Credit consumer products.Its business model has served the company well. In the fourth quarter, sales rose 17% from the year-earlier, to $2.6 billion, with 1% of that growth stemming from its Xoom acquisition. The company reported earnings per share, minus items, of 36 cents, up 21% from a year earlier.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2016 earnings to rise 18% to $1.49 a share. They see an 18% increase in 2017 and in 2018.What’s behind PayPal’s momentum?""PayPal has grown for the longest time,""  Wedbush analyst Gil Luria told IBD. ""They came up with a clever way to help merchants and consumers feel more secure about online payments, and they have been riding the growth of e-commerce since. And I don’t expect that to change. Because so many merchants accept it, it creates a very positive network effect and it’s going to be hard for anybody to disrupt it.""Luria sees three ""tangential"" areas PayPal is involved in that can help it grow beyond the growth of e-commerce. One of them is in cross-border remittance, a capability it gained when it acquired Xoom. He also sees an opportunity to grow its credit product business for consumers and business sellers. A third growth opportunity is in helping brick-and-mortar stores accept in-store mobile payments.""Their competitors have consistently failed to dislodge PayPal from its leadership position because they never really have done anything that PayPal hasn’t already done,"" Luria said.

Visa (V) will announce results on Monday.Vantiv offers traditional and innovative payment processing products, including products for Apple (AAPL) Pay and the fast-growing mobile device sector, to merchants, banks and other financial institutions.The company's Q3 earnings, minus one-time items, climbed 20% to 59 cents per share as revenue grew 13% to $430.45 million. Wall Street expected 56 cents EPS on $413.96 million revenue.Vantiv, the nation's largest acquirer of PIN debit accounts — based on number of transactions — projects Q4 EPS of 61 cents-63 cents and $429 million-$437 million revenue. Both are roughly in line with analyst estimates.Its business net revenue from merchants services grew 16% to $345 million, mainly on an 8% hike in the number of transactions and a 7% increase in net revenue per transaction. Net revenue from financial institution services rose 3% to $86 million.Vantiv shares settled to an 8.4% closing gain to 50.92 on the stock market today after setting a record 52.44 intraday. Its stock has a 96 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 96% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Shares of peer Global Payments (GPN) climbed nearly 5% to a fresh high after Vantiv's report. MasterCard was up 1.7%. IBD Leaderboard list stock Visa was up 1.7%.Late last year Vantiv launched Vantiv Mobile Accept, a card reader that attaches to mobile devices to let retailers take payments anytime, anywhere. Mobile Accept is compatible with Apple's Apple Pay.Apple launched its mobile payment and digital wallet service a year ago in October 2014, with more than 1 million stores signing up within days of its debut, including Walt Disney (DIS), JetBlue (JBLU) and Chevron (CVX).Apple was up 4.1% Wednesday after it topped earnings estimates late Tuesday.Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

603,PYPL,"New money never sleeps -- or so February's first-ever PayPal (PYPL) Super Bowl ad asked viewers to believe.The aggressive spot was an attempt to tell the public that PayPal is the future of money. It was also meant to suggest to investors that good things lie ahead now that the company is once again on its own after being spun off from 13-year parent eBay (EBAY).PayPal, however, finds itself surrounded by some big companies with payments technologies that could disrupt its lead. Apple (AAPL), Square (SQ) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google are among the companies building digital wallet technologies that compete in one way or another with PayPal.""The new campaign is the very positioning we did pre-IPO (in 2002),"" Eric Jackson, CEO of business technology company CapLinked, told IBD. Jackson was PayPal's first director of marketing and wrote a memoir about his time at the company.Companies in the payments sector often do business with one another. Many of the merchants signed up with Apple Pay have their payments processed by PayPal subsidiary Braintree, for example.""As the kids say, there are 'frenemies' in payments,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria told IBD.Still, PayPal stock was down more than 4% in late-afternoon trading Thursday on news that both Apple and  Starbucks (SBUX) are expanding the reach of their mobile payment systems, aiming to get a bigger edge on rivals such as PayPal and Google.Apple Pay will be included in Apple’s Safari browser in time for Q4 holiday shopping, reported Re/code. The payment system will continue to work with Apple’s fingerprint ID technology.At least one analyst didn't see a big impact on PayPal, however. “While this (Apple Pay-Safari) could represent some near-term headline risk for PayPal, we believe the competitive impact introduced by Apple Pay in-browser will be limited due to potential consumer and merchant adoption hurdles,” Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg said in a research report. “PayPal's own expedited checkout process, One Touch, is already in use by more than 250 of the top 500 internet retailers”Meanwhile, in many ways, Braintree's peer-to-peer payments app Venmo is in a position similar to PayPal in its own very early days. Instead of focusing only on its first market, person-to-person payments, Venmo -- like PayPal, which started out as a free service before it built enough heft to charge merchants -- is turning to merchant transactions to turn a profit.Targeting merchant transaction fees ""is not that much of a leap,"" Luria said. ""That's what Elon Musk and Peter Thiel (PayPal co-founders along with Max Levchin) did 15 years ago. It's not unprecedented to take the Venmo users and turn them into paying customers.""That PayPal would be able to unlock business opportunities previously inaccessible to it with eBay as its owner -- other e-commerce rivals didn't particularly care to give business to a competitor such as eBay -- was a notable selling point when the split-up was announced in 2015.PayPal executives say that the company has advanced in several ways that it couldn't while it was a part of eBay. The marketing campaign that the Super Bowl ad was designed to support might not have been a priority under eBay, says Juan Benitez, general manager and CTO at Braintree.Braintree powers payments behind fast-growing private companies such as ride hailing app Uber and alternative accommodations provider Airbnb. Analyst Luria says that most of Braintree's profit comes from those two firms. Uber and Airbnb were Braintree's top clients when it was part of eBay as well, but the separation has led to at least one marquee client: the fast-growing e-tail startup Jet.com. Its CEO, Marc Lore, aims to compete with Amazon.com by, like Amazon, offering free two-day shipping. EBay is another rival. ""Jet is something that maybe would have had a question or two asked before before the split,"" Benitez told IBD. In addition, he says that PayPal is expanding its pilot merchant program with China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA).ITG Investment Research analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD that PayPal's post-eBay success has much to do with the company bringing on new merchants while part of eBay, ""and that moment has continued."" He says that it's ""hard to tell"" whether things have changed since the split, since it's so recent.But according to Wedbush's Luria, the truth about PayPal's real post-eBay value is related to the spinoff's financials.""When the carving out was happening, when the separation was negotiated, the eBay board allocated a lot of the revenue to PayPal and expenses to eBay,"" he said. The reasoning, he says, is that PayPal was getting twice the multiple (price-to-earnings ratio), so every dollar of profit they put into PayPal was going to get twice as much market value.Luria said that beyond the financials, the split produced a ""freeing effect"" that has allowed the deals with Alibaba and Jet.com. ""It's now an easier decision to incorporate PayPal into merchant acceptance,"" he said.The split, says Luria, gave PayPal the ""power of focus."" PayPal no longer needs approval from eBay executives on important decisions.No doubt competition with tech titans in payments will remain fierce, but PayPal is in a strong position. With its base of 13 million active merchants, the company can achieve powerful network effects from that critical mass, which makes it a considerable challenge to unseat PayPal as payments king.CEO Jeff Bezos' mighty e-commerce firm Amazon.com has been competing with PayPal for 10 years via its own payments platform, with negligible results.""Now the subtlety is that Apple Pay and Android Pay have an advantage,"" Luria said. Because the companies integrate their payments into iOS and Android, respectively, the payment experience is seamless -- which is critical for digital wallets.PayPal executives say that Apple Pay and Android Pay are actually good for their company, since those services often use PayPal's Braintree to process transactions.Others, however, don't see PayPal walking arm in arm with Apple or Google. ""Embracing the advent of Android Pay and Apple Pay sounds a little hollow,"" former PayPal exec Jackson said. ""It sounds more like corporate spin than reality.""Both Apple and Google are able to position their payments systems as the default option on their own mobile devices and services, which could make things rougher for PayPal.But even if Apple and Google do it, Weinstein says, that move by itself would not be enough to unseat San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal from the payments lead.""PayPal has a lot of other products,"" he said.Analysts and industry watchers aren't sure how PayPal plans to tackle its challenges. Innovation is one strategy that's worked well in the past, such as with One Touch, the company's tech tool to reduce checkout time. Acquisitions have been helpful, too -- for example, the $800 million Braintree purchase, which included Venmo.Regardless of how PayPal proceeds, how it separates itself from its competition will be key, says Jackson. As the Super Bowl ad shows, PayPal has its game face on.

604,PYPL,"Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX) are expanding the reach of their mobile payment systems, aiming to get a bigger edge on rivals such as PayPal (PYPL) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Apple Pay -- which supports in-store shopping at retail checkout as well as in-app purchases for Uber, Disney stores and others – will be included in Apple’s Safari browser in time for Q4 holiday shopping, says a Re/code report. The payment system will continue to work with Apple’s fingerprint ID technology as a substitute for inputting 16-digit credit card numbers.Apple aims to solve a problem with mobile shopping; smartphone users tend to browse for products but often don't pull the trigger to buy.“The checkout page tends to be clunky and requires much in the way of manual entry.

Visa, though, has been active making deals, said Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, in a report.“Visa has certainly not been sitting idle as shown by recent minority investments in Chain, Stripe and Square (SQ) and product enhancements, including Visa Commerce Network, Visa Token Services and Visa Checkout,” wrote Beck.Starbucks, which has one of the most successful mobile wallets, is expanding its rewards system using a branded prepaid Visa card.Starbucks on Wednesday said the loyalty rewards system will allow customers to earn points for all purchases made with the prepaid  card. The Starbucks branded card can be used at any retailer that accepts Visa cards.Image provided by Shutterstock.

605,PYPL,"As President Obama stands beside Cuban President Raul Castro in Havana and brokers historic talks to thaw relations between the two countries, online travel giants and other Silicon Valley titans have set their sights on building businesses on the island nation.The $8.4 billion tourism industry is likely to swell once Washington allows general tourism to the island nation. For now, a license from the Treasury Department is required for legal travel to Cuba, but the online travel kings have been quick to strike deals to build sales to that nation.Still, online travel firms shouldn't expect any big returns on their efforts for three to five years, says Douglas Quinby, an analyst with travel research firm Phocuswright.""But once all the ducks are lined up, I think you’re going to see a lot of interest for U.S. travelers,"" Quinby told IBD. ""It’s a huge Caribbean destination, it’s got great beaches and sun.""Online travel giant Priceline (PCLN), via its Booking.com platform, already is setting up shop in Havana and allowing U.S. citizens to reserve and pay for rooms at Cuban and foreign-owned hotels.""Members of our leadership spent many weeks working hand in hand with the Cuban government and tourism authorities, hotel partners, and banks to ensure that when we launch a few weeks from now our customers will experience the secure and seamless service they’ve come to expect from Booking.com,"" Todd Dunlap, managing director of Booking.com Americas, told IBD via email.Expedia (EXPE) is working on getting travel to Cuba online as well -- though it did not share a timetable or a specific date that bookings could begin.""We currently have a team working across multiple channels to help enable U.S.-to-Cuba travel, taking every step to ensure that the solutions align with the laws governing travel between the countries,""  Expedia spokeswoman Sarah Gavin said in an emailed statement.Privately held Airbnb has been operating in Cuba for a year, and is available to U.S. citizens in Cuba. The San Francisco-based firm lets travelers rent homes, rooms in homes and apartments.According to an Airbnb blog post, U.S. visits to Cuba rose 77% in 2015, to 161,000.The company says it's working closely with the Cuban government.TripAdvisor (TRIP) spokeswoman Julie Cassetina told IBD via email that the company is ""now displaying hotel metasearch for Cuban hotels"" on its website, but she declined to make executives available for an interview.Outside of the online travel agency kings, the tech contingent included IBD Leaderboard stock PayPal (PYPL). In a blog post Sunday, PayPal CEO Dan Shulman outlined his case for targeting Cuba.The major cash cow for the firm is likely to be in assisting Cubans who receive money from sources in the U.S., an influx which at the moment, according to the blog, accounts for $2 billion, or 3%, of the Cuban economy each year. It's a chance for PayPal to expand the reach of its Xoom subsidiary, which handles international transfers. PayPal bought Xoom for $890 million in July 2015.The blog also makes the pitch that PayPal plans to find ways to attract Cuban small businesses -- which at the moment are mostly not set up to process credit and debit cards.Privately held Stripe, which competes with PayPal payments-processing subsidiary Braintree, also made the trip to Cuba. Stripe said in a blog that it would start offering Cuban businesses the ability to set up bank accounts and incorporate in the U.S.On the trip, President Obama said Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google would try to help ensure that Cubans have access to broadband Internet, which remains scarce, especially outside of large cities.""We know, from the experience of many countries around the world, that new technologies and improved internet access can help people in their daily lives, provide new information and experiences, and help harness a country’s creativity and ingenuity,"" Brett Perlmutter, the Cuba lead for Google Access, wrote in a blog post Monday. ""We hope to have the chance to offer more services to the Cuban people in the future.""Xerox (XRX) CEO Ursula Burns also attended the trip in a fact-finding capacity.""Recent changes in U.S. regulations may afford new commercial opportunities in Cuba,"" Burns told IBD in an emailed statement, ""but the parameters of those opportunities are not always obvious. The U.S. government has worked hard to describe what the recent changes mean. I think part of my job on this trip is to evaluate what they mean in light of the economic realities here in Cuba.""

606,PYPL,"As part of its effort to bring the Internet to the masses, Facebook (FB) on Wednesday announced plans to develop a wireless system that connects buildings to the Internet without the need of fiber-optic cable.The system, called Terragraph, will connect buildings to the Internet using millimeter-wave technology, a wireless system Facebook hopes to use to bring high-speed connectivity to dense urban areas.The plan was announced on the final day of Facebook’s annual two-day F8 Developer Conference, in San Francisco. Facebook also announced Project Aries, a  test network of 96 different directional antennas based on a technology that can transmit massive amounts of data.The series of announcements made by Facebook at the event puts the company on a solid path toward adding billions to its revenue stream.CEO Mark Zuckerberg set a 10-year strategy for Facebook on Tuesday that emphasized pushing its Messenger chat platform deeper into the business world with chatbots and by enhancing Live video with virtual reality. Zuckerberg presented his vision in a keynote speech at the start of F8.Analysts say the monetization strategy of Messenger will closely follow that of Instagram, with both platforms seen becoming multibillion-dollar businesses. That will be followed by its Oculus Rift virtual reality business and its WhatsApp messaging platform.“We see Facebook’s revenue growth visibility being enhanced by Instagram this year, Messenger in 2017, and more mass-market virtual reality and maybe WhatsApp by 2018,” wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Martin Pyykkonen in a research note Wednesday. He estimates Instagram's ad revenue will reach $1 billion this year.“It’s still very early, but Messenger could become that single app interface for multiple mobile payments and be a competitive issue for the likes of PayPal (PYPL), Square (SQ) and credit card companies,” he wrote.Cowen analyst John Blackledge wrote in a research note that, given Messenger's sheer user scale, it could potentially be another transformational platform for Facebook. Messenger has 900 million users, up from 800 million in January.“Facebook will continue to follow its proven playbook of building great products, achieving scale and then building ecosystems around those products/apps in order to monetize,” Blackledge wrote.Facebook provided a glimpse as to how it might monetize Messenger at the F8 conference. Examples included businesses placing an ad on Facebook and then, when the ad is clicked, the user is taken over to Messenger, where that user can communicate with the company and transact on the platform.As widely expected, Zuckerberg announced a program for developers to write apps that are powered by artificial intelligence, known as chatbots. The digital assistants will help Messenger users communicate with businesses for services, perhaps to fix a problem or to buy goods.Demonstrations on how bots will be used by businesses included ordering flowers through the chatbot of 1-800-Flowers (FLWS). Facebook highlighted over 40 existing partnerships that included Shopify (SHOP) and Hyatt Hotels (H).While ads and promotions are not currently allowed in the bot platform, Facebook has begun testing “Sponsored Messages” in small groups. Facebook also said it will be able to earn revenue through “Click to Message” links in News Feed ads.Another major focus at the F8 conference is on live video streaming, which generates 10 times more comments than regular videos. Facebook is already pumping up revenue from standard video ads placed on its website. The addition of Facebook Live video will accelerate that opportunity.Blackledge estimates Facebook video revenue will hit $10 billion by 2021, up from $1.8 billion last year.Facebook Live is comparable to the Twitter (TWTR) Periscope app, which launched last year and has logged more than 100 million broadcasts. Twitter has integrated Periscope into the Twitter app feed.The vast majority of Facebook revenue comes from ads on its main website, but the company is looking to build on that with Instagram, Messenger and Live.“Messenger is clearly increasingly important, in our view, but its vision of the post-app world will be a challenge to pull off,” wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson in a research note. “It has a real opportunity with Live video in the near term.”Facebook stock, which rose 1.5% Tuesday, finished flat on Wednesday, at 110.51, and shares are forming a cup-with-handle base.Facebook is set to report Q1 earnings after the market close on April 27. Analysts expect revenue will rise 48% from the year-earlier quarter to $5.25 billion, while earnings per share minus items also are expected to rise 48%, to 62 cents.

608,PYPL,"Silicon Valley tech giants Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google are likely to begin acquiring payments firms, with PayPal (PYPL) among the possible targets, investment bank Wedbush said after polling what it termed a panel of experts.The shopping spree will be sparked by slowing industry growth and ""capital markets back at higher valuations,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria wrote in a research note Monday.The panel told Wedbush that Google would be the best fit to acquire PayPal.Luria, however, disagreed with the panel, writing that he believes MasterCard (MA) would gain more value from a PayPal acquisition.PayPal stock was up 4%, near 41, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today. The IBD Leaderboard stock cleared a 40.03 buy point early Monday. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, where 99 is the highest.Wedbush panelists included a former senior vice president at PayPal, as well as executives with credit card companies including MasterCard.On Sunday, PayPal announced that it would be opening up its money-transfer service Xoom to Cuba. The announcement coincided with President Obama's historic trip to the island nation.The report dismissed Square (SQ) as a potential acquisition target until it can attract more than just ""small-ticket merchants,"" Luria cited the panelists as saying. Luria speculated that Visa (V) would unload its approximately 1% stake in Square vs. acquiring more.Earlier this month, Square posted its first quarterly earnings reports since its November IPO. Results met Wall Street expectations, but slowing merchant growth led to a disappointing outlook.Square stock rose to a 2016 high on Monday, up 10% near 13, in late-afternoon trading. The gains came with no apparent news. In an email, Luria told IBD, ""Square is very heavily shorted with a very small float -- that has translated into significant volatility in the share price, including today.""The float will rise in less than two months: The IPO lockup period for insiders and major venture capital investors expires May 17.The panelists said that if Square's lending business continues to grow at 200% to 300%, it will likely ""end badly."" Square Capital provides cash advances to some of Square's small-merchant customers. But Square Capital is essentially a subprime lender, Luria has told IBD.

610,PYPL,"The Delaware Select Growth Fund (DVEAX) pulls out all the stops in its search for growth.The go-anywhere fund invests in companies of all sizes, and looks for names that are expected to grow faster than the U.S. economy over the long term. With $688 million in assets, the fund is sub-advised by a team of managers from San Francisco-based Jackson Square Partners.Year-to-date going into Tuesday, the fund is down 5.8% vs. an average decline of 3.4% from its peer large growth funds tracked by Morningstar. Over the last decade though, Delaware Select Growth has churned out an annual average return of 7.1% vs. 6.6% from the large growth category.The fund held 69 stocks as of Feb. 29, spread across varying market cap categories. By the fund's count, technology, consumer discretionary and health care are its top three weightings. The fund has an annual turnover rate of 46% versus 65% for its category average. Delaware Select Growth primarily bets on U.S. companies with 38% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings.PayPal (PYPL) was one of those top holdings, and one of the fund's better recent performers.  The digital and mobile payments provider is up 14% so far this year. The stock was a top holding as of Feb. 29.

We doubt that Yahoo would want to still push for a spinoff if the IRS ruled against the tax-free transaction,"" Pyykkonen said.Yahoo stock rose 2% to 39.68 on Friday but is down 21% this year.Alibaba stock also rose 2% Friday, to 83.36, but it's down 20% this year.Other companies deploying spinoffs include eBay (EBAY). The online auctions leader is spinning off its transactions unit PayPal, which starts formal trading under the ticker PYPL on Monday.Display Ads ChallengingFor Yahoo's Q2, ""Our expectations are clearly for another lackluster quarter on the core business, with continuing challenges in display advertising,"" wrote Pyykkonen.While its display ad business continues to decline, Yahoo executives are hitching their future on four emerging ad revenue categories dubbed Mavens to pick up the slack — mobile, video, native and social advertising.In January, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said she expects $1.5 billion in Mavens revenue this year, a 36% jump from 2014, after starting from scratch in 2012.The segment generated $363 million in revenue in Q1, up 58%, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in a research report Friday. But the company's larger premium and programmatic desktop display segment fell 7%, he said. ""We will be looking closely at the performance of the Mavens segment to determine if Yahoo can offset the declines seen in its traditional advertising segments.""Other issues, Mahaney said, include whether Yahoo can regain search and display share from strong competitors such as Google (GOOGL)"" and the ""integration risk"" with microblogging service Tumblr.Other analysts also want more clarity on whether Tumblr, purchased for $1.1 billion in 2013, will ever match the moneymaking moxie of Facebook's (FB) Instagram photo-sharing service.""There does not seem to be evidence that advertising revenue is yet approaching a $100 million or greater annualized run rate,"" said Rosenblatt's Pyykkonen.Tumblr does have ""attractive advertising revenue potential, primarily based on sponsored posts and sponsored apps,"" Pyykkonen said.Yahoo is expected to report Q2 revenue minus traffic acquisition costs — what Yahoo pays other websites to carry ads — of $1.03 billion, down 3% year over year, according to FactSet.FactSet expects Yahoo to post EPS ex items of 18 cents, down 51%.Follow Michele Chandler on Twitter: @IBD_MChandler.RELATED: Ad 'Viewability' Standards Elusive As Digital Grows

665,PYPL,"Investors may have sold off PayPal (PYPL) too quickly last week, an analyst says, after new Apple (AAPL) Pay features called into question PayPal's longtime dominance in payments.Mark Palmer of BTIG wrote in a research note Monday that Apple Pay has a relatively small reach -- Apple's iOS has a 14% global market share -- and PayPal is no stranger to competition, successfully fending off offerings from Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) over the years.Reports surfaced Wednesday that Apple Pay will be included in the Safari browser in time for holiday shopping this year. Doing so will help solve the perennial problem with mobile commerce: Shoppers prefer to buy on desktops and browse on mobile devices.PayPal, an IBD Leaderboard stock, fell 5 cents to 38.87 in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock temporarily dropped nearly 8% intraday from an alternate 40.03 buy point Thursday, but closed down about 4%. PayPal's 38.62 entry still holds for now. It has an IBD Composite rating of 93, where 99 is the highest.Despite the fact that PayPal executives have told IBD on several occasions that Apple Pay growth will actually help the company's prospects -- many of the merchants using Apple Pay process the payment through PayPal subsidiary Braintree -- Palmer says that such an argument is a ""stretch.""That's because PayPal earns less if Braintree processes an Apple Pay transaction vs. if the customer uses PayPal. ""With that said, we do agree that Braintree could serve as something of a mitigate to the competitive challenge posed by Apple Pay,"" Palmer wrote.But threats to PayPal are nothing new, and the company has been fending off competition since it first launched in the late 1990s. Alphabet's Google Checkout made its debut in 2006, Palmer says, and Amazon Payments launched in 2007. Facebook has also launched Facebook Credits. None have unseated PayPal as payments king.""None of these offerings has diminished PayPal's growth trajectory, as most recently demonstrated by its 29% foreign exchange-neutral increase in total payment volume during Q4, 2015,"" Palmer wrote.Digital cash register maker and payments processor Square (SQ) said Thursday that it planned to transition its lending business, Square Capital, to flexible loans from its current cash-advance program.In a separate research note, Palmer questioned whether observers who suggested the company's continued push into lending would drag its valuation down. Palmer, in the note, said that he didn't believe that was the case because Square CEO Jack Dorsey -- also top boss at Twitter (TWTR) -- sees the lending business as part of a suite of products that add value to small businesses, not a stand-alone operation.To wit, in addition to the loans, Square offers marketing products and other financial services such as payroll that make small businesses (the bulk of Square's customers) more efficient, Palmer wrote.Because of Square's large base on merchants and the ease with which it can market loans, it can offer lenders extremely low acquisition costs, Palmer says. Its credit decisions based on the trove of transaction data have also produced a low default rate thus far.""As part of a cohesive bundle of services, SQ’s loan product should be regarded not as an anchor on its valuation but rather as a facilitator of increased growth, in our view,"" Palmer wrote.""In the end, we see little reason Square Capital’s loan growth can’t approach the rates demonstrated by the company’s core payments business while enhancing its profitability.""Image provided by Shutterstock.

But first-time Super Bowl advertisers Amazon.com (AMZN) and PayPal (PYPL) think that it's worth every penny.For PayPal, which until July was a unit of eBay, advertising on what's likely the largest single-day sporting event of the year comes at an auspicious time. ""If you look at our business today, we're in a big transformation,"" said Greg Fisher, vice president and head of global brand marketing.""The very nature of money is changing. Everything must really serve people. If you look at the Super Bowl it's a big moment for us to be able to tell that story, to tell that (story) of us leading that revolution.""Since the company has spun off from eBay, Fisher says, it's been trying to re-introduce the world to PayPal with an independent, strong voice and the hope that people will see the company differently.The Super Bowl 50 ad is just the beginning, Fisher says. The company plans to continue a marketing and advertising campaign across multiple channels -- including digital. ""We're really looking at the Super Bowl as the first step in a long journey,"" Fisher said.While a PayPal spokesman declined to provide a copy of the ad or let IBD view it, Fisher did say that the company had negotiated a ""very untraditional 45-second spot"" and that viewers should expect a ""very different ad.""To produce the ad PayPal, hired ad agency Crispin Porter and Bogusky.""I think this is a really exciting thing, and there's a lot of buzz internally. We can see the stadium from our office."" Super Bowl 50 is being played in Santa Clara, Calif., less than five miles from San Jose, where PayPal is headquartered.Amazon.com will also join PayPal and debut its first Super Bowl commercial at the big game.Amazon has not been shy about its plans. According to CNet the firm plans to advertise its Amazon Echo smart speaker -- a competitor to Siri from Apple (AAPL), among others. To advertise the Super Bowl commercial, the company has released an ad that at publication time had received 195,311 views on YouTube, the Alphabet (GOOGL)-run streaming video website.The Super Bowl ad will feature Echo and its voice, named Alexa. Though Amazon spokeswoman Brittany Turner declined IBD's request to interview an executive about the Seattle-based company's decision, the firm did supply a statement from Neil Lindsay, vice president of Amazon devices.“Echo has had an amazing reception from customers over the past year -- they love it,"" Lindsay said in the statement. ""We thought the Super Bowl was a great chance to tell even more people about what Echo and Alexa can do, and have some fun while doing it.”After the stock market close Thursday, Amazon released Q4 results that missed investor expectations.

669,PYPL,"PayPal (PYPL) stock jumped Thursday after the company posted a Q4 earnings beat after the close Wednesday, with executives dismissing Apple (APPL) Pay as no big threat to the company's payments business.PayPal stock was up nearly 8%, near 34, in early afternoon trading in the stock market today. PayPal has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, where 99 is the highest.RBC Capital Markets Daniel Perlin wrote in a research note that the quarter was ""solid,"" and that the company will continue to gain market share. He cited its recent Venmo acquisition -- a company that offers a peer-to-peer payment app popular with millennials for sharing restaurant tabs, rent payments and more.PayPal executives outlined a strategy to monetize Venmo on their Q4 earnings call, as the service is testing ways to generate revenue.In a research note Thursday, Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg described PayPal as a ""scarce investment opportunity."" The analyst says that it's a large-cap company growing sales in the mid-double digits, with improving margins and a global brand. He said it's a pure online-payments stock, in a high-growth sector.""PayPal continues to innovate around its core,"" he wrote.The strong Q4 results may reassure investors ""about the resilience of its business model and the strength of its brand,"" wrote BTIG analyst Mark Palmer in a research note late Wednesday.Palmer added that the $2 billion share buyback should also remind investors about the company's ""robust"" free cash flow, as well as offer ""downside protection.""""PayPal is going out of its way to actively emphasize its payment agnostic philosophy to other players in the payments ecosystem, making it clear that it's not seeking to disintermediate them,"" Nomura analyst Bill Carcache wrote in a research note. ""This approach is giving rise to discussions that are more partnership-oriented rather than antagonistic.""Anuj Nayar, PayPal’s senior director of global initiatives, echoed this in a recent interview with IBD, saying that PayPal is the only service that's ""cross-platform"" and ""device agnostic.""On the company's Q4 earnings conference call, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said the company collects transaction data from Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android Pay -- many merchants use (PayPal-owned) Braintree to process transactions -- suggesting that the company has significant insight into its competition. ""We have really good insight as to those different services, but we wouldn't release it publicly,"" Schulman said.Whether that data help PayPal in the long run remains to be seen. Alex Rampell, a general partner at noted Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, says that if Apple and Google decide to focus on payments it could ""create a huge problem"" for PayPal, precisely because of the reason Nayar and Schulman cite as an advantage: PayPal does not control the hardware and software.Apple's hardware business if far more profitable than payments, Rampell says, so the company might not go all-in on payments.PayPal's Q4 results are the second since the company spun off from eBay (EBAY) in July. EBay did not fare as well in Q4, disappointing Wall Street.

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 35 cents EPS ex items on sales of $2.51 billion.PayPal stock was up 5% in after-hours trading on the earnings news.""In Q4, we acquired more customers than any other in PayPal’s history,"" PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts.He also said that nearly 30% of the payments made on PayPal's platform last year were from a mobile device.""In the face of a slow global economy and foreign exchange headwinds, PayPal exceeded its full year revenue, earnings and free cash flow commitments to shareholders,"" Schulman said in the company's earnings release. ""As money becomes digital and the world goes mobile, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to expand our leadership, transform the way people move and manage their money and deliver increased value to shareholders.""Last quarter, PayPal said it extended its partnership with Alibaba (BABA), started a limited pilot program that lets Alibaba's wholesale vendors accept PayPal. Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce company.PayPal also announced a $2 billion stock repurchase program.""We have proven our ability to generate cash, and this share repurchase authorization demonstrates our confidence in our strategic plan and long-term growth,"" PayPal CFO John Rainey said in the earnings release.PayPal gave 2016 full-year guidance calling for EPS ex items of $1.45 -to $1.50, the midpoint shy of  the consensus analyst estimate of $1.49. PayPal gave revenue guidance only on a constant-currency basis. For Q1, the company expects EPS ex items of 34 cents to 36 cents, in line with analysts' 35-cent consensus.PayPal said it ended the year with 179 million active accounts, having added 6.6 million in Q4. It said total payment volume rose 23% in Q4 to $81.5 billion.PayPal stock is down more than 15% from the record high of 42.55 it touched on the first day of trading after it spun off from eBay, July 20. This was the San Jose, Calif.-based firm's second quarterly earnings report without eBay.EBay (EBAY) and PayPal split up into separate companies as of July 17, a move they had announced a year before under pressure from some shareholders, including activist investor Carl Icahn.PayPal announced progress in its strategy to monetize one closely watched businesses the firm recently acquired, peer-to-peer payments app Venmo. The app lets friends do things like split dinner bills, cabs and rent. PayPal said Venmo processed $2.5 billion in total payments last quarter, up 174% from Q4 2014.Since Venmo doesn't charge customers to send and receive money, Wall Street questioned how PayPal would make it profitable.PayPal, though, said Wednesday that it's testing a program where  Venmo customers now can use the app to pay for concert tickets on ticketing platform Gametime and meal delivery app Munchery, the first revenue sources for Venmo.""We made good progress in setting up the technological infrastructure to allow Venmo users to pay merchants,"" Schulman said on the earnings call. ""Venmo is not just another buy button. It is the most beloved way to pay for millennials. There is tremendous demand from merchants for pay with Venmo.""PayPal faces heated competition from a host of mobile payment platforms. Both Apple (AAPL) Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android Pay are gunning for a big share of the U.S. mobile payment market, estimated at $8.71 billion this year.In an earlier interview, Anuj Nayar, PayPal’s senior director of global initiatives, told IBD the company is well prepared to handle competition from Apple and Google, since payments is the core business for PayPal and just a side business for those tech giants.Since the spinoff, PayPal has been free to pursue partnerships with some of eBay's competitors such as Amazon.com. But according to a CNet report, an Amazon-PayPal partnership isn't happening soon.""It's quite simple,"" Patrick Gauthier, an Amazon payments vice president  and a former PayPal manager, told the website. ""Amazon starts with the customer. If our customers were asking for it, it (PayPal) would have been on Amazon already.""Gauthier also told CNet that Pay with Amazon, which lets customers use their Amazon log-in on other retailer sites to buy goods, has ""over 23 million customers.""The company said it ended the year with 179 million active accounts, having added 6.6 million in Q4.

In the 12 months ended March 31, Xoom's more than 1.3 million active customers transferred $7 billion using Xoom, the company says.As part of the 2013 acquisition of Braintree, a mobile payment service, PayPal also obtained Venmo, a hybrid mobile payment app and social network for millennials.

In Q1, PayPal's revenue topped that of eBay's marketplace for the first time .""We currently value PayPal at a market cap of $44 billion,"" Anmuth wrote, ""and a post-spin share price of $36.

685,PYPL,"A day prior to PayPal (PYPL) reporting its Q4 earnings -- the second quarter since its departure from parent company eBay -- a Monness Crespi Hardt analyst has upgraded the stock to neutral from sell.In a research note Monday, Hardt analyst James Cakmak wrote that at the moment PayPal stock is trading at an appropriate discount given the competitive risks the analyst outlined in his downgrade report Jan. 4.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average expect PayPal sales to reach $2.51 billion in Q4, with earnings of 35 cents per share. That would put revenue up 14% year over year; EPS would be up 21% according to an estimate from Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham.PayPal started trading under its own ticker Jul. 20 of last year, after eBay (EBAY) spun the payments processor off.EBay had announced plans for the spinoff in 2014 -- in part because it was under pressure to do so from some shareholders, including activist investor Carl Icahn.PayPal stock was up about 1.6% near 32 in the stock market today, down 15% from late December and down 25% from its July high as a new spinoff.Apple (APPL) and Google -- its parent company is Alphabet (GOOGL) -- both have entered the payments sector with mobile products. Venture capitalist Alex Rampell has told IBD in the past that essentially the threat to PayPal has to do with how interested Apple is in its payments business vs. its more lucrative hardware division.“This is the Death Star coming,” Rampell said, referring to the planet-destroying battle station in “Star Wars.""In addition to corporate giants entering the payments fray, startups such as Stripe and Adyen pose risks to PayPal as well. Both firms offer developers easy-to-implement payments solutions.PayPal has an IBD Composite Rating of 81, where 99 is the highest.

690,PYPL,"As Silicon Valley remains firmly rooted as the global center of technology and innovation, rarely mentioned is one huge fact that could blunt a ton of good vibes: The area is due for a  major earthquake.“There are going to be infrastructure problems,” David Walters, Cisco Systems (CSCO) director of global safety and security told IBD. “If it’s 6.5 or greater, the bottom line is that a lot of people are going to be walking.”The U.S. Geological Survey says there’s a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on one of the region’s many faults in the next 30 years. The percentage shoots up to 89% for a magnitude 6 or greater quake, USGS scientist Morgan Page told IBD. Either could be catastrophic.""The Bay Area has the highest density of active faults per square mile of any urban center in the country, and on a long-term basis it has the highest amount of earthquake energy released per square mile of any urban center in the country,"" David Schwartz, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told the East Bay Express in 2005. ""So we're really kind of living at ground zero.""A magnitude 7 or greater quake would ""likely"" spur damage to buildings and infrastructure in the range of $95 billion to $190 billion, says Renee Lee, an analyst with Risk Management Solutions, a firm that models risk for insurance companies. “Despite the area being really well educated about earthquakes, and the substantial investments in infrastructure, we will expect to see some pretty significant damage if there’s a quake along the Hayward fault.”Scientists have long considered the Hayward fault one of the most likely candidates for a major quake within a few decades. The fault runs through Oakland and other heavily populated East Bay cities.What’s all but certain is that Silicon Valley will experience widespread utilities losses -- water, power -- as well as damage to buildings and infrastructure such as roads and bridges.A phenomenon called liquefaction -- in which normally solid soil acts like a liquid -- could wreak havoc on any firms with offices near the San Francisco Bay’s shore. Oracle’s main campus, for example, sits atop what’s called bay fill, a material that is highly susceptible to liquefaction. (Oracle (ORCL) spokeswoman Jessica Moore refused to comment on the company's business-continuity plans in the event of an earthquake, or any other natural disaster.)Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also have large campuses located on land susceptible to liquefaction -- though less so than Oracle's (neither of these companies responded to requests for comment). The liquefaction risk to Apple's (APPL) office in Cupertino is low.The good news is that the Internet will almost certainly continue to function, for the most part. Service disruptions are likely, but the core backbones that tie the Bay Area to the Internet will remain intact. That might not have been the case 15 years ago, though ""even then there were major fiber cuts that the Internet weathered fine,” Mike Leber, CEO of Hurricane Electric, an Internet backbone provider, told IBD via email.And many Silicon Valley companies have been sure to locate data centers in other parts of the country, so service disruptions are less likely.""Our data centers are located at sites which have limited potential for severe weather and seismic events,"" Yahoo spokeswoman Carolyn Clark told IBD in an emailed statement.Yet, though the experts can make educated guesses, no one knows how a big one might affect Silicon Valley, or any area, says Anne Wein, a USGS operations research analyst.""The hard work is going to be to get a description about what will happen,"" she told IBD. ""We're just not there yet.""The USGS is studying the issue, what it calls ""Project Haywired,"" and is aiming to complete its research in the fall, according to spokesman Justin Pressfield.In the meantime, uncertainty will persist. ""We haven't had a major earthquake in the U.S. since we have become so connected with wired and wireless technology,"" Wein said. ""Do we have new vulnerabilities? How much redundancy is there? How will this new technology help us recover?""Of 15 large Silicon Valley tech companies -- and several startups valued by investors at more than $1 billion -- that IBD contacted for this report, Adobe Systems (ADBE), eBay (EBAY), Oracle and PayPal (PYPL) declined to comment and nine did not return the request. Cisco provided access to executives for a wide-ranging interview, and Yahoo issued a brief statement.When asked why tech firms are reluctant to discuss business-continuity plans, Sam Singer, a public relations executive who specializes in crisis situations,  said tech companies are “better at talking about services and products. They’re not prepared to talk about public policy issues, safety issues, even though they ought to be.”He says that there’s no reason why companies shouldn’t be able to describe how they would deal with a natural disaster in the Bay Area without giving away proprietary information.“It’s important that companies discuss earthquakes,"" Singer said. ""They need to be leaders, and offer reminders to their employees, the public and the news media that we live in earthquake country.”Dick Evans, president of the Business Recovery Managers Association, a networking and information group for disaster recovery planners, told IBD that his group used to have more membership among major Silicon Valley firms. At the moment, he said, ""we don't have as many as we would like.""Cisco has been active in preparing for quakes. It might take the issue more seriously than others, in part, because it's among the tech giants that were around during the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, Walters says. That quake, centered near San Jose and San Francisco, killed 63 people, displaced 12,000, destroyed an estimated $6 billion worth of property and caused an unknown amount of productivity losses.At Cisco's main offices in San Jose, Walters says the company maintains what it calls ""Arks,"" which store water, food, tents and emergency supplies for all employees on site -- enough supplies to last up to three days.And executives all carry three-day survival backpacks in their vehicles, he says.The company also has a mobile operations center that can staff 13 -- and can turn it into a kind of mobile office for execs. The company has five command-and-control centers around the world -- with satellite communications abilities and backup generators for incident response vehicles. And the company conducts earthquake drills at its main offices.""We have the right processes, right supplies,"" Walters said. ""We know as much as we can about the fault lines and we want to be as knowledgeable as possible."" He adds that USGS scientists come in from time to time to talk about the fault lines with Cisco's safety and security team.The company also monitors incidents around the globe, and has a Tactical Operations team that it deploys on humanitarian missions to restore communications connectivity.Yahoo was willing to share a few details of its plans, though declined to provide access to business continuity executives.Spokeswoman Clark, in a statement, said ""Yahoo has prepared our technology, as well as our physical spaces, to allow us to continue to run and operate our business either in California or other parts of the world in the event of catastrophe. We have invested at our mission-critical facilities to provide for alternative power supplies that will allow those facilities to run in the event of a loss of power or other utilities.""

693,PYPL,"Payments processor and digital cash register maker Square (SQ) is set to release its first earnings report since its November IPO after the close Wednesday, with analysts keen to see results from its Square Capital and Square Cash operations.The fourth-quarter report could be better than expected, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin said in a research note Monday. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q4 revenue to clock a 37% year-on-year gain to $343 million, with a per-share loss minus items of 13 cents, compared with an 11-cent loss a year earlier.Square produces a line of digital cash registers and credit card readers targeting smaller businesses. It also processes the payments on these devices. Square has branched out to marketing and financial services -- such as payroll -- and offers short-term cash advances based on the transaction data it collects.RBC's Perlin expects a 14% sequential increase in software and data revenue, driven by Square Capital, the company's financial services business.""Arguably one of the more important drivers to total revenue growth, Square Capital will be a key focal point on the earnings call, as management has devoted considerable resources to the growth of this business,"" Perlin wrote.Perlin expects a lofty 140% increase in hardware sales, saying demand for the company's credit card chip readers has been strong.Square also has a peer-to-peer payments app called Square Cash that competes with payments giant PayPal (PYPL) and its P2P app, Venmo. Both are said to be popular with millennials, the coveted young-adult demographic.Perlin has a price target of 15 on Square stock, which was down 2% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 12.

As such, having a branded developer advocacy group is no longer necessary.""The team most recently known as Braintree_Dev will no longer operate under that moniker, and some members of the team will be integrated into developer facing roles throughout Braintree. Additionally, as we build the next generation of developer facing programs, we will not be bringing BattleHack back in 2016, but will be back soon with information on upcoming programs and events.""BattleHack is Braintree's hackathon -- an event where software developers compete to create a product during the duration of the event, which is presented for judging at the end.

697,PYPL,"The three most actively traded ETFs have something in common with certain presidential candidates. No, not Donald Trump.They've all recently rallied off their lows but are at various stages of trending higher.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) is 5% below its 52-week high. PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) is next, with an 8% gap. Small-cap iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) is 16% shy of the mark.SPY has been making lower highs and lower lows in the past year. Investors in exchange traded funds have, at times, run of patience waiting for SPY to return to its winning ways. They yanked $1.98 billion in just the first two months of 2016.However, assets in the ETF have grown in March to $176.94 billion. Investors seem to feel more optimistic about job growth and manufacturing at home and less bothered by the picture of disarray abroad.SPY set a 2016 high of 202.81 Friday, a nice turnaround for the largest U.S. exchange traded fund.Last month, it was down about 15% from its 52-week high. It's now trading 5% off that level.Here's a look at five top IBD 50 stocks that have contributed to its comeback:PayPal (PYPL) stock seems ready to bolt to new highs, a positive sign. The company is a lead player in the electronic payments industry. It has grown earnings 16% annually over the past three years and sales 18%.But company officials are no doubt looking in the rearview mirror. Wall Street banks are getting more aggressive about making inroads in the mobile payments field.Ross Stores (ROST), the biggest discount apparel retailer, has been described as a retail pick that could hold up even in a recession.  The stock is trading near its highest levels since December 2013.Ross has eight straight quarters of earnings and sales growth under its belt. But the company's latest full-year guidance lagged expectations on plans to hike wages and amid retail uncertainties.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) makes treatment for cardiovascular diseases, including heart valve disorders. Global sales of aortic valve products could exceed $5 billion, according to the company. The medical company has six quarters of double-digit earnings growth. Its stock is trading near multiyear highs as well.AT&T (T) touched a 52-week high Friday. The telecom stock, a defensive play, has held up amid a young market uptrend. Its 5% yield makes AT&T a coveted stock among income investors. Growth has been accelerating in recent quarters, thanks in part to its 2015 takeover of DirecTV.Reynolds American (RAI) is also trading near a new 52-week high. The cigarette maker brandishes four consecutive quarters of accelerating sales growth. Earnings grew 9% on average over the past three years.The stock yields 3.2%, making it a nice dividend play. Its $25 billion acquisition of Lorillard, the maker of Newport cigarettes, was considered a key strategic move.SPY has a 1.3% portfolio stake in AT&T and less than 1% in each of the others. Its top holding is Apple (AAPL), with a 3.2% weighting.The ETF is up 0.5% year to date.It gained 1.6% on the stock market Friday.
"
698,PYPL,"Square (SQ) stock plunged on heavy volume Thursday despite better-than-expected Q4 sales, as analysts worried about slowing growth in its number of merchant customers, among other challenges.Square stock was down 7.5% in early afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 11. Shares rose after hours Wednesday, following the company's release of its Q4 earnings to a generally positive reaction from Wall Street, even though its loss widened.Square makes digital cash registers often affixed to smartphones or tablets and processes payments on those registers, which are popular among small and midsize businesses. The company also offers marketing and financial services to those clients. Rivals include payments leader PayPal (PYPL).The fourth-quarter results presented some issues, Wedbush analyst Gil Luria told IBD. While ""the results themselves were good"" and the ""outlook for the year was positive,"" there were a few things investors should watch for, Luria said.""One, there was the lack of merchant growth,"" Luria said.On the company's earnings conference call, CFO Sarah Friar said the company was growing by 100,000 merchants a quarter. But Luria says that's a historical statement.""Customer growth (now) is less than 100,000 a quarter,"" Luria said, adding that the company has been touting that it has ""over 2 million merchants"" for more than six months.In addition, Luria cautions that Square Capital -- the firm's small-business cash advance operation -- is growing in an uncontrolled way, as the company is trying to lend to as many of its clients as possible.""Let's not forget what they are,"" Luria said. ""It's a subprime, small-business loan broker. You can grow quickly, but it's not always a good thing.""Luria says Square Capital is similar in many ways to Ameriquest Mortgage, which was a major U.S. subprime lender until its 2007 closure amid turbulence in the housing market. Subprime mortgages were a big factor in that meltdown.""Square is generating loans to people who cannot otherwise borrow money,"" Luria said.Since its November IPO, Square stock has been volatile. It priced at 9, peaked its first day at 14.78, and hit its all-time low of 8.06 a month ago. Square has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 43, where 99 is the highest.Luria says that one reason for the volatility is that only 10% of Square shares are available for trading. The rest are held by insiders and early venture capital investors. The lockup period for the VCs and many insiders expires May 17, which could pressure the stock.Visa (V) is among those that have a sizeable investment in Square.

700,PYPL,"Wall Street banks have declared war on Silicon Valley mobile payments platforms, arming to do battle in the peer-to-peer mobile payments business.As the likes of Square (SQ), Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) have charged into the uncharted waters of peer-to-peer payments, Wall Street banks have spent five years stitching together an alliance among JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) and others, according to a press release from Early Warning.Early Warning is a real-time payments and authentication firm that will manage clearXchange, a technology that lets bank customers make quick -- near-instant -- transactions. It now generally takes one to three days to transfer money between banks. Banks had been slow to innovate after the financial crisis, but now ""what we are doing now is delivering payments in real time, which is what our customers have asked for,"" Mary Harman, managing director for payments at Bank of America, said in an interview with Reuters.The banks are starting to use clearXchange to allow customers to transfer money almost instantly to friends and family. Peer-to-peer payments have been popular among millennials for splitting dinner bills, cab fare and paying rent.Achieving a critical mass fast is important for the banks using clearXchange. The so-called network effects -- the value unlocked from having a large customer base -- were critical to PayPal's early success in online payments, for example.PayPal was early to the peer-to-peer market and snapped up the popular Venmo app as a part of its $800 million Braintree acquisition in 2013. Braintree had acquired Venmo in 2012. Last year, Venmo moved $7.5 billion between people, and in January alone it handled $1 billion, PayPal told Reuters.As of Wednesday, only customers at U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America will be able to send money via mobile devices with the clearXchange platform. JPMorgan and Capital One Financial (COF) told Reuters they plan to plug in to the platform ""later this year.""Citigroup (C) is among banks that have not joined the alliance, Reuters said.PayPal stock was up a fraction, near 38, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company is an IBD Leaderboard stock. Shares are just below an early entry at 38.62. A conventional buy point lies at 42.65.Square stock was down a fraction Wednesday afternoon, as the company was set to report its Q4 earnings after the close. Investors are likely going to focus on Square Capital, the company's financial services arm, as an area of growth.Square's peer-to-peer payments app Square Cash recently added a feature that let customers store money in it, much like a PayPal account already does.Facebook built its peer-to-peer payments play within its Messenger app, and it did so in-house. The company has said Messenger has more than 800 million customers. Facebook stock was up 1% Wednesday afternoon, near 107.

It's near the top of a new base with a  117.69 buy point.Also in the IBD 50, Store Capital (STOR) dropped nearly 2% after pricing a follow-on offering of 33.3 million shares of common stock at 25.25.

724,PYPL,"On eBay (EBAY), you can buy one year's worth of work -- to be completed in little more than four months.While that listing may be a joke -- it appears not to be -- over the years eBay has garnered fame and infamy for the sometimes weird items and services people have listed on the popular e-tail website. And last week was no different.On Feb. 25, a prankster listed Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi on the site after the president reportedly said, ""By God, if it were possible for me to be sold, I would sell myself,"" in an address on state television. His condition was listed as ""slightly used"" and the seller would not accept returns. Bidding surpassed $100,000 before eBay pulled the listing.Unlike many of eBay's e-commerce rivals such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Wal-Mart (WMT) and even PayPal (PYPL), the San Jose-based company's platform is set up in such a way that bizarre items are almost inevitable (though it is worth noting that you can buy some pretty weird stuff on Amazon as well). In that spirit, here's a look at some of my favorite odd listings that have appeared on eBay:1. As noted above, this one is currently live on the site. Listed is ""one year of work equivalent to 2,000 hours of specialized labor over 4.25 months."" For $150,000 a ""loyal, dedicated and tireless contractor"" will labor 16 hours a day, seven days a week with no break or lunch -- for projects like painting, light construction work and ""bamboo plant propagation."" EBay spokeswoman Penny Bruce told IBD the listing is indeed in compliance with the company's policies.2. Another odd auction -- again, completely legit -- was the World's Largest BBQ Pit offered by a Texas man for the princely sum of $350,000. The 76-foot-long truck trailer has 24 barbecue pit doors, a walk-in cooler, beer taps and a ""place for stereo equipment"" and TV. The truck cab was an extra $50,000. It sold.3. In 2004, a man tried to sell an F-18 warplane via eBay for $1 million. Ultimately, the fighter jet did not sell -- it used to be a Blue Angel-owned aircraft -- but it did attract the attention of the FBI, which told the seller that the plane had to remain in the U.S.4. The last of our favorite weird items sold via eBay is a letter that Nobel Prize winning physicist Albert Einstein sent to philosopher Eric Gutkind shortly before Einstein's death. The letter references philosophical and theological themes, and expresses Einstein's belief that God does not exist. It sold for ... $3 million.

738,PYPL,"The number of consumers using mobile phones to make payments on the go is expected to reach 148 million worldwide this year, up 64% from 90 million in 2015, U.K.-based research firm Juniper Research said Tuesday.Apple (AAPL) and Samsung will account for nearly 70% of new customers for contactless payments this year, Juniper said. Apple Pay and Samsung Pay have been heavily promoted by their respective companies.When Apple Pay arrived in China in mid-February, nearly 40 million payment cards were registered to the service in the first 24 hours.In the U.S., nearly 1 in 5 point-of-sale terminals now supports contactless payments, creating the infrastructure for broader adoption, Juniper said.Contactless-payment systems use near-field communications technology.

739,PYPL,"Hot off the heals of its November initial public offering, Square (SQ) has added a feature that will up the stakes in its battle against payments rival PayPal (PYPL): Square customers can now store cash in the Square Cash service.Square Cash is a peer-to-peer payments service that lets customers send money to anyone in the U.S. with an email address. It's designed for things such as paying a friend back for a cab ride, or sharing a restaurant bill.The new feature Square announced Monday is called Cash Drawer, and allows anyone who has the Square Cash app -- sending or receiving money doesn't require the app, just email -- to store money and use it to pay people back at a later date.Square stock was up more than 3%, near 11, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The San Francisco-based firm had a strong first day after making its IPO, with its stock rising 45% that day and touching its still-record high of 14.78, after prices shares at 9. But the stock has mostly fallen since as many bigger companies compete in payments.The new feature makes Square Cash look a lot more like rival PayPal and its peer-to-peer payments subsidiary Venmo, which is popular among millennials. Both PayPal and Venmo already have the capability that Square added Monday.Square Cash is outside the company's core business, which is a set of digital cash registers and transaction processing, marketing and financial services, which it sells mostly to small businesses.Square CEO Jack Dorsey is also the top boss at microblog Twitter (TWTR).Visa (V) has a sizeable investment in Square.

"
741,PYPL,"Based on a survey of 1,000 PayPal (PYPL) customers, an analyst says that the company isn't getting enough credit for the potential impact of its peer-to-peer payments app, Venmo.According to Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg, investor concerns over the Apple (AAPL) Pay competitor are exaggerated -- PayPal's mobile sales continue to grow and have, in fact, accelerated since Apple released its payments app, he says in a research note.Venmo is a mobile app that enables friends and family to share expenses such as rent, meals and cab fare.Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), also competes in the payments game with its Android Pay.Though PayPal executives continue to emphasize the firm's ""platform agnostic"" approach -- it isn't tied to an operating system or platform -- and say that neither Apple nor Google is a real threat, some industry watchers disagree.Alex Rampell, a general partner at noted VC firm Andreesseen Horowitz, likened the prospects of either Apple or Google taking a bigger interest in payments to the Death Star -- the planet-destroying battle station in ""Star Wars"" -- approaching for all other rivals.""This isn't the 'Empire Strikes Back,' ” Rampell has told IBD in the past. ""This is the Death Star coming.""Kupferberg wrote in a research note Monday that PayPal earnings will accelerate due to transactions conducted with the Venmo app.Venmo is free for now, but PayPal executives say that they plan to monetize the app, which is popular with millennials. They say that PayPal plans to allow selected PayPal merchants to accept payment via the Venmo app -- and PayPal would charge its typical transaction fee (2.9%, according to Fortune magazine) in the process.According to Kupferberg, 67% of Venmo users would use the Pay With Venmo feature one or twice a month, with 44% using it three to five times a month, and 19% using it six to 10 times per month.Kupferberg says that Pay With Venmo transactions will yield larger profit margins because Venmo customers typically fund their accounts with debit cards, bank accounts and stored balances -- the result of others sending cash.PayPal stock was up more than 2%, near 38, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The San Jose-based company has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, where 99 is the highest.The stock has had a choppy few months since its spin-off from eBay (EBAY) in July. It hit its high of 42.55 during its first trading session on Nasdaq and has plunged to as low as about 30 on several occasions. At least one analyst says that the sell-off has been too hasty.Kupferberg's price target for PayPal stock is 44.PayPal has recently settled a lawsuit over a perennial issue that the company faces: locked accounts.

742,PYPL,"Stocks started off the week in quiet fashion, trading slightly higher near midday. The Nasdaq added 0.5%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.4% each.

744,PYPL,"Stocks were firmly lower in afternoon trading Thursday, but there wasn't much conviction behind the selling ahead of the Good Friday market holiday.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average fell about 0.4% each. The Nasdaq lost 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking lower than Wednesday's levels in the stock market today.Caterpillar (CAT) and IBM (IBM) outperformed in the Dow with gains of 1% each.In economic news, durable goods orders fell 2.8% in February, mostly in line with expectations, but it was the third decline in four months.The bond market didn't see much inflow despite selling in stocks.

"
745,PYPL,"Google announced a pilot app program Wednesday that aims to make it more seamless to use its Android Pay payments app.The new app, called Hands Free, will remove the need to use a smartphone at checkout, when shopping at merchants participating in the pilot -- which for now is limited to a southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area.With Hands Free, shoppers at checkout tell cashiers that they want to ""pay with Google."" Checkout computers, equipped with the Android Pay app, then let cashiers call up a photo that the shopper already has uploaded to the app, to verify the shopper's identity, and then complete the transaction. In select stores, Google is testing the use of in-store cameras to automatically confirm a shopper's identity, based on the uploaded picture.Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL).The announcement signals Google's growing interest in the crowded payments sectors. It's a complex and competitive arena, with companies in the mix including Apple (AAPL) with Apple Pay; PayPal (PYPL) which recently split off from eBay (EBAY); and recent  IPO Square (SQ).If Hands Free indeed signals that Google plans to aggressively tackle online payments, it could spell trouble for PayPal, according to Alex Rampell, a general partner at the noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.PayPal executives stick to their message that the San Jose, Calif.-based company is well-positioned, in part because unlike Google or Apple, it's platform agnostic. For example, PayPal processes many of the transactions conducted over Apple Pay.On Monday, San Francisco-based Square announced that it was adding the ability to store money on its Square Cash app, adding a feature already offered by PayPal and PayPal subsidiary Venmo. Venmo and Square Cash are peer-to-peer payments apps that are popular with millennials, which use them for things such as sharing the cost of a cab fare or meal.At least one analyst says Venmo stacks up well against rivals such as Google and Apple.Amazon.com (AMZN) is also in the payments business -- and that's the reason, according to industry watchers, that Amazon shoppers will not be able to pay with PayPal at any time in the near future. When PayPal spun off from eBay, executives said at the time that one advantage was the new business opportunities it couldn't get while attached to eBay.
"
746,PYPL,"Stocks dug into moderate losses at Thursday's open, feeling some drag from oil prices and weak trade in Europe.The Dow and S&P 500 dropped 0.5% each. The Nasdaq slipped 0.4%. Volume rose, up 14% on the NYSE and 4% on the Nasdaq, relative to action at the same time Wednesday.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 will require some effort on the stock market today if they are to extend their five-week climb to six. Both indexes open the final session of the holiday-shortened week down 0.6%.But while the S&P 500 remains comfortably above its 50-day moving average, a five-day climb by the Nasdaq petered out on Tuesday just as it hit resistance at the 50-day level. A move above that line would give the uptrend a psychological boost. If progress stalls there, it could leave the rally in a hangdog mood.Durable goods orders dipped 2.8% in February, according to Commerce Department estimates. That was a big drop from January's downwardly revised 4.2% increase, but better than the 3% decline projected by economist consensus. Minus transportation, orders ebbed 1%, a slight improvement over January's 1.2% dip, but worse than estimates for a 0.2% decrease.The Labor Department reported 265,000 initial unemployment claims filed in the week ended March 19. That was in line with consensus expectations, and even with the initial report for the prior week, but up from the department's downwardly revised 259,000 claims.Oil dropped hard, down almost 3% sending West Texas Intermediate back below $39 a barrel to trade at a 1% loss on the week.

Staples is attempting to acquire Office Depot (ODP) in a $6.3 billion deal announced in Feb. 2015. Office Depot shares jumped 9% in premarket trade Thursday.KBHome (KBH) popped 6% after reporting its fiscal first-quarter results after Wednesday's close. EPS and revenue easily topped consensus views. Home deliveries rose 23% and average sale prices climbed 5%. KB ended Wednesday 45% off a January low, fighting to overtake resistance at its 10-week moving average in an eight-month consolidation.IBD 50 stocks leaned to the low side in premarket action. PayPal (PYPL) led the declines, down almost 4%. The online payment processor dropped 2% on Wednesday, but ended the session holding a 3% gain so far for the week.Europe's market traded firmly lower near midday, with the CAC 40 in Paris down nearly 2%, and the FTSE 100 in London and Frankfurt's DAX both edging near 1.5% declines.

747,PYPL,"The stock market is in a confirmed uptrend. But $41.5 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock (PRGFX) is still way off its late-2015 high (it's down 10.36% this year going into Tuesday), like a lot of growth-oriented mutual funds. So what's the fund doing to position itself for the future and to resume the outperformance charted by helmsman Joe Fath since he took the tiller a little more than two years ago?After becoming manager in early 2014 and then reshaping the portfolio to reflect his strategy, Fath guided the fund to a 10.85% gain in 2015. That topped 96% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its peer group averaged a 3.60% gain. The S&P 500 edged up 1.38%.It will be increasingly hard to find growth in 2016, Fath said in his year-end commentary. Durable growers will be crucial to good performance. And he wants to use market volatility to find good growers whose price gets knocked too low -- relative to their long-term prospects.Eight of his top-10 holdings as of Dec. 31 have strong Composite Ratings from IBD of 80 or higher.He's already seeing gains out of names like Ross Stores (ROST). The apparel, accessories, footwear and home-fashions discounter is up 5% since its Jan. 20 low.

The No. 1 U.S. auto-parts retailer topped analysts' consensus quarterly earnings expectations Tuesday with a solid same-store sales gain. It benefited from upbeat industry trends and higher margins.AutoZone's Q2 earnings per share revved up 14%. Net sales rose 5% to $2.26 billion, matching views. Same-store sales climbed 3.6% from a year earlier. Gross profit as a percentage of sales widened to 52.7% from 52.2% the prior year, driven by higher merchandise margins.

753,PYPL,"Is digital currency bitcoin in Netflix's (NFLX) future as the Internet video streamer goes global? Netflix on Jan. 6 announced its expansion to 130 new countries, bringing its total to 190 countries worldwide. The same day, CFO David Wells brought up Bitcoin during a Q&A at a Citigroup investor conference in Las Vegas.Satellite broadcaster Dish Network (DISH), Dell, Expedia (EXPE) and Overstock.com (OSTK) are among U.S. companies that accept bitcoin in transactions.Netflix, meanwhile, faces challenges as it expands its video streaming service globally. Acquiring content rights is a biggie, but payments and pricing are other issues. Netflix plans to roll out its service in China later this year.Netflix accepts payments in some local currencies, Wells noted at the Citigroup conference. The Netflix CFO says Netflix has aimed to keep pricing comparable to the U.S., where its service starts at $8 monthly.Wells says it's possible that Netflix may offer wireless-only subscriptions in some countries where mobile broadband is actually faster than fixed-line Internet services.Wells says Netflix aims to keep its log-in procedure and payment systems as simple as possible as it expands to more countries.""The world in general from an e-commerce perspective is balancing security and fraud detection with friction-less sign-up,"" Wells said.Bitcoin, a decentralized, peer-to-peer, digital-payment network, is not designed for recurring payments and the digital currency is non-refundable. Still, it may work better in the future with payment systems such as PayPal (PYPL), some analysts say.""You have to authenticate, you have to make sure you have the right person, the right bank account, but you don't want to run people through a 20-step process, because that's not going to work,"" Wells added.Wells has learned from rolling out its service in markets such as Mexico, Brazil and parts of Europe, he says.""Payments are becoming more of a global world,"" said the CFO. ""You still have central banks. We'll see where we go from here in the next 10, 15 years. Countries still want to hold onto their monetary policy. But, it sure would be nice to have bitcoin in terms of a global currency that you could use globally.""Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

760,PYPL,"Despite today's market slump, Amazon.com (AMZN) had an undeniably great 2015 — but an analyst thinks that 2016 might not be as rosy. ""We believe even winners need to take breathers sometimes as estimates recalibrate,"" Monness Crespi Hardt analyst James Cakmak wrote in a research note. Monness Crespi Hardt is still ""very much positive on the name"" but believes that in the short run, there may be a better time to acquire Amazon.com stock.The e-tail giant's stock suffered a significant blow Monday, down about 6% in afternoon trading, near 637 in the stock market today. Amazon stock cut through its 50-day moving average in volume that is running more than triple normal levels. It's the first test of the key support level since the e-commerce and Web services giant broke out of a cup-with-handle base at 549.88 in October. The stock gained 118% in 2015.Cakmak sees four major reasons why Amazon stock will come under pressure in 2016:Gross profit growth may slow down — mostly due to greater investments in businesses such as original video content and Prime Now, the company's same-day delivery app.Amazon Web Services may suffer as competition heats up and industry pricing faces downward pressure.India will be a costly market to enter because the lack of infrastructure makes logistics a challenge.New products: Aside from artificial intelligence investments, Cakmak is unsure what to expect, though he wrote, ""We are reminded (of) the Fire Phone,"" referring to the company's tech foray that many consider a failure.Amazon.com did not return an email request for comment.Cakmak added that the downgrade from a ""Buy"" rating to ""Neutral"" might be ""premature"" due to strong Q4 earnings. A poll of analysts by Thomson Reuters projected Amazon's fourth-quarter earnings per share are projected to rise 267% to $1.65. The analysts forecast full-year 2015 sales of $36 billion and EPS of $1.88 after a 52-cent per-share loss in 2014, and they expect a 198% EPS gain in 2016.PayPal DowngradedIn his research note, Cakmak downgraded PayPal (PYPL) from ""Neutral"" to ""Sell,"" writing that he ""sees PayPal's prospects diminishing relative to the rest of the field."" Citing strong competition from Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Samsung and each firm's mobile payments solution, Cakmak wrote that he thought it was possible those offerings could eventually bypass PayPal as a payment option.Large retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are also building payments solutions and not relying on PayPal, Cakmak wrote.The analyst is also skeptical of PayPal via its Braintree subsidiary and its ability to continue snap up business from so-called ""unicorns"" such as privately held Uber and Airbnb. ""Unicorn"" is Silicon Valley jargon for startups that investors have valued at over $1 billion.""We see PayPal's long-term prospects boiling down to one core avenue, and that is peer-to-peer payments supported by the important Xoom deal,"" Cakmak wrote. Xoom is a money-sending service that PayPal has acquired.

771,PYPL,"Much as code-makers and code-breakers are locked in a seemingly endless battle, Netflix (NFLX) has a perennial struggle of its own: virtual private networks, proxies and unblockers. And now it has dragged PayPal (PYPL) into the fight.VPNs, proxies and unblockers have legitimate uses, but they can also be used to fake the geographic location of Internet traffic, which lets Netflix customers watch content they're not supposed to.“People will always try to find ways to get the content they want, no matter the technological barriers,” an unidentified Netflix spokeswoman told Wired. “We recognize that, and that’s why we are trying to offer our content to members globally at the exact same time.”Until recently, Netflix hasn't much cared that, say, Canadian customers use VPNs to watch shows restricted to the U.S. But as the company begins to roll out its plan for world domination (at least in video streaming), the situation appears to have changed.Cracking down on VPNs has some customers upset -- especially ones in small markets like Portugal -- and threatening to cancel their subscriptions. And now PayPal has either decided or been pushed into terminating its business relationships with unblockers that help customers circumvent geographic content restrictions.It looks as though Canadian VPNs are being targeted by PayPal for violating its terms of service, since video streaming Netflix America content from Canada violates copyright law.When asked for an interview with executives, a PayPal spokeswoman replied with the following statement:""As a global payments company, we have to comply with laws set by governments and regulatory agencies. PayPal does not permit the use of its service for transactions that infringe copyrights or other proprietary rights. This policy extends to services that unlawfully facilitate infringement by intentionally enabling access to copyrighted television shows or movies in places where distribution of the content is not authorized by the copyright owners.""In line with this policy, PayPal has recently discontinued service to certain businesses that actively promote their services as a means to circumvent copyright restrictions and violate intellectual property laws.

Due for a pause after its three-week rally, two days of weak volume suggest the market is unlikely to get too rambunctious before the European Central Bank's policy announcement on Thursday and, the bigger news, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee's meeting next week.Today, the Commerce Department reports January wholesale inventories data at 10 a.m. ET.

774,PYPL,"Investors bolstered Square (SQ) stock in after-hours trading, after the mobile payments company late Wednesday posted Q4 revenue that safely exceeded Wall Street's expectations.In its first earnings release since its November IPO, Square reported sales of $374 million, up 49% from $251 million in the year-earlier quarter.The company's net loss widened to 34 cents per share from 25 cents in Q4 2014, as operating expenses rose 52% to $157 million. The company didn't release EPS minus items. On that basis, analysts were expecting a 14-cent per-share loss, up from 11 cents.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q1 sales of $325 million, up 29% from the year-earlier quarter. Analyst model a per-share loss minus items of 11 cents, improving from a 14-cent loss in Q1 2015. The company guided to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of a $9 million loss to an $11 million loss, before ending 2016 with an adjusted EBITDA profit of $6 million to $12 million. It posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $6 million in Q4.Gross payment volume -- the total volume of payments processed by the company -- rose nearly 50% to $10.2 billion in Q4.The company provided only ""adjusted revenue"" guidance for Q1, calling for $132 million to $137 million, and for $600 million to $620 million for 2016. It posted adjusted revenue of $135 million for Q4, up 64% vs. Q4 2014.Square stock was up more than 1% in after-hours trading, after the company released its earnings. Shares jumped 4.8% in Wednesday's regular session, to 12.03, still a far cry from its all-time high of 14.78 touched on its first day of trading.The stock has been volatile -- in part, analysts say -- because investors weren't sure how to value the company before its first earnings release.Square provides digital cash registers and credit card readers -- which users affix to their smartphones or tablets -- targeting smaller businesses, as well as processing the transactions conducted over its point-of-sale hardware.In addition, Square offers its restaurant clients the Caviar app and delivery service. In 2015, Caviar launched in six new markets and is now in 17 markets across the U.S.Square CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey also is co-founder and CEO at Twitter (TWTR), which has led investors to speculate on his ability to run two high-profile companies with big challenges at the same time. On Square's earnings conference call, Dorsey said his dual jobs have ""been working out really well. I benefit a lot from a consistent schedule and structure."" Dorsey said he has separate four-hour meetings on Monday's with leaders of both companies, and shorter meetings on Wednesdays and Fridays. He pointed out that both San Francisco-based companies are located practically right across the street from one another.But questions like these also have led to a volatile stock, for a company whose rivals on some levels include major companies such as Apple (AAPL), PayPal (PYPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL).Square also provides transaction services such as peer-to-peer payments and other financial services such as payroll and short-term cash advances to its sellers.Square said that it extended more than $400 million in cash advances in 2015 through its Square Capital business, including $150 million in Q4 alone. The company says that 90% of sellers who have used Square Capital have asked for a second advance. Square Capital offers short-term cash advances to businesses with more than $250,000 in annual revenue.Square charges a flat rate for the cash advance repayments, which are deducted from each transaction a business processes through Square. The company uses the wealth of transaction data it collects about a company to determine how much cash it is willing to advance to a business.Analysts speculate that Square Capital can be a big opportunity for growth because of its product mix and its ability to keep merchants as Square customers.“Our sellers are our partners,"" Dorsey said on the call. ""When they grow, we grow.”On the call, CFO Sarah Friar said Square has more than 2 million active sellers and ""adds 100,000 active sellers per quarter.""In its Q4 release, Square said its Instant Deposit feature, which send funds from a sale immediate to a seller's bank account for a 1% charge -- normally, Square settles payments the next day -- has completed 600,000 such deposits since its August launch.In recent weeks Square has upped the ante in its battle against PayPal. Square Cash -- the company’s peer-to-peer payments app -- recently added a feature called “Cash Drawer” that lets customers store money in their account, instead of transferring it directly to friends. PayPal offers the same feature.It’s possible Square will attempt to leverage the feature into a mobile wallet, much like the direction PayPal’s own Venmo is heading. Venmo is a free person-to-person payment app. PayPal has opened up its ""Buy With Venmo"" option to “select” PayPal merchants. Buying from a merchant triggers transaction fees, which PayPal hopes will make the app profitable.Square is taking a similar approach, letting people check out with Square Cash at businesses that use Square’s digital cash register and transaction processing technology -- much the way Apple Pay and Android Pay, Google’s version of a digital wallet, do.

775,PYPL,"With Valentine's Day on Sunday, love is in the air, and if you're single, is probably poisoning it.But as couples lock down dinner reservations and gift orders, and single men cram for dates with books by Neil Strauss, here are five highly-rated IBD 50 companies that, in one way or another, could make for steamy investor relations: Facebook (FB), Global Payments (GPN), Michael Kors (KORS), Nike (NKE) and PayPal (PYPL).With oil prices diving and China's economy slowing, the prospect of a recession and credit-market contagion are on the minds of curious lovers everywhere. Let a strong company like Nike be your rock with its cash flow, solid dividend and share repurchase program, as it unlocks your passion with brand innovation.Cue the slow music and let the rose petals fall where they may as Jefferies finds the words:""Nike offers consistent cash flow and also a growth opportunity tied to continued success in China and emerging markets, and share gains for the brand and the sportswear category. While (analyst Edward Plank) likes the strong growth prospects for NKE outside of the core North America base and focus on capital returns to shareholders, he highlights Nike’s already dominant global market share in athletic footwear and competitive separation as contributing to consistent cash flow. Eddie anticipates new product innovation, driven by the 2016 Summer Olympics, will help to drive growth over the next year.""In that research note, released Friday, Jefferies cited Nike as among its picks with ""idiosyncratic growth and some degree of protection from a downturn.""The company could also become more involved with Apple (AAPL), whose Apple Watch has fitness-tracking capabilities.Shares of Nike closed down 1.3% for the week. Apple ended virtually flat.Nothing is more attractive than confidence, and analysts praised social media giant Facebook after its Q4 results last month soundly topped estimates, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was ""thriving."" Facebook has grown through mobile and video ads and has broken into virtual reality through its Oculus Rift headset, with romantic implications that need not be mentioned here.But for those who will not be boldly exploring any new boundaries this weekend, Facebook at least has one feature (detailed in this press release) that allows you to reduce your exposure to your exes.Shares cleared a consolidation in the days following Facebook's report, but they fizzled afterward and are currently testing support at their 50-day line.Facebook finished 2% lower for the week.Maybe your significant other wants a new handbag. Well, Michael Kors sells lots of handbags. And their stock jumped 23.9% on Feb.2 following the release of view-topping holiday-quarter results, which were boosted luxury offerings and e-commerce.Jefferies, in a note last month, predicted a rebound in handbags' appeal, citing new spring trends and slowing shoe sales, leaving shoppers with more money potentially to buy crossbodies, mini-bags or ""bag-cessories.""Michael Kors shares lost 4.4% for the week, finding some love above their 200-day line after a long dry spell below it.Whatever you buy on Valentine's Day, payment processor Global Payments could help you seal the deal, indulging customers with robust support for Apple Pay and a product suite of online and brick-and-mortar payment-technology solutions across 29 countries.But no multibillion-dollar company can drift through this entropic world alone forever, especially as the payments landscape becomes more competitive with the rise of e-commerce. To that end, Global Payments in December announced the $4.3 billion acquisition of Heartland Payment Systems (HPY), allowing it to reach out to smaller and midsize businesses.Shares gained 1.9% for the week, but the stock has trended below its key 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Meanwhile, PayPal, which Jefferies also cited as a good growth stock for an uncertain time, has become a globally recognized leader in online payments, partly due to social-payments app Venmo.""We see PayPal as the best positioned large-cap payments company for the current environment, with a strong hold on its core online market and options on tangential markets remittance, credit and in-store,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria said in a research note last month.Shares fell 2.2% for the week, testing support at their 50-day line.Image provided by Shutterstock.

That's way up from IBM's tally of an 8.5% sales gain for full-day Cyber Monday last year.Mobile users accounted for 46% of all online traffic, up 16% over 2014, IBM said.""Mobile continues to be the story,"" Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiatives at online transaction company PayPal (PYPL), told IBD.Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Digital Index, which says that it measures 80% of transactions for the top 100 U.S. retailers, projected U.S. Cyber Monday sales to hit $3 billion and be the largest online sales day of the year.Adobe said that mobile traffic accounted for 53% of shopping visits and 32% of sales.ITG analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD he sees three trends:• Heavy shopping has started earlier in the season.• Mobile buying has changed shopping behaviors.• And retailers, especially Amazon.com (AMZN), that have heavily invested in fulfillment infrastructure, will do well and lengthen their selling season.From Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, U.S. shoppers spent $8.03 billion online, up 17%, says Adobe. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note that initial shopping data appears ""positive"" for Amazon, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) and PayPal.""We're all pretty excited here,"" Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, told IBD.

EBay says that it sold two hoverboards a minute on Thanksgiving. ""If there were a breakout item, that's it,"" Hal Lawton, senior vice president of eBay North America, told IBD.ChannelAdvisor reported that as of 3 p.m. EST, Cyber Monday sales were up 16.8% over the year-earlier period, but a small percentage from last year's growth.EBay ""is offering very unusual promotions,"" said Wingo. ""They seem to be saying that we're going to opt-out of competing with the big guys on the latest GoPro (GPRO) camera, for example.""ChannelAdvisor said third-party sales were up 22% at Amazon but less than 2% at eBay, though it represents just a small percentage of eBay sellers.Lawton, in a statement, said eBay is making ""an aggressive push"" for daily deals on Apple products.No. 4 U.S. retailer Target (TGT) suffered a website outage at 10 a.m. EST Monday on heavy traffic. The company ran an aggressive promotion, offering 15% off any item on its website.

""We sold a limited edition Mercedes on an Android phone, a Lamborghini on an iPhone, and a Ferrari (RACE) Testarossa on an iPhone,"" he said.EBay says mobile growth is the trend. ""For us, mobile is not a new story,"" Lawton said. ""For Q3, we saw 43% of traffic on mobile. And we're seeing shoppers start on one platform, like a phone, and then finish shopping on another, like an iPad.""But Adobe said online sales were lagging its estimate. Sales between midnight and 11 a.m. ET Friday rose 15% from the year-earlier period to $822 million, it said, but Adobe had expected 19% growth. Adobe is anticipating $2.6 billion in online sales for Black Friday.On Thanksgiving, email promotions accounted for 14% of online sales, says Adobe, rising 25% from last Thanksgiving.Adobe's report also found that eBay surpassed Amazon.com in social media buzz.""We're very pleased by the results we saw on Thanksgiving, and we're pleased with the early momentum today,"" Lawton said.

794,PYPL,"As banks farm out more tech services and try to keep up with customers managing more of their money via their phones, Fiserv (FISV), a company that provides back-end technology to the finance industry, seems to be expanding at a solid, measured pace.Companies spilling over with triple-digit growth every quarter are drawing more adventurous investors, which is why many on Wall Street seem to like Fiserv’s steadiness. The company routinely generates single-digit sales gains and low-double-digit earnings growth, aided by share buybacks.Following the Fed’s rate hike last year and forecasts for fatter industry tech budgets, more of the same could be in store despite worries over a downturn and consolidation, the company and analysts say. That's due primarily to a steady income base.“When you have 85% of revenue recurring, it gives them a very good visibility into their numbers,” helping enable more accurate guidance and minimizing surprises when earnings season rolls around, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Alexander Veytsman told Investor's Business Daily.“They do increase pricing, but given the longevity of those contracts and given the fact that these clients have been with them for a number of years, I would say they’re growing it slowly and steadily,” Veytsman said.The nature of the company’s contracts with clients helps Fiserv maintain its firm footing. Many deals are longer-term and retention is high, Morningstar notes in its research on the company. In addition, it’s costly and potentially hugely disruptive for financial companies to switch from one core-processing service to another, helping Fiserv keep customers in the fold.And even amid Wall Street’s hand-wringing over a possible recession, Chief Executive Jeffery Yabuki told IBD that he sees the trends in tech spending among Fiserv’s own clients continuing.""Most of our revenue is based on non-discretionary, mission-critical technologies under longer term contracts and is not subject to dramatic fluctuation,” he said via email. “We are seeing stable and growing demand for newer technologies that enhance experiences in the increasingly digital world.”Brookfield, Wis.-based Fiserv serves 13,000 banks, credit unions, retailers and other clients around the world. If you’ve withdrawn money from an automated teller or transferred a balance from one account to another, there’s a good chance it went smoothly in part because of Fiserv.Created in 1984 through a merger, Fiserv handles everything from transaction processing to data analysis to person-to-person payment systems. With this year’s technology spending seen growing 4%-5% among banks and credit-union customers -- Fiserv’s bread and butter -- the company is set to follow, Argus Research says.“We believe that Fiserv remains well positioned to benefit from technology infrastructure spending among its primary customers (banks and credit unions), many of whom are working to improve processing efficiency for online bill payment and debit card transactions,” Argus analyst Stephen Biggar said in a research note last month.“This should help revenue to keep rising at a modest mid-single-digit pace,” Biggar said, adding that Argus sees 5.5% in sales growth this year.Shares are up 25% over the past 12 months. The company has a Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, boosted most recently by its strong fourth-quarter results that were marked by better-than-expected operating margins.The company also has tried to stay relevant through acquisitions. In 2011, Fiserv snapped up mobile banking company M-Com and digital payments outfit CashEdge, which gave it Popmoney, a bank-based person-to-person payments system for participating institutions that has helped drive sales growth. The company in 2013 announced that it acquired Open Solutions, giving it real-time account-processing technology.“You don’t need a new product every day,” Biggar said, “but you need something fairly significant every 2-3 years that would have its own sort of life cycle.”Last month, Fiserv said the United Nations Federal Credit Union for U.N. employees, among the largest in the U.S. by assets, will begin using Fiserv’s core account-processing technology. Analysts say the Federal Reserve’s rate hike in December could help strengthen banks’ finances, potentially freeing up cash for their technology budgets.“We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend, as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape,” CEO Yabuki said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last month.Some concern persists that Fiserv could make less money if consolidation continues within the banking industry, either due to tightening regulations or an event like the 2008 financial crisis. Mergers and acquisitions could reduce client count and give those bigger, combined companies more muscle in negotiating cheaper contract prices with companies like Fiserv.However, the reduction in clients hasn't materialized, Veytsman said, and the prospect of more banks bringing tech operations in-house seems unlikely. Fiserv counts Wells Fargo (WFC) among its big clients, potentially signaling a stronger shift to outsourcing among larger banks.Monness Crespi's Veytsman said consolidation could actually accelerate the trend of tech outsourcing.“When they consolidate they also look to see what’s happening with the bottom line and what they’re doing around the costs,” he said. “And if someone was not considering using Fiserv as a client, maybe together, they will.”Yabuki sees consolidation continuing, but stressed that the number of accounts and transactions has kept rising for the company.Foreign exchange amid a stronger dollar could also hurt the company, although its international exposure is limited, Veytsman said. Jack Henry & Associates and FIS are among the company’s primary competitors. Concern also lingers about Fiserv’s debt, although Yabuki cites the company’s $1-billion-plus free cash flow last year.Still, both Biggar and Veytsman say the company’s acquisitions have been relatively focused and restrained.And one might be forgiven for wondering whether a person-to-person service like Popmoney can compete with PayPal’s (PYPL) Venmo, or payment-tech offerings from Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and, potentially, Apple (AAPL).However, Yabuki said P2P was in the early innings. And Veytsman said Popmoney is intended more as a side dish in its offerings to midcap banks than a main course.""It’s very hard to challenge PayPal,” he said.

795,PYPL,"The stock market bulls were back at it Monday as stocks overcame a soft start and held modest gains in afternoon trading.The Nasdaq added 0.5% while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3%. That lifted the Nasdaq above 4609 -- just below the 4613 level at which it would break even for the month.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking below Friday's levels in the stock market today.Inside the IBD 50, PayPal (PYPL) jumped 3.5% to 38.80 in heavy volume.

Before the open, Wall Street liked the look of preliminary Q4 results, a new share repurchase program and a raised dividend.The market might still have a defensive tone, with gold miners, utility and food stocks still showing strength, but nondefensive areas of the market have been perking up. For example, as of Friday's close, three semiconductor-related industry groups ranked inside the top 25 of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.Among chip designers, Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) picked up 2% to 33.88 .

902,PYPL,"On today’s episode of the Zacks Friday Finish Line, Associate Stock Strategists Ryan McQueeney and Ben Rains take on this week’s biggest stories, including the latest in Trump’s ongoing trade war with China and June’s CPI data. The hosts also discuss Venmo’s new partnership with Uber, and later, they recap Friday morning’s top bank earnings reports.Make sure to subscribe and leave the show a rating on Apple Podcasts!First, the hosts touched on this week’s macroeconomic headlines, including President Trump’s new tariff plan. Just a few days after implementing a controversial batch of tariffs—which primarily targeted Chinese raw materials—the White House surprisingly announced another $200 billion worth of products which could face new charges soon.These products are primarily consumer goods, including baseball gloves, electronics, apparel, mattresses, and furniture. Of these, analysts were quick to highlight furniture makers as the most at risk companies. The majority of imported U.S. furniture is from China, and that could spell bad news for companies like Restoration Hardware (RH  -  Free Report), Williams-Sonoma (WSM  -  Free Report), At Home Group (HOME  -  Free Report) and Wayfair (W  -  Free Report).Ryan and Ben explain this situation and speculate as to whether these tariffs will actually come into effect. The hosts also discuss June’s CPI data, which saw its biggest monthly year-over-year uptick in about four years.This CPI growth was above estimates and has some investors concerned that inflation might finally be here. However, as the Finish Line team explains, much of June’s growth can be attributed to higher fuel costs, and stripping out energy, things were actually relatively in line with expectations.The hosts also touched on one of this week’s trendiest stories: Venmo’s new partnership with Uber. The PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report)-owned Venmo application is immensely popular with millennials and represents a top choice in the growing mobile payments industry.Now, Venmo users will find a “Pay With Venmo” option on the Uber application. PayPal has launched similar partnerships with the likes of Grubhub (GRUB  -  Free Report).Finally, Ryan and Ben recapped the results of Friday’s “Big Three” financial reports. It was a mixed bag from JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), but one thing is for certain: these reports did not blow investors out of the water, and they likely will not move the needle much in the sluggish bank industry.Still, make sure to check out the show to hear what the Finish Line team had to say about these companies!As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you want us to cover a different story, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

903,PYPL,"Shares of Paypal (PYPL  -  Free Report) surged more than 3.3% on Thursday after the company announced an expanded partnership with Uber. Uber riders could already use their Paypal balance to pay for trips, but now that ability will also include Paypal-owned mobile payment app Venmo.Early Thursday, it was announced that Uber will soon have a “Pay with Venmo” option, letting Uber riders use Venmo to pay for their fares in the main Uber app and for food in the Uber Eats app.For Uber, the addition will make it even simpler for people to pay, especially when they want to split fares. In the past, there was a $0.25 charge if riders wanted to split with friends, while that service will now be free with Venmo.On the other side of the deal, the move continues PayPal’s mission to make the Pay with Venmo option available for as many services as possible.“Adding Venmo as a way to pay within Uber and Uber Eats furthers our mission to provide a seamless way to pay for the services that matter most to our customers,” Bill Ready, the chief operating officer at Paypal, said in a statement.The company also previously introduced the option with food delivery service Grubhub (GRUB  -  Free Report).This partnership, along with other more recent moves by Paypal, is necessary for the company to win the intense battle over payment services. The Cash App, competitor Square’s (SQ  -  Free Report) mobile payment app counterpart, is already estimated to pass Venmo in downloads soon, while bank-backed Zelle is also challenging Venmo.Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is another key player in the payments industry, and the number of active Apple Pay users doubled in 2017 to 127 million globally, according to Loup Ventures. Furthermore, Uber has let riders use Apple Pay for payment since 2016.Bottom LineVenmo partnering with Uber will attract new customers to the platform and give the app more exposure, which should only help Paypal. However, competition from other companies in the market continues to intensify as the world becomes more and more cashless.Paypal has performed relatively well so far this year, with the share prices growing 20% since the start of 2018, but that growth will become increasingly more difficult to sustain in the future due to being in such a crowded industry.Paypal’s upcoming Q2 Earnings Report will be a vital indicator of the success of its existing deals and if the company can win moving forward in the payment service market. Make sure to check back here for more on Paypal’s earnings outlook and the rest of the payment service industy!The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

904,PYPL,"Founded in 1999 by English teacher turned entrepreneur Jack Ma, Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) began as a China-based business-to-business marketplace and has since evolved into a multinational conglomerate. With humble beginnings and a constantly growing number of revenue streams, the firm has seen exponential growth in the 19 years since its founding, currently boasting a market cap of nearly $500 billion.With this much momentum behind it, could the firm be as lucrative an investment today as it was in years prior? Let’s find out.The Big PictureAlibaba is headquartered in southern China and is an e-commerce goliath that currently focuses a majority of its operations on the domestic market. This Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) of China does not hold inventory or sell goods directly, but rather serves as a platform for third parties to do so. Besides e-commerce, Alibaba is also involved in technology development, cloud computing, logistics, digital entertainment, and other local services.The company operates two retail shopping platforms: Taobao, which is now China’s largest e-commerce platform, and Tmall, which is solely dedicated to official brand stores and retailers. It also developed Alipay, a third-party online payment platform similar to Paypal (PYPL  -  Free Report) that accounts for roughly half of all payment transactions within China. Alongside these services, BABA also operates platforms in global retail, wholesale market transactions, and advertising. Alibaba boasts hundreds of millions of users across these platforms.The firm has launched multiple initiatives around the world across each of its segments, making it an interesting company not only to follow but to potentially consider investing in as well. Let’s take a look at the numbers to get a better idea why.By the Numbers The firm is coming off a strong Q4 FY18 earnings report at the end of March, in which it posted earnings of $0.91 per share on revenues of $9.87 billion; both metrics surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 44.4% and 61%, respectively. Still, it is worth highlighting that BABA’s revenue numbers represent a 25.4% decrease from last quarter.Alibaba currently reports earnings across four segments: Core Commerce (representing its retail business), Cloud Computing, Digital Media and Entertainment, and Innovation Initiatives.Revenue from its domestic retail business, which represents 65% of total revenues, grew 56% year-over-year to $6.4 billion. This was due largely to a 98 million annual active consumer boost to 552 million overall, along with a 110 million increase in mobile monthly active users (MAUs) to 617 million overall. Retail earnings from international ventures hit $903 million, also representing significant year-over-year growth.Cloud computing was one of the main stars of the report, surging 103% year-over-year to $699 million. This was driven primarily by an increase in the number of paying customers as well as an increase in the usage of the firm’s more complex products, including content delivery network and database services. This will continue to grow as the firm expands its new ecosystem in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions. Digital media and other initiatives also saw strong year-over-year growth on effective expansion measures.Key Financials Moving on to key metrics, investors should first take note of BABA’s 12-Month Forward P/E Ratio of 25.7x, which is about in line with the industry average of 23.6x, shown here:Its ratio has historically been much higher than the industry average, but even so, the firm has consistently added value. By its own standards, the recent drop means that the stock is trading at a cheaper value than it typically does. While this may seem enticing, it is for a very important reason.In the background of Alibaba’s stellar growth story are concerns of a potential trade war between the United States and China. In recent weeks, numerous tech stocks have taken a hit as the Trump administration has threatened to levy tariffs on the “Middle Kingdom.” This week, theWhite House announced that it would impose $34 billion in tariffs on Chinese products starting at 12:01 am Eastern time on Friday. China responded by stating that it will also impose an equal amount of tariffs on the US.In the last month, BABA stock has decreased over 12% from its 52-week high of nearly $212 to about $184. Should an extended trade war take place, it, along with many other firms would feel the burn, particularly if the Trump administration does follow through on its threat of restricting Chinese investment on US tech firms.Still, Alibaba’s exposure to America is small enough that such a situation won’t hurt it significantly. The firm is strengthening its presence in other parts of the world, including Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Pakistan, and other nations in the region. Furthermore, it already holds a comfortable and ever-growing share of its domestic market.But if we examine the firm’s margins, investors might see another cause for concern:Over the past few years, the firm’s margins have been consistently trending downward. While BABA’s executive team mentioned this on a previous earnings call, stating that it would occur as the company continued to reinvest its cash into operations, including various expansion initiatives, current levels of about 58% are still quite healthy overall. This shows that even as BABA is spending cash, it is still earning it quite efficiently.Looking at revenues, growth has been quite consistent:The drop between December and March should not be a concern, since that is usually a slower period for BABA; there are no major events or holidays in China during that time. The overall trend is upward, indicating that the company is growing healthily and stably. This is important as it reflects the fact that its investments and growth initiatives are paying off.Furthermore, taking a look at the firm’s cash, we see another bright light:Alibaba is sitting on an ever-growing pile of cash, which it could potentially use for key acquisitions or further strategic investments. The firm did announce the acquisition of China-based delivery food start up Ele.me in April, which will be worth $9.5 billion after the transaction and already serves consumers across the country. It also acquired Pakistani e-commerce firm Daraz in May for an undisclosed amount, a move meant to expand the firm’s presence in South Asia. These moves will help the firm leverage its new retail and technological initiatives.Finally, looking at EPS estimates, we see further evidence that BABA is on track for greener pastures:While estimates for this fiscal year have been slightly trimmed from its highest point of $6.79 per share, it still represents an overall increase from those last year. In other words, concerns about BABA’s operations and a possible trade war are there, but so too is optimism that the firm can continue its trend of historical growth.OutlookShares of Alibaba stock have grown nearly 30% in value in the last year, compared to an industry average of 26% during that same time. A strong earnings report and continued strategic investments and partnerships are all signs that investors should be happy to see. Still, a potential trade war looms in the near future, and there is no way of knowing just how far it can go.In terms of Alibaba as an individual company, there is plenty of reason for optimism. However, more cautious investors may wish to first monitor the geopolitical situation between the US and China before deciding to act on any investment ideas involving the region. Furthermore, BABA faces risk politically as it must adhere to whatever policies the domestic government sets. It also faces heavy competition from fellow local tech giant Tencent (TCEHY  -  Free Report) across multiple sectors.For investors with a higher risk tolerance, BABA could be an interesting venture that is trading at a comparative discount given its size and growth plans. However, it still may be more prudent to continue monitoring the firm and related news before making any decisions.Alibaba currently sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

905,PYPL,"After two lackluster years, the U.S. IPO market has made an impressive comeback this year, with companies raising capital at a pace seen in the past two decades.120 companies have completed their IPOs and raised $35.2 billion on U.S. exchanges in the first six months of the year. This marks the highest volume since 2014 and the fourth-busiest year-to-date period since 1995, according to Dealogic. These IPOs have delivered an average gain of 22% (read: Best & Worst Zones of 1H 2018 and Their ETFs).In fact, the second quarter was the busiest since 2015 with 60 companies that went public raising nearly $13.1 billion. This marks the most-active quarter in three years as per IPO research intelligence Renaissance Capital. The number is well above 44 IPOs in the first quarter but the offering was well below $15.6 billion.  In terms of deals, healthcare companies, especially biotechs, topped the list with 25 deals worth $2.5 billion, closely followed by technology companies with 18 deals worth $4.6 billion. Healthcare accounts for more than 40% of IPOs while tech makes up for 30%. The financial sector was in the third position, representing 10% of IPOs with six deals valued at $0.2 billion.The largest offering in terms of proceeds was AXA Equitable Holdings (EQH  -  Free Report) that raised $2.7 billion. GreenSky (GSKY  -  Free Report) and BJ’s Wholesale Club  round off the next two, raking in $874 million and $638 million, respectively.   Most of the companies that went public last quarter have outperformed the broader markets and generated 29% returns. The gains came on the back of improving economic fundamentals and consumer sentiment that increased the appeal for new stocks with high growth potential despite trade war fears. Technology dominates the returns with seven of the 10 best-performing IPOs belonging to this sector (read: 4 Sector ETFs That Beat the Market in 1H).Among these, Chinese streaming company HUYA  skyrocketed 172.3% since its debut on May 10, IT service provider CLPS Incorporation  climbed 155.8% since its debut on May 23, laser maker nLIGHT Inc. (LASR  -  Free Report) surged nearly 108% since Apr 25 and cloud software Zuora Inc. (ZUO  -  Free Report) gained 102.4% since Apr 11. Goosehead Insurance (GSHD  -  Free Report) from the financial sector and Inspire Medical Systems (INSP  -  Free Report) from the healthcare sector popped up 160.5% and 126.1%, respectively, since they went public.What’s Hot on Wheels?The solid IPO trends are likely to continue as a large number of companies that had already filed in the first half this year are ready to come up with their IPOs in the second half. This is especially true as 65 companies are currently in the pipeline of going public and seeking to raise a combined $11 billion. The biggest upcoming IPO deal will come from TPG-backed commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield, which could fetch around $500 million (see: all the Total U.S. Market ETFs here).The IPO bunch of other well-known companies include Chinese car marketplace Cango (CANG), Chinese music streaming company Tencent Music Entertainment Group, wealth management behemoth Focus Financial Partners (FOCS), a maker of electricity-generating fuel cells Bloom Energy (BE), a biotech firm Rubius Therapeutics (RUBY), oilfield services and equipment provider AFG Holdings (AFGL), franc sand solution provider Vista Proppants and Logistics (VPRL), Immunotherapy biotech Replimune Group (REPL) and Canadian cannabis company Tilray (TLRY).How to Tap?With a large pipeline and some reputable companies likely to go public in the second half, 2018 is on track for 160-200 IPOs raising $50 billion or more. While investing in many IPOs at the same time could be difficult, investors could easily tap the IPO resurgence with the two domestic-focused ETFs discussed below:Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO  -  Free Report)This fund provides exposure to the largest and most-liquid newly listed companies by tracking the Renaissance IPO Index. New companies seek inclusion on a fast entry basis on the fifth day of trading. The fund currently holds 47 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for less than 6.5% exposure. Technology is the top sector accounting for 36% share while industrials, real estate and financials round off the next three with double-digit allocations each. The fund has amassed $19.3 million in its asset base while it trades in a light volume of less than 5,000 shares, probably implying additional cost beyond the expense ratio of 0.60%. The product is up 6.3% in the year-to-date timeframe.First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (FPX  -  Free Report)This ETF focuses on the largest, best-performing and most-liquid U.S. IPOs and follows the IPOX-100 U.S. Index. New companies can find entry into the fund’s holding after trading for a minimum of 100 days. In total, the fund holds 100 securities in its basket with the largest allocation going to the top firm, PayPal Holdings (PYPL  -  Free Report), with 8.4% share. Other securities hold no more than 5.74% of the assets. The product has a nice mix of sectors, with the top four being information technology, health care, consumer discretionary and consumer staples. The fund has accumulated $1.2 billion in AUM and sees volume of about 66,000 shares per day. It charges 59 bps in fees a year and has gained 5.3% so far this year (read: eBay vs. PayPal ETFs: The Story After Q1 Earnings).Bottom LineConsidering the most anticipated offerings of this year, investors seeking to take advantage of new growth stocks should definitely bank on these two ETFs. The huge success of the new listings and a prospering IPO industry would further drive the funds.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

906,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of its consumer credit receivables transaction with Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report). Pursuant to this, Synchrony acquired $7.6 billion in receivables, comprising PayPal’s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, valued at $6.8 billion at the time of closing. Moreover, it includes $0.8 billion as participation interests in receivables held by unaffiliated third parties.With this transaction, both companies have extended their current co-brand consumer credit card program arrangement and Synchrony will now act as the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the United States through 2028.PayPal expects to accomplish its asset light strategy, double down on their innovative consumer credit experiences for existing customers and profitably enhance its portfolio with this transaction.This collaboration would actually help both companies combine their expertise in order to provide seamless digital payments as well as innovate for merchants, partners and consumers. This will also allow Synchrony to enhance its leadership position in consumer credit programs. PayPal and Synchrony Bank have teamed up to provide PayPal-branded consumer credit cards to consumers since 2004. This expanded agreement with Synchrony Bank for the U.S. PayPal Credit online consumer financing program and the U.S. PayPal-branded consumer credit card program, enables PayPal to be partners with an industry leader and widen its consumer credit ratings.PayPal has always been active when it comes to forging strategic partnerships for providing better consumer services, penetration into different geographies, etc. Its ongoing collaboration with Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) in the United States, Europe and Asia-Pacific is intended to offer an enhanced consumer choice as well as an instant money withdrawal facility and data quality plus a point of sale acceptance.The company has also been vigorously working with Mastercard Incorporated (MA) for 10 years now.

907,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) has announced the conclusion of the sale of its consumer credit receivables to Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report).The latest divestiture is in sync with PayPal’s “asset light” strategy. Although the company will lose the interest earnings on these credit receivables but it will also be free from the credit-related volatility risk.This deal was announced last year back in November when the company had agreed to sell receivables worth $5.8 billion.PayPal received $6.9 billion as deal proceeds and Synchrony Financial ended up acquiring receivables worth $7.6 billion following the completion of the deal. Synchrony Financial’s acquired receivables include PayPal’s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio worth $6.8 billion and $800 million of participation interests in the receivables held by the third parties.Deal BenefitsThe recent deal seems to be a win-win situation for both the companies. The transaction has led to the extension of their co-branded consumer credit card program agreement which is likely to fortify their presence in the credit card market.Per the data from Euromonitor International, the credit card products are anticipated to contribute $4.8 trillion to the total card payments volume by 2022.Consequently, PayPal is well poised to reap benefits from this credit card market driven by the expansion of its partnership with Synchrony Financial.  Notably, this will allow the company to enhance its credit offerings.Moreover, this will add strength to the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program and the U.S. PayPal-branded consumer credit card program, enabling the company to deliver improved customer experience. This will help in attracting new customers to the platform.Coming to the price performance, shares of PayPal have returned 52.4% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 32.9%.Scope for DiversificationWe believe the recent transaction will aid the company in diversifying its business, consequently driving momentum in the online and digital payment sector.PayPal intends to use the freed up resources on the development of its other existing business as well as new businesses with more potential in the long haul.Moreover, the company will able to focus on more strategic acquisitions which will benefit its online payment solutions portfolio.PayPal has completed the buyout of iZettle, which marks as its biggest acquisition to date. Further, the company has acquired Jetlore and entered into definitive agreement to take over Simility and Hyperwallet. All these endeavors have aided the expansion of its product portfolio.Consequently, we believe PayPal’s solutions and product offerings will continue to expand and enhance with growing number of acquisitions. This is likely to improve its customer base.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Revenue (TTM) PayPal Holdings, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | PayPal Holdings, Inc.

908,PYPL,"MercardoLibre, Inc. (MELI  -  Free Report) is getting hit by increased competition, especially from Amazon, in the online marketplace. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see an 88% decline in earnings in 2018.MercardoLibre is Latin America's leading e-commerce company with its websites MercadoLibre.com and MercadoPago.com.Big Miss in the Fiscal First QuarterOn May 9, MercadoLibre reported first quarter results but missed on the Zacks Consensus for the 4th consecutive quarter.It posted earnings of a loss of $0.29 versus the $0.48 estimate.There are multiple analysts covering this company so it's not like there's only 1 or 2 and they can't get it right.The headline numbers looked great as gross merchandise volume surpassed the $3 billion market for the first time, up 34% year-over-year in USD and up 42.7% on an FX neutral basis.It saw a 50.6% increase in the number of items sold to 80.1 million.Unique buyers jumped 28%, driven by Brazil and Mexico, two of its largest markets while Colombia and Chile also delivered solid results.Total payment volume through MercadoPago rose 60.5% in USD and 81.7% on an FX neutral basis.Estimates Slashed for the Full YearIf everything was so good, why are estimates being cut dramatically?Free shipping.Amazon has entered into several of MercadoLibre's biggest markets, including Mexico. The company has to eat the difference as it rolls out free shipping.In the first quarter of 2018 free shipping cost the company $112.5 million versus just $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.The 2018 Zacks Consensus has fallen to $0.28 versus $1.93 just 2 months ago. By comparison, it made $2.53 in 2017 when it didn't have to pay for free shipping.The analysts are also bearish on 2019 as 7 estimates were cut for 2019 as well, pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $2.35 from $3.55.Shares Sink on Earnings DeclineThe good news is that the underlying business is healthy in both the merchant category and in payments.Shares had been on a tear the last 2 years with a gain of 105% but with the new free shipping dynamic, the shares have sold off.They're down 11% year-to-date.Because of the estimate cuts, the valuation is still insane, with a forward P/E of 1071.But if you're interested in the online merchant story in Latin America, which is a big growth market, you can always buy its largest competitor Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). It is trading at just 130x right now.Additionally, online payments are growing quickly in Latin America. PagSeguro Digital (PAGS  -  Free Report) is one of the largest players in Brazil.

The service now covers more or less 22 countries, including recent launches in Poland and Ukraine.Per Bloomberg, the mobile payment service currently serves Nordea Bank AB and Santander Bank’s customers in Norway. Moreover, according to Visa, the service will eventually be extended to clients of Sbanken ASA.Apple’s Norway expansion is a threat to Vipps, which has gained widespread adoption rapidly. Per Bloomberg, three million Norwegians are already using this mobile payment service. Hence, it will not be easier for Apple to get a foothold in the country, instantly.Nevertheless, international expansions have been a key catalyst for Apple Pay’s expanding user base. Active users more than doubled, while transactions tripled year over year in the last-reported quarter.Apple Pay Availability Boosts Services BusinessApple's Services segment, which includes revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing and other services, has become the new cash cow for the company. Apple Inc.

The availability of original content — now expected as early as March 2019 — will further boost subscription revenues.

The social media firm also joined tech giants Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), which all hit new 52-week highs on Tuesday.Price Movement Now that we have looked at Twitter’s most recent gains and explained the reasoning behind the surge, let’s take a look at more of the social media company’s current fundamentals that make it look like an attractive stock.Before Tuesday’s gains, shares of Twitter had soared over 118% during the last year, crushing the S&P 500’s roughly 13% climb. Twitter’s year-long surge also tops its industry’s 27% gain—this industry includes the likes of Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and others.Maybe more impressively, shares of Twitter have skyrocketed 160% over the last two years, which outpaces social media behemoth Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) roughly 63% climb. Investors will also note Twitter’s great year to date performance.Growth InitiativesMoving on, Twitter grew its daily active user base by 10% in Q1, while its monthly active user base climbed by 3% to reach 336 million. Twitter’s MAU growth might not seem that significant, adding only 10 million new users over the last year, but every user counts when it comes to growing its top line.The company’s advertising sales—which accounted for roughly 86% of Twitter’s $665 million total Q1 revenues—climbed 21% from $474 million in the year-ago period to $575 million. Meanwhile, the social media company’s international ad revenue surged 52%.Going forward, investors should expect to see Twitter’s adverting business become even more lucrative as it expands its live video reach. Twitter streamed more than 1,300 live broadcasts in Q1 and also announced that it signed more than 30 new partnerships in the first quarter, which includes deals with the likes of Fox Sports FOXA, NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), Viacom (VIAB  -  Free Report), Disney (DIS  -  Free Report)—which includes a ton of ESPN programming—and many more.Outlook Twitter is expected to see its Q2 revenues pop by nearly 22% to hit $698.93 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the current fiscal year, Twitter revenues are projected to hit $2.93 billion, which would mark a roughly 20% surge.Meanwhile, the company, which reported GAAP profits for the first time in Q4, is expected to see its adjusted quarterly earnings skyrocket 112.5% to $0.17 per share. The company’s fiscal 2018 earnings are also projected to soar by 68% to reach $0.74 per share.Investors should also note that Twitter has received 10 earnings estimate revisions for Q2, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. Meanwhile, during this same time frame, Twitter earned 13 upward revisions against zero downgrades for fiscal 2018.Bottom LineTwitter has been a great platform to share news instantly for years, but it had struggled to monetize its importance. Now, the company looks ready to profit from its live video push.Twitter is also currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

923,PYPL,"Amid widespread volatility, the Wall Street is back in the green territory for the year. The impressive run in the stocks last week has helped the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 index to attain this level. Meanwhile, gains for the Nasdaq Composite Index expanded, taking the lead this year, climbing 7.2%.Tech Sector BoostMost of the surge came from the technology stocks following the power-packed earnings. The market darlings, known as the FAAMNG group, which comprises Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) had slipped into deep correction territory in late March. However, these managed to bounce back and restore positive sentiments with better-than-expected results and optimism for future growth.Facebook shrugged off worries over the data-privacy scandal involving Cambridge Analytica that broke in mid-March, while Apple eased concerns over weak iPhone demand and greeted investors with a big capital return program plus Warren Buffett's increased stake in the firm. The fast-growing cloud computing business powered both Amazon and Microsoft’s growth story. Notably, Microsoft seems on track to record its strongest annual revenue growth for more than a decade. Netflix came up with blockbuster results while Alphabet’s numbers were also inspiring.Apart from these, semiconductor firms like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) and Intel INTC and payment companies including Visa V and PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) also fueled the rally and instilled confidence in the sector.Energy JumpsOil price has zoomed to the highest levels in more than three and a half years buoyed by potential export disruptions in Iran and falling production in Venezuela. Additionally, the historic output cut deal by OPEC, Russia and other producers to curb production is paying off, paving the way for a rebalancing of the oil market despite rising U.S. production. The rally in the commodity has lent major optimism to the energy sector, pushing many stocks to new highs.Other FactorsStronger-than-expected earnings are providing the biggest catalyst. Total Q1 earnings for the 444 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far are up 24.5% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 77.7% beating EPS estimates and 75% beating revenue estimates. Notably, the Q1 earnings season is on track to record its best quarter in seven years.Additionally, signs of easing trade worries between China and the United States as well as April inflation data raised the appeal for riskier assets lately. This is because soft inflation numbers have alleviated the month-long aggressive rake hikes concern.Given the improving macro backdrop, many stocks have been surging. Below, we have highlighted those five stocks that have been leading the way higher this year and are poised to continue their bullish trend given that these have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR  -  Free Report) – Up 784.7%This California-based audio technology company designs audio products for consumer, commercial and healthcare markets.

But the tide seems to be turning around following strong earnings, leading to an end to weeks of decline for the sector’s stocks (read: Tech ETFs to Buy After Massive Selloff).Total earnings from 81.5% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index are up 29.6% on 12.1% higher revenues, with a record 92.1% companies beating earnings estimates.

This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from reduced tax rates. These companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders. Additionally, the sector’s cyclical nature will allow it to perform well in a maturing economic cycle (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Further, the emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts.Given the recovering trend, most of the tech ETFs are on the rise following the power-packed earnings.

925,PYPL,"Vipshop Holdings Limited (VIPS  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 14, after the closing bell. Notably, the company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in the past four quarters. Vipshop has been gaining from rising consumer base, driven by increasing preference for online transactions. However, higher promotional costs have been a drag. With these aspects in mind, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Widening Consumer Base to Aid PerformanceVipshop has been consistently gaining from a growing consumer base. In fact, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the company’s revenues surged 27.1% year over year, owing to a 4% rise in the number of active consumers. Moreover, to keep widening operations and consumer reach, the company actively undertook strategic investments, evident from its partnership with Tencent and JD.com.Apart from this, the company made investments in upgrading its technology to enhance the shopping experience of online customers. In this respect, the company launched programs such as the WeChat Mini Program in 2017 and released the trial version of WeChat Wallet in February. Additionally, to serve consumers efficiently, the company has undertaken warehouse expansion efforts, especially on the international front. Moreover, Vipshop continues to bolster its last-mile delivery services. Encouraged by such efforts, analysts polled by Zacks expect the company’s revenues to surge 29.5% during first-quarter 2018 to reach $3,001 million.Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Vipshop Holdings Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vipshop Holdings Limited QuotePromotional Expenses a WorryVipshop has long been grappling with rising promotional costs, amid a highly competitive online retail market. This has led to lower gross margin in the past few quarters, which has affected the company’s profits. In the last reported quarter, gross margin declined 180 basis points. Although Vipshop has been trying to compensate rising promotional spending’s with reductions in other marketing efforts, it is likely to continue hurting profitability. Additionally, the company’s performance is expected to be dampened by costs associated with investments toward the expansion of the internet finance business, witnessed in the fourth quarter.Thanks to such deterrents, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the impending quarter is currently pegged at 13 cents per share, which depicts a decline of 31.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure. The current estimate has been stable over the last 30 days.All said, lets see what the Zacks Model reveals about Vipshop’s upcoming quarterly release.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Vipshop is likely to beat estimates this quarter This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

In particular, Apple led the impressive surge following upbeat results and Warren Buffett's decision to increase his stake in the firm (read: 6 Top-Ranked ETFs With Apple in Basket for Juicy Returns).Additionally, a string of reports from other tech players like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report), Intel INTC, Visa V and PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) also fueled the rally and instilled confidence in the sector.Coming to sector fundamentals, the twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax cuts and a rising interest rate scenario as well as the emergence of cutting-edge technology are acting as catalysts. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from reduced tax rates. These companies are also sitting on a huge cash pile and in a position to increase payouts to their shareholders.If these aren’t enough, the sector has a solid Zacks Rank in the top 44%, suggesting robust growth prospects in the coming months (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Given this, many tech ETFs have been hitting all-time highs in recent trading sessions, easily crushing the broad market by a wide margin in the past one month.

929,PYPL,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) sunk last Friday after news broke that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) might enter the peer-to-peer payment business. But PayPal’s downturn didn’t last long as investors dove back into the stock on Monday after the company announced a new international venture, and its larger banking ambitions became more well-known.International Expansion     PayPal just announced a new partnership with Safaricom that will allow users in Kenya to transfer money between their M-PESA and PayPal accounts. This should enable them to buy goods and services from all over the world more easily than before.Safaricom launched its mobile payment platform, M-PESA, in 2007 and it now boasts nearly 28 million customers. “We are excited to bring the M-PESA mobile wallet and PayPal joint services to the Kenyan market, which makes it more convenient and secure for users to withdraw and add money to their accounts while participating in the global digital economy,” PayPal’s GM for the Middle East, Africa and Russia, Efi Dahan, said in a statement.PayPal’s latest partnership is part of a series of international growth efforts that have led to real results. Last quarter, PayPal’s international revenues climbed 21% year over year to reach $1.69 billion. International sales accounted for 45% of PayPal’s total Q4 revenues.Yet, despite PayPal’s international expansion, the U.S. is still hugely important for the digital payment power. PayPal’s Q4 U.S. sales climbed by 30% to hit $2.05 billion, and now the company’s domestic top line might be set to get an even bigger boost.BankingPayPal has slowly expanded into the traditional banking industry over the last few months, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. The San Jose, California-based firm currently reaches out to select customers to see if they would be interested in adding basic banking features to their PayPal digital wallets.The company, which became known for its secure e-commerce payment platform, now offers select customers debit cards, FDIC insurance for their balances, the opportunity to direct-deposit paychecks, and much more.However, PayPal still doesn’t have an official U.S. banking license, which means it offers services, like its small business loans, through partnerships with banks.PayPal’s entrance into the larger banking industry puts the company in direct competition with other fintech firms. Square (SQ  -  Free Report) also offers clients the chance to take out small business loans and recently began giving users of its Cash App the chance to open bank cards.Recent Amazon Fears PayPal’s Venmo and Square’s Cash App have become hugely popular with younger users, as they allow them to pay friends and family for everything from food to rent. The success of these apps forced big banks, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), to invest heavily in similar mobile payments technology.Now Amazon looks ready to enter this crowded peer-to-peer marketplace. The e-commerce juggernaut is reportedly in the early stages of developing its own person-to-person payment technology for its widely popular Alexa voice assistant (also read: Amazon Looks to Enter Person-to-Person Payment Business).Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

930,PYPL,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) rolled out its mobile payment platform Apple Pay in Brazil, making it the first South American market to get the service.Reportedly, the company has entered into a 90-day exclusive launch partnership with Brazil’s largest private lender, Itaú Unibanco Holding.The nearly 1.2 million VISA or MasterCard holders of Itaú having an iPhone 6 or later can make payments using iPhones or other Apple devices like iPad or Watch, which is accepted at a number of locations in Brazil.As of the last reported quarter, the mobile payment and digital wallet service, launched by Apple in 2014, was available in 20 markets.Shares of Apple have gained 19.2% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 12.7%. Growing Adoption of Apple PayApple Pay’s integration with iPhones is helping it gain popularity. In the last reported quarter, its adoption increased 50% on a year-over-year basis among merchants. Moreover, global purchase volume more than tripled year over year in the quarter.We note that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams. Of late, the company’s strategy has been to identify new revenue sources that can boost its Services business, which includes Apple Pay among others.Notably, the segment witnessed an 18% year-over-year increase in revenues, higher than its flagship iPhone segment, which grew 13%.We believe, the launch of peer-to-peer payment service Apple Pay Cash in the United States in December 2017 is a step toward that direction. Management mentioned on the last earnings call that Apple Pay Cash is off to a “terrific start” with “millions of people” already using the service.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteIntensifying CompetitionIn order to cash in on the growing smartphone payments market, we observe that tech companies are focusing on expanding or building their mobile payments platform.Notably, the launch of Apple Pay in Brazil follows Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Pay launch in the country a month back, while Samsung Pay has been available in the country since 2016.PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) and its Venmo app are already dominating the peer-to-peer, mobile-to-mobile payments market. Square’s (SQ  -  Free Report) Cash App is also a very popular money transfer application.Moreover, Alphabet is set to launch an updated Google Pay Send platform in the coming months. Google Pay Send is similar to Apple Pay Cash.We believe that in order to expand its foothold in the market, Apple should expand the service to other markets.Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

933,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25. The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates. In fact, in each of the preceding four quarters, PayPal outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.8%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that PayPal is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Proofpoint carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.43%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the company is likely to continue reporting massive top and bottom-line growth on a year-over-year basis. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 54 cents, indicating remarkable year-over-year growth of 22.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $3.58 billion, up 20.3% from the year-ago quarter.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteSo, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What’s Driving This Upswing?PayPal’s growth depends on two major metrics — Active Customer Accounts and Total Payment Volume — and the company has been witnessing massive growth in both metrics for the past several quarters. This trend is likely to have continued into the to-be-reported quarter as well.According to our latest consensus estimates, PayPal’s active customer accounts will reach 233 million in the quarter, marking a year-over-year improvement of approximately 15%. Similarly, total payment volume is anticipated to surge nearly 30% year over year to $128.7 billion.The upswing will mainly be driven by several partnerships and strong adoption of the company’s mobile payment solutions.PayPal continues to ride on partnerships. The company’s ongoing strategic partnership with Visa (V  -  Free Report) provides enhanced consumer choice, point of sale acceptance, instant money-withdrawal facility and data quality. Similarly, PayPal and Mastercard have been working together for 10 years. The firms currently run a multi-year PayPal Extras Mastercard co-branded consumer credit card program. MasterCard is a ""clear and equal"" payment choice in PayPal’s wallet.The company’s partnerships with Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alibaba and eBay are also helping it add new customers and increase payment volume. Over the past year, the company has placed itself at a potential position for partnerships across multiple original equipment manufacturers (OEM), technology companies, mobile-carriers, retailers and financial institutions. All these are likely to aid the company’s first-quarter results.Furthermore, PayPal’s mobile payment tools — One Touch and Venmo — are other key growth catalysts. One Touch enables customers to make purchases through a variety of merchant websites or apps without providing additional information. At the end of the prior quarter, the service was in use by more than 8 million merchants and 80 million consumers.The company’s other platform — Venmo — enables users to transfer money between family and friends via mobile devices. Venmo users can pay at more than 2 million PayPal merchants across the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Venmo generated $10.4 billion of payment volume, marking impressive year-over-year growth of 86%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

934,PYPL,"Shares of Visa (V  -  Free Report) have climbed 3.3% over the last month in a sign that investors might be anticipating a strong quarter from the credit card giant. Now, let’s take a look to see what they should really expect from Visa’s quarterly earnings results.Visa, and rival credit card power Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) just recently announced their plans to join forces via one single online payment function. The two card networks plan to drop their respective online payment options to try to become more attractive in the fight for e-commerce spends. This move helps illuminate just how competitive the online shopping world has become with PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), other fintech firms, and even tech giants like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), all fighting for online shoppers.Clearly, Visa’s latest plan to grab more online payment business won’t show up on it upcoming earnings report, but it is worth noting how the company hopes to evolve in order to present shareholders more value going forward. With that said, Visa is coming off a strong quarter that saw the company’s earnings beat expectations and surge 25% from the year-ago period.The question is: what’s in store for Visa when it reports its quarterly earnings results after market close on Wednesday, April 25.Quarterly OutlookVisa’s quarterly revenues are projected to climb by 6.8% to reach $4.78 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Investors should be more impressed by the credit card firm’s quarterly earnings, which are expected to expand by 18.6% to hit $1.02 per share. Still, these estimates don’t give investors any idea is Visa is expected to top its current earnings estimate, which is important because earnings beats can lead to positive stock price movement immediately following the release of quarterly financial results. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, either way.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Visa is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 1.38%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.03 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that investors should consider Visa a stock that could beat quarterly earnings estimates. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

935,PYPL,"Shares of eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) have climbed 23% over the last year, and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) analysts just recently “double upgraded” the stock. With that said, investors must still consider how eBay is expected to perform in the first quarter, as Q1 will likely have a greater impact on eBay’s near-term price movement than Morgan Stanley’s positive long-term outlook.Morgan Stanley analysts raised their eBay rating to “overweight” all the up way from “underweight.” The investment bank also up its price target from $36 per share to $58 a share, which marks a nearly 40% premium compared to eBay’s closing price on Wednesday.The reason for this substantial upgrade centers on the fact that eBay, which split from PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) a few years ago, will finally start to transition away from the online payment platform—with a full transition expected by mid-2020. “EBay acting as both marketplace and payment intermediator could simplify and reduce costs for merchants, who would pay a single fee to eBay,” analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients.However, eBay’s recent upgrade and year-long momentum don’t mean investors should consider buying the stock ahead of its Q1 earnings report.Therefore, we have to look at what to expect from eBay’s first quarter earnings results to let investors decide if they want to buy eBay stock in order to take home some possible near-term gains.Latest Outlook & ValuationEBay’s Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 17.2% to reach $2.6 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s EPS figure is expected to expand by 8.2% to reach $0.53 per share.It is also worth noting that eBay has experienced nothing but positive Q1 earnings estimate revision activity recently.Of course, revenue and earnings growth estimates are just two of the many metrics investors will consider when eBay reports its first quarter financial results.Heading into Thursday, eBay was trading with a Forward P/E of 21.9, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Internet - Commerce” industry’s average of 49.7. Investors should be excited to see that eBay offers such great value, especially compared to its industry, for a company that is expected to experience big Q1 revenue growth.  EBay has also consistently traded at this earnings multiple over the last year, while its stock price has climbed. This signals that eBay’s earnings estimates have also continually climbed higher over this period.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance eBay has to surprise with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Ebay is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.31%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.54 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Therefore, investors can consider eBay a stock that looks poised to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Wednesday, April 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

936,PYPL,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) climbed on Thursday as investors continued to price in the possibility that the fintech power becomes a more full-service banking provider. With that said, amid current market volatility, investors should perhaps be more focused on PayPal’s upcoming first quarter financial results. PayPal, which currently boasts 227 million active customer accounts around the world, has slowly started to offer some customers the option to add traditional banking services, including debit cards, FDIC insurance, and direct deposit. The company’s ability to add these types of offerings will become hugely important going forward in order to compete against Square (SQ  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and maybe even Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report).However, while stocks continue to sink in the near-term, long-term gains might be far from some investors’ minds. Therefore, the aim is to take a look at what investors might expect from PayPal’s Q1 earnings release in order to avoid any further turmoil that a slow first quarter could bring.  Outlook & ValuationOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for PayPal’s Q1 revenues to climb by 20.3% to hit $3.58 billion. PayPal’s bottom line is projected to climb by a similar 22.7% to reach $0.54 per share. The digital payment company also earned one upward earnings estimate revisions within the last 30 days.Heading into its soon-to-be-reported quarter, PayPal is trading with a P/E of 33.5, which marks a massive discount compared to the “Internet – Software” industry’s average of 59.5. This means PayPal is currently offering investors solid value while presenting strong top and bottom line growth.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important factor that investors might want to consider ahead of PayPal’s Q1 earnings report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteWe can see that PayPal boasts a very strong earnings surprise history, yet its bottom-line results have not always immediately translated into positive momentum for the stock. Furthermore, investors should note that PayPal’s stock sunk immediately following the release of its fourth quarter earnings results, despite posting an earnings surprise of 5.8%.  With that said, past performance does not necessarily indicate future success or failure. PayPal is expected to report its first quarter financial results on April 25.Make sure to check back for more closer to PayPal’s Q1 earnings report!Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

937,PYPL,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growth has helped its shares skyrocket for more than a decade, which might leave some investors upset they didn’t buy Amazon stock a long time ago. Clearly, getting in on the ground floor would have been amazing, but now still looks like a great time to buy Amazon because Jeff Bezos’ behemoth is poised for more growth and is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Quick Overview Amazon forced the likes of Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and nearly every other retailer to revamp their business models, bolster their e-commerce platforms, and push much faster into delivery. Meanwhile, the company’s AWS cloud hosting business is one of the biggest in the world and competes directly against likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report).The Seattle-based company has also expanded its entertainment offerings through Amazon Prime Video, spending billions on new content to compete with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Hulu. The company’s streaming music business hopes to take on Spotify (SPOT  -  Free Report) and Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) Music. Amazon is also set to stream NFL games once again this season, and recently landed highly sought after Premier League rights.Amazon has also quietly grown its advertising business, expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint with bookstores and more experimental retail locations—not to mention Whole Foods. Meanwhile, the e-commerce power looks poised to further infiltrate key growth markets, such as India (also read: The Latest on Amazon's Booming Advertising Business).And this was just a quick overview of Amazon’s staggering scale. So now let’s move onto some more of Amazon’s current fundamentals.Price Performance Shares of Amazon have skyrocketed over 300% during the last three years, which crushes the S&P 500’s 34% climb, and also thoroughly outpaces Facebook's (FB) 139% surge, as well as Wall Street darling Micron’s (MU) 149% growth.Over the last year, Amazon’s stock price has climbed roughly 75%. Year to date, AMZN is up 46%, against the S&P 500’s 4.3% climb.Valuation Coming into Wednesday, Amazon was trading at 105.3X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which does mark a massive premium compared the S&P 500’s 17.3X. It is always worth remembering that Amazon doesn’t really care about earnings as it continues to pursue expansion.Yet, Amazon stock has traded as high as 282.7X over the last year, with a year-long median of 146.4X. AMZN is currently trading almost directly in line with its 52-week low, which means it is hardly a stretch to say that Amazon stock looks rather attractive at this current valuation.Let’s also take a quick look at the company’s forward P/E divided by its P/E to growth ratio or PEG, which is a somewhat more useful valuation metric to evaluate growth companies like Amazon. AMZN is currently trading at 3.5. This comes in above the S&P 500’s average of 1.8. But Amazon stock compares more favorably against its own history.AMZN stock has traded as high as 9.5 over the last three years and rested at 7.7 as recently as February. Amazon is also trading below its three-year median of 3.9 and currently presents a discount against fellow growth focused tech firm Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) 3.6.Looking AheadLet’s close by quickly looking at Amazon’s growth outlook. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Amazon’s second-quarter revenues to surge by nearly 41% to $53.46 billion. The company’s full-year sales are projected to reach $237.97 billion. This would mark growth of roughly 34% from 2017, which is pretty incredible for a company of its size and age. The company well-known on Wall Street for casting earnings aside is projected to see its adjusted Q2 earnings skyrocket 525% to $2.50 per share. Amazon’s fiscal 2018 earnings are expected to expand by 180% to reach $12.74 per share.Investors should also note that during the last 60 days, Amazon has earned 14 earnings estimate revisions for the second quarter, with nearly 100% agreement to the upside. During this same time period, Amazon received 17 upward revisions for the full-year against just one downward revision. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

939,PYPL,"Reportedly, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is set to launch a person-to-person payment system with the help of its voice automated assistant, Alexa. With help of the latest system, the process of transferring money will become seamless as users will be able to transfer funds through voice command. To complete the transfer, bank account details of the person to whom the money will be sent needs to be provided.With the latest move, Amazon is trying to strengthen its footprint in the financial and payment sector.We believe the customer base will increase significantly if the company succeeds at launching a voice supported peer-to-peer payment system with the help of Alexa.Coming to the price performance, shares of Amazon have returned 54.9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 41.4%.Improving Competitive PositionIntroducing Alexa supported payment system will strengthen the company’s competitive position against tech companies like PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), Square (SQ  -  Free Report) and Apple who have already launched a similar kind of payment system.Additionaly, the latest move will help the company to gain traction in the digital payment market.We note that Alexa might give a tough competition to PayPal’s Venmo, which is a digital wallet that makes payments to friends, families and others via a mobile app or web interface. Reportedly, shares of PayPal and Square already dipped on Apr 6, 2018 following the news.Payment Sector Holds PromiseIn today’s fast moving world, people prefer digital transaction.Amazon entered the payment market with the launch of Amazon Pay in 2005. The company introduced Amazon Cash, Amazon Gift Cards, Amazon Rewards Visa Cards and many more.Further, the company is likely to implement artificial intelligence on Alexa and would incorporate it into various payment system such as paying for car fuel or payment for shopping at Whole Foods Market.The company might combine its payment products and services into a single digital wallet and link it up with its e-commerce business which will make the online shopping and payment easier. Last year, the company added Amazon Pay to its Alexa team.Recently, Amazon partnered with J.P. Morgan Chase to introduce checking accounts. According to a survey conducted by LendEdu, 45% of the responders were willing to use Amazon as their primary banking account.Hence, we conclude that strong efforts on expansion of business in various sectors is helping Amazon to go beyond its well established e-commerce business.

940,PYPL,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) climbed premarket after the Wall Street Journal reported that the e-commerce giant hopes to enter the ever-growing person-to-person payment business. The move would put Amazon in direct competition with PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) Venmo as well as some big banks.Amazon is in the early stages of developing peer-to-peer payment technology for its widely popular Alexa voice assistant, according to the Journal’s report.In theory, this move would allow users to pay their friends, family, and possibly bills—similar to banking apps—by simply saying “Hey Alexa, pay John $50 for concert tickets.” This news helped send shares of PayPal and Square (SQ  -  Free Report) down premarket.The person-to-person payment business has grown hugely over the last few years, driven by Venmo and others. This has forced big banks, like JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), to invest heavily in mobile payments technology.Amazon’s entry into the peer-to-peer payment business would also encroach on credit cards firms such as Visa (V  -  Free Report) and MasterCard (MA  -  Free Report), which have invested in various fintech ventures for some time.For this payment initiative to work, Amazon might need even more access to consumer’s personal information, but this doesn’t seem to have been an issue for many customers, up to this point. It is also part of a larger move by Amazon to enter the financial sector, which includes possibly creating a checking account-like service.Amazon currently offers an online and digital payment service called Amazon Pay that is similar to PayPal.If Amazon does eventually offer peer-to-peer payment through Alexa, or even Prime, the company could easily grab a large portion of this quickly expanding economic sector. Nearly half of U.S. households are Amazon Prime members, according to a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners report.Venmo’s payment volume did expand by 97% last year, with the app processing roughly $35 billion worth of total payments. The company does not publish total user data, though some of the most recent estimates put its monthly users at around 7 million. Meanwhile, the more established, PayPal, currently boasts 227 million active customer accounts around the world.There is no official timetable or even confirmation that Amazon will offer peer-to-peer payment options. But if history is any guide, Jeff Bezos’ company will eagerly enter into another sector of the economy without hesitation. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

941,PYPL,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) sunk nearly 3% on Thursday morning amid what has otherwise been a stellar run for the online and mobile payments powerhouse. With no new stock-moving headlines to speak of, let’s take a look at some of the company’s current fundamentals to see if now might be a good time to buy this slight dip.Latest Earnings ResultsPayPal has moved higher since its latest earnings report in late January, so it is clear that investors liked what they saw.PayPal’s Q4 revenue popped 26% to reach $3.74 billion, while adjusted earnings surged 30% to hit $0.55 per share. The company’s widely popular Venmo payment app saw an 86% jump in payment volume. PayPal also expanded its business into new international regions that have the potential to drastically increase revenues.PayPal’s Q4 and FY 2017 Financial Earnings Results. $PYPL pic.twitter.com/HncjmcGKxo— PayPal (@PayPal) January 31, 2018More Fundamentals Looking ahead to the first quarter, PayPal is projected to see its revenues climb 20.3% to reach $3.58 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. PayPal’s top line is expected to grow at a similar rate the following quarter and hit $15.25 billion for the full-year, which would mark 16.4% growth.PayPal’s Q1 and full-year earnings are projected to surge 22.7% and 20.5%, respectively. The payment firm is also expected to see it adjusted earnings expand at an annualized rate of 17.5% over the next three to five years.But what could have caused today’s small sell-off?One possible answer is that some of PayPal’s earnings estimates have been trending downward recently. Within the last 60 days, PayPal has earned six downward revisions against just four upward revisions for the first quarter.On the other hand, earnings revisions have favored the upside 12 to two for PayPal’s current full-year within this same timeframe.Investors should also note that PayPal seems to focus on satisfying earnings expectations, which is something growth-based firms can neglect. The company has beat earnings estimates every quarter since it split from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), and a positive earnings surprise has sometimes resulted in an immediate surge in share prices.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteValuePayPal doesn’t necessarily scream value, but when compared to the “Internet – Software” industry’s average P/E of 61.7, the company looks outstanding. PayPal is currently trading at 35.5x forward earnings, which also marks a massive discount compared to the 55x it traded at in the beginning of January.PayPal is also currently trading at a discount compared to its new-age payment rival Square (SQ  -  Free Report), which sports a Forward P/E of 123.8. This should please PayPal investors because both companies operate a similar service and have expanded far beyond their initial business models into new growth areas, so investors are able to get similar exposure with PYPL at a more attractive earnings multiple.Bottom LinePayPal continues to try to bolster the variety of financial services it offers, including its relatively new entry into the world of “Robo Investing.” The company also has partnerships with a wide range of industry giants, including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report).Now might not be a bad time to buy PayPal at a slight discount, especially considering its propensity to focus on earnings while it also expands into new growth areas.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

943,PYPL,"The beginning of 2018 has been eventful for the remittance industry, which saw the termination of the mega merger between MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Ant Financial Services Group, formerly known as Alipay, an affiliate company of the Chinese Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA  -  Free Report)The deal met a dead end after it was shown a red flag by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”), which was concerned about the security of the personal data of U.S citizens, who are using MoneyGram’s services. Otherwise, it would have lead to expansion in the size and scale of the company, thereby enabling MoneyGram to provide a stiff competition to Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report).These two are pureplay money remittance companies. A number of other players PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report), Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (EEFT  -  Free Report) having money transfer being as one  among their other businesses have also entered the industry.Notably, this market concentration has been continuing for many years due to increased consolidation. One of the significant deal was the acquisition of Xoom by PayPal, which signaled players entering the industry to reap large untapped opportunities. PayPal, primarily operating via its digital platform also brought new challenges for the traditional brick and mortar players to invest in technology.Some other deals were also inked to enlarge the players business, in an effort to diversify from money transfer business to provide a bouquet of money management services.Competition May Lead to Mergers & AcquisitionsWe expect to see more consolidations as players diversify business to counter the increased competition. In fact, the companies in this remittance space are aiming to reach out faster to customers and cater to new markets, which are expected to fuel mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Generally, players respond to competition by making price modifications and introductions of products and services or by expanding geographically. But acquiring a best company is another most sought-after method to gain a foothold in the industry amid competition.After the failure of the merger between Moneygram and Ant Financial, the industry participants are very closely anticipating the former’s tie-up with Euronet. Earlier, Euronet had failed to woo MoneyGram as Ant Financial’s bid was comparatively more attractive.If the Moneygram-Euronet merger takes place it would make the market further concentrated by wiping out a major player.Techological Innovation to Trigger ConsolidationsProliferation of technology in everyday lives has also influenced the way money is being transferred around the world. Currently, customers demand for safe secure, flexible, fast, easy ways of transferring money to their relatives around the world can be met only by digital transfers.This changing need has compelled even traditional players like Western Union, MoneyGram to invest millions of dollars for building up technical platform to offer electronic money transfer services to keep their customer in loop. Another faster way of catching up on the digital revolution is to tap a player essentially proficient in electronic money transfer.Share Price PerformanceThe industry has rallied 34% in a year’s time, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 gain of 20%.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

944,PYPL,"Leading business service provider Cintas Corporation (CTAS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Dec 21. The company is likely to report higher revenues from Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment, which accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues, due to improved demand for its products.This, in turn, is likely to result in higher earnings for the quarter.Top-Line ImprovementCintas recorded industry leading revenue growth over the past few quarters with continued focus on core businesses. New business wins, deeper penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and customer retention remain key strengths of the company. In addition, Cintas also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. This focused approach for steady top-line growth is likely to benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Moreover, the successful integration of G&K Services Inc. is likely to expand Cintas’ customer profile and augment its revenues. With annual revenues of approximately $1 billion, G&K Services has more than 170,000 customers in the United States and Canada. The combined company is expected to cater more than one billion business customers with an extended product portfolio and additional processing capacity. Customer service is also likely to improve with increased route density.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products segment revenues is currently pegged at $1,296 million, up from $1,006 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues from First Aid Safety and Protection segment are expected to be $137 million compared with reported revenues of $125 million in the year-earlier quarter.Other Key FactorsHowever, a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment has mostly driven customers to perform certain in-house services themselves instead of outsourcing them to Cintas. This is expected to result in some loss of businesses. In addition, significant international operations expose it to risks of fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, which in turn, is likely to impact its financial results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cintas is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

945,PYPL,"Several large-cap tech stocks—including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)—were in the green on Wednesday morning, perhaps signaling that investors are ready to pile back on these firms after the recent sector-wide selloff.Technology companies have dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but in a brief moment of risk aversion spurred by investors looking to sure up profits, tech stocks began to tumble from their highs last Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped more than 2% over the next week, and 2017 darlings like Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and Square (SQ  -  Free Report) were hammered.Before the dip, our “Computers and Technology” sector was up over 30% on the year, outpacing the S&P 500’s respectable 20% gain. This group is still well ahead of the broader market, but as we head into the New Year, investors simply seem to be less enthusiastic about tech.The selloff appears to be relatively short-lived, but renewed volatility in the sector serves as a reminder that tech stocks are not untouchable. This is far from the first major tech rally that the market has witnessed, and it is important for investors to remember how Wall Street reacted when the sector’s previous runs ended.However, investors should be skeptical of bearish voices that are quick to proclaim today’s tech market the second-coming of the infamous dot-com era bubble.The “dot-com bubble” refers to a historic period of over-valuation in the tech sector caused by the widespread adaption of the internet in the late-90s. Shares of internet-based companies skyrocketed, and investors were willing to pour cash into anything that ended in “dot-com.”By the turn of the century, however, overspending and a lack of real sales and profitability pulled the rug out from underneath the sector. Some of the period’s most-hyped companies, including Pets.com and Webvan, went completely out of business, while giants like Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) watched their market capitalizations plummet.But herein lies the difference between the dot-com bubble and today’s tech growth. Earnings and revenue growth were never able to keep up with dot-com era valuations, while contemporary valuations are actually supported reasonably well by earnings and revenue.For reference, check out the average Forward P/E of our “Computers and Technology” sector during the dot-com bubble versus today: At the turn of the century, we were looking at tech P/E ratios in the 50s, nearly doubling the average of the broader S&P 500. Sure, today’s tech valuations are a bit loftier than the market as a whole, but the difference is miniscule by comparison.Prolonged tech rallies make investors uncomfortable because, to many, the dot-com bubble was not that long ago. However, the fundamental picture right now is significantly different. Smart investors cannot ignore these differences.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

949,PYPL,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) rose premarket on Monday morning after the company announced it reached a deal with an investment startup in order to offer its customers robotic trading options. The online and mobile payment powerhouse announced on Monday that it is set to partner with Acorns Grow Inc. to allow PayPal users to invest or set up a savings account with the five-year-old automated investment startup. PayPal users will have the option to link their funds to an Acorns investment account. Users can then choose between one-time investment options or make recurring payments. The connected payments giant hopes to give its users the ability to save more easily and create a stable, long-term financial plan. PayPal users who elect to set up an account with Acorns will be able to monitor the activity through PayPal’s online portal or mobile app.The San Jose, California-based company said it debuted this Acorns investment option to select PayPal customers in the U.S. today. PayPal will roll out the offering to its entire U.S. customer base by early 2018. Previously, PayPal users had been able to save and invest money through Acorns “Round-up” feature, which allows users to automatically invest in various low-cost, diversified portfolios of ETFs by rounding PayPal purchases up to the nearest dollar. “Together, Acorns and PayPal are helping democratize financial services and offering innovative solutions to the people typically underserved by the current system,” PayPal VP of Consumer Financial Services Joanna Lambert wrote in a statement. The company’s push into robotic—or more passive automated investment—comes after it took a minority stake in Acorns about a year ago during a $30 million fundraising round for the startup.Acorns gears its services towards mobile-focused millennials and people who might find it hard to make investments in traditional ways. The micro-investing app currently boasts more than 2.3 million U.S. users. PayPal shares surged before the opening bell and are currently up around 0.70%. On Friday, the payments company climbed to a new all-time high after announcing that it made a deal with Synchrony Financial (SYF  -  Free Report) to sell the firm roughly $6 billion worth of loans it made to online shoppers. PayPal investors then jumped on the stock, as the company plans to use the cash infusion for acquisitions and or share buybacks.PayPal continues to try to bolster the variety of financial services it offers its customers. This new Acorns relationship comes after PayPal struck deals with over 20 new partners—including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report)—all within the last year and a half. On top of that, the PayPal now partners with credit card giants Visa V) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report)—two brands that it has previously been at odds with. The company is also expanding its reach on a larger global scale.Before today’s announcement, PayPal’s stock price had already skyrocketed over 93% in 2017.

950,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) is the latest company to dive into the fast-growing digital payments market in India.The payment processor company recently announced the launch of its domestic operations in India in a bid to expand its presence in the country.The company’s price performance looks impressive. On a year-to-date-basis, the company has outperformed the industry. Shares of PayPal have gained 87.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 29.2%.More to the HeadlinesWith the launch of PayPal’s domestic services, Indian customers can now use PayPal to shop online at some of India’s popular businesses. Merchants who will offer PayPal can process both local and global payments for PayPal’s 218 customer accounts through the payment gateway.Reportedly, in this regard, the company is partnering with Government and state-owned banks on a number of initiatives including digital financial literacy program and eTourist Visa (eTV).In order to carry out its operations effectively, PayPal has set up a customer service centre in India with multi-lingual support capabilities. It has also provided an on-ground sales team which will help in driving customer engagement and education.Why India?The question should be, why not India!Firstly, the country has huge growth potential. According to the trade body GSMA and the Boston Consulting Group (some websites say the study was done not by GSMA but Google), the digital payment market in India will grow rapidly over the next few years and touch $500 billion, constituting 15% of India’s GDP by 2020. By then, non-cash payment methods (cheques, demand drafts, net-banking, credit/debit cards, mobile wallets and UPI) will double to 40% of total consumer payments.With 81% of Indian digital payment users preferring it to other payment methods, it’s currently expected that 90% of Indian consumers will are likely to use digital payments for both online as well as offline transactions. So it isn’t surprising that not just technology companies with their mobile wallets, but also telecoms, banks and e-commerce companies are jumping into the digital payment market in India.Secondly, Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, has attracted many global business leaders, namely Facebook.com (FB  -  Free Report) Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd toward India. Since his appointment as the country’s prime minister, Modi has taken a number of steps to realize his Digital India dream.Thirdly, the country has favorable demographics. India is home to around 1.25 billion people, or 18% of the global population. With only 26% of the Indian population accessing the Internet in 2016, the country was one of the biggest online markets with more than 348 million Internet users, second only to China. By 2021, the Indian Internet user base is expected to reach 555.3 million, or a 44% penetration. (Euromonitor estimates)Increasing Competition in This SpaceThe Indian digital payments market is already crowded with Alibaba-backed Paytm being one of the dominant players in the country.Apart from established players, a number of smaller players are also eyeing this lucrative market. These include Tencent-backed Hike Messenger, MobiKwik, Flipkart’s PhonePe, FreeCharge, Oxigen, Citrus Pay, PayU, ItzCash, Reliance’s Jio Money and Ola Money.In September, Alphabet’s Google also launched a localized payments app for India, trying to gain a foothold in the country's rapidly-growing digital payments space.There are also international players like Truecaller, Uber and Amazon Pay. Additionally, Facebook and WhatsApp are working with the NPCI for a UPI-enabled payments platform.Bottom LineAlthough this industry is becoming highly competitive, PayPal is gearing up to make a mark for itself in the fast-growing digital payment space.Strength in PayPal’s core business and growth of Venmo will help the company to cash in on the future of transactions. While Venmo is not a major money-maker for the company yet, it has gained popularity in the last few years and should help solidify PayPal as the mobile transactions company of today. Also, PayPal continues to ride on partnerships and mobile centrism. The company’s ongoing strategic partnership with Visa provides enhanced consumer choice, point of sale acceptance, instant money withdrawal facility and data quality.We believe the continuous rise in demand for mobile payment solutions will help PayPal to grow and expand internationally, now in India too.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

953,PYPL,"Shares of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) gained more than 1.3% in morning trading Tuesday as the technology behemoth celebrated the launch of Google Pay, the company’s latest response to Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) popular mobile payment platform.In short, Google Pay is one of a growing number of options that let users pay for goods with their smartphones. This new iteration follows several failed attempts by Alphabet to launch such a platform, including Google Wallet and Android Pay.Google Wallet was the search giant’s first foray into this market before it was folded and transformed into Android Pay. Now, Google Pay promises to combine features from both—such as the ability to pay at checkout counters using a phone and the option to scan into certain public transit systems.Alphabet has also said that Google Pay users will be able to send money to one another using its new “Google Pay Send” platform, which is slated to launch within the coming months. This feature mimics several popular money-sending applications, including PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) Venmo and Square’s (SQ  -  Free Report) Cash App. Google Pay Send is also a copy of Apple’s newly-launched Apple Pay Cash.At the end of the day, Alphabet’s new mobile payment offerings are a direct response to Apple’s progress in the market. Apple Pay has exploded in popularity over the past few years, thanks in large part to its integration on iPhones.But Alphabet is certainly no smartphone slouch, and over the next few days, Google Pay will reach all Android-enabled smartphones around the world—meaning that the platform is a serious contender in terms of exposure.But will Google Play catch on?Alphabet’s frequent rebranding of its payments platform seems to imply that previous iterations have not resonated with users. However, a quick glance at Google Pay’s debut features does not necessarily reveal anything particularly new that could provide a spark.Alphabet said that it is currently working with partners to ensure that Google Pay users will be able to use the new platform to shop for goods online or by using Google Assistant, but right out of the box, the Google Pay launch appears to be more of a name change than a reimagining.One also has to consider whether Apple Pay and Google Pay are even really competing for the same users. Is a preference for a specific mobile payment platform really going to be enough to sway someone who is on the fence about going for an Android or an iPhone?If anything, the launch of Google Pay reaffirms the hype around mobile payments and suggests that these platforms will continue to be a focus for tech companies going forward.Want more analysis from this author?

954,PYPL,"The Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report) seems poised for long-term growth on the back of its steady investment in digital platform, which has been yielding strong returns. Numerous alliances, pacts and deal renewals have also broadened the company’s network in the United States as well as across the globe.The company’s fourth-quarter earnings were driven by its revenue growth in digital business. On this front, westernunion.com money transfer revenues  increased 22% in the quarter, representing 10% of overall consumer-to-consumer revenues. The segment should further witness growth through westernunion.com’s expansion in the core countries, enhanced mobile services and digital partnerships plus thriving products and services. Additionally, stable pricing and moderating foreign exchange headwinds should contribute to this upside.As one of the world’s leading money remittance companies, Western Union has been making business transformation under its initiative of WU Way.  It successfully rolled out this initiative and achieved $25 million of savings in 2017.The company generates solid free cash flow and boasts a stable track record of returning capital to shareholders via share buybacks and dividend payments. In February, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 9% with the current yield being 3.6%, way higher than its industry’s 0.6%.The company’s return on equity (ROE) of 206.8% remains ahead of the industry’s 35.6%, reflecting is tactical efficiency in using its shareholders’ funds. Moreover, the company’s ROE has grown steadily since 2014.Nevertheless, Western Union expects weakness in its US domestic manufacturing business, accounting for 7% of the company’s total revenues in 2017. The business has been experiencing a drag in its transaction trends since the second half of last year and is likely to have been affected by free peer-to-peer services in the market to an extent. The company expects a subdued performance from this part of the business.Western Union is also facing severe competitive pressure from the recent acquisition of Xoom by PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report). Notably, the companies enjoy a significant presence in the digital money transfer market with the acquirer fast catching up via intensive investments. Also, there are high chances of a merger between MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (EEFT  -  Free Report) (after a failed merger attempt by MoneyGram with Ant Financial). Western Union has always commanded premium pricing in the market by virtue of its brand name, reliability and near monopoly in the market. But industry consolidation might pose some stiff competitive challenges to the company.Share Price PerformanceIn the last six months, shares of the company have returned 7.3% compared with the industry’s rally of 19.5%. Despite this underperformance, we believe the stock has enough room to grow, given its favorable 2018 guidance and strong fundamentals. The stock’s lower-than-market positioning (currently trading at a forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11, which compares with a five-year trading range of 9.6-13.9 and is lower than the industry P/E ratio of 24.3) further makes it an attractive buy. Moreover, the stock carries an impressive Value Score of A.Western Union carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

955,PYPL,"Benchmarks finished mostly in the red on Thursday as investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014. Additionally, weak earnings results from United Parcel Service weighed on the broader S&P 500. Further, the tech-heavy index, Nasdaq fell ahead of major tech earnings. However, rising rate hike prospects pushed financial blue-chips like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan upward, which in turn boosted the Dow.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.1%, to close at 26,186.71. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,821.98. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,385.86, losing 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 1.6% to close at 13.75. A total of around 7.80 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.23 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.24 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?In its two-day policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that the labor market remained strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The central bank also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Tighter labor market and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.722% on Wednesday to 2.773% on Thursday, its best levels since April 2014. Also, 30-year U.S. Treasury yield surged more than 3% for the first time since May 2017. High treasury yields weighed on broader equity markets to a great extent.Q4 Earnings Continue to Hog AttentionOn the earnings front, shares of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) decreased 6.1% despite posting upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results. (Read More) High level of shipping costs during the holiday season weighed on the package delivery company’s net profit, which in turn dragged down share performance.Additionally, PayPal Holdings, Inc’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) shares declined 8.1% after its former parent company, eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) decided to rely less on the company for processing payments. Separately, the company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues, which beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)Meanwhile, tech stocks took a breather on Thursday ahead of earnings from major tech companies like, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Economic Data Bolsters Rate Hike ChancesPer the Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary data, non-farm business sector labor productivity declined 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was in contrast to previous quarter’s increase of 2.7%.Moreover, the ISM manufacturing index declined from 59.3% in December to 59.1% in January. But the index remained at its best level since June 2004. Reading above 50 indicates expansion in the activity. Additionally, ISM Prices Index advanced from 68.3% in December to 72.7% in January, reaching its highest levels in seven years.Additionally, the U.S Department of Labor reported that seasonally adjusted initial claims decreased 1,000 to 230,000 in the week ending Jan 27, its lowest level in more than 44 years. Low initial claims indicate a tighter labor market, which along with increase in factory prices cemented rate hike prospects further.High rate hike chances had a positive impact on the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), which rose 1%. Some of its key holdings, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) rose 1.7% and 1%, respectively.

956,PYPL,"Bloomberg and Marketwatch are reporting that eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) has new plans for independent operation after the expiry of its existing operating agreement with PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) signed when the two companies separated for greater operational flexibility.Accordingly, it appears that the agreement, which expires in the middle of 2020, will not be renewed. Specifically, what it means is that eBay will not be promoting PayPal to its customers any more, nor will it try to maintain PayPal penetration on its platform at around 80%, Paypal will no longer devote resources to build payments products for eBay. Also, PayPal can build its own marketplace if it so chooses and eBay will be able to build its own payments platform, as required.The news stories say that PayPal will remain a payment option for eBay customers until at least 2023. While they don’t say anything about the current data sharing arrangement between the two, eBay is now expected to take over payments intermediation from PayPal meaning that it will be processing customer payments itself and distributing to sellers. For the purpose, it will be collaborating with a Dutch company called Adyen. eBay expects this to lower payments processing costs for sellers.Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel said in a conference call that “In the new intermediation model, we will simplify our relationship with sellers and plan to charge them a single fee for our Marketplace and payment services”. So basically, the fees paid to PayPal earlier will be split between eBay and Adyen and also adjusted against amount due from sellers.This is naturally a huge positive for eBay, which should see a jump in both revenue and profitability.In PayPal’s case, it is of course a big negative. PayPal Chief Executive Daniel Schulman called it “the best possible outcome for PayPal.” CFO John Rainey said that “There’s nothing about what’s been announced today that changes our thoughts on our ability to continue to grow our top line and bottom line after the operating agreement.”PayPal spokeswoman Amanda Miller said, “The planned evolution of our relationship with EBay is consistent with our strategic direction and growth opportunities and does not alter our financial guidance.” These sound like brave words, because it can’t possibly be easy to replace a big and lucrative revenue source. At the same time, nothing is expected to change overnight, so there won’t be any impact on immediate guidance. There’s also nothing to suggest that Paypal won’t be able to acquire the technology or partnerships within the next 5-6 years that can generate continued growth for the company.eBay currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) while PayPal has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So none of these stocks are recommended at the moment. For exposure to the space, it’s better to consider stocks like MeetMe (MEET  -  Free Report), Castlight Health (CSLT  -  Free Report), HubSpot (HUBS  -  Free Report), or Nice Systems (NICE  -  Free Report), all of which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Or, simply take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Quarterly revenues and earnings both came in above the company’s expectations as well as surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Despite this, shares of PayPal plunged drastically during late-hour trading yesterday as its former parent company — eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) — has decided to rely less on the company for processing payments. The online marketplace company, during the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings conference call, announced that it has signed a Dutch payment company — Adyen — as its new primary payment processor.It should be noted that eBay accounts for 13% of PayPal’s total payment volume (TPV), thereby contributing a major portion to its total revenues. Therefore, if this volume tanks by nearly 50% due to the recent development, it might consequently impact PayPal’s top and bottom lines massively in the near term.The stock lost more than 11% of its value during yesterday’s after-hour trade. Notably, PayPal was one of the best performing stocks in 2017.  The stock has appreciated 115.6%, significantly outperforming its industry’s gain of 33.2%, in a year’s time.Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesThe company’s net revenues jumped 25.6% to $3.744 billion, on a year-over-year basis (up 26% on an Fx-neutral basis), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.631 billion.

PayPal added record 8.7 million customers in the fourth quarter, taking the total active customer accounts to 227 million.During the quarter, the company entered into agreements with big companies like The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), Dillard’s, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) and QVC Group.

Venmo users can now pay at more than 2 million PayPal merchants across the United States. One Touch is currently in use by more than 8 million merchants and 80 million consumers.In the reported quarter, mobile made significant contribution to PayPal’s volume growth, processing $48 billion of transactions and accounting for approximately 37% of total payments made on its platform.TPV was $131 billion, increasing 29% year over year on an Fx-neutral basis.

The mid-point of the range is better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.55 billion.Non-GAAP earnings are estimated in the band of 52-54 cents per share.

They shouldn’t be overlooked.These are five companies you should be tuning into this week.

Shares have soared, however. Is the move justified or is it priced for perfection?2.    eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) hasn’t missed since 2014. That big sell off in 2015 was the PayPal spin-off. eBay has always been overlooked by technology investors but the shares have been grinding higher. Maybe it’s time to take a second look?3.    Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) has missed only one time in 5 years yet the shares sank to new multi-year lows last year on fears that all the apparel retailers were going under thanks to Amazon. That obviously hasn’t happened. Is the worst finally over for the apparel companies?4.    Ferrari (RACE  -  Free Report) is a niche player in the auto industry but it’s serving them well.

960,PYPL,"Technology sector earnings gain steam in this week of the Q4 reporting cycle. Notably, the technology sector has been witnessing an upside since the last year on the back of innovative ideas and technological advancements. Driverless cars, facial recognition payments technology, advancements in artificial intelligence, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), increased demand for cloud storage and Internet of Things (IoT) related software are aiding growth.Per the latest Earnings Preview, Technology is one of the five sectors anticipated to report double-digit earnings growth with the other four being Oil/Energy, Basic Materials, Industrial Products and Construction. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 16.8% on 9.3% higher revenues.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company’s earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment, as well as management’s ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Notably, our research shows that the chance of beating earnings estimates is high when a stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s see what’s in store for these four software stocks, all of which are expected to release quarterly numbers on Jan 31.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), a broad-based technology provider, is set to release its second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Microsoft is likely to beat expectations as it has a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.21%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s revenues is pegged at $28.35 billion, representing an 8.8% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for earnings stands at 86 cents per share, reflecting an increase of 3.6% from the year-ago actual figure.The company’s Azure Cloud Platform is likely to be a major contributor to growth.

961,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this online payment solution provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and posted in-line results in the other occasion. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.4%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 52 cents, representing remarkable year-over-year growth of 23.8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $3.63 billion, up 21.8% from the year-ago quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model conclusively shows that PayPal is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chance of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. PayPal currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an ESP of +0.11%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?PayPal’s growth depends on two major metrics – Active Customer Accounts and Total Payment Volume – and the company has been witnessing massive growth in both the metrics for the past several quarters. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.According to our latest consensus estimates, PayPal’s active customer accounts will reach to 225 million in the quarter, marking a year-over-year improvement of 14.2%. Similarly, total payment volume is anticipated to surge 30.4% year over year to $129.6 billion.The upswing will mainly be driven by several partnerships and strong adoption of the company’s mobile payment solutions.PayPal continues to ride on partnerships. The company’s ongoing strategic partnership with Visa (V  -  Free Report) provides enhanced consumer choice, point of sale acceptance, instant money withdrawal facility and data quality. Similarly, PayPal and Mastercard have been working together for 10 years. The firms currently run a multi-year PayPal Extras Mastercard co-branded consumer credit card program. MasterCard is a ""clear and equal"" payment choice in PayPal’s wallet.The company’s partnerships with Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alibaba and eBay are also helping it add new customers and increase payment volume. Over the past year, the company has placed itself at a potential position for partnerships across multiple original equipment manufacturers (OEM), technology companies, mobile-carriers, retailers and financial institutions. All these are likely to aid the company’s fourth-quarter results.Furthermore, PayPal’s mobile payment tools — One Touch and Venmo — are other key growth catalysts. One Touch allows customers to make purchases through a variety of merchant websites or apps without having to enter additional information. At the end of the prior quarter, the service was in use by more than 6 million merchants and 70 million consumers.The company’s other platform — Venmo — enables users to transfer money between family and friends via mobile devices. Venmo users can pay at more than 2 million PayPal merchants across the United States. In the third quarter, Venmo generated $9.4 billion of payment volume, marking impressive year-over-year growth of 93%.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

964,PYPL,"Palantir Technologies is a privately-held software and services company that has taken Silicon Valley by storm since its launch back in 2004. It was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp (now CEO) with the idea of “creating the world’s best user experience for working with data, one that empowers people to ask and answer complex questions without requiring them to master querying languages, statistical modeling, or the command line.”While its name is derived from the palantÍr, a “seeing stone” in J.R.R. Tolkein’s fantasy series Lord of the Rings—even its motto is “Save the Shire,” in reference to the home of the hobbits of Middle Earth—Palantir actually emerged from mobile payments giant PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) anti-fraud efforts (its co-founder Thiel also co-founded PayPal).It’s also often considered to be one of the most secretive tech unicorns out there today. And by secretive, I mean a couple of things. For one, many people just haven’t heard of the company, especially outside of the tech and investing worlds; its Big Data focus is not nearly as flashy and exciting as ride-hailing or home-sharing. For another, Palantir and its technology is still best known for antiterrorism and spycraft, two avenues that must be secretive in order to thrive. It’s “Minority Report come true,” writes The Guardian.What They DoIf you have heard of Palantir, then you know that the company’s technology has been used in several notable cases, including the discovery of the infamous Chinese espionage networks, GhostNet and the Shadow Network. There’s also their rumored-but-never-confirmed efforts to help take down Osama Bin Laden.Even though its role in Bin Laden’s takedown will likely never be established as fact, what can be recognized, however, is Palantir’s extensive relationship with the U.S. government. Just as recently as six years ago, Palantir sold exclusively to the government sector.  The FBI, CIA, IRS, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and several branches of the armed forces have all been customers, and up to 50% of the company’s business is tied to the public sector. Even In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm, was an early investor.For instance, The Guardian goes on to note that the Pentagon “used Palantir software [in Iraq] to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage-door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it.”Palantir also has commercial customers that rely on them to detect fraud, study consumer behavior, and search for a competitive edge against rivals; these clients include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and Bridgewater Associates, a global investment management firm, among others. Overall, private customers make up about 75% of Palantir’s revenue, notes Fortune.Big Data PioneerAs a whole, Palantir prides itself on being one of the world’s Big Data solutions experts. It’s a term that refers to a collection of structured and multi-structured data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside a company, representing a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. Examples of structured data include tweets (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other social media posts, while multi-structured data is something that can be derived from interactions between people and machines.To help tackle Big Data, Palantir created two software suites for which it’s best known for. Formerly known as Palantir Finance, Palantir Metropolis is software for data integration, information management, and quantitative analytics. The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and public data sets and discovery trends, relationships and anomalies, including predictive analytics. And yes, this software suite is named after the home city of Superman.For users like hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms, Metropolis provides a number of integrated applications in order to build up interactive models using all the data that is available in their system. This includes Custom Metric, Dashboard, Date Set, Explorer, Regression, and Spreadsheet applications.The other is Palantir Gotham, formerly known as Palantir Government. This software integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and secure collaboration. Like Metropolis, Gotham is named after the home city of fellow superhero Batman.Gotham provides a suite of tools that are optimized for semantic, temporal, geospatial, and full-text analysis. Users can seamlessly drag and drop data objects from one application to the next, and applications include Graphs, Maps, Object Explorer, Browser, and Mobile.IPO BuzzWith a valuation at $20 billion, Palantir is one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed tech startups, but the company has yet to lay out any specific plans for an initial public offering. However, that hasn’t stopped IPO buzz from building, and investors have been excited for a while now about the potential for a Palantir market debut.The hype grew even more once President Trump took office, as co-founder Thiel is one of his closest tech advisors and CEO Karp joined with some of the industry’s biggest names—including executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), just to name a few—during the president’s transition period.Despite its impressive valuation and presidential connections, Palantir is still not profitable, though the company expects to reach profitability in 2017. Palantir doesn’t report current revenue, but according to Fortune, it brought in over $1 billion in 2014, and that commercial bookings in 2015 almost doubled year-over-year.But with buzz certainly comes controversy. In September 2016, Palantir was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian applicants by routinely eliminating them in the screening process; Palantir recently settled, and will need to pay nearly $1.7 million in ""back pay and other monetary relief.”For now, talks of a Palantir IPO remain a combination of speculation and anticipation. Last October, Karp told The Wall Street Journal that the company was “positioned so [it] could go public,” a positive sign that Palantir could hit the market in the near future. And with its Big Data-focused business—something that will only become more prevalent with the rise of artificial intelligence—unique user base, and fundamentally secretive operations, Palantir’s potential IPO could be one for the books.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Garry Tan was a co-founder of Palantir; he came on board as employee number 10. This version has been corrected.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

965,PYPL,"BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Dec 20, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 5 cents per share compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny. Results were aided by robust software sales. Total revenues in the quarter were $249 million, down 25.4% year over year. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $231 million.Lets see whats in store this earnings season.Factors Likely at PlayWe expect BlackBerry’s fiscal third-quarter results to be benefited by strong software sales on the back of its decision to end all internal hardware development and focus exclusively on software business.Of late, the company has also inked many deals to bolster its software business. For example, during the quarter BlackBerry signed a sales and distribution agreement with Tokyo Electron Device Limited. Per the agreement, Japanese device manufacturers will have access to Blackberry's QNX Software Development Platform 7.0, the most advanced and secure embedded platform in the market.In fact, BlackBerry’s efforts to expand its product portfolio augur well and should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. The company expects its Software and Service revenues to rise between 10% and 15% for fiscal 2018.During the quarter, BlackBerry was ordered to pay Nokia (NOK  -  Free Report) approximately $137 million following the loss of a payment dispute with the latter. We expect management to provide an update on the issue on the fiscal third-quarter conference call.However, BlackBerry is exposed to risks related to foreign currency fluctuations as it operates globally. Adverse foreign currency effects might also hurt results in the to-be-reported quarter. High costs might hurt the bottom line as well.BlackBerry Limited Price and EPS Surprise  BlackBerry Limited Price and EPS Surprise | BlackBerry Limited QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that BlackBerry is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny.

966,PYPL,"Putting a man on the Moon is, without a doubt, one of the most remarkable feats of human achievement. The accomplishment also underscores humanity’s thirst for competition, as the conclusion of the “Space Race” between the United States and the Soviet Union all but squashed our desire to visit the Moon, and humans have not visited the celestial body since 1972.Now, some 25 years after the last manned mission left our Moon, humanity finds itself on the cusp of another major Space Race—and bringing man to Mars is the objective.Besides the more advantageous destination, which would mark humankind’s first visit to another planet, the current race to Mars is also different than the original Space Race because of the parties involved. Gone are the days when space served as a front for the Cold War; today, the Space Race is being held by multibillion dollar corporations.The current frontrunners in the race made their positions clear last week, when Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) CEO Dennis Muilenburg boldly declared that his company would beat Elon Musk’s SpaceX to the red planet. Musk’s Response? Bring it on: Do it— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 7, 2017 But Musk, who rose to fame as a co-founder of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) and now runs Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report), is not the only celebrity tech entrepreneur that Muilenberg and Boeing will square off against.The third major player in today’s Space Race is Blue Origin, a privately held spaceflight services company created by Jeff Bezos. The Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) founder has used some of his own e-commerce riches to fund Blue Origin, which promises to lower costs and make private human space travel more reliable.Being the first organization to send humans to Mars is not a publicized goal for Blue Origin, although one would assume that establishing the planet as a realistic destination is a goal for any space tourism company.SpaceX, on the other hand, is adamant about its desire to reach the red planet first. In a 2011 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Musk said that a 2021 arrival date was SpaceX’s best-case-scenario, even though NASA does not expect to bring humans to Mars until the 2030s.In fact, Musk’s worst-case predication was that SpaceX would put a man on Mars within 15 to 20 years, meaning that the enigmatic CEO is pretty confident that his company will beat the world’s premiere space agency there.Nevertheless, Boeing might already have a significant head-start. The aerospace behemoth is building NASA’s Space Launch System, a new design that Muilenberg has described as the “largest and most powerful rocket ever built.”The ultimate goal of Boeing’s new Launch System is to send a deep space capsule piloted by American astronauts further into space than manned aircraft has ever travelled. According to a recent Chicago Tribune report, one scenario includes astronauts making a pit stop at a Moon-based docking station before heading to Mars.As competition continues to heat up, Boeing’s biggest advantage is a steady stream of cash from its other operations. Demand for the company’s flagship commercial jets is strong, and at the end of its most recent quarter, Boeing’s cash and marketable securities totaled $10 billion.Founded in 2002, SpaceX survived on about $1 billion in private funding through its first decade of operation. The company now generates revenue by running cargo missions to the International Space Station, and it recently raised another $350 million at a valuation of $21 billion. Meanwhile, Bezos plans to sell about $1 billion in Amazon stock every year to fund Blue Origin.The galactic exploration business is expensive, so Boeing’s unique ability to shell out cash further highlights its leadership position in the modern-day Space Race. But will the company beat Musk and Bezos to Mars? We will have to wait and see.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

It was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp (now CEO) with the idea of “creating the world’s best user experience for working with data, one that empowers people to ask and answer complex questions without requiring them to master querying languages, statistical modeling, or the command line.”While its name is derived from the palantÍr, a “seeing stone” in J.R.R. Tolkein’s fantasy series Lord of the Rings—even its motto is “Save the Shire,” in reference to the home of the hobbits of Middle Earth—Palantir actually emerged from mobile payments giant PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) anti-fraud efforts (its co-founder Thiel also co-founded PayPal).It’s also often considered to be one of the most secretive tech unicorns out there today. And by secretive, I mean a couple of things. For one, many people just haven’t heard of the company, especially outside of the tech and investing worlds; its Big Data focus is not nearly as flashy and exciting as ride-hailing or home-sharing. For another, Palantir and its technology is still best known for antiterrorism and spycraft, two avenues that must be secretive in order to thrive. It’s “Minority Report come true,” writes The Guardian.What They DoIf you have heard of Palantir, then you know that the company’s technology has been used in several notable cases, including the discovery of the infamous Chinese espionage networks, GhostNet and the Shadow Network. There’s also their rumored-but-never-confirmed efforts to help take down Osama Bin Laden.Even though its role in Bin Laden’s takedown will likely never be established as fact, what can be recognized, however, is Palantir’s extensive relationship with the U.S. government. Just as recently as six years ago, Palantir sold exclusively to the government sector.  The FBI, CIA, IRS, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and several branches of the armed forces have all been customers, and up to 50% of the company’s business is tied to the public sector. Even In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm, was an early investor.For instance, The Guardian goes on to note that the Pentagon “used Palantir software [in Iraq] to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage-door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it.”Palantir also has commercial customers that rely on them to detect fraud, study consumer behavior, and search for a competitive edge against rivals; these clients include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and Bridgewater Associates, a global investment management firm, among others. Overall, private customers make up about 75% of Palantir’s revenue, notes Fortune.Big Data PioneerAs a whole, Palantir prides itself on being one of the world’s Big Data solutions experts. It’s a term that refers to a collection of structured and multi-structured data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside a company, representing a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. Examples of structured data include tweets (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other social media posts, while multi-structured data is something that can be derived from interactions between people and machines.To help tackle Big Data, Palantir created two software suites for which it’s best known for. Formerly known as Palantir Finance, Palantir Metropolis is software for data integration, information management, and quantitative analytics. The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and public data sets and discovery trends, relationships and anomalies, including predictive analytics. And yes, this software suite is named after the home city of Superman.For users like hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms, Metropolis provides a number of integrated applications in order to build up interactive models using all the data that is available in their system. This includes Custom Metric, Dashboard, Date Set, Explorer, Regression, and Spreadsheet applications.The other is Palantir Gotham, formerly known as Palantir Government. This software integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and secure collaboration. Like Metropolis, Gotham is named after the home city of fellow superhero Batman.Gotham provides a suite of tools that are optimized for semantic, temporal, geospatial, and full-text analysis. Users can seamlessly drag and drop data objects from one application to the next, and applications include Graphs, Maps, Object Explorer, Browser, and Mobile.IPO BuzzWith a valuation at $20 billion, Palantir is one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed tech startups, but the company has yet to lay out any specific plans for an initial public offering. However, that hasn’t stopped IPO buzz from building, and investors have been excited for a while now about the potential for a Palantir market debut.The hype grew even more once President Trump took office, as co-founder Thiel is one of his closest tech advisors and CEO Karp joined with some of the industry’s biggest names—including executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), just to name a few—during the president’s transition period.Despite its impressive valuation and presidential connections, Palantir is still not profitable, though the company expects to reach profitability in 2017. Palantir doesn’t report current revenue, but according to Fortune, it brought in over $1 billion in 2014, and that commercial bookings in 2015 almost doubled year-over-year.But with buzz certainly comes controversy. In September 2016, Palantir was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian applicants by routinely eliminating them in the screening process; Palantir recently settled, and will need to pay nearly $1.7 million in ""back pay and other monetary relief.”For now, talks of a Palantir IPO remain a combination of speculation and anticipation. Last October, Karp told The Wall Street Journal that the company was “positioned so [it] could go public,” a positive sign that Palantir could hit the market in the near future. And with its Big Data-focused business—something that will only become more prevalent with the rise of artificial intelligence—unique user base, and fundamentally secretive operations, Palantir’s potential IPO could be one for the books.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Garry Tan was a co-founder of Palantir; he came on board as employee number 10. This version has been corrected.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

969,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) stated last Friday that it has found proof of data breach at its newly acquired company, TIO Networks. The breach might have led to theft of personally identifiable information of about 1.6 million TIO customers and customers of TIO billers.PayPal has been investigating the issue and suspended TIO operations on Nov 10 as part of this investigation. The company confirmed that the breach didn’t disturb its own platform since TIO systems operate separately.The investigation has revealed unauthorized access, which led PayPal to safeguard impacted customers. As part of this effort, TIO is working with its patron companies to alert potentially affected individuals.Also, PayPal is making arrangements for provision of free credit monitoring memberships in collaboration with a consumer credit reporting agency.  The company will directly contact affected individuals and give them instructions to sign up for monitoring.We observe that the company’s shares have appreciated a huge 90.8% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s gain of 30.2%.A Prudent MoveA data breach announcement and subsequent steps to take care of the affected customers makes sense as PayPal would not want to suffer because of a recently acquired entity.Moreover, PayPal’s efforts to make a bigger push in the North American bill pay market and tap un-banked and under-banked customers through the acquisition may get thwarted if it fails to handle the situation.PayPal Holdings, Inc. EPS Diluted (TTM) PayPal Holdings, Inc. EPS Diluted (TTM) | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuotePayPal has been working on the broader goal of partaking into daily financial activities of customers, through strengthening its product portfolio boosting global expansion efforts. We believe that the announced measures are part of PayPal’s efforts to make sure it attains its objective.Had the breach been exposed before the acquisition, we would have seen another Yahoo-Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) case. Verizon made Yahoo sign a revised deal, cutting its price by $350 million following the disclosure of two data breaches by the latter. In this case, since the TIO data breach was exposed post PayPal’s acquisition, it has no such oppourtunity. Rather, it will have to shoulder the responsibility of protecting affected customers.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderPayPal has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

970,PYPL,"Investors looking for growth stocks sometimes discount, or don’t even consider, well-established industry heavyweights. This tactic, however, can be a mistake.Just because the home run growth play is to get in on the ground floor of the next Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) or Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) doesn’t mean that this goal is very reasonable or likely. If investors take a small step back, they can often find growth in the form of companies with strong track records and massive market caps, which are also poised to get bigger.With that said, growth-minded investors might look no further than Visa (V  -  Free Report).Visa is coming off a strong fourth-quarter earnings report last week. The credit card giant’s Q4 profits popped 11% to $2.14 billion, while revenues jumped 14% to $4.86 billion. The company also saw its payment volume rise almost 10%.On top of that, Visa’s full-year revenues soared 22% to hit $18.36 billion. The company’s full-year profits also experienced year-over-year gains.Moving forward, Visa expects to keep growing, spurred in part by its 2016 acquisition of Visa Europe—which was previously a completely separate entity. What’s more, the credit card company is now the official credit card provider for Costco (COST  -  Free Report) and USAA, one of the bigger issuers of debit and credit cards in the U.S.Visa is also set to benefit from the fintech revolution through its recently renewed partnership with PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), along with wearable contactless payment technologies such as Fitbit’s (FIT  -  Free Report) new Ionic smartwatch—as well as experiments with outside the box payment-enabled sunglasses.With a little bit of background as to how the company has performed recently and how Visa has positioned itself going forward, let’s dive into what makes the credit powerhouse a potentially attractive growth stock right now.Fundamentals The company’s stellar run has helped its shares gain nearly 41% this year, which nearly doubles the “Financial Transaction Services” industry’s average and crushes the S&P 500’s 12.42% climb. Visa stock touched a new 52-week intraday trading high on Wednesday.This movement and new high shouldn’t scare off investors who might be worried that Visa will have a hard time bursting into a new range, as its growth prospects are still strong.Visa is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports a “B” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.According to our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Visa’s revenues are projected to gain 7.60% to hit $4.80 billion in the first quarter of its fiscal 2018. Along with sales growth, Visa’s earnings are expected to jump nearly 13%.For Visa’s upcoming full-year, company revenues are projected to climb over 9% to touch as high as $20.23 billion. In terms of earnings growth, Visa is set to see its 2018 EPS soar 16.35% to $4.05.Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Visa Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Visa Inc. QuoteInvestors should feel relatively confident that Visa will match or beat these new growth projections based on recent analyst upgrades and its strong track record.Within the last 60 days, Visa has received 12 upward earnings estimate revisions for its upcoming full-year, against no downward changes. What’s more, Visa has topped earnings estimates for over four years running.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

978,PYPL,"Time flies! We are already into the third-quarter 2017 reporting cycle and as always, investors are gearing up to make most of the earnings season.Talking of making the most, we believe that diversification is one of the most successful investment strategies. That said, we focus on four solid S&P 500 stocks from the four top-ranked Zacks sectors, which are likely to gain ground this earnings season. However, before getting into the stocks, let’s take a look at the picture painted so far and the expectations for the third quarter on the whole.A Glimpse of Yesterday & Signals for TomorrowPer the latest Earnings Trends, 26 S&P 500 companies have reported financial numbers. Notably, 84.6% of these companies have registered a beat on both top and bottom-line front. Further, total earnings of these firms advanced 22.5% year over year, buoyed by a 9.4% jump in revenues. Clearly, the performance so far is nearly at levels with the second quarter, though it displays a considerable improvement when compared with the 4 and 12-quarter averages.A glimpse at the overall expectations for the third quarter reveals that total earnings for the S&P 500 index is envisioned to rise 1.2%, with revenues likely to jump 5.1%. Also, major contributions of the earnings growth are expected to come from the Energy, Conglomerates and Technology sectors, out of which Energy and Conglomerates are anticipated to witness double-digit earnings growth.Diversification a Win-Win Strategy:  4 Gems From 4 Solid SpacesWhile the overall earnings growth in Q3 is expected to be lowest among all four quarters of 2017, the earnings season still offers good scope for investors, especially in some top-ranked Zacks sectors that are likely to witness year-over-year earnings and revenue growth. The sectors demanding attention are the Conglomerates, Consumer Staples, Technology and Industrial Products that are ranked among the top 13%, 19%, 25% and 31% out of all 16 classifications.Here is the winning strategy: Plucking an S&P 500 stock from each top-ranked sector that possesses a favorable combination of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with a positive Earnings ESP. Our research shows that the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70% for stocks holding such a combination. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are the GemsConglomerates (2 out of 16) Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q3 — 16.4%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 5.5%Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) is a global conglomerate that designs, manufactures and markets diverse lines of industrial and consumer products. With an Earnings ESP of +0.57%, the company is likely to beat earnings estimates when it posts third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19. Notably, this stock with a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.7% has surged 12.3% year to date, surpassing the sector’s 0.4% growth. Also, this Zacks Rank #2 company has a splendid positive earnings surprise history. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Consumer Staples (3 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q3 — 1.8%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 2.2%New York-based, Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is a viable bet from the Consumer Staples space. This Zacks Rank #2 company with a long-term growth rate of 8.6% hasn’t reported a single negative earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters. In fact, its favorable Earnings ESP of +0.55% makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat, when Colgate reports results on Oct 27. Notably, this global consumer goods behemoth has jumped 16.1% so far this year, beating the sector’s 12.3% rise.Technology (4 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q3 — 9.7%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 6.7%Online payment solutions provider, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) is a clear winner in the technology space. This big-wig topped earnings estimates in the past two quarters. Also, PayPal’s Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of +0.08% signal an earnings beat yet again, on Oct 19. PayPal’s long-term growth rate of 17.2% and marvelous stock performance are also worth noting. Evidently, shares of the company have soared 71.7% this year, crushing the sector’s solid growth of 23%.Industrial Products (5 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q3 — 9.0%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 2.8%Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), which manufactures tools and engineered security solutions across the globe, has rallied 38.3% year to date, cruising the sector’s 18.4% growth. With a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.09%, the company is likely to beat earnings estimates when it posts third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24. Notably, this New Britain-based company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%. The company’s robust earnings surprise record is the icing on the cake.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

979,PYPL,"Just one day after witnessing one of their toughest trading periods in months, several major tech stocks—including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)—rebounded slightly on Thursday morning.The rebound comes on the back of several positive notes related to the ecommerce and cloud computing dominance of Amazon.Analysts at D.A. Davidson reiterated their “buy” rating for the stock and raised their price target to $1,500 from $1,300, representing a nearly 30% upside to Wednesday’s close. The firm’s target is the highest out of the 41 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet and CNBC.“We are focusing on the company's physical store efforts as we believe its increased physical footprint… is THE story of its 2017 holiday sales and an indication of things to come in the future as Amazon increasingly leverages physical stores to increase its revenue growth and wallet share,” wrote D.A. Davidson’s Tom Forte.Meanwhile, JPMorgan reiterated its “overweight” rating for Amazon, and MKM Partners reaffirmed its “buy” rating and raised its price target to $1,350 from $1,275.“We continue to think Amazon is the best long-term growth story available to large-cap investors today,” wrote MKM analyst Rob Sanderson.Shares of Amazon gained more than 1.2% in morning trading hours Thursday, helping the stock recover nearly half of the value it lost during Wednesday’s tech selloff. Elsewhere, Apple shares gained about 0.5%, Facebook popped over 1%, and Alphabet gained about 0.25%.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was up nearly 0.6% on Thursday morning, leading the major indexes and signaling that the tech rally might still have some life left in it. Other notable tech stocks on the rebound today include PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Square (SQ  -  Free Report), and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report).Wednesday’s selloff is likely attributable to end-of-the-month fund rebalancing, which could have included a slight shift away from tech. A strong Q3 earnings season for several industry behemoths might have inspired some profit taking, while increased geopolitical tensions may have forced some funds to move money into more “tried-and-true” sectors.Indeed, investors have been keeping a close eye on North Korea this week, as Kim Jong-un’s regime conducted its first missile test in over two months on Tuesday. According to the Pentagon, the missile went higher than any previous North Korean tests, and Pyongyang officials later claimed that it now had the ability to reach the eastern seaboard of the United States.Nevertheless, Wall Street remains confident that political initiatives on the domestic front will come to fruition soon. The GOP’s long-awaited tax reform bill made it out of committee on Tuesday and could see a vote on the Senate floor this week, while the confirmation process for President Trump’s Fed chair nominee, Jerome Powell, is expected to go smoothly.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

980,PYPL,"Shares of several of the world’s largest technology companies—including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report)—were in the red on Wednesday morning, just one trading day after the stock market surged to new all-time highs.This week has been an interesting one for domestic and international politics, with the GOP’s tax bill and the Fed chair confirmation process dominating investor attention at home and renewed tensions with North Korea causing concerns abroad.On Tuesday, the Pentagon confirmed that North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile over the Sea of Japan. This was Pyongyang’s first missile test in two months, and according to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, the weapon went “higher, frankly, than any previous shot they have taken.”Nevertheless, investors shrugged off the news yesterday, opting instead to reward stocks for the progress made on the Republican tax reform bill and the positive reaction to Fed Chair nominee Jerome Powell’s testimony.The GOP’s highly-anticipated tax package, which includes significant reductions for large corporations like the aforementioned tech behemoths, was approved by the budget committee and could see a final vote on the Senate floor this week. Meanwhile, Powell is expected to witness a smooth path to confirmation.Tuesday’s news out of Washington was enough for stocks to surge to new all-time highs, but investors entered Wednesday with a bit more caution.Shares of Amazon dipped as much as 3.6% in morning trading Wednesday, while Alphabet dropped as low as 2.7%. Apple shares bottomed out about 2.4% below Tuesday’s close, and Facebook fell as much as 4.6%.Elsewhere in the tech world, PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), which had surged nearly 30% over the past three months, dropped over 6.7% in morning hours. Video streaming giant Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) fell nearly 5.1%, and red-hot payments company Square (SQ  -  Free Report) was briefly down as much as 9.4%.Wall Street darling Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) also dropped, with shares reaching an intraday low that was nearly 7% off of Tuesday’s close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down over 1% from its new highs.North Korea is certainly not entirely to blame for today’s tech selloff. As we approach the end of the month, large funds are beginning their rebalancing process, and it is not surprising to see a slight shift away from tech stocks after the sector’s recent run-up.Tech has dominated Wall Street for the majority of 2017, but after a relatively strong Q3 earnings season for our industry behemoths, it makes sense that investors would start taking profits now. And let us not forget, tech is still considered a volatile sector by many, so geopolitical tensions could underscore a desire to move to more tried-and-true areas.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

981,PYPL,"Earnings season kicked off last week with the first few technology companies averaging a 9.9% earnings growth rate on a revenues growth rate of 7.1%. The biggest releases were Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), eBAY (EBAY  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report). Here are the details:EarningsNetflix: The video streaming company had a very good revenue quarter, with the top line jumping over 30% from last year. Subscriber additions were impressive with domestic paid members growing 10.5% to 51.35 million. International growth was even stronger at up 43.2% to 52.68 million. But since content costs whether acquired or produced continue to increase, the earnings of 29 cents fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents.The recent price hike will help future results but note that the company has already also earmarked several billions for content. Moreover, it continues to burn cash. Read more: Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Miss, Subscriber Growth ImpressiveLam Research: Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research saw very strong growth in revenue and earnings, both of which also sailed past the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. That’s because the semiconductor market is particularly hot right now, as players scramble to produce more memory to capture the growing demand for data and related services.The company estimates that the semiconductor market will grow 15%+ this year following a 2% average growth rate in the last six years. At the same time, it says that WFE spending has remained rational, implying that there’s unlikely to be a correction any time soon. In this environment, Lam’s early lead in acquiring the capabilities to serve the NAND market will help it gain market share. Read more: Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) Tops Q1 Earnings & Revenue EstimateseBay: The online marketplace reported earnings that matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate (helped by share buybacks) on revenue that exceeded slightly (helped by positive FX). Active buyers increased by a couple of million, the marketplaces business also did well, but promotional pricing for new/small sellers and sluggish growth in StubHub impacted results. StubHub issues are likely to continue, as sporting events restricting tickets is making it harder for the business to generate profits.The guidance for the all-important holiday quarter was also short of exciting: revenue of $2.58 billion to $2.62 billion (or 9% growth at the midpoint) compared to $2.58 billion consensus and EPS of $0.57 to $0.59 (or 7% growth at the midpoint) compared to $0.60 consensus. Read more: eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Match Estimates, Revenues BeatPayPal: PayPal also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both revenue and profits and raised full-year guidance. Apart from registering strong growth in revenue and earnings, the company also reported an increase of 88% in its active customer base to 218 million, including more than 17 million merchant accounts. The total payment volume (TPV) jumped 30% with 35% of the payment volume coming from mobile devices. The P2P business (Venmo) saw a 106% increase in TPV. Read more: PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) Tops Q3 Earnings Estimates, Raises 2017 ViewIBM: The company reported strong third-quarter results with both revenue and earnings coming in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Strategic Imperatives (cloud, analytics, mobility and security) growth of 10% in constant currency was encouraging. Cloud and security in particular saw strong double-digit growth.

Hargreaves raised his fiscal 2018 earnings estimate from $11.07 to $11.68, well above the street consensus of $11.03 while upgrading the stock from Sector Weight to Overweight.The analyst said that Apple’s layered pricing strategy of $999 for the iPhone X, higher prices for the iPhone 8/8 Plus as well as its storage step-up pricing was effectively segmenting its customer base to generate more profit for the company. As a result, his iPhone ASP and gross margin targets are now up to $760 and 39.5%, respectively (the street consensus is at $725 and 38.6%). Prompted by an improved outlook for average selling prices, Lamba raised his price target from $150 to $160, which is close to Apple’s current price and retained his neutral rating on the shares.Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs Unleashed on Toronto: Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs is partnering with Waterfront Toronto, the public agency funded by federal, provincial and city governments, to build a highly digitized neighborhood in the Eastern Waterfront area of the Canadian capital. Quayside, as the area will be called, is currently an underdeveloped region, but the plan is to take it to the forefront of technological progress, teaming with automated transport of various kinds, including bikes, vans and cars for both personal and business uses, and even an automated trash collection system.Waymo and Lyft are expected to help in these efforts and other companies are likely to join the efforts as and when Sidewalk Labs partners with them. Google will be moving its Canadian headquarters and around 300 employees to the site once it is completed. But it expects to employ around 5,000 people in the region by then and support another 5,000 over the following 3-4 years.Amazon Wind Farm: Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has launched the 253 megawatt Amazon Wind Farm Texas, which operates more than 100 turbines – each over 300 feet tall with a rotor diameter more than twice the wingspan of a Boeing 787. Amazon Wind Farm Texas is built, owned and operated by Lincoln Clean Energy, a leading developer of wind and solar projects across the U.S. Amazon has launched 18 wind and solar projects across the U.S., with over 35 more to come. It is second only to Google in its clean energy consumption, having bought more than 1.22 gigawatts to date. Google has bought 1.85 gigawatts.Amazon Expands in Brazil: Amazon has been selling books in Brazil since 2012 but the company has now started selling electronics as well. Products can also be purchased with up to ten interest free monthly installments on the items sold with local sellers handling deliveries. The logistics business in Brazil is reportedly complicated, which makes it difficult for ecommerce companies to get into it.Amazon may eventually open a fulfillment center for sellers, although that is pure conjecture at this point. A Bloomberg report mentioned that Amazon’s easy returns policy might help it gain momentum, as that is a sore point for Brazilian customers and it’s apparently really hard to get your money back.NVIDIA Price Target Hiked: Analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on (NVDA  -  Free Report), while raising his price target to $220, representing around 12% upside from current levels. Some of the positives cited include the rising GPU pricing trend fueled by strength in the gaming and cryptocurrency markets, recent business deal wins in China and growing demand from the self-driving market.HP Estimates, Target Price Up: Amit Daryanani of RBC raised estimates to account for the company’s 2018 guidance. His new EPS estimate is $1.81 (previously $1.74) and revenue estimate $52.0 billion (previously $50.8 billion). The note said that HPQ's ""FY18 guide is inherently conservative and could enable sustained beats/raises over the next few quarters,"" and ""Commodity markets should remain challenging but likely peak in FQ4 (October); that headwind should be offset by cost-reduction initiatives.""Micron Retires Debt, Appoints EVP Global Operations: Micron will be using the proceeds of its recent equity offering to redeem $1.25 billion of its outstanding 7.5% notes due 2023 and $1 billion of its 5.25% notes due 2023. The company also appointed Manish Bhatia as EVP of Global Operations to report directly to Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO. He will be in charge of operations, including the company’s global manufacturing fab footprint, back-end assembly and test operations, supply chain planning and fulfillment, procurement, quality and IT teams to enhance Micron’s agility and responsiveness to meet customer requirements through a tighter coordination and alignment of these critical business functions.Legal/RegulatoryApple Fined $440 Million: After 7 years of winning and losing appeals, VirnetX, which sues on patents held but doesn’t manufacture anything of its own, has finally won another legal round against Apple. The judge and jury found Apple guilty of infringement and willful infringement at that, so they awarded the patent troll, as such companies are sometimes called, $440 million. This includes the jury verdict of $302.4 million awarded last year, additional willful infringement charges of $41.3 million or $1.80 in royalties per infringed device sold, and another $96 million by way of interests, costs and attorney fees. Apple said it would appeal the decision.Qualcomm Sues Apple Again:  An Accesswire report indicates that Qualcomm has filed another patent infringement case against Apple in Beijing. The three patents in question are related to power management and touch screen technology known as Force Touch, which Apple uses in its iPhones. Qualcomm says that since these patents are not a part of any standard, it is not bound to license them.Qualcomm is asking the court to ban the manufacture and sale of iPhones in China. Since this is an employment question, it is very unlikely that the lawsuit will be successful. The Chinese authorities haven’t made the filing public yet. Apple hasn’t denied infringement, but instead called the suit a courtroom maneuver, adding that these patents have never been discussed in the past and that Qualcomm’s effort would fail.New Products/TechnologyApple Watch Connectivity Issue in China: The new Apple Watch was the first one offering cellular connectivity by virtue of an eSIM (subscriber identity module) that Apple has embedded in it. The problem is that in China, the SIM is normally provided by state-owned telecom companies, which also register the person’s name. This therefore made it possible for the government to identify the person using it.Connectivity was first made available exclusively to customers on China Unicom, but was abruptly cut off without adequate explanations. All that China Unicom said on its website was that the cellular feature had been offered on a trial basis. It’s currently believed that since the technology is relatively new and lesser-known in China, regulatory authorities may have required its discontinuation.iPhone 8 Demand Issue: Taiwan’s Economic Daily reported that Apple told its suppliers of a 50% cut in iPhone 8 components for the final quarter of the year because of lower-than-expected demand. This is likely because of customers are waiting it out to buy the more expensive iPhone X, although there could be some customers defecting to other devices. If iPhone X increases in the sales mix, Apple will obviously make more profit, so this weakness could in fact be good news. Nevertheless, it sent shares down.Intel on Autonomous Vehicle Safety: Intel and Mobileye have created a set of standards that if adopted will ensure that self-driving cars aren’t responsible for accidents. At the World Knowledge Forum in Seoul, South Korea, Professor Amnon Shashua, Mobileye CEO and Intel senior vice president, offered his solution.The solution is based on the understanding that the most a vehicle can do to avoid an accident is to ensure that it isn’t the cause. The company seeks to show that computers can precisely calculate the time it takes for another vehicle or pedestrian approaching it to actually make contact with it, so it can take a course of action that will avoid the collision much better than a human.Cisco’s AI-Powered Predictive Services: The two new services are called Business Critical Services and High-value Services. Powered by AI, these services anticipate IT failures, mitigate risk, reduce maintenance costs, and assist organizations in attaining the necessary skills to transform their businesses. ""Business Critical Services,"" uses analytics, automation, compliance and security tools to enable a secure, efficient and agile technology environment, minimize human error and help extract the most value from products and solutions in a secure environment. High-value services offer software, hardware and network support for Cisco systems and processes.YouTube Comedy Video Series: Featuring comedians Trevor Noah, Judd Apatow and Howie Mandel, YouTube has launched its first virtual reality (VR) video series called “The Confessional”. Google offered a grant to Montreal-based production company Felix & Paul Studios as funding. In seven episodes of several minutes each, over the next few weeks, comedians and YouTube stars including Lilly Singh and Grace Helbig will confess about embarrassing and awkward moments in their lives such as first dates gone wrong.YouTube hasn’t said how much it intends to spend on VR content, but it should be a priority for its recently-launched $79 Daydream View headset, which uses the smartphone display close to stream VR content. Earlier this year, it pulled out $30K to launch a training program for video makers with at least 10,000 followers. It also introduced a new video format for semi-immersive videos that is intended to reduce the cost of creation.Google Chip for Consumer Devices: Last week, Google announced a system on chip (SoC) called Pixel Visual Core that will increase the speed and power efficiency of its camera. Google says it’s an image processing unit (IPU), although it is structurally closer to an 8-core processor like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon or Samsung Exynos. Although a part of its latest Pixel offerings, Google will activate the device some time soon, after which third-party developers will get access to it.Google hasn’t said that its relationship with Qualcomm will change as a result of the chip, but its growing prowess in chip design is no doubt a matter of concern for the leading mobile processor company. For Google, this is an important step to more closely integrate hardware and software in its devices the way that Apple does. If anything, these moves are indication of Google’s growing ambitions for mobile and IoT markets. New Twitter Rules for Abuse, Hate Speech: Twitter hasn’t formed any new rules, but the company has come out and said that it’s going to. Its primary goal is to remove unwanted sexual advances, nonconsensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorify violence from the platform and it will frame rules so bystanders can report incidents.Twitter ""will take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause."" The concession comes after Rose McGowan was prevented from posting additional tweets about alleged sexual abuse by Hollywood bigwigs. Twitter said that the 12-hour suspension was because she mentioned a private phone number. Women boycotted the site on her call. This kind of thing is turning out to be unsafe for users and therefore, harmful for business, so the company says it is taking necessary steps.Collaborations and M&AApple-GE Deal: Apple has inked a deal with GE to use its Predix data-collection and analysis tool to launch a toolkit targeted at the industrial sector. The toolkit will help developers build apps for iPhone and iPads that can facilitate collaboration in industrial environments thus increasing the efficiency of operations, lowering unplanned downtime, facilitating better resource allocation and leading to overall time and cost savings.Apple’s role will thus be to develop and promote Predix as the industrial IoT platform of choice, for which GE will standardize on iPhone and iPad and promote Apple's Mac computers as a choice for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees. Apple’s approach has been to build custom solutions for large enterprises and verticals, with each win being a stepping stone, helping it expand deeper into the enterprise segment.Intel-Facebook on AI Chip: Intel announced its Nervana Neural Network Processors at the WSJ D.Live conference last week. The chip has been built specifically for neural networks and is, according to Intel a first of its kind. Intel intends to expand the product line to an entire family over time.Former Nervana CEO Naveen Rao who joined Intel after his company was acquired by the chip giant, said that Intel would ultimately sell the chips in two ways: it will either sell a data center appliance containing several of the new Nervana Neural Network Processors as well as Intel’s CPUs to customers wanting to run deep learning projects within their own data centers. Or, it will rent access to the chips through Intel’s cloud data centers the way NVIDIA does. Facebook, which along with others helped the chip get off to launch, will be among the first to test the chip on its platform.   Facebook Buys tbh: Facebook has bought tbh, or “to be honest,” the anonymous messaging app from parent company Midnight Labs. The app allows you to run polls regarding people’s positive attributes, after which there is an option to connect with the people that chose you. They can, however, choose to remain anonymous even after they are part of your network. The app has been very popular with teens this summer rising to the top of Apple’s app store rankings despite launching only in August. Apple’s app store describes the app as one that has been downloaded 5 million times with 2.5 million daily active users.Facebook’s Deal with Delivery Services: Facebook now has deals with food delivery services like GrubHub, EatStreet, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow and Olo and direct deals with some restaurants that will allow U.S. users to order food from within the app. Facebook says food delivery is a tricky business and promises to remove some of the hurdles in its operation.The goal is, of course, that users never leave its platform by giving them all they might need right on it. The longer they stay, the greater the opportunities to serve them ads and keep them from rival services like Google. In the delivery business too, operations like UberEats and Amazon delivery are likely to see increased competition because of Facebook.Cisco Buying Perspica: Cisco is building on its $3.7 billion acquisition of AppDynamics, which offers tools to better understand how applications are operating to identify which applications or hardware are not providing optimal performance. Now, Perspica, a machine learning startup that has raised around $8.85 million, will expand and strengthen these capabilities so customers can better analyze large amounts of application-related data, in real time and with business context, and irrespective of when an application is deployed in a company's public, private or multiple cloud environments.  Google-Target Deal Expansion: Just as Walmart did a short while back, Target is cozying up with Google to help it battle Amazon in ecommerce. After testing the Google Express delivery service in New York City, the company has announced that it will be expanding it to the rest of the country barring Hawaii and Alaska. So customers can use the Google Express website or app to get their Target stuff delivered.What’s more, Target is quickly bringing more services to Google Express, including its Redcard credit and debit cards that enable free shipping and a 5% discount (this one should be available next year). Although voice ordering hasn’t gained momentum and most people aren’t comfortable using it yet, the deal also lets Target customers voice-order through Google Home.For Google, this is valuable data that gives it insight into customer buying habits and so, can help it better target ads. It also provides it a foothold in the product search space that Amazon has grown quickly to dominate.Some NumbersNintendo Switch: Top-Selling Console in September: Nintendo has come out to say that according to NPD sales data, the company’s Switch game console was the leading one in September, making it the best-selling device in the U.S. for three straight months and five of the last seven months. When combined with the 3DS family of systems and the Super NES Classic Edition system, Nintendo systems claimed two-thirds of the month’s total video game hardware sales.With the first holiday season in progress, the company will no doubt see a very strong year. Nintendo’s return to prominence is commendable despite the fact that both Sony’s PS4 and Microsoft’s XB1 have been around for a few years.Some Companies Reporting This Week: TXN, TER, NLSN, KLAC, EXPE, GOOGL, FTV, AMZN, FFIV, CA, XLNX, NXPI, IRM, TWTR, VRSN, NTGR, GRUB, STX, AMD, AKAM, GLW, JNPR, MSFT, CDNS, INTC, WDCZacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

So, we can now easily evaluate how successful the spin-off decision was and throw light on their recent earnings performances (read: Spin-Off ETF: Can the Outperformance Continue?).PayPal is now valued at $84.39 billion, more than 80% higher than what it was on its first trading day. On the other hand, its erstwhile parent company eBay’s market cap has grown to $38.38 billion from $34.63 billion in July 2015 (read: ETFs to Ride on PayPal Growth Story).A Peek into the Latest Earnings Picture: PYPL Wins, eBAy LoseseBay Inc. reported decent third-quarter 2017 results (after the closing bell on Oct 18) with earnings matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same by a slight margin.

985,PYPL,"As investors continue to digest the latest quarterly report from Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), the floodgates have opened on the Q3 earnings season, and several more of our favorite consumer tech brands will release their new financial results soon.One of this week’s other marquee tech earnings reports will be that of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report). Founded by a team of entrepreneurs that included Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, PayPal is a digital payments company that has revolutionized online transactions. And since spinning off from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) in mid-2015, PayPal has been on fire.A rise in demand for mobile payment solutions has led to PayPal shares gaining nearly 74% in 2017 alone. This momentum has helped PayPal become one of the tech sector’s hottest stocks of the year, which means all eyes will be on the company when it releases its latest quarterly report on Thursday.Heading into its report date, PayPal rests just $2 per share below its all-time high. That fact adds even more pressure for the stock, as investors will want to see big results before sending shares any higher. So should you buy PYPL ahead of earnings? Let’s take a closer look!Earnings & Revenue OutlookAccording to our latest consensus estimates, PayPal is projected to post earnings of 44 cents per share and revenues of $3.17 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 25% and 19%, respectively.Investors will also be interested to see whether or not PayPal can exceed these earnings expectations. It’s worth noting that PayPal has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each quarter since its spin-off, but we should also take a look at the stock’s Earnings ESP.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about an earnings beat. PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but with an Earnings ESP of -0.14%, our predictive power is limited. Still, the company has a solid track record for surprises and has beaten consensus estimates by an average of 4.21% over the past four quarters.Key Segment DetailsIf PayPal wants to blow investors away, it will need to post impressive results in several of its key segments. Luckily, we can use the Zacks exclusive non-financial metrics file to get a feel for how the company might do. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here>>>According to our latest consensus estimates, PayPal is slated to report that it reached 216 million active customer accounts in the quarter. This would mark a 12.5% year-over-year improvement and a 2.9% gain from the previous quarter. It’s also important to note that PayPal recorded 11.7% year-over-year growth in this category in Q2, so if our estimates hold up, it would mean that the company’s customer growth has picked up.Furthermore, our consensus estimates indicate that total payment volume reached $109.03 billion in the quarter. This would represent year-over-year growth of 24.7%, which outpaces the 23.5% growth witnessed during Q2.Investors will also want to keep an eye on any information related to Venmo, the PayPal-owned peer-to-peer payment system that is a hit with millennials. While Venmo is likely not a major money-maker for the company yet, it has exploded in popularity over the past few years and should help solidify PayPal as the mobile transactions company of today.Bottom LineWith a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a red-hot stock, PayPal is looking strong headed into its report date. The company is witnessing strong growth in several of its key segments, and that growth is translating into overall expansion on the top and bottom lines.Nevertheless, shares are near an all-time high, which means the report will have to be exceptional if the stock wants to break into a new range.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

986,PYPL,"Tech has come a long way from the dot-com fiasco to a preferred trade by Wall Street pundits. Computer and software makers are having a ball as the White House’s initiative to trim tax rates are providing the much needed windfall to companies that have mostly hoarded money outside the United States. Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, while the lawmakers, regrettably, have been divided on the same so far this year.Substantial growth in cloud computing and the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launches of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech will keep rolling, at least for now. Lest we forget, the “FAANGtastic five” – Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) have gained in double digits this year. Amazon, in particular, topped the $1000-a-share level, highlighting the stellar show put up by tech stocks this year.Let us, thus, keep an eye on tech stocks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season that has unofficially kicked off this week.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions Under Trump Tax Plan Investors continue to pour money into Internet and tech companies, and the most basic thing that is driving them at this point is taxes. Trump has promised to deliver historic relief to corporate America by lowering tax rates. The corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. This helps tech multinationals to bring funds held overseas back to the United States at a decreased tax rate. Bringing back the tech companies massive overseas cash pile would let it do a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle ORCL hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.The tax plan, in the meanwhile, aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%. The current top rate is 39.6%. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force in the continued strength of big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest in such bellwethers. Q3 Should be Good for TechThe third-quarter earnings season, historically, is one of the best seasons for tech stocks.As per hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, 30 days after the start of the third-quarter earnings season, the information technology sector gained an average 4.6% in the last 19 years. Meanwhile, other major sectors including industrials, materials and financials have gained 2.8%, 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively. In fact, the S&P 500 index gained a meagre 2.3% during the said period.Tech stocks had an impressive 2017 so far, while earnings for tech companies in the third quarter are expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues (read more: Handicapping the Q3 Earnings Season).Tech Earnings Preview: Cloud Business is a Game Changer International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) will lead the tech earnings parade on Oct 17. Can the company break it’s more than five-year long streak of quarterly revenue decline? It’s cloud revenues had increased 15% in the second quarter, but, that too was nowhere close to the triple-digit growth Microsoft witnessed in the same quarter and 40% growth Amazon reported over the last couple of years. This time around the tech major could, however, see a boost in hardware sales on the back of the security-fortified z14 mainframes introduced in July.Things are looking up for SAP SE SAP, which will report before the market opens on Oct 19. It saw 33% growth in cloud revenues and a whopping 70% growth in its S/4 Hana business suite in the second quarter. With little competition in its core market, the software and service provider is expected to see strong results in the third quarter in the aforesaid segments.Meanwhile, all await the releases from Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft on Oct 26. Alphabet’s dominance in the search marketing business seems to be getting stronger with each quarter, while Amazon continues to lead the cloud space. Investors, however, will be keen to see how Diane Greene-led Alphabet does in the cloud business. In the second quarter, Alphabet reported 33% growth to $2.2 billion in the category “other revenues” that includes cloud.Microsoft, in the meantime, has almost doubled in the three-and-a-half years since Nadella took over as CEO. The big question is whether the company can maintain growth in its cloud business. So, all eyes are on its Azure product. After all, if we combine Azure and other software-as-a-service products, Microsoft will gain an edge over Amazon in the cloud business.5 Solid ChoicesTechnology companies, nevertheless, are likely to see solid growth in Q3 on the back of favorable government policy. This calls for investing in five tech stocks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q3 earnings. These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP.

Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of October 16.1.       Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report)Video streaming behemoth Netflix will report its third-quarter results after the market closes on October 16. The company is coming off a rare earnings miss in Q2, but shares are up more than 58% year-to-date, and the earnings and revenue growth picture is still exciting. NFLX is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect Netflix to report earnings of 32 cents per share and revenues of $2.97 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 165% and 30%, respectively. Management has also projected 0.75 million domestic subscriber adds and 3.65 million international adds in the quarter. Investors should keep a close eye on the company’s international margins as it looks to operate more efficiently overseas. 2.       IBM (IBM  -  Free Report)IT services giant IBM is slated to release its third-quarter earnings report after the closing bell on October 17. IBM’s transition away from a hardware focus has led to disappointing revenue results over the past few years, but growth in cloud, mobile, and security products could fuel a turnaround. Still, shares are down more than 11% on the year, and the stock is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).According to our latest consensus estimates, IBM is projected to post earnings of $3.28 per share and revenues of $18.67 billion, which would represent year-over-year slumps of 0.3% and 3%, respectively. Management has warned that seasonality concerns will hurt revenues, but the company’s Mainframe z14 product and services contracts should pitch in more. 3.       United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report)Plagued by public relations nightmares and damage from natural disasters, United is heading into its report date like a wounded bird. The company will announce its full third-quarter results after the market closes on October 18, but this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) has already warned that Q3 was noticeably rough.Our current consensus estimates are calling for earnings of $1.87 per share and revenues of $9.84 billion. These figures would represent year-over-year drops of 40% and 0.75%, respectively. Houston is United’s second-largest hub, and Hurricane Harvey caused the company significant headwinds. Investors will want to hear how management plans on recovering from this short-term problem and preparing for a strong future. 4.       PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report)Digital payments pioneer PayPal will report its third-quarter earnings results after the bell on October 19. Rising demand for mobile payments solutions has helped PayPal soar more than 67% this year, and now the company will hope to continue this strong momentum with another great report.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect to see the company report earnings of 44 cents per share and revenues of $3.17 billion this quarter, which would represent year-over-year growth of 25% and 19%, respectively.

989,PYPL,"Spin-off activities have stepped up lately, with biggies like Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) being the most active ones. Lately, the industrial giant Honeywell announced plans of spinning off its homes and global distribution units and its transportation systems unit into two publicly traded companies by 2018 end (read: 5 ETFs to Buy on 13-Year High Manufacturing Activity).On the other hand, Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives to possibly bid good-bye to its Consumer Healthcare segment. A sale or spin-off of its consumer-health unit is expected next year. Pfizer's consumer sales have been essentially “flat for the past three years.”This clearly explains why Pfizer intends to concentrate on the more promising, innovative pharmaceutical unit and separate it from Consumer Healthcare. The move also signifies the likely introduction of more deal-making, as per Wall Street Journal. However, the company also kept open chances of retaining the business.Inside Spin-offsSometimes businesses form another autonomous entity from an existing business/division, when they believe that the separated line would add more value as an independent company. In such situations, the parent can focus on its core business management while the new entity can focus on its relative different goals.How Profitable Spin-offs are to Investors?According to Cantor Fitzgerald, “spinoffs completed between 2009 and 2013 outperformed the S&P 500 in their first year of trading by an average of more than 17 percent.” As per an article published on benzinga, spun-off entities have been performing better than parent companies lately.PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) (up about 114%) generated higher gains than parent eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) (up about 56%) in the last two years (post spin-off). WhiteWave Foods Co  gained about 67.8% in the last three years against an 11.2% decline in Dean Foods Co (DF  -  Free Report). WhiteWave Foods was spun off in May 2013. Abbot Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) cut ties with part of its business and formed a new company called AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Jan 2013. ABBV was up 85% while ABT gained 41% in the last three years (as of Oct 12, 2017).What’s Behind the Recent Surge in Spin-OffA Chicago-based partner at The Boston Consulting Group recently commented that in a bull market, which we are witnessing currently, equities are overvalued. This makes materialization of mergers and acquisitions difficult. Instead, high valuations better justify “spinning off assets or divesting assets."" If this logic holds good, we are likely to see more such actions in the coming days (read: 4 Bargain ETFs in a Pricey Market).Notably, the United States saw 88 completed spinoffs in 1999, which fell to 80 in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. The number further declined to 55 in 2001. The number of actions again rose from 24 in 2007 to 30 in 2008, before sliding to 17 in 2009 when the financial crisis kicked in, as per the data provided by Dealogic, quoted on CNBC. The momentum again gained momentum in 2015 by value, though 2016 and 2017 have been subdued.ETFs to Play There are always ways to play such corporate actions. Below we highlight two spin-off ETFs in detail. These ETFs can get further boost from Honeywell and Pfizer’s announcements.Guggenheim S&P Spin-Off ETF (CSD  -  Free Report)The 61-stock fund looks to track the S&P U.S. Spin-Off Index. Paypal Holdings (7.98%), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (7.85%) and Synchrony Financial (7.39%) are the top three holdings of the fund. CSD charges 65 bps in fees (read: PayPal's Strong Q2 Results Put These ETFs in Focus).VanEck Vectors Global Spin-Off ETF (SPUN  -  Free Report) The 95-stock fund follows the Horizon Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index, which is a rules-based, equal-weighted index intended to track the performance of listed, publicly held spin-offs that are domiciled and trade in the U.S. or developed markets of Western Europe and Asia. The net expense ratio of the fund is 0.55%. United States accounts for about 78.8% of the fund. Gannett Co (1.2%), Time Inc. (1.1%) and Timkensteel (1.1%) are top three stocks of the fund.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

991,PYPL,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) surged over 2.50% to reach a new all-time high on Thursday, and now many investors might be wondering if they should get in on the digital payment company, despite it breaking through a brand new threshold.People use cash less and less these days, especially in the developed world where mobile, online, and contactless payment options have become normal.Fintech and mobile payments platforms are tangible, usable, and practical for the average person. This makes companies that operate in this sector potentially very valuable, both today and in the future.PayPal is one of the original online and digital payment companies, and since spinning off from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) a few years ago, the firm has gone on quite the run and now boasts over 210 million active accounts.The companysaw its stock price pop to hit $65.63 per share on Thursday, a new all-time intraday trading high. Let’s take a look at some of what the company has done recently, as well as some key fundamental metrics, to see if investors might want to invest in the digital payment firm.Recent Moves PayPal owns mobile peer-to-peer payment giant Venmo, which is widely popular with millennials and has experienced massive year-over-year growth, and the company now partners with credit card giants Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report)—where previously they were at odds.In August, Mastercard introduced a new PayPal Cashback credit card. On Thursday, PayPal and Mastercard announced that they expanded their partnership to include more services on a larger global scale in Canada, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Africa.“Together we expect to accelerate digital payment adoption across the world, improve the payment experience online, in-app and in store, and empower millions of consumers to seamlessly manage and move their money,” PayPal Chief Commercial Officer Gary Marino said in a statement.These new relationships have helped PayPal grow more quickly. On top of that, PayPal has struck deals with over 20 new partners,including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), all within the last year and a half.Fundamentals PayPal’s second quarter saw the company’s revenues pop 18% to hit $3.14 billion, while the company’s earnings jumped 27%. PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an overall VGM grade of “C.”PayPal might not be the most attractive investment for value-minded investors, as it is currently trading at almost 35x earnings. This, however, does mark a massive discount to the industry, which is trading at 62x earnings—its younger competitor, Square (SQ  -  Free Report), has a P/E ratio of 160.39.The company’s P/B ratio of 5.15 is not great either, but again, it is comparable to the “Internet – Software” industry average.The digital payment solution firm’s 13.91% cash flow growth helps demonstrates that the company is healthy compared to many of its peers that have more cash going out than coming in.PayPal’s revenues are projected to gain 18.99% this quarter and gain 18.62% on the year to hit as high as $12.94 billion, based on our current consensus estimates. The “Internet – Software” industry is set to experience 9.73% year-over-year sales growth. PayPal’s quarterly earnings are expected to pop 24.60% this quarter and 22.45% for the year.These substantial gains are projected even though, within the last 60 days, PayPal has received eight downward earnings estimate revisions against only one positive change. However, since spinning off in 2015, PayPal has beat quarterly expectations every time.Bottom LineIn a mobile-centered and digital world, fintech and online payment companies will be positioned to cash in on the future of transactions. PayPal is a pioneer in the industry and might just be a company investors consider now—and down the road.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

992,PYPL,"Western Union Co. (WU  -  Free Report), one of the leaders in the money remittance market, is investing heavily in digital money transfer, and leveraging its cross-border platform to serve new customers.The company has traditionally derived a huge chunk of business from physical money transfer. However, recent massive investments made to grow its digital platform have strengthened its leadership position in digital money transfer. Its electronic platform, westernunion.com, clocked money transfer revenues of more than $340 million in 2016 and is on track to deliver strong growth again this year.Over the next few years, Western Union plans to expand its westernunion.com transaction sites well beyond the 40 countries it is presently available in. Its emphasis on mobile, as well as increased penetration in existing markets through enhanced services and customer relationship management, account payout offerings and digital partnerships are also part of digital expansion.One of the major feats achieved by the company this year was its successful navigation of secondary recommendations in the south west border compliance program.Staying clear of anti-money laundering activities is crucial for money remittance companies and Western Union has made relentless efforts in this regard.Western Union, which has a wide agent network and dominance in the money transfer industry, has grown over the past many years via several alliances with banks, post offices, retailers, telecom operators and other carriers worldwide.Western Union’s international business is a feather in its crown, where it faces lesser competition.Recently, competition has intensified from the ongoing consolidation in the industry.

994,PYPL,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, stock futures are once again up, even as domestic news cycles deliver drama and tension regarding the recent words and actions of President Trump. An impromptu press conference yesterday saw the President double-down on his initial comments on the weekend tragedy in Charlottesville, which were heavily criticized by people on both the Left and the Right. Nevertheless, the Dow is enjoying a 3-day winning streak, although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 4 of the last 6 sessions.Trump’s Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn said he was “disgusted and upset” by the President’s latest address. Even still, he is quoted as expecting tax reform to be on track for passage before Thanksgiving. As far as healthcare reform, Cohn said he’s “not sure where that will wind up.”More leaders from Trump’s manufacturing council are leaving in response to this continuing public relations development. Further, PayPal ((PYPL  -  Free Report)) has announced it will no longer process payments to fun “alt-right” groups, and privately-held GoDaddy has already booted alt-right website Daily Stormer from its server. However, work-arounds are already occurring among groups protesting the removal of Confederate statues, among others things (nine more such protests are reportedly scheduled for the upcoming weekend). These groups are finding the Bitcoin trade useful in this regard.Housing Starts & PermitsHousing Starts posted a disappointing headline number of -4.8% for the month of July; +0.4% had been expected. A total of 1.155 million seasonally adjusted, annualized new starts is below the 1.23 million expected, and June results were revised slightly downward as well. Consider that we’re still in the zone of warmer seasonal months, and a big negative result in new starts does demonstrate a real cooling of the new home market, near-term.Permits fell 4.1% to 1.223 million, also a disappointment; June results were revised down to 1.227 million, and these numbers represent the weakest permits data since May. These figures overall represent the topsy-turvy world of spending and consumer confidence — for every better-than-expected Retail Sales number, like yesterday, we see a headwind with the next domestic growth metric, like Starts & Permits.Target, Urban Outfitters OutperformBig-box retailer Target ((TGT  -  Free Report) posted a 3-cent beat on the bottom line ahead of the opening bell this morning to $1.23 per share. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks consensus of $16.82 billion in the quarter, reporting $16.42 billion. Nevertheless, this represents 1.6% growth in sales year over year, on 1.3% comps. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated company was trading as high as +6% in today’s pre-market, but shares are now roughly +3.3%.Urban Outfitters ((URBN  -  Free Report)), however, is trading way up — more than 21% at this hour — following a fiscal Q2 2018 beat on both top and bottom lines. The company’s 44 cents per share outperformed the 37 cents expected, and revenues of $873 million topped the Zacks consensus estimate of $834 million. Same-store sales were also up in the quarter, and URBN shares — which had been down nearly 41% year-to-date — look to be making a nice bounce off multi-year bottoms.

995,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) is acquiring online small business lending firm Swift Financial for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed later this year.Founded in 2006, Delaware-based Swift Financial provides loans, cash advances and lines of credit to small businesses in the U.S. The company claims that it has funded more than 20,000 businesses since inception. Both the companies have already been in a commercial partnership, so integration risk is likely to be low.PayPal Looks to Boost its Lending BusinessPayPal has been working on providing a wide gamut of financial services to lure small businesses to its platform and lock existing ones. This is part of its intensified focus on the growing number of active customer accounts since it was spun off from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report).We believe that by acquiring Swift Financial, PayPal will be able to make its financing solutions more accessible and affordable to small businesses, leveraging on the additional underwriting data and capabilities that Swift offers.This in turn will help the company grow its PayPal Working Capital unit that has been offering short-term loans to smaller merchants since 2013. The unit provided more than $3 billion worth of funds to 115,000 small businesses at up to $125,000 each. PayPal stated that the acquisition will enable it to increase term loans to $500,000 for its larger merchants and also offer sufficient credit to those business who are yet not using its services.In addition, PayPal will be in a position to give tough competition to companies like Square (SQ  -  Free Report), Kabbage and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the small business lending space. Square has already passed 1 billion in loans through its Square Capital program. Amazon claims that it has loaned $3 billion to small and medium-sized businesses.Our TakeWe expect the acquisition to significantly boost PayPal’s other value added services revenues that include interest and fees earned on PayPal Credit loans, gateway fees, subscription fees and gain on sale of participation interest in consumer loans receivable and more.Moreover, since PayPal earns from transactions between merchants and customers, the company, through this acquisition, could boost its transaction revenues by enabling merchants to grow their businesses and enhance sales.In the recently reported quarter, transaction revenues of $2.75 billion contributed 88% to total revenue and were up 6% sequentially and 18% on a year-over-year basis. Other value added services revenues contributed the rest and increased 3% sequentially and 18% year over year. The company added 6.5 million new customers in the first quarter, taking the total active customer accounts to 210 million.It also increased its full year guidance.  The company now expects revenues between $12.78 billion and $12.88 billion compared with its earlier expectations of $12.52–$12.72 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 12.70 billion.

996,PYPL,"On Thursday, online payments company PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) said it has agreed to acquire lending firm Swift Financial in a deal that will hopefully expand its business that provides working capital to merchants. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and is subject to regulatory approval.Founded in 2006, Swift Financial offers credit to businesses through methods like loans and advances. With Swift, PayPal will be able to grant loans to firms that process payments through its platform, in addition to providing credit to firms that are not yet users of PayPal’s services. Additionally, PayPal can also offer term loans of up to $500,000 to its larger merchants, as well as utilize Swift’s data and capabilities.With this deal, PayPal believes it will be able to “better serve small businesses by enhancing our underwriting capabilities to provide access to affordable business financing solutions to more businesses to help them grow and thrive,” said Darrell Esch, vice president and commercial officer of global credit at PayPal, in an interview.Dabbling in credit offerings is not new to PayPal. The company has offered a working capital program, called PayPal Working Capital, through which it lends money to small businesses since 2013. PayPal has lent over $3 billion to 115,000 small businesses in loans of up to $125,000.PayPal is not the only tech company entering the lending space either. Through its Square Capital program, fellow digital payments company Square (SQ  -  Free Report) has already passed $1 billion in loans since the program’s launch in 2014. Even Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is encouraging spending, and with its Amazon Lending division, founded back in 2011, the e-commerce giant said that it has loaned SMEs $3 billion.“Increasing access to capital is vital to the success of small businesses and is a strategic offering for PayPal, which drives merchants’ sales growth, increases processing volume, and reduces merchant churn,” added Esch.Shares of PYPL are currently down about 1.9% in mid-morning trading.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

999,PYPL,"Palantir Technologies is a privately-held software and services company that has taken Silicon Valley by storm since its launch back in 2004. It was founded by Peter Thiel, Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale, Stephen Cohen, and Alex Karp (now CEO) with the idea of “creating the world’s best user experience for working with data, one that empowers people to ask and answer complex questions without requiring them to master querying languages, statistical modeling, or the command line.”While its name is derived from the palantÍr, a “seeing stone” in J.R.R. Tolkein’s fantasy series Lord of the Rings—even its motto is “Save the Shire,” in reference to the home of the hobbits of Middle Earth—Palantir actually emerged from mobile payments giant PayPal’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) anti-fraud efforts (its co-founder Thiel also co-founded PayPal).It’s also often considered to be one of the most secretive tech unicorns out there today. And by secretive, I mean a couple of things. For one, many people just haven’t heard of the company, especially outside of the tech and investing worlds; its Big Data focus is not nearly as flashy and exciting as ride-hailing or home-sharing. For another, Palantir and its technology is still best known for antiterrorism and spycraft, two avenues that must be secretive in order to thrive. It’s “Minority Report come true,” writes The Guardian.What They DoIf you have heard of Palantir, then you know that the company’s technology has been used in several notable cases, including the discovery of the infamous Chinese espionage networks, GhostNet and the Shadow Network. There’s also their rumored-but-never-confirmed efforts to help take down Osama Bin Laden.Even though its role in Bin Laden’s takedown will likely never be established as fact, what can be recognized, however, is Palantir’s extensive relationship with the U.S. government. Just as recently as six years ago, Palantir sold exclusively to the government sector.  The FBI, CIA, IRS, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and several branches of the armed forces have all been customers, and up to 50% of the company’s business is tied to the public sector. Even In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture arm, was an early investor.For instance, The Guardian goes on to note that the Pentagon “used Palantir software [in Iraq] to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage-door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it.”Palantir also has commercial customers that rely on them to detect fraud, study consumer behavior, and search for a competitive edge against rivals; these clients include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and Bridgewater Associates, a global investment management firm, among others. Overall, private customers make up about 75% of Palantir’s revenue, notes Fortune.Big Data PioneerAs a whole, Palantir prides itself on being one of the world’s Big Data solutions experts. It’s a term that refers to a collection of structured and multi-structured data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside a company, representing a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. Examples of structured data include tweets (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other social media posts, while multi-structured data is something that can be derived from interactions between people and machines.To help tackle Big Data, Palantir created two software suites for which it’s best known for. Formerly known as Palantir Finance, Palantir Metropolis is software for data integration, information management, and quantitative analytics. The software connects to commercial, proprietary, and public data sets and discovery trends, relationships and anomalies, including predictive analytics. And yes, this software suite is named after the home city of Superman.For users like hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms, Metropolis provides a number of integrated applications in order to build up interactive models using all the data that is available in their system. This includes Custom Metric, Dashboard, Date Set, Explorer, Regression, and Spreadsheet applications.The other is Palantir Gotham, formerly known as Palantir Government. This software integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and secure collaboration. Like Metropolis, Gotham is named after the home city of fellow superhero Batman.Gotham provides a suite of tools that are optimized for semantic, temporal, geospatial, and full-text analysis.

However, that hasn’t stopped IPO buzz from building, and investors have been excited for a while now about the potential for a Palantir market debut.The hype grew even more once President Trump took office, as co-founder Thiel is one of his closest tech advisors and CEO Karp joined with some of the industry’s biggest names—including executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), just to name a few—during the president’s transition period.Despite its impressive valuation and presidential connections, Palantir is still not profitable, though the company expects to reach profitability in 2017. Palantir doesn’t report current revenue, but according to Fortune, it brought in over $1 billion in 2014, and that commercial bookings in 2015 almost doubled year-over-year.But with buzz certainly comes controversy. In September 2016, Palantir was sued by the U.S. Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian applicants by routinely eliminating them in the screening process; Palantir recently settled, and will need to pay nearly $1.7 million in ""back pay and other monetary relief.”For now, talks of a Palantir IPO remain a combination of speculation and anticipation. Last October, Karp told The Wall Street Journal that the company was “positioned so [it] could go public,” a positive sign that Palantir could hit the market in the near future. And with its Big Data-focused business—something that will only become more prevalent with the rise of artificial intelligence—unique user base, and fundamentally secretive operations, Palantir’s potential IPO could be one for the books.An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Garry Tan was a co-founder of Palantir; he came on board as employee number 10. This version has been corrected.<!--{cke_protected}{C}%3C!%2D%2Dtd%20%7Bborder%3A%201px%20solid%20%23ccc%3B%7Dbr%20%7Bmso-data-placement%3Asame-cell%3B%7D%2D%2D%3E-->Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1000,PYPL,"Shares of Square, Inc. (SQ  -  Free Report) climbed on Thursday after the mobile payment company announced its plan to open a bank. But can Square and other fintech startups really shake up the banking industry?  Jack Dorsey’s San Francisco-based mobile payment company is scheduled to submit an application to form a bank in Utah. The bank will be called Square Financial Services Inc. and is set to offer loans and deposit accounts to small businesses.It seems clear that Dorsey, who is also Twitter’s (TWTR) CEO, has his sights set extremely high for the fintech company. Square stock jumped nearly 2% on Thursday to hover around $26.50 a share.Mobile Payment Revolution Square became popular for point of sale services geared towards small business. The company then invested in food ordering companies and began to offer small business loans through Square Capital, which allows merchants the opportunity to pay loans back gradually through automatic payments via a portion of their point of sale transactions.Proud we’ve lent out over $1.8 billion to over 140,000 small businesses throughout the US. Average loan size: $6,000 https://t.co/zCkG6bwwAM— jack (@jack) September 7, 2017But now it seems that Dorsey and Square are ready to venture into new, old school brick-and-mortar banking waters. Square’s banking move follows two other online tech-based financial startups.Social Finance, Inc., which specializes in student loan refinancing and personal loans, applied for a bank charter in June. Mobile-banking startup Varo Money Inc. then applied for a banking charter in August. All three companies applied for these charters in Utah.Salt Lake City has become the unofficial hub of industrial banks—institutions that make business loans and act like traditional banks in other manners, while still being a part of a company that also conducts other business operations.Fintech and mobile payment companies are geared heavily towards Millennials, who do basically everything on their phones. However, this mobile generation still has to use traditional banks in order to have checking accounts and credit cards.Square is taking the first step towards becoming a full-scale, legitimate FDIC insured bank. Dorsey’s company already boasts a market cap of $10.2 billion, and big banks might start to consider the possibility of a tech-based disruption to their industry in the somewhat near future.Other Fintech Companies GainSquare’s move helped send shares of mobile payment giant PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), which also owns youthful peer-to-peer payment powerhouse Venmo, up over 1% on Thursday.

1003,PYPL,"Last week, technology companies took steps to check white supremacy groups on their platforms, in an attempt to check related violence. Ride-hailing app Uber for instance told drivers that they don’t have to pick up racists (it isn’t clear how such people would be identified); Airbnb has taken a proactive stand in this respect, checking up on prospective guests through their social media profiles.Payment platforms also took a stand: PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) said it could cancel relationships with sites that promote racial intolerance; Discover Financial Services is in the process of ending its agreements with hate groups; and Apple Pay has also moved to block hate sites from using Apple Pay. Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) CEO Tim Cook also committed to a donation of a million dollars each to hate tracking organizations Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League.Facebook found that eight group pages violated hate-speech policies, including ""Right Wing Death Squad"" and ""White Nationalists United."" Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) relies on user feedback that it then checks out itself before removing any page. Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google is also removing sites GoDaddy stepped off Daily Stormer because of its connections with the neo Nazi movement.Here are the top stories from last week:    Cisco EarningsCisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) met earnings estimates for the quarter on revenue that beat. It was a mixed quarter from Cisco in which services revenue was consistent with the year-ago quarter while product revenue declined mid single-digits. The weakness in products was driven by Switching, NGN Routing, Collaboration, Data Center and Service Provider Video, offset by progress in Wireless, Security and Other. The 3% increase in security revenues was not indicative of the underlying strength, which was evident from a double-digit increase in orders and a 49% increase in related deferred revenue.  YouTube TV ExpandsYouTube TV has been adding locations at a rapid pace and reached 14 new locations, or half the U.S. population last week. 17 additional locations are in the works taking the total 46, or around 64% of U.S. households.Google didn’t roll out the service across America at the initial stage because of its strategic focus on live and local. This is the demand among millennials, according to an in-house survey. And the service does seem to have attracted a younger crowd of between 13 and 35 compared to traditional TV, which is currently patronized by 49 year olds and above.So how successful has it been thus far? Google has been executing to plan, with local content from at least three of the four local broadcasters ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC (19 of its served markets now offer all four). YouTube now offers more local channels than almost anybody except Hulu. Its customer base is also reportedly hooked on to live content.As usual, we don’t know the impact on the top or bottom line because Google doesn’t reveal the impact on its revenues or earnings.Netflix, Disney Were Destined to SeparateWith Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) going all out to create original shows and spending millions on programming, it was only a matter of time before content providers took measures to reach consumers directly.In this case, Disney upped its stake in BAMTech, a direct-to-consumer streaming technology and marketing services, data analytics and commerce management company, from 33% to 75%. Some say BAMTech doesn’t have exceptional technology, but does give the company something to build up from (it’s the technology behind HBO Now and MLB.TV).Disney will now use the technology to launch an ESPN service in 2018 that won’t have the content available on ESPN proper, but will be a robust service according to the company. It says another Disney-branded service, which will have animation and action movies, will launch in 2019 with content that would otherwise have gone to Netflix. Management just isn’t sure what it plans to do with the Marvel and Star Wars movies yet, but they could remain on Netflix.Disney also has a 30% stake in live streaming service Hulu, to which it recently transferred exclusive streaming rights to 50 of its classic movies. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+0.01%+16.05%FB-0.40%+25.37%GOOGL-0.42%+9.41%MSFT-0.01%+12.17%INTC-2.39%-4.03%CSCO-3.50%-9.99%AMZN-0.98%+13.41% Other StoriesAmazon Announces Senior Public Offering: As indicated earlier in June, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is raising $16 billion through senior unsecured notes to fund its Whole Foods Market acquisition and for general corporate purposes. Moody's assigned a Baa1 rating to the notes and changed its rating outlook from stable to positive.In the words of Moody's Vice President Charlie O'Shea, “The change in outlook to positive reflects our view that despite the increase in debt, the Whole Foods acquisition is an immediate credit positive for the company on a variety of fronts,"" These include ""greater scale"" and ""crucial brick-and-mortar presence in a segment where it has been trying to grow."" Meanwhile, S&P Global Ratings assigned an AA- rating to the proposed debt offering.Alibaba on Wrong Side of Chinese Regulators: Alibaba’s Taobao was one among five ecommerce platforms that were warned about illicit content and illegal virtual private networks (VPNs) selling on their platforms. VPNs allow users to circumvent government censorship to access foreign sites. Some of the errant sites were even ordered to halt new user registrations, suspend services and punish accountable staff. Earlier, Amazon and Apple were also similarly directed with the tech companies doing the needful to comply with Chinese government orders.Google Home Calling Phones: If you’re in the U.S. or Canada, Google Home now allows you to call any number saved in your Google Contacts account, or businesses for free. But you need to activate the feature from a phone that has the Google Home app installed. Amazon currently allows Echo users to call other Echo devices, but phone numbers can’t be called yet. The recipient however sees an “unknown number” unless he/she is a Google Fi subscriber, in which case their name appears.Amazon Macie from AWS: Last week, Amazon rolled out a security service called Amazon Macie for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).Companies that handle medical records, intellectual property, legal documents, and personally identifiable information (PII) are at risk of data theft, leakage or unauthorized access. So as data volumes increase over time, it becomes increasingly difficult to track the handling of this data.Amazon Macie relies on a machine-learning process, i.e., it studies normal data flows within the organization, classifies it and monitors future activity with past events to determine anomalies indicating risks and/or suspicious behavior. Abnormal activity such as large quantities of source code being downloaded, credentials being stored in an unsecure manner, or accidental exposure of sensitive data could get Macie to trigger alerts and suggest remedial actions.The product may have been inspired by the recent acquisition of cybersecurity startup harvest.ai for around $20 million, which had a somewhat similar product called MACIE Analytics. Macie is reportedly supported only in AWS US East and US West regions for now. Macie classification services cost $5 per GB after the first GB has been processed plus additional cost of processed events at $4 per million events after the first 100,000 events.Alibaba Invests in China Unicom: China Unicom is one of the six companies picked by the Chinese government as part of an initiative to introduce private investment in big state owned enterprises. The company will therefore be selling 10.9 billion shares, or 35% of the business at 6.83 yuan each to companies with 850 million at 3.79 yuan having been set aside for employees.The government’s initiative is in the nature of a trial, but companies have flocked to the table to cooperate. Those likely to make investments include Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, JD.com Inc., Didi Chuxing, Suning Commerce Group Co. and CRRC Corp.Apple Sets Aside $1 Billion for Hollywood: Apple’s investment is probably a drop in the ocean and doesn’t compare with what other technology companies like Netflix are spending. But Apple’s original program efforts haven’t done so great in the past, so the company is still getting its act together. Apple is also in partnership with the Netflix type, so it’s probably a good idea to tread softly. The investment is not the only indication that Apple is pulling up its socks however: the company hired away Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht from Sony TV back in June, so things are likely to get more interesting henceforth.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1004,PYPL,"Wednesday, August 16th, 2017Ahead of today’s opening bell, stock futures are once again up, even as domestic news cycles deliver drama and tension regarding the recent words and actions of President Trump. An impromptu press conference yesterday saw the President double-down on his initial comments on the weekend tragedy in Charlottesville, which were heavily criticized by people on both the Left and the Right. Nevertheless, the Dow is enjoying a 3-day winning streak, although the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are down 4 of the last 6 sessions.Trump’s Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn said he was “disgusted and upset” by the President’s latest address. Even still, he is quoted as expecting tax reform to be on track for passage before Thanksgiving. As far as healthcare reform, Cohn said he’s “not sure where that will wind up.”More leaders from Trump’s manufacturing council are leaving in response to this continuing public relations development. Further, PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) has announced it will no longer process payments to fun “alt-right” groups, and privately-held GoDaddy has already booted alt-right website Daily Stormer from its server. However, work-arounds are already occurring among groups protesting the removal of Confederate statues, among others things (nine more such protests are reportedly scheduled for the upcoming weekend). These groups are finding the Bitcoin trade useful in this regard.Housing Starts & PermitsHousing Starts posted a disappointing headline number of -4.8% for the month of July; +0.4% had been expected. A total of 1.155 million seasonally adjusted, annualized new starts is below the 1.23 million expected, and June results were revised slightly downward as well. Consider that we’re still in the zone of warmer seasonal months, and a big negative result in new starts does demonstrate a real cooling of the new home market, near-term.Permits fell 4.1% to 1.223 million, also a disappointment; June results were revised down to 1.227 million, and these numbers represent the weakest permits data since May. These figures overall represent the topsy-turvy world of spending and consumer confidence — for every better-than-expected Retail Sales number, like yesterday, we see a headwind with the next domestic growth metric, like Starts & Permits.Target, Urban Outfitters OutperformBig-box retailer Target (TGT  -  Free Report) posted a 3-cent beat on the bottom line ahead of the opening bell this morning to $1.23 per share. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks consensus of $16.82 billion in the quarter, reporting $16.42 billion. Nevertheless, this represents 1.6% growth in sales year over year, on 1.3% comps. The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated company was trading as high as +6% in today’s pre-market, but shares are now roughly +3.3%.Urban Outfitters (URBN  -  Free Report), however, is trading way up — more than 21% at this hour — following a fiscal Q2 2018 beat on both top and bottom lines. The company’s 44 cents per share outperformed the 37 cents expected, and revenues of $873 million topped the Zacks consensus estimate of $834 million. Same-store sales were also up in the quarter, and URBN shares — which had been down nearly 41% year-to-date — look to be making a nice bounce off multi-year bottoms.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1005,PYPL,"Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Mastercard surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.45%. The company exceeded earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.38%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect the company’s top line in the second quarter to gain traction from its strong international business. This will likely be offset to some extent from softness in its U.S. credit card business, given the loss of one of its client, USAA, to Visa Inc.The company’s disciplined cost management will add to its bottom line.We expect increased purchase volume and processed transaction, which will increase its business volume in the quarter led by higher spending by members as the economy continues to improve.Also, substantial investment in technology, new product launches, upgrades and alliances will be accruing to Mastercard’s top-line growth.The company’s effort in expanding its services business, which has been posting strong earnings, is a differentiator for the company in the market. Higher utilization of the company’s service offerings led to revenue acceleration in the previous quarter, and the same is expected to be seen in the quarter to be reported.Earnings will, however, be offset by an increase in rebates and incentives primarily due to impact from new and renewed agreements. Also, accelerated advertising and marketing spend is likely to hamper the company’s bottom line.We expect to see a lower tax rate led by higher earnings from lower tax-rate international market than in the prior year.The company’s use of capital in buying back shares, with the effect of reducing the share count, will help the company’s bottom line.Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Mastercard Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | Mastercard Incorporated QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Mastercard is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

1006,PYPL,"We expect PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26.Last quarter, earnings of 36 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 33 cents. Also, earnings were up 12.5% year over year.  The company has a decent earnings track record. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matching the same on the other two occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.13%.In the first quarter, the company’s revenues of $2.98 billion were up 16.9% on a year-over-year basis (up 19% on an Fx-neutral basis) and beat Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93 billion.Its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock returned 48.6%. We believe that the company’s strong performance in global payments, both online and mobile, and an increase in strategic partnerships are growth drivers.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PayPal is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components.Zacks ESP: PayPal currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.13%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 33 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged a penny lower at 32 cents per share. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: PayPal currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of PayPal’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteWhat's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?PayPal’s strong product portfolio that includes solutions like Venmo, One Touch and Xoom are helping the company acquire customers on a regular basis.Notably, the company’s One Touch solution gained 53 million consumers in the last reported quarter. Moreover, Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) decision to support in-store transactions indicates the growing clout of the company in the financial transaction market. Also, PayPal’s social P2P payment platform– Venmo– is likely to boost its customer base due to its new features in the to- be-reported quarter.PayPal is a two-sided platform, which provides it with a significant competitive advantage. Moreover, it expands its total addressable market as the company focuses on bringing more customers who are using online payments option. This is evident from the fact that net new active accounts grew 6 million in the first quarter to 203 million active accounts.Additionally, strategic partnerships with multiple original equipment manufacturers (OEM), technology companies, mobile-carriers, retailers and financial institutions are a positive.Other Stocks Worth ConsideringHere are a few companies that you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and Zacks Rank #1.

1008,PYPL,"Fortinet Inc. (FTNT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a remarkable positive earnings surprise of 250%. Notably, Fortinet has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an impressive average positive earnings surprise of 139.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFortinet’s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration.For the last three quarters, there has been a slowdown in Fortinet’s sales. The company observed that organizations have been breaking their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time instead of making a single large investment. Therefore, the above mentioned factor is likely to affect the to-be-reported quarter revenues.Nonetheless, we opine that Fortinet’s initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company’s bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates over 50% of the total revenue from these services, which helped it generate a 70 basis points gross margin expansion in first-quarter 2017. We believe that this strategy will continue to improve the company’s bottom-line performances as well.Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Fortinet, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Fortinet, Inc.

1009,PYPL,"(0:45) - The World of Fintech: Where Is The Growth?(4:00) - Global X FinTech Thematic ETF: FINX(8:50) - The Massive Growth of the Internet of Things(13:30) - Global X Internet of Things ETF: SNSR(17:15) - The Future of Thematic Investing(18:20) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@zacks.comThe tech world has exploded into a number of new industries in recent years. Segments that were once relatively untouched by the recent revolutions that we have seen in the world of computing, communications, and information are now finally being revamped with high tech processes.Two such major shifts as of late in the market come to us in the world of FinTech—which blends technology and finance into new types of banking, card processing, and the like—and also the Internet of Things, a wide market that touches everything from household products to industrial machinery by connecting a variety of devices to the internet so that they can send and receive data or instructions.Both FinTech and the Internet of Things look to be high growth areas and could completely change their respective industries in the near future too. And with this kind of growth potential, investors have to be asking what are the key points to know about these impressive industries?Well, for some insights on these new areas of the tech world, I spoke to Jay Jacobs, the VP, Director of Research at Global X for this week’s Dutram Report. We discussed these two markets in greater detail, and what investors need to be aware of in both of these increasingly in-focus corners of the stock and ETF world.FinTechFirst up, we discussed the topic of ‘FinTech’, arguably the less famous of the two areas, though it is certainly an important market in its own right. Jay clues us in on the growth that is being seen in this market as of late, and what the key industries are for the near future.We also talk about the Global X FinTech Thematic ETF (FINX  -  Free Report) and how investors can obtain broad exposure to this market via the fund. The product goes beyond usual suspects like PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and we discuss some of the other components here such as Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report) or those in the banking and asset management side, and how they fit into the overall theme.Jay also talks about what kinds of companies—from a cap perspective—are generally included in the fund, and what the most built-up areas of the FinTech ecosystem are right now. Check out the podcast for additional insights though!Internet of ThingsAfter that, we discuss one of my favorite topics in the new-tech world, and that is the Internet of Things. I am a huge fan of Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) entrant in this space, the Echo, but Jay explains how the market goes well beyond this consumer product and hits a variety of areas.One such segment that could be a huge beneficiary of the soaring demand for internet-connected devices is the semiconductor space. Jay discusses how the Internet of Things could be a huge growth avenue for the market, and how this may benefit players like Skyworks (SWKS  -  Free Report) or even Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) in the process.Jay also discusses the Global X way to play the broad industry, the Internet of Things ETF (SNSR  -  Free Report). We talk about the construction of the fund, the level of foreign exposure here, and how companies are included or not in the ETF. This is especially important for this industry, as many companies are not completely focused on the Internet of Things world, so make sure to check out the podcast for the Global X process here.Bottom LineBut what do you think about these new areas of the tech world?

1012,PYPL,"Square (SQ  -  Free Report) stock climbed higher again on Wednesday and is set to close at a new all-time high, as investors seemingly can’t get enough of the mobile payment company in 2017.Shares of Square hovered around 2% higher on Wednesday, and the company is now poised to close at over $27 per share for the first time ever. The up and coming mobile payment company also eclipsed its intraday high today, touching $27.68 per share.The San Francisco-based company closed 2016 trading at $13.63 per share and hasn’t looked back since. Square is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and scored an “A” for growth in our style score system.Why Do Investors Keep Coming?Beyond the mobile payment company’s fundamental and popular small business point of sale services, Square still has room for growth in an array of areas.Square began to offer small business loans through Square Capital, which allows merchants the opportunity to pay loans back gradually through automatic payments via a portion of their point of sale transactions.These loans could be particularly exciting for many small businesses because it removes the hassle of going through a bank. Square simply monitors a merchant and then lets them know through their online business portal if they are eligible for a loan.Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) CEO Jack Dorsey’s other company also invested in the food-ordering sector. Square now owns two food industry companies, OrderAhead and Caviar.On top of that, Square has grown to this point, without a large international presence. The mobile payment company officially entered just its fifth country, the U.K., in late March.Could Today Mean Something More For Square?Square’s name came up recently as a potential buyout candidate for a much larger and more established company that operates in the same sector: PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report).Loop Capital analyst Joseph Vafi suggested in an early July note that PayPal should consider buying Square. ""PayPal's strategic objectives over the next several years should be to maximize Venmo monetization opportunities, extend PayPal's reach in brick-and-mortar retailers, and stem transaction margin deterioration,"" Loop Capital analyst Joseph Vafi said.""The acquisition of Square helps check the boxes. Such an acquisition also fits with PayPal's vision of transforming itself into a true, two-sided network. Timing-wise, such a deal makes more sense now that Square is pro-forma profitable… With millions of active merchants, Square's customer base makes for a tantalizing monetization opportunity for Venmo.""The note lays out what seems to be a reasonable case for PayPal to acquire Square. The idea of pairing Square’s merchant-facing, small and medium size business services with PayPal’s millennial-driven, person-to-person mobile payment platform could prove to be a winning combination for both sides.PayPal is set to announce its second-quarter financials after the closing bell today. Square is ready to report its Q2 earnings a week from today, on August 2.Depending on how the two companies’ second-quarter earnings and forward-looking statements turn out, perhaps a deal is also in their futures.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All                 Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1014,PYPL,"Atlassian Corporation Plc (TEAM  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 50%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 70.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayAtlassian is engaged in designing, developing, licensing and maintenance of software, and provisioning of software hosting services. It offers tools for software developers consisting of FishEye, Bamboo and SourceTree.During third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company acquired Trello – a cloud collaboration services provider – with more than 19 million users. This acquisition has not only strengthened Atlassian’s dominating position, but also enhanced its client base, which, we expect, will drive the company’s top- and bottom-line performances over the long run. We anticipate benefits of the acquisition to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter results.Furthermore, we believe that continuous investments in product development (mainly the launch of three purpose-built versions of JIRA products) and a significant number of customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement are a few of the positives, which may drive the fiscal fourth-quarter results.Nonetheless, a volatile spending atmosphere and competition from other privately held players in the space such as Dynport and PBworks remain concerns.Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Atlassian Corporation PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Atlassian Corporation PLC QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Atlassian is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release.

1016,PYPL,"Twitter, Inc. (TWTR  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27 before the opening bell. The company recorded a positive earnings surprise of 68.75% in the last quarter. It has also delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 50.37% over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderUser growth (especially daily average users) and ad revenues will remain investors’ areas of interest in the upcoming results.In the last reported quarter, Twitter recorded a relatively impressive increase in monthly average users (MAUs) with a jump of 2.8% sequentially and 6% year over year. Also, daily average users (DAUs) were up 14%. This has somewhat renewed interest in the stock.We note that Twitter has vastly outperformed the industry in the last three months. While the stock returned 26.4%, the industry gained 11.6%.Though with a little over 328 million users, Twitter falls way behind other social media services like Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), which has over 2 billion users. The complex nature of the service has been often considered a major hindrance to user growth.Twitter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Twitter, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Twitter, Inc. QuoteTwitter has been making user-friendly changes to its platform to make it more appealing. In the second quarter, the social media platform announced that it has revamped its mobile app to make it simpler to use, including bolder headlines and easier to reply to tweets.Moreover, to improve ad revenues, Twitter has been hawk eyed on boosting video content, especially “live” content on its platform. This is because online video content generates relatively more revenues than its text-based counterparts.However, given the ad revenue potential, competition is fast intensifying in this space, with all social media companies – including Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat – pumping huge amount of resources to increase live-video viewing on their platform. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $95–$115 million while EBITDA margin is expected to be in a band of 21–21.5%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Twitter is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Twitter has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 12 cents.Zacks Rank: Twitter sports a Zacks Rank #1. Though Zacks Ranks #1, 2 or 3 increase the predictive power of the ESP, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00 makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks that, per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Cypress Semiconductor Corp (CY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.13% and a Zacks Rank #2More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

1018,PYPL,"The tech-heavy Nasdaq staged a spectacular rebound to post its longest run of gains in two years on Jul 18. Boosted by stellar results from Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), the index has now increased over eight successive sessions. This is its longest stretch of increases since Feb 24, 2015 (when the index had risen over 10 consecutive sessions). But its performance is even more remarkable this time around since it has recovered from a series of recent reverses.Concerns over overvaluation have plagued the index since June, a month the index closed with losses. Even so, it managed to post the best first half of a year in eight years. This is because investors are continuing to bet on a strong economy and bullish earnings to boost markets. Investing in stocks which make up the Nasdaq continues to make for a profitable proposition at this point in time.Longest Stretch of Gains since 2015The primary catalyst for extending this round of gains has been bullish results from Netflix. Shares of the streaming service provider jumped 13.5% after it added over 5.2 million subscribers during the second quarter, much more than the expected 3.2 million. Also, earnings grew 66.7% while revenues increased 32.3% on a year-over-year basis. (Read: Netflix Q2 Earnings Miss, Gains on Subscriber Growth)Market watchers had backed tech stocks to bounce back, riding on a strong earnings performance. The sector’s recent slide had begun on Jun 9, when a report from Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) triggered off several questions about gains made recently. It questioned the sky-high valuation of tech stocks, particularly the likes of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft  and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Overvaluation concerns then triggered off a spate of losses for tech stocks. Ultimately, the Nasdaq closed the month of June 0.9% lower. This was the index’s first monthly loss since the 2.3% decline in Oct 2016.Solid First Half Performance, Strong FundamentalsDespite the decline in June, the Nasdaq still managed to finish the second half 14.1% higher. Additionally, the index recorded its best performance for the same period since 2009. At that time, the Nasdaq had skyrocketed by 43.9% to post a far more spectacular performance. Even so, the index notched up 38 all-time highs during the first half of this year.This is the largest number of record finishes recorded since the same period in 1986. At that time it had ended at record levels on 52 occasions.   Tuesday’s gains come at a time when the fate of President Trump’s new healthcare law looks increasingly uncertain. In the event that it fails to gain passage, fresh questions will arise about the new administration’s ability to deliver on the policy front.It seems investors are ignoring these developments, choosing instead to focus on low interest rates inflation, a soft dollar and a resilient economy. Strong earnings performances of the likes of Netflix are likely to further bolster markets in the days ahead.Our ChoicesInvestors seem to have recovered their confidence in tech stocks, choosing to ignore recent concerns about valuations. A strong earnings show, such as the one from Netflix has bolstered such sentiments, leading to fresh gains for the sector over the past few sessions.Investing in tech stocks which make up the Nasdaq looks like an extremely prudent option at this point.

Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

1019,PYPL,"Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) announced today a new feature coming to its mobile app called “Amazon Pay Places” that will allow users to pay for in-store items and order meals for pick-up using their Amazon account payment information.Amazon Pay Places will allow consumers to use the app to pay for things in the real-world instead of using cash, check, credit or debit cards. In the future, the feature will available for use in a variety of stores, such as Whole Foods Market  which Amazon acquired recently.The retail giant is offering a limited launch of the meal ordering part of the feature, however. Users can only make pay-ahead food orders for one company, TGI Friday’s, at locations in Boston; Baltimore; Washington D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.This feature expands upon the company’s current “Amazon Pay” checkout option, which functions similarly to PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report). It allows retailers to add a button for the payment platform during online check out, making online shopping faster.While Amazon doesn’t disclose how many merchants use their Amazon Pay feature, the company announced in February that over 33 million customers used the payment platform. That figure represents a 10 million increase from the 23 million reported users in April 2016.Amazon Pay Places will compete with other mobile pay apps, like Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Apple Pay and Samsung Electronics’  Samsung Pay. The competition is currently fierce as mobile wallet apps have low adoption rates. Only about 4% of mobile users use mobile wallets.Amazon has not yet announced when Amazon Pay Places will reach additional markets or gain new partners.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1020,PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) has completed the acquisition of Canada-based bill payment company TIO Networks in an all-cash transaction.The payment processing giant yesterday announced that it has purchased all the outstanding shares of TIO for $2.64 per share. The collective transaction amount is approximately $238 million.The announcement of the merger was first made on Feb 14. The company stated that it will be funding the purchase with its own cash reserve. After the acquisition, TIO will operate as an independent company under PayPal.Investors will surely keep an eye on this new deal and its impact post closure to see if it could further boost the ongoing momentum in PayPal’s shares. The stock has appreciated a huge 46.6% on a year-to-date basis against the Zacks Internet - Software industry’s gain of 19.9%.How is PayPal Poised to Benefit?Since management made no change in the previously announced fiscal guidance and three-year outlook based on the TIO buyout, we do not expect any instant accretion to PayPal’s earnings.PayPal seems to be thinking several years down the road. It has been trying to enter the bill pay space. Since TIO is a major player in the North American bill pay market, the acquisition could accelerate the company’s push in the space.Further, TIO's offline payment processing platform will help PayPal tap un-banked and under-banked customers who are unable to access conventional financial services. Per a Business Insider report, these customer groups roughly encompass 33.5 million U.S. households and 2 billion people globally.The acquisition gives PayPal access to $7 billion worth of payments from around 14 million clients that TIO serves in North America and its 10,000 biller partners.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Revenue (TTM) PayPal Holdings, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteOur TakePayPal has been working on a broader goal of partaking into daily financial activities of customers.  We believe that by combining its own payment platform with bill payment, PayPal will be able to strengthen its product portfolio as well as boost global expansion efforts.We expect the acquisition to significantly boost PayPal’s transaction revenues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently PayPal is Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.

1022,PYPL,"Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) have entered into a mutual agreement pursuant to which the latter will be able to issue PayPal-branded Visa debit cards in Europe.PayPal already had a banking license in Europe and this deal will help it foray into the region’s debit card market.Consumers and merchants will be benefited by this alliance as the joint service should make their digital and mobile payments options secure, reliable and convenient digital.This partnership will make it easier for financial institutions to offer their Visa account holders the ability to checkout anywhere PayPal is accepted online. The agreement should result in ""more spending volume"" on Visa cards.The partnership also includes the participation of Visa Digital Enablement Program (VDEP) in Europe. Visa’s VDEP service makes use of tokenization that simplifies and secures transactions.PayPal will also be able to leverage on the Visa Direct service, which is quick, safe, affordable and the easiest way to send and receive money. This service will enable PayPal users to move funds to their Visa accounts in real time across multiple markets.Visa has been busy forming numerous pacts and alliances that have beefed up its business volumes. The company’s strong performance is also reflected in its share price which has added 24%, compared with the 22% gain for the Zacks categorized Financial Transaction Services industry, since it first joined forces with PayPal last July.Visa and PayPal are treading along quite well since their first partnership to jointly provide payment services in the U.S. The strategic deal put an end to their decade-old friction over online transactions. The deal was a positive development for Visa, as PayPal agreed to stop steering business away from the former.PayPal has also formed similar alliances with other payment services companies Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) and Discover Financial Services (DFS  -  Free Report).In April, PayPal and Visa entered into another partnership to jointly serve customers in Asia-Pacific. The agreement is an extension of their strategic partnership in the United States and Asia-Pacific.The deals forged this year don’t come to us as a surprise since the companies already hinted (at the time of first partnership) that they “hope to work out a deal for international transactions as well.” We expect to hear similar deals in the future.Visa carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1023,PYPL,"Major credit card processors are scheduled to report earnings over this week and the next. While, American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) are scheduled to report earnings within a day of each other, Mastercard Inc.’s (MA  -  Free Report) earnings are due for release next week.Visa has profited considerably from American Express’ loss of its lucrative partnership with Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report), which it has now added to its bag of tie-ups. The reunion with Visa Europe has also strengthened the card processor.Meanwhile, Mastercard is benefiting from its inorganic growth strategy, such as its acquisitions of VocaLink and NuData Security. Its partnerships, such as its deal with PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) have also widened its business opportunities. Meanwhile, Mastercard is making significant progress in its digital strategy and continuously investing in technology.With Visa and Mastercard scheduled to report within a week of each other, on Jul 20 and Jul 27, respectively this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceShares of both Mastercard and Visa have notched up gains in the year to date period. Visa is marginally ahead with a gain of 24.1%. However, Mastercard is not far behind with an increase of 23.4%, ahead of both the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry and the S&P 500 which have gained 20.2% and 10%, respectively during this period.ValuationThe average one year trailing 12-month P/B ratio is the best multiple for valuing the card processing business because of large variations in earnings results from one quarter to the next.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/B ratio of 24.23, Mastercard is overvalued compared to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry. On the other hand, Visa has a P/B ratio of 8.10, which is why it is undervalued compared to both the broader industry as well as Mastercard. Dividend YieldComing to dividend yield, while the Financial Transaction Services industry offers a dividend yield of 0.7%, Mastercard offers a marginally lower return of 0.69%. Visa is not far behind, with a dividend yield of 0.68%, which means that this round is too close to call.Earnings History ESP, Estimate Revisions and EPS GrowthRiding on higher revenues, Visa posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) earnings of 86 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. Also, the bottom line improved 27% year over year. Net operating revenue of $4.5 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.2 billion. Also, revenues climbed 23% year over year.Meanwhile, Mastercard reported first-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.01 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents by 7.4%. Also, earnings improved 17.4% year over year. MasterCard posted revenues of $2.73 billion for the reported quarter, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64 billion. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 11.8%.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, both Mastercard and Visa have delivered positive earnings surprises over the last two quarters. However, Visa holds a slight edge with an average earnings surprise of 7.2% versus Mastercard’s figure of 6.4%. Visa also has a higher expected earnings growth rate of 18.4% for the current year, compared to Mastercard’s expected rate of 13.9%.However, when considering Earnings ESP, there is nothing to choose from between the two stocks, with both having readings of 0. Estimate revisions for both stocks have increased by 0.1% over the last 30 days.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that there is nothing to choose between Mastercard and Visa when considering Earnings ESP and estimate revisions. Additionally, both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2. While Mastercard offers a marginally higher dividend yield, Visa holds a clear edge when considering earnings history, price performance, expected EPS growth and valuations. This is why it may be better to bet on Visa over Mastercard.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.
