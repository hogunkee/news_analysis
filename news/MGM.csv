11,MGM,"The Supreme Court on Monday struck down a law largely banning sports betting as unconstitutional, a ruling that will likely spur many states to legalize it.However analysts have said the difference between expectations and reality means it may not be the revenue bonanza for casino stocks such as of Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) than it first appears.In fact the biggest winners should actually be the strong regional players, such as Caesars Entertainment (CZR), Boyd Gaming (BYD) and Penn National Gaming (PENN). With their vast network of properties, they are the best poised to open sports books around the U.S., especially if states opt to limit the locations were such betting is allowed, rather than following the more laissez-faire approach of the United Kingdom, where bookmakers are an established part of the high street.Caesars Entertainment shot up 5.5% on the stock market today. Boyd Gaming climbed 3.1%, Penn National Gaming 4.7% and Churchill Downs (CHDN) 4.9%. Penn National and Churchill Downs cleared buy points.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

MGM Resorts, which has a big Macau exposure but is more Vegas-centric than Sands and Wynn, rose 1.6%.However online sports betting could end up being the most important market of all. That would put specialist bookmakers such as U.K.-based William Hill, which is Nevada's sports betting market leader, in pole position to seize the lion's share of the business. And back in April online gambling giant Stars Group (TSG) bet big on online sports betting after agreeing to a $4.7 billion deal to acquire U.K. firm Sky Betting & Gaming.Stars Group stock rallied 9% Monday.The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act Of 1992 had effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, except for sports lotteries conducted in Oregon, Delaware and Montana, as well as the licensed sports pools in Nevada. In Murphy v. NCAA, New Jersey appealed the law and the Supreme Court on Monday found in the state's favor.This could have massive implications, as sports betting bills exist in some form in roughly half the 50 states. However analysts believe there may be less gold at the end of the rainbow than is believed.'We think the time to play the impact of sports betting in the U.S. is sooner than later, as we believe the 10,000-foot-view of what the opportunity could mean, is likely to be better than the reality of what it ultimately does mean,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli said in a research note.He cited the case of online gaming legalization in New Jersey in 2013, where estimates of market size far outpaced the ultimate reality of the market. Then Governor Chris Christie claimed the market could be worth $1.2 billion, however, first-year revenue in 2014 ended up coming in at $123 million.""While we don't want to be overly dismissive, we believe; 1) market size is likely to be lower than expectations as player conversion to legal markets could be lower than perceived, 2) a state by state rollout will take time, as will the ramp periods, & 3) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins will be thin,"" Santarelli said.On the other hand ease of use and trust of payment, and the ability to attract those who would like to bet but do not want to break the law will attract customers.The American Gaming Association has estimated that $150 billion is bet annually on sports. However analysts don't think that those who bet illegally will become legal bettors en masse.""Issues which could possibly curb market size include: 1) there will be no float in legal sports betting, meaning you can't bet what you don't have, and yes, that happens, 2) tradition and relationships with ""your guy,"" and 3) an unwillingness to allow governments to see further into an individual's financials,"" Santarelli said.Jefferies analysts estimates a legal sports betting handle, excluding Nevada and Delaware, of between $1.2 and $57.6 billion, and has used $23.9 billion as its base case. Deutsche Bank estimates a total market size of around $4 billion in sports book revenue across 13 states in 2023.There may be an opportunity for a nimble competitor to outmaneuver the bigger companies and run a sports book across a number of regional casinos, who would cash in buy leasing space out to the bookies.""Other than the largest operators in (Nevada), most should outsource bookmaking which bears a cost against profits, while the operating platform also bears a cost,"" Jefferies analyst David Katz said in a research note. ""The issue of negotiating and establishing regulations and issuing licenses has historically been time-consuming, which pushes the earnings opportunities further out.""The most lucrative, but also the most risky, aspect of sports betting is running the sports book itself. While industry giant Caesars could operate its own book, analysts believe both Penn and Boyd's are more likely to outsource. They will profit by leasing floor space and taking a cut of the profits.Due to the outsourcing dimension, British bookmaker William Hill could be a big winner, with Canter Gaming and another U.K. firm Ladbrokes also seen as being well-placed. William Hill is currently Nevada's sports betting leader with a 55% market share. The company operates 108 of Nevada's 192 sports books and is the risk manager for sports betting within the Delaware lottery.Last week its U.S. operations enjoyed the biggest growth of all divisions across its whole group during Q1, with revenue rising by 45%. It would have the vital expertise needed to operate a sports book on a large scale.The big casino companies are keeping their cards close to their chest on the issue, with many declining to comment. However there is one firm that seems eager to take advantage if the chips fall the right way.""Boyd Gaming views expanded sports betting as an intriguing growth opportunity. We have more than 40 years of experience in sports betting, we operate one of the largest sports book networks in the state of Nevada, and we currently have operations in seven different states (expanding to 10 by the end of the year),"" a spokesman said. ""Should the Supreme Court repeal PAPSA, Boyd Gaming is in an excellent position to become a leading player in the growth and expansion of sports betting in the U.S.""Meanwhile the NBA has been criticized for seeking an ""integrity fee,"" which would levy a proposed 1% of every placed wager if legalization is approved.

""We have an obligation to our fans and our sport to help ensure the integrity of our games is protected, which can be done through a strong law requiring airtight coordination between the state, the casino operators and the sports leagues to closely monitor wagers.""The NHL has yet to take a public position on the subject, however it allows bets to be placed on its Vegas Golden Knights games in Nevada.The players associations from the four big leagues have banded together and seem keen to secure their own slice of the pie.""Betting on sports may become widely legal, but we cannot allow those who have lobbied the hardest for sports gambling to be the only ones controlling how it would be ushered into our businesses,"" they said in a joint statement.

Micron tumbled as a Chinese court barred some sales in the country.The electric-car maker managed to top a long-delayed production goal of 5,000 Model 3 sedans in the final week of June.

Fed contacts indicated that tit-for-tat tariffs and escalating trade threats were starting to impact business confidence and investment plans. Several policymakers raised concern about the narrowing of the gap between short-term and long-term Treasury yields, given that an inversion — longer rates falling below shorter ones — historically precedes a recession.

Credit Suisse analysts also expected a rebound for Home Depot in the second quarter, but said ""we expect that the near-term direction of the stock to be dictated by weather in the coming weeks.""Retail sales data for April showed that the consumer soft patch to start the year has given way to strength, likely helped by delayed tax refunds.

And how hard it was to make a buck.""I think it very much informed his approach to life later,"" says William G. Rempel, author of ""The Gambler: How Penniless Dropout Kirk Kerkorian Became the Greatest Dealmaker in Capitalist History.""That deal making included starting Trans International Airlines, three times building what would then be the largest hotels in the world and purchasing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio.His career had an unlikely genesis. His father was a successful farmer in California's rich San Joaquin Valley until he lost it all in the Depression of 1921-22. The family moved to Los Angeles when Kerkorian (1917-2015) was five years old. Ironically, much of his later success is rooted in the difficult times he experienced in his youth.In a phone interview, author Rempel continued: ""That poverty, that desperation, that uncertainty gave him a comfort with risk, and with that comfort came a willingness to place big bets.""It also imbued Kerkorian with a scrappiness. He even thought about becoming a professional boxer; he'd compiled a 33-4 record and won the Pacific Coast welterweight title as an amateur. While he may not have had a killer instinct, he certainly didn't lack confidence.Kerkorian was booked to fight a more experienced, undefeated boxer. After watching his opponent warm up in the ring, he called over his manager/brother Nish and said, ""I can't fight this guy."" Kerkorian wasn't afraid of his opponent, he was afraid he ""might hurt him.""His confidence was warranted. Kerkorian knocked him out within seconds of the first round. But boxing was probably not the best career choice. In a twist of fate and luck, his boss at the heating company where he worked took him along on a flying lesson and Kerkorian was hooked.He signed up for flying lessons, eventually became a flight instructor, and during World War II took on the dangerous task of ferrying RAF planes from Canada to Scotland. The flights required a stiff tailwind, and many aircraft (nearly including one Kerkorian piloted) didn't make it.After the war, he started a charter service that flew between Los Angeles and Las Vegas; Bugsy Siegel and John Wayne were regular customers. He saw a future in aviation and steadily expanded what started as Los Angeles Air Service into Trans International Airlines (TIA), a major supplemental carrier at the time.Kerkorian seemed to have a special wisdom to see deals where his contemporaries didn't. For example, when, after a rough landing, an insurance company declared a BOAC (a forerunner of British Airways) Constellation a total loss, Kerkorian offered $150,000 for it with the proviso the insurer throw in four new (or rebuilt) engines, which it gladly did.Kerkorian promptly leased the engines to TWA for $150,000, invested that amount in rebuilding the plane, and ultimately (after leasing it elsewhere) sold it to El Al for $750,000.It is the kind of deal Kerkorian repeated time and again. ""I think there was an instinct,"" Rempel said. ""He also did his homework. He didn't turn to advisors with MBAs. He searched (on his own) for things outside the common wisdom, looking for hidden assets.""In 1962, Kerkorian sold TIA to Studebaker in a deal valued at approximately $10 million — plus an approval-of-purchaser clause. By the following year, the automaker was in free fall, and its board tried to sell TIA to Continental Airlines. If successful, it would have impacted TIA employees' seniority and pensions. Kerkorian said no way. He would not leave in the lurch the employees who had been there for him in the beginning.""All he had growing up was family and the loyalty of friends,"" Rempel said. ""He put value in people.""So he agreed to purchase the airline back — for $2.5 million. He'd purchased a large parcel of land on the Las Vegas Strip with his share of the initial TIA sale, so he had to go into debt to repurchase the airline. He willingly put up every property he owned as collateral and covered the rest with his personal savings. He did this time and again, because, Rempel said, ""He didn't have an attachment to things. Things didn't matter. He didn't have toys growing up. He didn't even have the same house from one month to the next. Things were what he traded.""In 1968 he sold TIA again, this time to Transamerica Corp., but a last-minute hang-up, a technicality over a class of stock, threatened to squelch the deal. Kerkorian needed the proceeds to pursue his Las Vegas dreams, but wasn't prepared to net any less than the original amount agreed upon. So at the meeting where the final papers were to be signed, Kerkorian called it off and started to walk out. But he was stopped, and Transamerica adjusted the terms to the original level.That money was used to help build the International Hotel, at the time (1969) the largest hotel in the world. In subsequent years, he built even larger properties, the MGM Grand Hotel (1973) and the MGM Grand (1993), each the largest hotels in the world when they were constructed.While the mob may have started Las Vegas, it was Kerkorian's vision of the modern leisure industry that created its current incarnation.When we think of the marketing of Las Vegas as an ""entertainment center instead of just being known for gambling with ancillary activities, we forget that Kerkorian had been (an innovator) a long time before,"" noted Michael Green, an associate professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.""When (he) opened the International, it had two showrooms, not one. ... The hotel had a youth hostel and activities for young people. ... This is the kind of thing we might expect today, but not back then.""He recognized value in Vegas just as he did with his purchase of MGM. The studio was bleeding cash when he made a tender offer for 1 million shares — initially for $10 a share more than the stock was then selling for. It seemed to produce one bomb film after another. He considered the company's real estate, vast library of classic films (""Singing in the Rain,"" ""Wizard of Oz,"" ""Gone With the Wind"") and even its symbol, Leo the Lion, as unvalued assets.Kerkorian revealed another aspect of his personality in 1985, when he sold MGM to Ted Turner. Turner signed on to a deal that was unsustainable, so Kerkorian restructured it, helping Turner finance the purchase. He didn't want to squash Turner. CNN could have been KNN, but Kerkorian kept changing the deal to accommodate Turner's needs.""You see in his dealings with Ted Turner and others that a good deal is a deal that benefits both sides,"" Rempel said.Early in his career, Kerkorian sold a used DC-4 to Pacific Northern Airlines. The company's mechanics complained that the aircraft leaked so badly it posed a safety hazard even when parked on the ground. When the airline's executives protested, Kerkorian apologized, said he was unaware of the plane's condition and immediately returned the full purchase price without question.Certainly Kerkorian had setbacks in his career, but his reputation for honesty as personified by actions such as these made it so he was able to get multimillion-dollar loans on his signature alone.When he died in 2015, his estate was valued at around $4 billion, but not because he didn't try to give much of it away. Mostly anonymously, he gave millions to charities such as the American Red Cross. But following the devastating 1988 earthquake that hit his parents' native Armenia, he spearheaded and donated $1 billion to relief efforts.""His acts were pure charity,"" Rempel said. ""He felt it wasn't charity if you expect something in return. He didn't want his name on buildings and no credit for any gift.""Toward the end of his life, Rempel says, Kerkorian confided to a friend that he wanted ""to give it all away — and start over. He so much enjoyed making deals.""Deal maker who founded a charter airline and helped create the modern Las Vegas.Overcame: A poverty-stricken background and a lack of education.Lesson: Use your background as your strength.Quote: ""When you're a self-made man, you start very early in life. ... You get a drive that's a little stronger than somebody who inherited.""

40,MGM,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) continued to dive on Monday following sexual-misconduct allegations last week against CEO Steve Wynn, as analysts began to parse out the possible fate of the CEO and his company, with one suggesting it could ultimately be sold.X The stock tumbled 9.3% to 163.48 in the stock market today in extremely high volume following a 10% plunge on Friday when a Wall Street Journal report detailed allegations from women who said Wynn pressured them into sexual activity. Wynn Resorts closed below its 50-day moving average, a sell signal given the heavy trading.Wynn has said the notion that he ""ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.""Wynn Resorts' board of directors has formed a committee to investigate the allegations. Regulators from Massachusetts and Nevada are examining the matter. Wynn resigned as the Republican National Committee's finance chairman.The growing scrutiny from regulators has raised questions about how much investors would stand by the company, and how the company might move past the potential loss of one of the industry's biggest innovators. Annual reports from the company cite ""our dependence on Stephen A. Wynn"" as among its risk factors, Barclays noted.And the moves out of Nevada and Massachusetts have raised questions over whether the axis of gambling in the east, Macau — where Wynn Resorts gets most of its sales — might do the same. The company is also seeking a license for a resort in Japan.The research firm Union Gaming and Morgan Stanley both downgraded Wynn Macau in the wake of the allegations. Bloomberg noted that gaming laws in Macau, a Chinese administrative region, factor in the operator's reputation during the bidding for licenses.Barclays analyst Felicia Hendrix, in a research note, said business and leisure customers in Las Vegas, where Wynn's sales have slipped recently, could stay away in the near-term as the allegations damage the company's reputation. But she said sales in Macau were less likely to be affected.However, she said that a sale of the company, as opposed to just Wynn's shares, could be the most likely result from those allegations. The move, she argued, would help preserve the company's value overall, she said.""The quality of WYNN's resorts globally is unprecedented, in our view, and there are a number of public companies (and likely private equity firms) that would be more than willing to acquire these assets if they were to come to the market,"" she wrote. ""Further, there are a number of public companies which do not operate in Macau that would see this as a great opportunity.""""So,"" she added, ""demand could be high for this company if it were to be sold, which could limit the potential downside.""The region — the only place in China where gambling is legal and the world's biggest market for gaming — did the heavy lifting for Wynn's results in the fourth quarter.Gaming sales in Macau jumped around 19% last year, as more VIPs overcame worries over regulator crackdowns in years past and returned more often to gamble there. But, as one analyst told IBD last year, ""You can never relax about Macau,"" and fears of stiffer gambling rules in the region are never far from investors' minds.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) jumped 4.7%, while MGM Resorts International (MGM) added 2.65%.

41,MGM,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are falling in the wake of a Wall Street Journal report detailing allegations of sexual misconduct against the casino company's CEO, Steve Wynn.X Hours after the report came out, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission said it will conduct a review of the company's Wynn Boston Harbor project.""The suitability and integrity of our gaming licensees is of the utmost importance, and ensuring that suitability is an active and ongoing process,"" the commission said, according to the Boston Business Journal. ""Consequently, the MGC's Investigations and Enforcement Bureau will conduct a regulatory review of this matter to determine the appropriate next steps.""For its bombshell story, the Wall Street Journal interviewed dozens of people, whose allegations would point to decades of sexual misconduct.Wynn, in a statement to the Journal, said ""The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous."" And he said ""the instigation of these accusations is the continued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement.""The report details accounts of female employees, including a manicurist and a massage therapist, who said Wynn asked or pressured them to perform sexual acts on him and felt that they had to do so, given his influence in the industry.One incident, in which a manicurist said Wynn pressured her to have sex with him, occurred shortly after the opening of Wynn Las Vegas in 2005 and resulted in a $7.5 million settlement, sources told the Journal.Other employees told the Journal that Wynn ""often walked around some areas of the complex in extremely short shorts without underwear, and he would sit in the salon to get pedicures in such a way that his genitals were exposed.""The report adds that former workers for Wynn properties said they ""sometimes entered fake appointments in the books to help other female workers get around a request for services in Mr. Wynn's office or arranged for others to pose as assistants so they wouldn't be alone with him.""The stock plunged 10.1% to 180.29 in the stock market today in its heaviest volume in years. Wynn closed the week up 0.2% after surging to a fresh 3-year high during the week on its strong earnings and those of peer Las Vegas Sands (LVS).Las Vegas Sands rose 0.2% to 75.50, MGM Resorts (MGM) 0.65% to 37.05 and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) 0.7% to 13.95.If Wynn were forced out of the company — a move that would follow the dismissals of other powerful men in the media and Hollywood — it would mark the departure of one of the most iconic figures in the casino industry, who helped evolve Las Vegas' basic casino industry into a huge casino-resort business and brought a new standard for lavishness to the industry.The allegations come as the nation reckons with workplace sexual harassment and reexamines the boundaries of consent.Las Vegas' economy, meanwhile, is set to remain solid on an influx of tourism and convention business. But as more business comes in and more women come forward, the union speaking for thousands of Las Vegas hotel staff is asking the city's casino and hotel companies to give those attendants panic buttons.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Wynn Resorts Earnings Nearly Triple On Strong Macau RevenueFord Mixed, Las Vegas Sands Beats, United Rental Profit Meets

42,MGM,"The NBA is backing a state-by-state solution that would pave the way for nationwide sports betting.X While the league had previously called for federal-level reform, it threw its weight behind lower-level legislation for the first time at a meeting of the New York State Senate's Racing, Gaming, and Wagering Committee Wednesday.And in a move that could pour billions into its coffers, it is demanding 1% of every placed wager if legalization is approved.""We support the passage of a comprehensive sports betting bill that would serve as a model for a 50-state solution — whether that happens in Congress or on a state-by-state basis,"" NBA Assistant General Counsel Dan Spillane said in written testimony.The American Gaming Association has estimated that $150 billion is bet annually on sports.Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman welcomed the NBA's testimony, but criticized the league's proposal to take a percentage point of each bet.""Let's get real about eliminating the illegal market, protecting consumers and determining the role of government – a role that most certainly does not include transferring money from bettors to multibillion-dollar sports leagues,"" Freeman said.The AGA claimed a 1% integrity fee on all money wagered legally would amount to 20-29% of total revenue.Shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) closed down 0.3% on the stock market today, but rallied late on strong quarterly results. Wynn Resorts (WYNN) climbed 2.9%, MGM Resorts (MGM) gained 1.7%, and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) ended flat.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.New York is one of several states exploring the idea of legalizing gambling. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently mulling over New Jersey's law to legalize sports gambling, and if that clears legal muster it could clear the way for individual states to legalize sports betting at casinos and racetracks.However, the NBA said at the New York Senate committee hearing that any future legislation should not limit betting to just those venues, but also allow wagers on smartphones and the internet.The league also pointed out that most states already offer gambling to citizens through lotteries and noted the relative underdevelopment of sports betting in the U.S. compared to the regulated industries that function in Europe and Australia.""In England, a sports fan can place a legal bet on a smartphone, at a stadium kiosk, or even on a television,"" Spillane said. ""There are extensive regulations in these jurisdictions to protect the integrity of sports and the consumers who place bets.""To ensure the integrity of sports is maintained, the NBA wants leagues to have the right to restrict the types of wagers placed on their events, as certain types of bets are open to manipulation by players.The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act Of 1992 effectively outlawed sports betting nationwide, except for sports lotteries conducted in Oregon, Delaware and Montana, as well as the licensed sports pools in Nevada.The NFL has maintained public opposition to sports betting, and last year Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league is also against individual states regulating their own gambling industries, despite the Raiders franchise moving to gambling mecca Las Vegas.MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has advocated the league change its opposition. And while the NHL has yet to take a public position on the subject, it allows bets to be placed on Vegas Golden Knights games in Nevada.

43,MGM,"Casino operator Wynn Resorts (WYNN) on Monday reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales that topped Wall Street forecasts, lifted by strong results in Macau. Shares of Wynn Resorts and other casino giants such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rallied, hitting multi-year highs.X Earnings per share nearly tripled to $1.40, beating Zacks estimates for $1.36, while net sales jumped 30% to $1.689 billion, above views for $1.536 billion.The pick up in sales was helped by gains from Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau, its two Macau resorts. However, sales in the company's Las Vegas properties fell 1.6%.Wynn shares soared 8.7% to 195.23 in the stock market today. Las Vegas Sands, which reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday, rose 3.4% to 77.06.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.MGM Resorts International (MGM), which is more exposed to Vegas than the other big casino players, rose 2.1% to its best levels since August 2008. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO),which draws much of its sales from Macau and is owned by Hong Kong-based Melco International Development, climbed 1.3%, reaching a three-year best  like Wynn and Sands.Wynn's results follow a 19.1% pop in sales last year in Macau, the world's largest gaming hub and the only part of China where gambling is legal. However, the region remains prone to stiff regulatory scrutiny.On a GAAP basis, the company said Q4 net income was $491.7 million, or $4.77 a share, more than quadruple the amount a year ago, due in large part to the GOP's tax reform and the gains in Macau.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Wynn Resorts Joins Rank Of Stocks With 95-Plus Composite RatingCasinos Hit By 'Luck Factor' As The House Doesn't Always WinHow An NFL Team, A Highway And Towels Benefit MGM ResortsStocks Near Buy Zone Ahead Of EarningsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

Hot recent IPO Roku (ROKU) tumbled on its revenue outlook. Home Depot (HD) beat and gave bullish guidance. Fed policymakers seemed slightly hawkish. Rite Aid (RAD) agreed to an Albertsons buyout.X The major averages suffered modest losses through Thursday, closing near session lows several times, while the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index fell back below their 50-day moving averages. But on Friday, all three indexes surged more than 1%, closing the week higher. Walmart (WMT) and Roku were big weekly losers. Treasury yields popped to fresh four-year highs on Fed minutes, but they backed off somewhat.The world's largest retailer reported better-than-expected Q4 sales and same-store sales, but earnings missed estimates. U.S. online sales grew 23%, less than half Q3's 50% annual rise, as Walmart (WMT) struggles to compete with Amazon.com (AMZN). Walmart still sees 40% e-commerce growth this fiscal year. But its earnings guidance was light. Walmart online chief Marc Lore denied a report he might leave the retailer. Walmart said it will roll out a more-upscale home furnishings shopping portal. Walmart stock crashed 10% on Tuesday.Amazon, for its part, reportedly plans to roll out six more cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores after recently opening its first Go store in Seattle to the general public.Federal Reserve policymakers still backed gradual interest rate hikes in 2018 at their Jan. 30-31 meeting. But they see stronger growth prospects in 2018 than they did in December, in part due to the Trump tax cuts. Fed officials see inflation rising to 2% over time. The 10-year Treasury yield, already up sharply this year, rose to fresh four-year highs, pushing stocks lower Wednesday. Meanwhile, existing-home sales posted their biggest annual drop in 3 years, while applications for loan to buy a home tumbled again.Streaming video platform Roku (ROKU) earned an adjusted 6 cents a share on sales of $188.3 million in Q4, vs. expectations for a loss of 11 cents a share on sales of $183 million.

It's projected to buy back $4 billion in shares. Shares rose fractionally for the week.Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) cut its offer to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) to $79 a share in cash and stock from $82 after Qualcomm raised its bid for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Broadcom said Qualcomm's revised NXP offer amounted to a transfer of value to NXP shareholders. If Qualcomm's purchase of NXP doesn't go through, Broadcom will pay $82 a share. Broadcom has asked Qualcomm investors to vote for its slate of six nominees to Qualcomm's board at the company's March 6 shareholder meeting.Grocery giant Albertsons, under private ownership for over a decade, announced it would merge with Rite Aid (RAD). The combined company, which will be public will have a value of $24 billion, including debt. The deal comes after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) gave up on an effort last year to buy all of Rite Aid due to regulatory objections, instead acquiring less than half of the smaller rival's stores.

Printer-and-PC maker HP Inc. (HPQ) also guided higher for Q2 and the full year. HPE and HP Inc. shares jumped Friday.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) came up short on sales, but its stock appeared to be propped up by a report saying that Burger King-parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) was thinking about making a bid.

Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) was just shy on same-store sales. Wingstop (WING) shares fell Friday on a weak 2018 EPS outlook.MGM Resorts International (MGM) missed Q4 earnings per share estimates, while sales topped, helped by the casino-resort operator's opening of MGM National Harbor in December 2016.

Copper revenue surged 52% on higher prices and an output boost, while BHP's iron ore division saw 4% growth. The mining giant pushed back against structural changes sought by activist hedge fund Elliott Advisors but boosted its dividend and said it's expediting the sale of its $10 billion in U.S. shale assets.General Mills (GIS) will buy natural cat and dog food maker Blue Buffalo Pet Products (BLUE) for about $8 billion, or $40 a share.Intuit (INTU) earned 35 cents a share in its Q2, beating views by a penny.

45,MGM,"Shares of gun makers tend to jump following a mass shooting, as investors bet on a rush to buy firearms in anticipation of possible gun control measures. But Sturm Ruger (RGR) and American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), the holding company of Smith & Wesson, have fallen since a former student killed 17 people and wounded 15 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.X With Sturm Ruger reporting fourth-quarter earnings late Wednesday, its shares closed down 2.4% on the stock market today, modestly below where they were before the Feb. 14 shooting. American Outdoor Brands was off 1.2%, just above a recent three-year high.Sturm Ruger's relative strength line, which compares a stock's price performance to the S&P 500 index, is at a three-year low. American Outdoor's RS line is the worst in six years.During the Obama administration, gun stocks tended to increase in value in the wake of mass shootings. Sales often spiked after such an incident on concerns that new restrictions on firearms sales could result. But Obama, despite his support for gun control measures, made few executive actions while Congress passed no significant restrictions during his eight years in office.With President Trump in office, there was no spike in gun sales in the wake of last year's Las Vegas mass shooting or the Sutherland Springs church shooting.Trump has come out in favor of banning rapid-fire bump stocks used in the Vegas massacre. He also reportedly is open to expanded background checks. But Trump and the GOP Congress are unlikely to adopt sweeping gun control restrictions.Sturm Ruger, which manufactures rifles, shotguns, semi-automatic pistols and revolvers, met fourth-quarter earnings estimates of 62 cents a share, down 44% vs. a year earlier. Revenue fell 27% to $118.2 million, beating views for $114 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares were not yet active late.Ruger will hold an analyst call Thursday morning.Decreased consumer demand has led to a 25% year-over-year decline in the estimated unit sell-through of its products from independent distributors to retailers.

HTe loss sent Walmart shares sharply below support at their 10-week moving average, and below a 100.23 buy point in a flat base.Home Depot narrowed its early gain, trading up 0.6% after topping analysts' targets and raising its quarterly dividend 16%. Home Depot shares are four weeks into a possible basing effort, but may be meeting some resistance at their 10-week moving average.Apple (AAPL) rose a fraction, and three of four FANG stock tech names turned positive at the open.

Efforts by Apple and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) to hold support at their 10-week moving averages will be among this week's closely watched contests.NXP Semicondcutors (NXPI) surged 6% after Qualcomm hoisted its takeover bid to $127.50 per share, up from an early $110-per-share offer. The new bid values the company near $44 billion vs. $38 billion in its earlier bid. Broadcom (AVGO) is maneuvering to buy out Qualcomm in a $121 billion deal.

His Bank of America holdings increased by 171% to 17.2 million shares. He opened new positions in Caesars Entertainment (CZR) at roughly 54.9 million shares and MGM Resorts International (MGM) at 2.3 million shares.Tepper cooled on the energy sector, offloading his entire stake in Kinder Morgan (KMI) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK) — which fell in Q4 despite a surge in oil prices. He also dumped the underperforming Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) and General Motors (GM), whose 2% gain over the quarter lagged the S&P 500's 6% gain.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital also looked to financials and tech. Greenlight grew its stake in Brighthouse Financial (BHF) to 11 million shares and opened a new stake in Twitter at 2.8 million shares.

"
62,MGM,"Sherry Lansing was in for a surprise when she met her new boss, oil magnate Marvin Davis.It was 1981 and Davis had just purchased 20th Century Fox (FOXA). Lansing was the studio's president of production, the first woman to hold so lofty a post. When she stuck her head in to say hello, Davis replied:""No, no honey, I don't want any coffee.""When she persisted and introduced herself, he said, no, ""I want Jerry Lansing, the person who's running the studio.""She explained that she was the person running the studio, he said, ""A girl?""Yes, she replied, ""a girl.""How did she deal with the slight? ""By denial,"" Lansing said in a telephone interview with IBD. ""It was a very different world, and I found that if I let all that noise bother me I couldn't do my job. So what I did was deny it, put my head down and work twice as hard. I learned to pick my battles.""If I had gone to human resources, I would have been fired. Today, you can bring down a network.""I'm not saying tolerating that behavior was better. Just that I learned to tolerate.""It was in large measure Lansing's ability to drown out distractions and concentrate on the task at hand that propelled her to the top ranks in the entertainment business. Stephen Galloway, the executive features editor at the Hollywood Reporter, is the author of the newly published ""Leading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker.""He was attracted to his subject, Galloway said, ""because she was the single most important and influential woman of her time and an important role model.""""Her breakthrough in becoming president of Fox was one of the those watermark moments for women,"" he added. ""I was very interested in how she had shifted in her career from model to actress to producer to studio executive, and finally out of the business into another career in philanthropy.""Lansing's career trajectory actually began while she was growing up in Chicago under the watchful eye of her role-model mom, Margot. Lansing was just 8 years old when her father died. She remembers two of the employees in the family's small real estate business telling Margot, ""Don't worry. We'll run the business and take care of you.""Lansing remembers her mother's reply: ""No you won't. You will teach me how to run the business and I will take care of my family.""""She without a doubt was the biggest influence in my life,"" Lansing says.After graduating from college, Sherry moved to Los Angeles with her first husband and began a ""career"" as a high school teacher. She tolerated all the normal headaches of an educator — until, that is, a gang invaded the school, beat up one of her pupils, tied up teachers, and threw a Molotov cocktail into the principal's office.But there was a Plan B. Lansing went out on auditions for modeling and acting jobs even while she taught. It wasn't easy, but she persevered through cattle calls and enjoyed a modicum of success:A national shampoo commercial opposite a then-unknown Farrah Fawcett; TV guest spots (""Ironside,"" ""Dan August""), films (""Loving,"" ""Rio Lobo"") and even 10 episodes as a background partyer on Hugh Hefner's jazz-infused series, ""Playboy After Dark."" While in her career Lansing had moments of fending off sexual aggression, Hefner treated her and the other actors with respect, and made sure they were all well fed.""It was a great lesson to see a boss making sure that everyone was treated like a human being,"" Lansing told Galloway.But while good Playboy victuals filled her stomach, there was still a void. ""I was extraordinarily uncomfortable being an actress,"" she said in the phone interview. ""First of all, I had no talent. Worse than having no talent — because you could always learn to act — was the pain of pretending to be someone other than yourself. I found it very difficult.""So she did a self-analysis. She had a good sense of story. An English major who always loved to read, she'd made suggestions on script changes when a problem arose on the set of ""Loving.""""I guess the suggestion was a good one,"" she said, because they used it. Her producer on that film, Ray Wagner, saw her uncanny script judgment on the set. He offered her a job with his company as a part-time script reader, and Sherry jumped at it.""I will be forever grateful to Ray,"" she said. ""I had a tiny office where I could read scripts. I felt I was home. I loved reading scripts. I love writing the synopsis. I loved giving my opinion. Those were the happiest days of my life.""As important, it provided an alternate view of screenplays. Previously, all she'd been exposed to were shooting scripts, the supposedly finished product. Here she saw them in raw form and learned important lessons on how a screenplay was developed, from manuscript to screen.She was so good that within six months Wagner hired her full time; 18 months she later was hired away by Leonard Stern Associates, a major TV producer; and in 1975 was named executive story editor at MGM.Lansing immediately made changes in the way the system operates. Unlike her predecessors, she asked her subordinates for their opinions. Lansing concedes that ""it's not a technique to use when you feel uncomfortable as an executive.""""This is who I am,"" she explained. ""I like to hear what other people have to say. Sometimes it colors my opinion. Sometimes it makes me feel stronger about what I'd thought. I love input.""I've gone through systems with many bosses who rule by fear, who pit people against each other. I can't exist in that kind of environment. I can only exist in an environment where there are no stupid ideas, and where everyone is comfortable and can say what they want.""When her boss was hired at Columbia, he asked her to come with him and named her, in November 1977, his vice president of production. In this high-level post she oversaw such major films as ""The China Syndrome"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer.""Such was her success that she fielded numerous offers from competitors, turning almost all of them down. In January 1980, she succumbed to an offer from Fox. Here she OK'd (greenlit in Hollywood parlance) ""Quest for Fire,"" ""Cannonball Run,"" ""Zorro: The Gay Blade,"" the Al Pacino vehicle ""Author! Author!"" and ""The Verdict"" — all the while dealing with temperamental, now-I'm-in-the-movie-now-I'm-not talent.It was a difficult, politics-filled job, and Lansing decided that she wanted to go back to basics. So she partnered with producer Stanley Jaffe and opened an office (or, again in Hollywood-speak, set up a shingle) at Paramount.Her new job as producer required her to be on-set virtually full time. Not only was she happy to be far from office politics, she was equally pleased because she was learning again: about camera angles and lenses and how scenes are set up.Sadly, her joy was mitigated by early flops. At one point, believing he was helping, her friend Michael Ovitz, then a powerful agent, offered to set the pair up with a commercial Eddie Murphy comedy.But that wasn't the kind of movie Lansing wanted to make. She wanted to make films that would change the world, that led to discussions. ""You have to be true to yourself,"" she said. ""If we failed at a movie we didn't believe in, that would be awful. And we believed we had the thing you need in any career: resiliency.""Resiliency won. Hit after hit followed: ""Fatal Attraction,"" ""The Accused,"" ""Black Rain"" and ""School Ties.""In March 1991, Jaffe left to become president of Paramount Communications, and in November of 1992 he hired his former partner as chair and CEO of Paramount Pictures. A wise choice, as it turned out. One of her first films: ""Forrest Gump.""She also had enough faith in her tastes that she got Paramount a half interest in ""Titanic"" while other studios were running away because of the film's escalating cost overruns. ""Titanic"" became the second-highest grossing film of all time, earning almost $2.2 billion, and ""Gump"" was no slouch either, finishing with roughly $680 million in ticket sales.Lansing kept her head on straight by weekly lunches with girlfriends and tried to see new releases at a local theater rather than at glamorous premieres.But the business changed — and not for the better in her view. When she'd first started, it was the film that mattered. Now it was the marketing. Studios were looking for franchises and tent-pole movies, not adult fare. Lost in the shuffle were the kinds of movies she wanted to make.She resigned in 2004 and decided to devote her energies to charities, particularly in finding a cure for cancer, from which her mother had died when she was just 63. In 2005, she started the Sherry Lansing Foundation to help find a cure. In addition, she was named a regent of the University of California, and sits on the board of a number of charities ranging from the American Red Cross to the Carter Center.Her charitable activities have earned her numerous awards, most notably the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, presented to her by Tom Cruise at the 2007 Academy Awards.First woman to head a Hollywood studio.Overcame: resistance from industry unused to women bosses.Lesson: If you build trust, you can win people over.""As an executive, you have to do things that are financially responsible. But if the filmmakers see you as a suit, that you only care about money, they're not going to trust you. I made it a point to let the producers, the directors, the actors know that I was on their side and that all I wanted to do was make good movies.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Nina Tassler Used An Outsider's Insight To Succeed At CBSSupermodel Kathy Ireland Became A Role Model For MogulsFashion's Maureen Chiquet Landed Big Roles By Accepting Small OnesRuth Handler And Her Barbie Refashioned Mattel And The Toy Industry

73,MGM,"Wynn Resorts (WYNN) broke out Friday as casino stocks rallied on news that Macau gaming revenue rose 20% in August, despite the city getting hit by a typhoon during the month.Macau's casinos brought in $2.82 billion, or 22.7 billion patacas, in revenue for the month, according to Reuters. That marks the 13th straight month of growth, but a sequential slowdown from the July's year-over-year gain of 29.2%. Macau's gaming revenue has been recovering after slipping in recent years due to crackdowns on money laundering and corruption. Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal.Shares of Wynn Resorts closed 3.2% higher at 143.42 on the stock market today, hitting the highest level since March 2015. That cleared a 139.77 entry point out of a two-month flat base.Several other Macau-exposed casino giants enjoyed more-modest gains Friday as they begin building the right side of their own flat-base consolidations.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 1.1% to finish at 62.87, closing on a 66.32 buy point. The stock cleared its 50-day moving average on Thursday. Last month Sands fell to around the June 1 breakout buy point of the prior consolidation.MGM Resorts International (MGM) rose 0.8% to 33.21 after definitively moving above its 50-day line on Thursday. MGM has a 34.63 buy point in a consolidation going back to July 25.  MGM is less exposed to Macau than Wynn and Sands, though it's opening a new resort in the Chinese gaming enclave soon.Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) advanced 1.1% to 22.20, also after retaking its 50-day in the prior session. The Hong Kong-domiciled casino operator has a 24.04 buy point.According to the Guardian, Typhoon Hato killed eight people in Macau, hitting southern China late in the month and cutting power in Macau's casinos. The storm was reportedly the strongest to hit the area in over half a century.The Leisure-Gaming/Equipment group is No. 8 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks. MGM Resorts is rated No. 1 in the gaming group, boasting a 96 Composite Rating. Sands has a CR of 92 while Wynn is at 91. All-time winning stocks often have Composite Ratings of 95 to a best-possible 99 near the start of big price moves.Several U.S.-focused casino operators also faring well, including Boyd Gaming (BYD), Eldorado Resorts (ERI), Churchill Downs (CHDN) and Monarch Casino & Resort (MCRI).RELATED:As Macau Rebounds, Casinos Eye This Next Possible Gaming Hot SpotMacau July Gaming Revenue Booms, But It's A Push On Wall Street

74,MGM,"The S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials are all near record highs. So where are the big winners?XApple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) sold off last week to drop below recent buy points, with Apple undercutting its 50-day moving average as well. Nvidia (NVDA) got off to a strong start, but has pared much of its gains. Meanwhile, many ""breakouts"" are like Alibaba (BABA), creeping into buy zones but just stalling or pulling back. All of that suggests that the risk-reward for investors isn't great.Using pattern recognition via IBD's Marketsmith, as of Friday there were 75 recent breakouts of stocks trading at least $15 million worth of shares a day, with current Composite Ratings of 90 or better. That doesn't include every breakout: Apple's Composite Rating was above 90 until its recent sell-off. Tesla now has a 77 CR, though that's in part due to a lack of profits. Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) have decent but not great fundamental and technical readings. But still, this is a fairly large list to study.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.Of those 75 recent breakouts, just 14 were more than 5% past the entry point as of Friday's closing bell, making them extended. Most are just out of range. The biggest winner is RV and towables maker Winnebago (WGO), with a 13.7% advance through Friday, taking on a further gain Monday morning. There are several auto parts firms in the mix. A few chip gear makers are the only tech representatives.Meanwhile, dozens are like Alibaba, SAP (SAP), Square (SQ), Amgen (AMGN) — nudging out to buy zones, stalling out and sometimes briefly undercutting their entry areas. Alibaba and Square fell in Monday morning trading to below its ascending base buy point.Some of these breakouts have come in light or lackluster volume, suggesting a lack of institutional support. Unless you bought right at or just above buy point, there's good chance you're down.Boeing (BA) and chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN) are Sept. 15 breakouts that have advanced to near the high end of their 5% buy zones. Maybe Boeing and TI are on their way to be big gains.On the other hand, some stocks such as Nvidia and Universal Display (OLED), have made big initial moves but then pulled back.Nvidia broke out on Sept. 15. In the next session, the graphics and AI chipmaker rose as high as 9.5% above the buy point. But shares have fallen for the past four days, and are now just 2.5% over the entry.Universal Display, a maker of parts and tech for OLED screens as those next-generation displays are being used in high-end TVs, Samsung handsets and the upcoming Apple iPhone X, was 13.6% above its double-bottom entry Tuesday intraday. But thanks to three days of selling, Universal Display is now just 3.8% over the buy point. You don't want to see a 10%-plus winner roundtrip to the buy point.Nvidia and Universal Display fell more than 2% shortly in Monday morning trade, with both stocks undercutting their recent buy points.Meanwhile, 17 of the 75 recent breakouts were below their buy points as of Friday. Some are just below their entries. But Proofpoint (PFPT), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Apple iPhone chipmaker Skyworks (SWKS) fell so far that those buy points are now invalid.Because of the current 90+ Composite Rating screen, the number of underwater or failed breakouts may be higher. Apple and Tesla are definitely below their buy points but technically not quite failed breakouts, though Apple's above-average volume tumble through its 10-week line gave an additional reason for investors to cut losses. Apple fell 0.8% Monday morning while Tesla rose 0.5%.Oracle (ORCL), with its heavy-volume plunge below its buy point and 50-day line after issuing weak guidance, is a failed breakout.If the market picks up, with even a modest uptrend, you might see stocks that are hovering at or above buy points take off. On the other hand, a market slide, even modest, would likely push many more breakouts underwater.Investors need to recognize the current landscape, despite the market direction being ""confirmed uptrend."" There are stocks that are working, but big winners are scarce. Pay close attention to your portfolio as well as the major averages and leading stocks.RELATED:The Big Picture: Small Caps Up; Apple's Stock TumblesNvidia Stock Shaken On Report Tesla Is Developing Chips With AMDFacebook Stock Is At A Make-Or-Break Moment; Here's WhyThis Defense Giant Just Broke Out; These 2 Rivals Are Near BuysHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

The net number of funds selling Apple (151 selling minus 85 buying) was 66.Mastercard (MA) had the second-most net sellers (48), followed by NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) (45) and biotech giant Amgen (AMGN) (30).Despite the number of sellers, each of those stocks continues to show strength, and Amgen is testing a new potential buy zone. On Monday, Amgen jumped past a 182.70 entry in heavy volume.

82,MGM,"Shares of big Macau casino stocks like Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM) were little changed Tuesday morning after July gaming revenue from the world's biggest gambling hub came in above forecasts.XGaming revenue for Macau, a special administrative region of China and the only place there where gambling is legal, jumped 29.2%, marking the best growth so far this year and the fourth straight month of acceleration. That was better than views for a 26% gain, according to Bloomberg.Las Vegas Sands fell 0.6% to 61.23 in the stock market today, as it moves through a flat base. Wynn, also in a short flat base, fell 1% to 128. Both Sands and Wynn are trading modestly below their 50-day moving averages.MGM Resorts sank 1.6% to 32.41, its fifth straight loss, and falling below its 50-day line. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) fell 1 cent  to 20.19, extending its losing streak to six sessions as it hits three-month lows.IBD'S TAKE: Despite a lukewarm quarter, analysts still like MGM Resorts International's chances in Las Vegas, where it is more exposed than rivals.Macau's VIP gaming sales have been on the mend following a crackdown on the industry from Beijing, which is worried about cash leaving China's borders. But the risk of new restrictions in the area is never far away.The monthly results also follow mixed earnings from the casino sector. Shares of Wynn were rattled over concerns about mass-market gaming revenue in Macau.

84,MGM,"Casino-and-resort giants MGM Resorts International (MGM), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) and Boyd Gaming (BYD) all report second-quarter earnings this week.XThe results come as Las Vegas evolves into a convention city rather than just a gaming one, and appears ready to benefit from a pickup in travel demand in a solid U.S. economy.Meanwhile, Macau, the world's largest gambling hub, has turned out better gaming revenue in recent months, although not always meeting expectations. But the Chinese special administrative region's lucrative, rebounding VIP gaming segment could face more difficult growth prospects later in the year, when compared with that period in 2016. And the area always remains subject to tighter restrictions from China.As a group, casino stocks staged a 21% run in 2016, and climbed about 9% over the past 8 weeks. That allowed the group to maintain a top 20 ranking among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD, despite the fact that many top stocks in the group were basing. On Tuesday, the group held a strong No. 17 ranking among industries.Estimates: Late Tuesday, Wall Street expects EPS of $1.09, up 2%, on revenue of $1.45 billion, up 37%, according to Zacks Investment Research.Stock: Shares were down 0.2% intraday at 138.31 in the stock market today.Barclays analyst Felicia Hendrix wrote in a research note in June that Wynn was among the biggest gainers from VIP growth in Macau, likely helped by new junket rooms at Wynn Macau. The company is also stepping up attempts to engage mass-market gamblers at Wynn Palace, which Hendrix said had become much busier compared to its opening last summer.Wynn Palace has added on dining options that appeal more to Chinese customers, she wrote, but added that the property was ""still surrounded by construction sites, which somewhat discourages traffic into the property.""Estimates: Las Vegas Sands, which reports Wednesday, is seen growing EPS by 17% to 61 cents, as revenue increases 14% to $3.019 billion.Stock: Shares fell 0.6% to 62.32, retreating from the top of a buy range above a 59.95 cup-with-handle buy point. The chase zone maxes out at 62.95.The company, which gets the vast majority of its revenue in Asia, is trying to expand its VIP business and nongaming sales in Macau.""We continue to believe that LVS is the best positioned for the long term as the mass market should replace VIP as the growth engine,"" Hendrix said. ""New infrastructure is likely to benefit LVS the most as it has the highest inventory of hotel rooms in Macau and a wide variety of nongaming offerings.""In addition, properties like Sands Cotai Central and the Parisian Macao, Zacks said in a note, aren't exclusively gaming facilities and could bring in more money from meetings, conventions, exhibitions and other events.Estimates: On Thursday, Wall Street expects EPS of 29 cents, up 12%, on revenue of $2.659 billion, a 17% increase.Stock: Shares rose 0.25% to 34.08, extended above buy range.Among the big casino players, MGM is the most exposed to Las Vegas and has been the least exposed to Macau. But the company is seen as a leader in Las Vegas' meetings and conventions business.Las Vegas will also be getting a new NFL team — the Oakland Raiders are set to begin playing in a new stadium there in 2020 — and a new highway connecting the city to Phoenix in the years to come.Big hotel-room additions along the Las Vegas Strip in the next few years are also unlikely, Gabelli analyst Adam Trivison said in an IBD story in May, making for an easier competitive landscape. The company also plans to open a new location on Macau's Cotai Strip and has expanded in smaller U.S. cities as well.Estimates: Wall Street expects the company, which reports Thursday and operates casino-resorts in Asia, to report EPS of 20 cents, up from 5 cents a year ago, with revenue climbing 13% to $1.211 billion.Stock: Shares slipped 2.1% to 21.67, working their way through a flat base with a 24.04 buy point.Estimates: On Thursday, EPS is expected to jump 81% to 29 cents, with revenue up 10% to $598 million.Stock: Shares fell 0.1% to 26.17, just below a 26.30 buy point.RELATED:Here's Why Casino Stocks Tumbled On A Trial In MacauCasino Stocks Retreat On Soft June Macau Gaming Revenue

85,MGM,"The election of a Republican president and both houses of Congress that triggered a Trump Bump in stocks — especially those that could benefit from corporate tax reform, financial industry deregulation and infrastructure spending — was nine months ago. But Karen Hiatt, lead manager of $951.8 million AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund (PGWAX), is already hedging bets based on those policy initiatives as well as the fund's usual fundamental criteria.X""That is accurate,"" Hiatt said. ""The portfolio would benefit from passing of legislative initiatives given the resulting lift to earnings growth in several holdings — but outperformance is not reliant on it.""Two areas where her fund is looking for more opportunities are the consumer discretionary and technology sectors. ""Our goal is to uncover stocks with earnings growth that exceeds the market — we are finding more interesting ideas in consumer discretionary and tech that fulfill that goal,"" she said.Individual investors and fund shareholders can benefit from insight into the fund's moves. The fund's 16.00% average annual gain over the five years going into Wednesday topped the S&P 500's 14.80% as well as 79% of the fund's large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The large-cap growth funds as a group averaged a 14.40% yearly gain.MGM Resorts International (MGM) is a consumer discretionary stock in which the fund started its current stake in February 2017 and has enlarged its position since then. A key attraction for Hiatt and co-manager Raphael Edelman is an expected surge in MGM revenue when its Cotai casino opens in Macau. That's forecast for the second half of this year.MGM has also been selling properties and leasing them back from asset manager MGM Growth Properties (MGP). That arrangement lets MGM Resorts focus on its core strengths, while retaining revenues from the properties, Hiatt says.The fund boosted its stake in Amazon.com (AMZN) in Q1 after having increased its position in Q2 and Q3 2016, then trimming in Q4.The e-commerce titan's earnings per share has slowed for four straight quarters, slumping from 992% in the first quarter of 2016 to 38% in Q1 2017. But Hiatt sees no problem. The decline in earnings stems from Amazon's investments in various businesses. ""The Amazon story is really about revenue opportunities that they create for themselves,"" she said. ""We have seen market share shift toward Amazon, away from other retailers. We've seen their success in Web Services, which is very high margin.""Those are reasons why the stock has climbed despite the EPS growth slowdown. ""Investors give them a pass on (near-term) earnings growth, knowing they have investments that are necessary for future growth,"" Hiatt said.Applied Materials (AMAT) is another name in which the fund has been building its position. EPS has grown at a triple-digit pace for three quarters in a row. The company has benefited from several trends, she says. It has benefited from the increased complexity of semiconductor manufacturing. And it benefits from its leadership role in OLED technology — organic light emitting diode technology — where demand has risen.Additional drivers are the Internet of Things, the ongoing rise of Big Data and the proliferation of smartphones and social media. ""All require more semiconductors,"" Hiatt said. ""So Applied Materials not only has earnings upside but also valuation upside that the market has not yet appreciated,"" she added.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials' average EPS growth was 139% in the past three quarters. You can check out more of Applied's fundamental and technical strengths in IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Broadcom (AVGO) is yet another stock in which the fund has built its stake. ""Broadcom fits the thesis of consolidation in the semiconductor space, but they have also diversified their exposure within semiconductors by acquiring other chipmakers,"" Hiatt said. Avago Technologies acquired Broadcom, keeping the latter's name. Another key takeover last year was of Brocade Communications Systems. Hiatt said, ""They acquire companies, divest the ones that don't fit their model, then leverage their own distribution to drive synergies with the remaining businesses.""In other sectors, animal medicine maker Zoetis (ZTS) is a relative newcomer to the portfolio, which has ramped up its stake in the stock. ""This is an animal health business that was spun off from Pfizer (in 2013),"" Hiatt said. ""It gave Zoetis the opportunity to focus on innovation. That can create value, and we believe that's happening here.""The company has a high corporate tax rate, ""so if any corporate tax (reform) comes through (Congress), that would be an added bonus,"" Hiatt said.RELATED:AllianzGI Fund's Bets On Regional Banks Are Paying OffWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Find And Track The Best Mutual Funds

100,MGM,"The major market indexes opened modestly higher early Monday ahead of the market's early 1:00 pm ET close. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average advanced more than 0.5% each on the strength in financials. However, the tech-heavy Nasdaq quickly pared its gains to 0.3%. The stock market will be closed on Tuesday, the Fourth of July.XWhile China and Europe received early boosts from strong manufacturing growth readings, the data on U.S. manufacturing was mixed.Growth slowed more than expected in June, according to researcher Markit, which showed its Purchasing Managers Index slipped to 52, down from 52.7 in May. Economist consensus had projected a slight slowing to 52.2.A second manufacturing gauge, from the Institute of Supply Management, showed a sharp increase. Its ISM manufacturing index jumped to 57.8, up from 54.9 in May, blasting past consensus views of 55.1 to its higher market since August of 2014.Among the Dow industrials, Disney (DIS) paced the advancers with a 2% rise, while financial components Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) rose over 1.3% apiece.  Disney shares gained following unconfirmed news reports that Verizon (VZ) may be contemplating a House of Mouse takeover bid.Casino operators fell across the board in the stock market today after Macau June casino revenue slightly missed expectations, coming in at 26.9% vs. the 30% estimate. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO) dropped 3.3%, while MGM Resorts (MGM) traded down 0.3% (MGM). Melco was testing support at its 50-day line, while MGM gave up that support level on Friday after Deutsche Bank trimmed its forecasts on the casino operator.Among leading stocks, Tesla (TSLA) powered up nearly 2% after CEO Elon Musk tweeted about early production progress on the Model 3 sedan.

101,MGM,"The Nasdaq composite edged down as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and other big techs remained under pressure. The S&P 500 index closed below its 50-day moving average on Thursday but moved higher Friday. Tesla (TSLA) crashed amid a variety of news that raised concerns, while auto sales slumped overall. Job growth was solid amid a variety of upbeat June economic data.XThe Nasdaq rose 0.2% for the week after hitting its lowest levels since May 19. The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day on Thursda but rallied for a 0.1% weekly gain. The Dow industrials, buoyed by financial components, hit an all-time high Monday and was closed the week up 0.3%, even as General Electric (GE) and Verizon (VZ) dived to 21-month lows. Tesla plunged amid weak Q2 deliveries, Model 3 news and a less-than-stellar safety rating. The latest Federal Reserve and European Central Bank meeting minutes indicated that policymakers are moving toward tightening policy, weighing on stocks and lifting global bond yields.The U.S. added 222,000 jobs in June, more than 170,000 expected, while April and May payrolls were revised higher. The jobless rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.4% as more people looked for work. Average hourly wages advanced 0.2%, a little less than expected. Meanwhile, the ISM manufacturing index for June rose to the best in years while the ISM nonmanufacturing gauge showed still-strong expansion.For the second straight week, U.S. investors paid more attention to the European Central Bank than to the Federal Reserve. Both central banks released minutes from their June meetings.Economists interpreted the Fed minutes as indicating a bit more uncertainty about whether inflation will rebound and, thus, about the Fed's rate trajectory. Still, absent a surprise, the Fed seems likely to announce in September that it will gradually scale back its $4.5 trillion balance sheet, inflated with Treasury and mortgage bonds purchased in response to the financial crisis.The ECB's policy signals have been jarring because they represent a pretty dramatic, if gradual, potential change from the central bank's long-running asset-purchase program.ECB President Mario Draghi indicated last week that the eurozone monetary authority could begin scaling back its asset buys, which economists now expect to happen by early 2018. The ECB minutes from the June 7-8 meeting revealed that policymakers discussed dropping language from future meeting statements saying that they're prepared to reverse course and increases asset purchases if conditions demand.Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the closely watched Model 3 has passed all regulatory inspections, signaling that production will start Friday and announcing a ""handover party"" on July 28 for the first 30 customers. He predicted a rapid ramp up in production. Late Monday, the electric car maker announced that its second-quarter deliveries climbed 53%, but were at the low end of expectations. Goldman Sachs, reiterating a sell rating, cut its price target to 180 from 190, while several other analysts noted some concerns with Tesla's data and outlook. Meanwhile, Tesla's Model S failed to get the IIHS' top safety rating. Tesla stock suffered its worst weekly loss in 17 months.U.S. auto sales fell 2.9% in June to a 16.4 million rate and are now down 2.1% so far this year. General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) saw sales drop 5%, 5% and 7% respectively year over year, while Toyota Motor (TM), Nissan (NSANY) and Honda Motor (HMC) grew sales modestly. Overall, the industry posted its sixth straight month of falling or flat sales, despite higher use of incentives. Consumers continued to spurn the car segment for SUVs, crossovers and trucks. Sales of new vehicles have slowed this year as freshly off-lease vehicles have flooded the market. Even the red-hot SUV segment is starting to show softness. June sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.4 million, the lowest rate of the year.An eight-day win streak came to sharp end on Wednesday, while even a sharp drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories couldn't give prices much of a boost.

The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 6.3 million barrels last week vs. analyst expectations for a 2.3 million barrel draw. Gasoline supplies dropped by 3.7 million barrels, also more than expected. But domestic crude production bounced back to 9.34 million barrels per day after falling to 9.25 million BPD in the prior week.

About 75% of the layoffs will be outside the U.S. Microsoft is shifting its business from on-premises software for PCs and servers to cloud-based software subscriptions for products like Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft said the reorganization is more about better using its resources than about cost-cutting.Samsung and Alibaba (BABA) are the latest companies entering the increasingly crowded market for voice-activated smart speakers, which is now led by Amazon.com's Echo devices. Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba announced its Tmall Genie X1, which has voice controls for online shopping, playing music, getting news and weather, and other functions. The Mandarin-language Genie will be much cheaper than the Amazon Echo and especially the upcoming Apple HomePod. Alibaba rival JD.com (JD) already has a smart speaker on the market. Samsung is working on a device code-named Vega. Other Chinese firms entering the space include search engine Baidu (BIDU) as well as gaming and messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY).Samsung announced huge preliminary second-quarter profit Friday, predicting operating earnings of $12.1 billion, which suggests the Korean electronics giant will top Apple's quarterly profit. That's was likely largely due to booming memory chips, but also possibly good sales for the Samsung Galaxy 8 smartphone.Yum China (YUMC) topped earnings but fell short on sales. The spin-off and China licensee of Yum Brands (YUM), which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, highlighted its mobile and delivery sales, which have become more important to attracting tech-savvy, convenience-seeking diners. Mobile payments surpassed 40% of sales during the quarter; delivery made up 13%. Yum China also said it had acquired a controlling interest in the holding company of the delivery service Daojia.

"
107,MGM,"Las Vegas is getting an NFL team, gaming revenue is returning to Macau, and economic improvements in both China and the U.S. are bringing people back to the casino table.For a sprawling resort operator like MGM Resorts International (MGM), whose hotels, convention spaces and casinos line the streets Macau, Vegas, and increasingly in other U.S. cities, things could be worse.""Usually when you see those kinds of factors taking place, that bodes well for our industry as a whole,"" MGM Chief Financial Officer Dan D'Arrigo told Investor's Business Daily.In Las Vegas, MGM has more exposure in the city than any other rival. Thus, the company stands to gain as more businesses attend conventions, gamers attend ""League of Legends"" tournaments, tourists plot their buffet strategy and people come from L.A. to party or blow their savings from behind poker sunglasses.""MGM is the best positioned operator to capture the growing trends in Las Vegas and faces many growth catalysts over the next few years that should generate stock price appreciation,"" Barclays analyst Felicia Hendrix said in a recent note to clients.Those catalysts were likely on display when the company reported strong first-quarter earnings last month. It was helped by Vegas, Macau, the December opening of MGM National Harbor outside Washington, D.C., and the company's moves to bring Atlantic City, N.J.-based Borgata, under its umbrella. Management said it remained optimistic about the ""market's recent uptick"" in lucrative VIP gaming.And in Macau, now the world's biggest gambling hot spot and the only place in China where it's legal, MGM plans to open a location this year on the casino-gilded Cotai Strip, its second in the region. The extra location, loaded with some 1,400 hotel rooms as well as spas and meeting spaces, would help the company offset some of the regulatory crackdown there, analysts say.""There is a VIP rally underway in Macau,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz told IBD.The casino glare tends to divert attention from an ongoing shift in Las Vegas' economy on which MGM has capitalized. That is the evolution away from the casino business toward hospitality, making the city one of the premiere destinations for conventions.MGM already controls much of the Las Vegas Strip. Gabelli & Co. estimated in an October research report that MGM and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) owned 70% of hotel rooms there and accounted for the same slice of the area's net sales. Rivals Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and others control the rest, Gabelli said.""MGM has pulled away as a clear leader in the (meetings and conventions) category with its expansion at Mandalay Bay and forthcoming expansion of Aria,"" Gabelli analyst Adam Trivison wrote in the report, referring to two of the company's casino resort properties. The company's larger operations dedicated to bringing in group businesses have helped on that front, he said in an interview with IBD.And in March, NFL owners OK'd the Oakland Raiders' plans to move to Las Vegas, where the team is set to begin playing in a new $1.9 billion stadium in 2020. Bringing a big sports franchise could shore up business across the city on slower weekends and during the holidays, Trivison said.But there's a particular benefit for MGM: Plans, as of now, would put the stadium along I-15 — right across from MGM's Mandalay Bay Resort.""Everyone wins,"" Trivison wrote in another recent research note, ""especially MGM.""A new highway linking Las Vegas and Phoenix, Interstate 11, could also decongest travel between the two expanding cities once complete. The two metro areas had been the largest adjacent U.S. cities not connected by freeway, and this move could bring more gamblers to Vegas from the southeast. Construction is still in the early phases.Meanwhile, Trivison estimates, there won't be any significant new hotel-room additions to the Las Vegas Strip for potentially three years, keeping new competition at bay for MGM and giving them more control over prices.IBD'S TAKE: In late April, MGM broke out of a flat base that lasted nearly five months and is now hovering in a buy range in the low 30s. MGM has a highest-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99 and is the top-ranked stock in the Leisure-Gaming Equipment sector.The shoring up of fundamentals comes as the industry, once populated by an array of smaller casino operators, has consolidated over the years. Along the way, it has also taken a more sophisticated, analytics-oriented approach to measuring business trends.MGM Resorts International — the product of a sandwiching-together of the legacy MGM business, Mirage and Mandalay — is no exception. The company has gotten better at watching costs and invested in technology that can gauge customer demand and labor needs.MGM's profit growth plan has helped. Under that plan, begun in mid-2015, the company carried out scores of initiatives, including tying its businesses together. It even made sure more of its properties all carried the same kinds of towels.""There was a view that the company could be improved,"" Katz said. ""They were leaving money on the table.""Even as MGM works to keep Wall Street happy, the industry faces a bigger, generational problem: how to keep the younger people coming into Vegas happy as well amid concerns they're not yet interested in gambling.D'Arrigo says Baby Boomers are still MGM's ""bread and butter"" customer. While he said millennials weren't shy about buying bottle service and dropping thousands at a venue in Vegas, they were more interested in the social component of gaming.""We've seen that more with the millennials than we do them sitting down at a three-reel slot machine at video poker,"" he said.The gaming industry, including MGM, has also begun tinkering with technology that allows people to gamble away from the casino floor, perhaps by the pool but not off-premise completely.Seeking to tap the growing popularity of e-sports, MGM's Mandalay Bay Events Center last year also hosted a ""League of Legends"" tournament. It also plans to host Evo 2017 World Finals, the fighting-game tournament, in July. And the company plans to turn a nightclub at its Luxor property into an e-Sports arena, potentially next year.The industry also is experimenting with so-called ""skill-based"" games, first approved in the U.S. last year. Those games function like the shooters or pinball games found on consoles or at arcades, except a player places a bet and gets paid according to how well they do.Trivison says it could take time before the industry develops games that effectively juggle the length of a turn at a game, payout and profitability. And he said it would be difficult to create something as profitable as the slot-heavy regional casinos of decades past.""What business can you think of where people will literally come into your place and drop money into a machine and walk out?"" Trivison said.MGM also has widened its exposure to parts of the U.S. outside of Vegas — with locations like MGM Grand Detroit and National Harbor. The company also plans to open a location in Springfield, Mass., in the second half of next year.Sales from those locations are unlikely to match those in Vegas, and newer, smaller markets can be harder for a casino operator to predict, Telsey's Katz says. Even as Detroit and Springfield pick up the pieces after years of struggle, Katz says locations in smaller cities can turn customers on to MGM's bigger resorts in Las Vegas.That may be helpful, since China is seeking to to curb the flow of cash from its borders. Ultimately, Macau still wields considerable influence over shares of MGM and rivals there — Wynn, LVS and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO).In recent years, China has accused junket operators, the middlemen who loan VIPs money to bypass cash the nation's cash limits, of money laundering. Macau authorities have also set limits on daily ATM cash withdrawals for China UnionPay cardholders — a big source of spending in the gaming hub — and recently said it would begin using facial recognition technology to verify the identities of those cardholders.After concerns VIPs would be scared away, business has picked up. But regulations in China remain hard to predict.""You can never relax about Macau,"" Katz said.MGM shares were up nearly 1% to 31.25 on Friday.

110,MGM,"Shares of Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and other casino operators that do business in Macau dropped Friday on weak tourism trends reported so far during China's National Day ""Golden Week"" holiday, which is typically a massive week for travel in the nation.XThe figures, if they hold, would run against more bullish expectations for casinos during the holiday, which this year runs from Oct. 1 through Oct. 8 — a day longer than in years past.That extra day had prompted some observers to dub this year's holiday ""Super Golden Week,"" and hopes were further lifted earlier this month, when Macau reported better-than-expected September gaming revenue.According to Bloomberg, tourist arrivals from mainland China were down 1.1% in the holiday's first five days. Over that time a year earlier, arrivals from China tourists were up 7.3%.The Macau Government Tourism Office had expected a 5% increase in visits during the holiday this year, according to a Barclays research note published this week.

The jobless rate fell to 4.2%, the lowest since early 2001, while average hourly wage gains jumped to 2.9%, matching the best gain since 2009. Other data earlier in the week also pointed to an economy that seems to finally be breaking out of its eight-year run of slow growth, though some of the strength may reflect a boost from hurricane recovery efforts. The Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey index jumped to a 13-year high of 60.8, far above the 50 neutral mark.

113,MGM,"Movie producer Merian Cooper was a legend in Hollywood. He wrote and directed the 1933 classic film ""King Kong,"" arranged Katharine Hepburn's screen test, got David O. Selznick his first job as head producer, teamed Fred Astaire with Ginger Rogers, partnered with director John Ford to make John Wayne a star, and pioneered Technicolor.But it was his off-the-set activities that could have been turned into a blockbuster: He was nearly killed by a leopard in the jungles of Thailand, barely escaped being captured by pirates, and was a fighter-bomber pilot who was shot down and taken prisoner twice.""Coop was ready to go anywhere, anytime and accept any challenge,"" Wheeler Winston Dixon, professor of film studies at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, told IBD. ""No matter what life or business fortunes dealt him, he remained an optimist and never lost his zest for life.""Cooper (1893-1973) was born in Jacksonville, Fla. When he was 6, he had Paul du Chaillu's ""Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa"" read to him and decided he would become an explorer.First though, his father, a prominent lawyer, arranged an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in 1911. In his senior year, however, Cooper was kicked out for hard partying and too strongly advocating air power.In 1915, he became a newspaper reporter, then joined the Georgia National Guard to hunt the Mexican bandit and revolutionary Pancho Villa along the border, though Villa always eluded them.Back in Georgia, Cooper graduated first in his aeronautics class of 150 and in 1918 became a pilot in the Army Air Services, flying an American DH-4 Liberty. On Sept. 26, the Meuse-Argonne offensive began with the aerial bombing of enemy positions, but on the way back, the seven planes in Cooper's group were attacked by a dozen German Fokkers and Cooper's gunner-bomber Edmund Leonard was wounded and the plane caught fire. Cooper crash-landed near a German camp, where a doctor treated him for burns and Leonard for his wound.After the war, Cooper was promoted to captain and headed the division delivering aid to a newly independent Poland from Herbert Hoover's American Food Administration. In 1920, he recruited American volunteers to create a squadron to defend Poland from the first Russian effort to export its revolution. After 70 combat missions he was shot down in July and spent nine months in a prisoner-of-war camp before escaping to Latvia through a swamp.Back in the U.S. in 1921, he was assigned by a magazine to write articles about a sea voyage. He teamed with a friend from the Poland campaign, cinematographer Ernest Schoedsack, and they encountered headhunters in the Solomon Islands, met the charismatic future emperor, Haile Selassie, in Ethiopia, and got out of a trap set by pirates off Yemen.In 1924, Cooper, and Schoedsack set off on an expedition to film a migration of 5,000 tribesmen and 50,000 animals across frozen mountains and dangerous rivers in Persia, resulting in the landmark 1925 documentary ""Grass"" and a contract with Paramount Pictures. ""Chang"" in 1927 pioneered wildlife films by showing a Thai family's struggles to survive man-eating tigers and stampeding elephants, combining documentary with staged sequences. After spending a year among fighting tribes in the Sudan, their adaptation of the novel, ""The Four Feathers,"" was released in 1929, but Cooper had become disillusioned by the studio's interference.He returned to his other love, co-founding what would become Pan American Airways in 1927. The company lined up mail delivery monopolies for Latin America using seaplanes that could carry eight passengers. In 1931, it began flying Clippers, which were the epitome of luxurious international air travel.Living in New York City, Cooper spent his free time working on a movie treatment inspired by the gorillas he had seen on one of his trips. One day he looked up to see a plane flying above a skyscraper.""Without any conscious effort of thought I immediately saw in my mind's eye a giant gorilla on top of the building,"" he recalled. Civilization could be symbolized by the ""mightiest building in the world"" and nature personified in the gorilla would be defeated by ""the most modern of weapons, the airplane."" He also began thinking about a ""beauty and the beast"" plot.Paramount showed interest in Cooper's idea in 1931, but Hollywood had been hit hard by the Depression. Selznick had left the studio and come to New York to try to form an independent production company and Cooper introduced him to investors. But Louis B. Mayer of MGM threatened to prevent distribution, so Cooper set up a meeting with David Sarnoff, president of RCA, which owned the RKO studio. Selznick was hired as vice president of production and asked Cooper to be his assistant.In January 1932, Cooper gave Selznick the first draft of the screenplay for ""King Kong,"" the tale of how filmmaker Carl Denham (a thinly disguised Cooper) sails to Skull Island, where prehistoric monsters still live, captures Kong and brings him to New York for exhibition. Robert Armstrong would play Denham and Fay Wray was selected for the role of Ann Darrow, whom Kong is trying to protect when he takes her to the top of the Empire State Building (which had opened in 1931).On a sound stage, and with Schoedsack in the rear cockpit, Cooper would pilot the mock plane on that finally kills Kong. RKO's experimental stop-motion animation would bring all the monsters to life, but help drive the budget to $517,000 (equivalent to $9.5 million now).It was released in March 1933, during the nationwide ""bank holiday"" imposed by President Franklin Roosevelt to check the collapse of the banking system — caused by nervous depositors rushing to withdraw their funds. The economic strife did not deter the public, with 180,000 flocking to theaters in the first week to spend $100,000. In its initial release, the movie brought in $2 million (worth $36 million today). There have been countless remakes (notably ""King Kong"" in 2005), sequels (including ""Kong: Skull Island"" in 2017), parodies, cartoons, comics, books, video games, toys, and theme park rides (a Broadway musical has been announced for 2018). But there would be innumerable legal battles over who owned what rights, which largely prevented Cooper from benefiting."" 'King Kong' had been one of the great gambles in movie history,"" wrote Mark Vaz in ""Living Dangerously: The Adventures of Merian C. Cooper, Creator of King Kong."" ""It beguiled an entire generation and its financial returns marked the turning point for an entire industry that had recently bottomed out, but was back on an economic upswing. … Movie halls became a refuge during the Depression, ushering in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Kong's triumphant creator would be crowned in glory, raising him to the pinnacle of Hollywood power and influence.""Cooper had been named head of production, after Selznick left just before the release of ""Kong."" With an incentive of 20% profit participation, he aimed to lower the overhead per picture by dramatically speeding up production, while signing little-known actresses he thought would be audience magnets.He also began producing John Ford's movies, starting with ""The Lost Patrol"" and ""The Informer.""Cooper had invested in the Technicolor three-strip process and co-founded Pioneer Pictures in 1933. He directed its first full-length feature, ""Becky Sharp,"" in 1935, predicting with incredible prescience, that color would enable motion pictures to continue to attract audiences despite competition from TV, which was still in its infancy.In June 1941, at age 47 and seeing war as inevitable, he enlisted as a colonel in the Army Air Forces, serving as the logistics officer for the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, setting up the airlift of supplies from India to China and acting as chief-of-staff to Gen. Claire Chennault in China, then chief-of-staff for the Fifth Air Force Bomber Command. Cooper, who finished his wartime service as a brigadier general, was on the battleship Missouri when the Japanese surrendered.Returning to Hollywood, in 1946 he partnered with Ford and they went on to make such John Wayne classics as ""Rio Grande,"" ""The Quiet Man,"" ""Fort Apache,"" ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" and ""The Searchers.""""Cooper spent his final two decades pioneering Cinerama and other attempts to create more immersive theatrical experiences and was given an Academy Award for lifetime achievement in 1952,"" said Ivor Dawson, a film historian and president of the Traveling Space Museum. ""And long before man walked on the moon in 1969, this incurable adventurer was dreaming of commercial flights into the final frontier, outer space.""In 1960 Cooper received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — though it got his first name wrong, misspelling it as ""Meriam.""He always saw the glass half-full and if something didn't work out, he moved on and didn't look back.Overcame: Enormous technical challenges to create ""King Kong.""Lesson: When you walk a tightrope, don't look down.""Keep it distant, difficult, and dangerous."" — motto of Merian C.

With Joseph Fath in his fourth year as manager, the fund has outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. so far this year and over the past one and three years respectively.The fund was up 17.46% for 2017 going into Thursday, far outrunning the 7.94% gain for the S&P 500.Fath has done it without resorting to any trick plays. He's of course aware of how last November's election offers ongoing opportunities to companies that can benefit from rising interest rates, a lighter regulatory load and heightened spending on infrastructure, he wrote to shareholders in January.But his investment approach remains largely the same as in the past. ""We believe that disciplined fundamental analysis will enable us to identify high-quality companies with durable growth prospects that are poised to stand out from the broader market,"" he said. ""We continue to favor companies that have more control over their destiny, are positioned to benefit from powerful secular trends, and are using innovation to disrupt less efficient business models and create new ones.""You can see how that strategy is expressed in the fund's top holdings. Among top holdings as of April 30 was Alphabet (GOOGL), up 20% so far this year. Amazon (AMZN), which is an IBD Leaderboard stock, is up 27%. Apple (AAPL), another Leaderboard stock, is up 32%.

134,MGM,"Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) shares jumped Wednesday after Macau announced that overall gaming revenues rose to their best level in more than two years. That comes a day after Nevada reported its strongest take in nearly four years.Macau gross gaming revenue soared 18% vs. a year earlier in February to $2.88 billion, the highest since January 2015, easing fear the China's only legal gambling enclave was losing steam.

136,MGM,"The economy and tourism in Vegas have rebounded, and gross gaming revenues out of global gaming hub Macau were up during the quarter.However, Macau also reported January gaming receipts that were up but weaker than expected, an indication that any rebound in the region could be shaky after Beijing launched an anti-money laundering crackdown that limited how much cash visitors could take into Macau and withdraw from banks there.Meanwhile, Melco Crown Entertainment, which operates casinos in Macau and elsewhere in Asia, reported earnings of 12 cents per share, up from a net loss of 2 cents per share a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters.

139,MGM,"The fight over the border tax has been focused entirely on the impact a 20% tax would have on big importers. Supporters insist that retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Best Buy (BBY) wouldn't really be hurt, because currencies would adjust to neutralize the tax.Yet, while the predicted 25% rise in the dollar isn't certain — it could rise by somewhat less or even more — it's curious that there's been almost no attention paid to the potential impact on the one industry that's likely to bear the brunt of a currency adjustment: U.S. tourism.Tourism Economics estimates that each 10% rise in the dollar causes a 2% decrease in international visitors. On top of that, visitors may shorten their average stay and otherwise limit their spending.International travelers could find that visiting a Disney (DIS) theme park, gambling at an MGM Resorts (MGM) casino, staying at a Marriott (MAR) hotel or shopping at Tiffany (TIF) would be much more expensive.Staying at a Trump International Hotel would be more expensive too, which might influence President Trump's view that the dollar is already ""too strong"" and is ""killing us."" Just how much more expensive would depend on the extent to which reduced travel leads tourism-related industries to lower prices.Another hit would come from increased overseas travel by Americans, who would find that their dollars go much further in London, Paris, Rome and other destination spots around the world and opt against a U.S. vacation.International carriers like United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) may not suffer as much, since more outbound American travelers could ease the pain of fewer U.S.-bound tourists. Similarly, global hotel chains like Marriott may also see additional bookings by Americans abroad. But more domestic-focused businesses won't have such offsets.A major, unilateral increase in the U.S. currency could come at a pretty significant price. International travel added $247 billion to the U.S. economy last year and generated an $88 billion surplus, relative to what Americans spent abroad, according to the U.S. Travel Association's analysis of Commerce Department data. That's down from a $98 billion travel surplus in 2015. It's not clear how much of the narrower surplus was related to a stronger dollar, but there is generally a lag before shifts in currencies affect travel, given advance bookings.The figures include educational tourism — foreign students attending U.S. colleges and universities and generally paying much more than local residents to do so. With a 25% rise in the dollar, the U.S. might not look like quite as an attractive place to study. In 2015, education-related tourism totaled $35.8 billion.""Regular exporters would, under border adjustment, receive a subsidy that would offset the exchange rate impact; but hotel owners presumably wouldn't,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Stan Veuger. ""Or would U.S. taxpayers start subsidizing the vacations of Chinese tourists?""That seems as unlikely as federal government subsidies to let foreign students attend the University of California at Berkeley, he adds.While the impact on tourism has been almost entirely absent from the debate, it could play a bigger role as GOP senators decide whether they can back the House plan. Georgia Sen. David Perdue, former CEO of Dollar General (DG), has already signaled his fierce opposition, meaning just two more GOP defections could kill it.Expect Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who both represent top-five states for foreign travel, to come under heavy lobbying pressure from the tourism industry. Border states Texas and Arizona also are big tourism destinations, with Mexican travelers spending $19.7 billion in the U.S. in 2015.IBD'S TAKE: If the dollar appreciates 20% to 25% against foreign currencies, U.S. investors holding ADRs of foreign equities like Alibaba or international ETFs would take a hit.The projected rise in the dollar would come from already lofty levels. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of advanced-economy currencies, surged 26% from July 2014 to March 2015, hitting the highest level since 2003.On earnings calls in the fall of 2015, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide noted ""lower volumes of inbound international travelers due to the strong dollar,"" while Tiffany said it ""continued to experience a negative effect on foreign tourists spending in the U.S.""While the dollar eased off of those levels for most of 2016, it has strengthened again on expectations for a stronger U.S. economy under Trump.AEI's Veuger also points out that real estate is another ""quasi-exporting"" industry that might feel an impact from the border tax, since foreigners purchase some $100 billion worth of residential properties in a year, about half paid for in cash.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

140,MGM,"Shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) fell Wednesday after Macau reported weaker-than-expected industry gaming revenues in January, suggesting the recovery may be uneven.Macau, China's only legal gambling area and the world's biggest gaming market, said gaming receipts rose 3.1% vs. a year earlier. That's down from an 8% gain in December and analyst estimates for a similar rise.The January figures indicated that the Chinese New Year holidays, which began late last month, will not be as big of a boon as hoped.Wynn Resorts fell 3.5% to close at 97.86 on the stock market today. Las Vegas Sands slid 1.6% to 51.75. MGM Resorts, which has less Macau exposure that Sands and Wynn, lost 0.8% to 28.56. Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), which is domiciled in Hong Kong, retreated 2.8% to 16.37.IBD'S TAKE: Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands both get more than half of their revenue from Macau, China's lone gambling enclave. Apple, Boeing and GM are among other U.S. global giants exposed to a potential China-Trump trade war.Wynn Resorts missed earnings estimates late on Jan. 26, but shares rose the next day on strong revenue for its recently opened Wynn Palace casino. Las Vegas Sands also reported below-forecast earnings last month; it too opened a Macau resort late last year, the Parisian. Both are designed to appeal to families in addition to the traditional focus on VIP gamblers. But those new casinos got much of their early revenue via cannibalizing existing casino activity.MGM will open a new location in Macau later this year.RELATED:Wynn Shares Take Off As Strong Palace Results Offset Miss

Fed Chair Janet Yellen's somewhat hawkish tone didn't worry investors, but gave bond yields and bank stocks a boost.""Waiting too long to remove accommodation would be unwise,"" Fed chief Janet Yellen told Congress, a shift from her 2016 tone emphasizing downside risks to the economy. Yellen, along with other Fed officials speaking during the week, raised the odds of a near-term hike slightly.

Sprint cut its unlimited price to $50 a month or $90 for two users, including HD video. AT&T (T) opened unlimited wireless beyond DirecTV and U-verse customers.

144,MGM,"Watching a movie in 10-second snippets over the course of five days might sound maddening.But the 110 million cumulative views on Snapchat for teen thriller ""Sickhouse"" say otherwise. The numbers reinforce views that an audience exists for narrative content on nontraditional sites. And they suggest entertainment industry competition will continue to ratchet higher, with social media competing directly with television and streaming platforms for viewers.XWriters are poised to go on strike as they duke it out with studios over the sweeping changes to the industry wrought by Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Video. But the next frontier already is at the door, thanks to moves by Snap's (SNAP) Snapchat and perhaps, soon enough, Facebook (FB).For now, traditional Hollywood studios are eager to team up with streaming video newcomers in a bid for coveted Gen Z and millennial viewers.""The team at Snap is thinking about mobile TV differently than anyone else in this space,"" said Barry Poznick, president of Unscripted Television MGM, in a March announcement on a partnership between MGM Television and Snap.The shared goal is to develop and produce ""TV-like mobile video content"" for Snapchat's Discover feature. ""We are excited to create content for their vast and hard-to-reach audience that consumes entertainment in a very specific fashion,"" Poznick added.The uniquely formatted ""Sickhouse"" — essentially ""Blair Witch Project"" for the internet age — was shot on just two Apple (AAPL) iPhones and rolled out in nearly 500 successive Snaps last year through the account of popular Snapchatter Andrea Russett. It wasn't a production backed by Snap, but has been billed broadly as the messaging app's first full-length movie.Indigenous Media produced the project and has since repackaged it in a standard format. COO Jake Avnet is more than pleased with the release of the full version of ""Sickhouse,"" which has been fleshed out to 68 minutes. A sequel is in the works.He won't say how much the first film has made so far, but it has ""performed well on virtually every platform (on which) it's been made available."" The film is available on AT&T (T)-backed Fullscreen and can be purchased for $5.99 on iTunes, Vimeo and Amazon Video.""We've been happy to see there's been a very healthy, sort of, second life to the film beyond that first Snapchat window,"" he said.The indie flick was no doubt unconventional in production, format and distribution. But as Twitter bloomed with discussion over whether Andrea Russett's increasingly creepy Snapchat activity was real or staged, the five-day social media debate perhaps indicates that young people's attention spans aren't gnatlike after at all, if the content is juicy enough to follow.""Sickhouse"" director Hannah Macpherson should know. She also writes and directs ""[email protected],"" an AwesomenessTV-produced series available through Verizon Communications' (VZ) Go90 app. A ""modern-day thriller that explores the terrifying risks of social media in a world of anonymity,"" the show's second season is about to begin.""That's a show that streams on teenagers' phones,"" she told Investor's Business Daily. ""So I'm very familiar that that's how teenagers are watching a lot of content. They're not watching just two-minute YouTube clips. They're watching 10 hours of 'House of Cards' on their cellphones.""Not surprisingly, traditional entertainment giants like Disney (DIS) and Viacom (VIAB) see an opportunity. Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal even invested $500 million in Snap's initial public offering.As they scramble to be where younger eyeballs are, they've put their content on Snapchat, which features videos from ESPN, Comedy Central and the Wall Street Journal. Offerings also include ABC's ""Watch Party: The Bachelor,"" BBC's ""Planet Earth II"" and original shorts from NBC's ""Saturday Night Live.""Snap's fresh slate of programming has a decidedly ""Real World""-era MTV feel to it. There's A&E's ""Second Chance"" (exes meet to dissect their broken relationships) and the soon-to-debut Vice Media's ""Hungry Hearts with Action Bronson"" (the rapper/chef plays matchmaker).Then there's Snap's in-house production, ""Good Luck America,"" which is in its second season and attempts to make politics accessible for its viewers, Rock the Vote-style.Other social media heavyweights have their own plans in motion. Twitter (TWTR), for its part, has so far kept its video focus on sports and news. On top of partnerships with CBS (CBS) News, Bloomberg, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and others, the company intends to stream 1,500 hours of e-sports on the platform this year.Facebook's TV guide is fuzzier, as the social networking giant builds out a video hub for all kinds of viewable content.It has begun funding ""seed video content"" that includes ""original and licensed scripted, unscripted and sports content that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook,"" the company's head of global creative strategy, Ricky Van Veen, told Recode in December.No specific show announcements have been made, but the Silicon Valley giant sounds like it's headed to Hollywood.In February, reports surfaced that Facebook had poached MTV's head of scripted development to become its head of development for original programming. Not long after that, Wall Street Journal sources said the company was looking for up-to-30-minute ""TV-like"" originals that focus on science, pop culture, sports and more — a far cry from the site's typical user-generated Facebook Live videos or short viral clips. Recent Facebook job listings also point to its desire to develop media and entertainment liaisons in Los Angeles.Long term, whether studios and networks benefit from partnering with social media outlets ""remains to be seen,"" said Morningstar tech analyst Ali Mogharabi.In Snapchat's case, content created for its nonstandard portrait-mode style renders it unusable on TV or even other online counterparts.""I think in the short to medium term, some of those (companies) will realize that this may not have been a worthy investment,"" he said.But it might also be a necessary evil, given the sway Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter have, and the chance that they could lure more talent away from the entertainment industry. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, an early Snap investor, announced in January that he would step down from the media conglomerate to focus on being Snap's chairman full-time.""Facebook's got a lot of money and a lot of pulse on the core millennial class,"" Magid Advisors President Mike Vorhaus told Investor's Business Daily. ""Snapchat's cool and edgy and all video all the time, and it's got a special kind of brand that you could've compared to brands like MTV 30, 40 years ago. So people are going to take a call from Snapchat, right? Joss Whedon gets a phone call (from) Snapchat — he's gonna take that.""For social media networks, whose users generate a seemingly endless stream of free video content every day, there's the inevitable question of risk. Why take on the unwieldy task of funding and creating original programming? Everyone knows entertainment is a hit-or-miss industry, so why not beef up those video libraries by licensing other people's shows?""We think (Facebook is) basically trying to expand its ecosystem, which they're hoping (will) keep users in the net ecosystem for a longer time,"" Morningstar's Mogharabi said. ""If they're successful at doing that, then they could attract some more ad dollars.""Snap, on the other hand, is ""pretty much doing the same thing for different reasons,"" he said. ""These guys actually need to build user base to begin with.""At this early stage, Mogharabi doesn't see Netflix-style ambitions in Snap's and Facebook's futures. But assuming that user growth and engagement follow, he says, Snap will be looking to rake in advertisers' money.A recent episode of E!'s ""The Rundown,"" which totaled fewer than 20 Snaps, included three ads for ""Fast and the Furious"" sequel ""The Fate of the Furious,"" which was slated to come out in theaters later that week.That could present a worry to entertainment executives courting advertising sales.Twitter recently announced plans to present for the first time at the Digital Content Newfronts in May. (The ""newfronts"" are an online-media counterpart to traditional upfronts, where media buyers make their ad-space purchases.) Without divulging much else, the company said it ""will showcase new original content offerings and live programming to brands and agencies entering the 2017 upfront season.""And last fall, eMarketer estimated that digital ad spending for 2016 would overtake TV ad spending for the first time. Its projections show a widening gap between digital and TV ad spending as the years go on.It's worth keeping in mind, however, that digital advertising growth ""hasn't necessarily come at a cost to TV ad budget,"" said Morningstar's Mogharabi.""TV ad dollars are still growing, of course at a much slower rate, but that's been the case for a while,"" he said. ""It's not necessarily that every percentage growth that you see in digital ad dollars is actually coming from television.  ...  It's not a so-called binary case.""That may give Hollywood — with its legacy entourage of agents, producers, directors and development execs — some comfort.And yet, while the big media companies aren't likely to quake in the face of Mark Zuckerberg's video tab or a few Venice Beach young guns with an app, they know better than to brush off competition from peculiar places.After all, with Amazon Studios' lauded ""Manchester by the Sea,"" the same e-commerce company that sells Echos, diapers and books online now carries the sheen of the Academy Awards. (The film, which was nominated for Best Picture, landed a statuette for Original Screenplay; star Casey Affleck notched a win in the lead-actor category.)""I think (network execs) kind of get it in a way that they might not have gotten it four years ago or six years ago, depending on who you were talking about,"" Vorhaus said.""So it's not, like, all of a sudden they're going to go, 'Oh my God, Snap and Facebook, they're surprising us just like — you know, some of us would admit — Netflix surprised us.' So I don't think the surprise is big. I think they get the frenemy concept.""

146,MGM,"Japan's parliament passed a bill legalizing casinos early on Thursday, paving the way for billions of dollars of potential investment after years of political wrangling.The revised casino bill was passed in both houses, Kyodo News reported, after hours of delaying tactics by the opposition. Details of the so-called integrated resorts must be laid out in a separate implementation bill before any casinos can be built — meaning none is likely to open its doors in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.International gaming companies have been mulling investments in Japan amid a boom in tourism, particularly from China. Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) are among the operators that have expressed interest. Opening two integrated resorts in major population centers could bring in $10 billion in revenue, with potential for $30 billion if they spread across the country, according to a report by CLSA this month.""This is a landmark occasion and should be a shot in the arm as it relates to investor sentiment in all gaming names that could be players in Japan,"" Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming, said in a research note.Some members of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's junior coalition partner Komeito, which is backed by a Buddhist group, have been reluctant to accept legalization because of concerns over gambling addiction and money laundering. A duty to tackle addiction is included in the revised bill, as is a requirement to review legalization within five years.""We have to pay close attention to the implementation bill,"" said Satoshi Sakamoto, who has been tapped by Konami Holdings Corp. to head a new company in Japan to invest in casinos after the legislation passes. ""If we are going to have casinos in Japan, we will establish the best regulations in the world, along with the personnel and systems to enforce them. It's important that we create facilities where guests have a safe and pleasant experience.""Japan already allows gambling on horse, boat and bicycle racing, while the pinball-like game of pachinko has spawned its own addicts. A survey published by public broadcaster NHK this week found only 12% of respondents were in favor of lifting the casino ban, with 44% opposed and the remainder unsure.The bill was previously abandoned after being submitted to Parliament in 2013 and debate was delayed after a second submission last year. It was rushed through this session after discussion was reopened on Nov. 30.Komeito leader Natsuo Yamaguchi was quoted by Kyodo News as saying earlier this month many people felt the discussion period had been too short. With a majority in both houses, Abe's LDP no longer needs Komeito to help it pass legislation, although it does rely on its ally for electoral support.Yokohama and Osaka have been touted as potential venues for the first casino resorts, while Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike has not come out clearly in favor of a venue in the capital.

147,MGM,"Shares of casino operators with big Macau operations rebounded Friday after the Chinese gambling enclave limited ATM withdrawals by less than a media report.The Macau Monetary Authority limited ATM withdrawals for China UnionPay cardholders to 5,000 patacas ($646) at a time, but the daily withdrawal limit of 10,000 patacas remains. The South China Morning Post had reported Thursday that the daily cap would be halved to 5,000 patacas as of Saturday.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) rose 1.2% in the stock market today, but well off morning highs. MGM Resorts (MGM) climbed 2.1%, Wynn Resorts (WYNN) 1.3% and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) about 1%.Those gains recouped only a fraction of casino stocks' big Thursday losses.Cash withdrawals via UnionPay fuel much of the spending on casinos in Macau. UnionPay ATM withdrawals are used by nearly half the Chinese customers in Macau to obtain money for gambling, Bloomberg said, citing research from Bernstein.The withdrawal cap has been seen as an attempt by Chinese authorities to curb the outflow of yuan from China.RELATED:Macau Gaming Is Stabilizing, But Investors Already Made That BetTime To Bet On Casino Stocks As Macau Nears Turnaround?

MGM, which has been the least Macau-exposed of the big U.S. casino operators, will open the $3.1 billion MGM Cotai in 2017.Wynn Resorts fell 11% on the stock market today.

151,MGM,"Wynn Resorts (WYNN) shares surged Friday as investors looked past the casino operator's earnings miss and focused on the strong start for the new Wynn Palace casino in Macau.Adjusted earnings per share tumbled 51% to 50 cents a share, Wynn reported late Thursday, far below views for 85 cents. Revenue surged 37% to $1.3 billion, slightly above forecasts.The Wynn Palace, which opened in August, accounted for $418.7 million in revenue, including $373.2 million from gaming.

154,MGM,"The same principles that led to Willie Davis starring on the football field, helped him tackle the business world and succeed there too.Davis, 82, was the Hall of Fame defensive end on the Green Bay Packers' 1960s dynasty teams. Under their legendary coach Vince Lombardi and with players like quarterback Bart Starr and guard Jerry Kramer, Davis and the Packers won five NFL titles including the first two Super Bowls.Davis went on to a successful business career that has spanned over 45 years and brought him acclaim and financial rewards as an entrepreneur in the beverage and radio industries. He's also sat on the board of directors of several Fortune 500 companies.""The emphasis on good habits is something that I learned from Coach Lombardi and have preached to myself over my years as a business leader,"" Davis wrote in ""Closing the Gap: Lombardi, The Packers Dynasty And The Pursuit Of Excellence."" ""We can deceive ourselves by thinking that having a clear goal in mind is enough to keep us on track, but it's not. … We must develop good habits to keep on the path.""Good habits included individual responsibility, accountability, self-discipline, commitment, focus, and hard work. There is nothing new and revolutionary in this philosophy. We all know what kind of results these kinds of good habits can bring.""They brought Davis such results as being named to the All-NFL team five times in his 12-year career while never missing a game. As the captain of the Packers' defense, the lightning-quick 6-foot-3, 250-pound Davis was prolific at sacking quarterbacks in an era when that wasn't yet an official stat.He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1981.Davis founded Willie Davis Distributing in 1970, which distributed Schlitz along with other beer brands, and All-Pro Broadcasting, which now owns several radio stations, in 1976. Both were struggling, renamed entities that he turned around by applying the lessons he learned as an athlete. Davis matched that with his intense work ethic and became ""notorious for my attention to detail in planning,"" he says.Davis' business acumen made him a sought-after board of directors member, and those he has served on include the boards of Dow Chemical (DOW), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Schlitz Brewing, Sara Lee, American Express (AXP) and Mattel (MAT) — and the Green Bay Packers.Bart Starr wrote in the foreword to Davis' book ""Willie took his work seriously, both as a football player and later on in his many business ventures. That discipline has led him to unbelievable success. … Willie has been the same great guy. He's been very humble, looking at hard work and success as a responsibility.""""I am proud of my achievements,"" Davis said, ""but I am even more proud of the work I have done to earn them.""The late billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, founder of MGM Resorts said, ""Willie's smart as a whip. ... I thought so well of him and what he could bring to the board, but he was just such a kind person.""Jim Robinson, former CEO and president of American Express said ""(Davis) quickly became a contributing, thoughtful director who listened, did his homework, and worked as hard as he could.""Born in Lisbon, La., Davis grew up in Texarkana, Ark. His mother raised him and his siblings alone after his father left the family when Willie was 8 years old. His family was poor, but his mother's spirit was high.Davis said his mother often told him, ""'I want you to go to school, get an education, get a good job, and be a better man than your father.'""I would be as determined as her,"" Davis wrote. ""I would work as much as her. I would be as responsible and aggressive as this woman who was managing to work multiple jobs and raise three kids on her own. I owed her that.""Davis' first aim from childhood wasn't to be a football star but a business one, so he could take care of his mother and siblings.""I was always a goal-setter,"" he said. ""I saw what I wanted, and no matter what it was, I worked to get there. I knew I didn't want to be poor. I knew I wanted to go to college and get a good job. … I was born determined.""When young Willie observed how people flocked to a local family grocer's store, he announced to his mother that he wanted to own his own business eventually. The European grocer became Willie's friend and mentor, and he worked for him from age 10 to 17.""I learned about loyalty, commitment, and compassion while developing a strong work ethic, a sense of community, and an understanding of how to connect with people,"" Davis wrote.After his mother refused to allow him to play high school football, Davis insisted and she relented. He went on to star and received football scholarships from colleges.""I quickly developed a reputation as a ferocious and tenacious athlete who never quit,"" Davis wrote. ""I would … learn from my mistakes, set goals, and always look to execute better.""Davis chose to attend Grambling State University largely due to their legendary coach, Eddie Robinson. ""He was a father figure, a friend, and a disciplinarian,"" Davis said. ""Coach Robinson was about preparation both on and off the field. I attribute much of my success to (him).""Davis was the 181st player taken in the 1956 NFL draft, selected by the Cleveland Browns. After a two-year army stint, Davis joined the Browns in 1958 and started soaking in the wisdom of their legendary coach and namesake, Paul Brown.The Browns couldn't decide if Davis was a defensive end or an offensive lineman. In a game against the New York Giants, though, Davis' defensive tenacity caught the eye of their offensive coordinator, Vince Lombardi.In 1960 Lombardi, as the coach and general manager of the Packers, traded for Davis, who had severe reservations about going to Green Bay, which at the time was considered the Siberia of the NFL. He even considered retiring from the league, at a time when walking away from an NFL salary wasn't unheard of.Davis then spoke with Lombardi and was overwhelmed by the coach's determination and vision.""We feel with his quickness, (Davis) can be a great pass rusher,"" Lombardi said upon acquiring him.In 1970, the 57-year-old Lombardi, who was dying of colon cancer, told Davis on his deathbed, ""Willie, you are the best deal I ever made.""""Coach Vince Lombardi was also the single most influential person in my adult life,"" Davis said. ""Coach Lombardi (turned) me into a Hall of Fame player and a business leader who has always reached for something more. … We learned that everything we put into preparing, working, and executing in each meeting, practice, and game was a microcosm of how we would live our lives. That's why it was so important to him that we always work hard, that we succeed.""""I did quickly develop respect for Willie, mainly because I saw how hard he worked,"" said his former teammate Jerry Kramer. ""I saw Willie going to the University of Chicago and working on his MBA. That was impressive to me because here was a guy thinking about his future, life after football, and planning ahead.""During his playing days, Davis had a relationship with the Schlitz beer company and was in their management training program, and after his NFL retirement they suggested he buy a struggling distributorship in South Central Los Angeles in 1970. Davis invested everything he had and took a large loan, becoming the first black person to own a distribution company with a major brewery.While he had no experience in his new position, ""there are always mentors if we're smart enough to find them and listen to them,"" he wrote.When addressing his employees for the first time as the new owner, Davis issued a decree: ""I'm not sure how we will gauge our success or just how much we will accomplish, but we will not fail.""""I have used a variation of those words with every one of my business ventures,"" he wrote. ""It's pure Lombardi. … I couldn't accept failure because I couldn't comprehend it, and I didn't want anyone in my company to entertain any notion of it.""Son Duane Davis, the operations manager of All-Pro Broadcasting, said his father ""has always stressed to me that passion is something you absolutely need to accomplish any goal.""Willie Davis took his distributorship from the lowest of the 13 area branches in sales to the highest. He'd use his same principles with All-Pro Broadcasting to take the radio station from the brink of bankruptcy when he bought it and turn it into a thriving concern. Those principles included goal-setting combined with good habits, attention to detail, surrounding yourself with people of quality, and adherence to what he called ""Lombardi time"" — always being at least 15 minutes early.When told that the radio industry business was fun, Davis told his employees the only way business is fun is if it is successful.""He's easy to work for … but still expects everyone to work hard,"" said Edna Garnet, a Davis assistant for more than 40 years. ""He's also very fair, and he's caring.""""In football, we talk about not just physical strength but also mental toughness, a psychological fortitude that comes from being emotionally invested in what you're doing,""  Davis said.""That's what sets apart the winners. It's the same way in life. There will always be challenges as well as opportunities, and only those who are physically prepared, mentally tough, and spiritually focused will be able to overcome or take advantage of the moment.""Hall of Fame defensive lineman and five time champion with the Green Bay Packers. Respected businessman who thrived in the beer distribution and radio industries. Has sat on numerous board of directors.Overcame: Impoverished circumstances and then a lack of business experience.Lesson: It's not just what you know, but what you can do.""Know where you want to go and get there. … I can assure you it will not be achieved in just a few big steps but rather a series of small steps along the way. But figure out what you want to do, what you want to achieve, and then do the work to get there. It is possible.""""Good or bad, habits will soon become the natural thing to do.""""If we are truly passionate about achieving that goal, we will plan, strategize, and work toward achieving it. Each time we hit one goal, we revel in it briefly and then look to what's next. That's how you succeed.""""Achieving a goal and celebrating that achievement creates drive in an individual.""""I firmly believe that any man's finest hour, the greatest fulfillment of all that he holds dear, is that moment when he has worked his heart out in a good cause and lies exhausted on the field of battle — victorious.""

159,MGM,"The head of Macau's government gave a conservative forecast Tuesday for gambling revenue next year that's 13% below analyst estimates amid a nascent recovery in the world's biggest casino hub.Macau's government is confident the economy will recover to grow in the low single-digits in 2017, Chief Executive Fernando Chui said at a briefing Tuesday. Chui's gambling revenue target is unchanged from his  forecast for 2016, as the government seeks to limit the growth of its casino industry and pushed operators such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Galaxy Entertainment Group to focus on tourists instead of hard-core gamblers.""We didn't set a higher target than this year because we think there are still uncertain factors,"" Chui said, referring to his gaming revenue forecast of $25 billion for 2017. That compares with the median estimate of $28.8 billion from five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Shares of Las Vegas Sands, which opened a new Macau resort in September and reported a 19% increase in visitors to its properties there that month, gained 1.6% to $57.93 in midday trades Tuesday. Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which also recently opened an additional resort in Macau, climbed 3%, while MGM Resorts (MGM) rose 0.8%.Macau's casino industry has been recovering since August from 26 straight months of revenue declines as operators open family-friendly resorts, while a two-year slump in its gross domestic product has also eased. The city's shift from high-stakes Chinese bettors comes amid President Xi Jinping's efforts to curb official corruption and limit capital outflow, ordering Macau to diversify from gambling during his visit two years ago.Macau's recovery comes as China signals a crackdown on foreign casinos that woo its citizens to gamble overseas, detaining 18 employees of Australia's Crown Resorts involved in marketing to high-rollers. Macau's gaming regulator chief Paulo Chan met with the city's six casino operators after the incident, reminding them to obey local laws when working outside the gambling hub and adding that Macau gaming won't be affected by the arrests.Speaking at a casino industry event in Macau on Tuesday, Chan said the government will continue strengthening its laws to regulate the city's gaming industry. The gaming regulator also has had several discussions on raising entry barriers for junket operators, middlemen who bring in mainland Chinese players and lend them money to play with, he said.Analysts expect gambling revenue for 2016 will comfortably exceed Chui's forecast, with the median of four estimates for $27.6 billion, a decline of 4.5% from 2015. Macau already has reported $23.1 billion in gambling receipts in the first 10 months of this year.""The government has historically, and rightly, presented a conservative forecast as it relates to gross gaming revenue,"" Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based gaming analyst at Union Gaming Group LLC, said by email. ""Based on trends we're seeing today, we remain comfortable with our expectations for mid-single digit growth next year.""

160,MGM,"MGM Resorts' (MGM) third-quarter results topped estimates, and management is upbeat on the Las Vegas market, while rivals have seen disappointing results from Macau.On Monday, MGM said earnings soared 675% to 93 cents per share, including items related to the Borgata acquisition and a charge related to the NV Energy exit. Adjusted EPS was 53 cents. Wall Street analysts were expecting 9 cents. Total revenue rose 20% to $2.73 billion, above views for $2.39 billion.MGM shares ended 2.9% higher at 27.18 on the stock market today, rising above buy range after breaking out from a 25.39 buy point in September.MGM, which has a smaller footprint on Macau than Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) do, said domestic net revenue rose 16% to $1.9 billion, while same-store revenue was up 8%.

164,MGM,"Macau gaming revenue rose a better-than-expected 7.4% in September, the second straight year-over-year gain after a 26-month decline, helped by two massive casino openings in the world's No. 1 gambling destination.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) opened the Parisian Macao last month, while Wynn Resorts (WYNN) opened Wynn Palace in August. The casino resorts offer more entertainment and nongaming tourism, with the Parisian including a mock Eiffel tower.Analysts had predicted a Macau gaming revenue of flat to up 5% last month. The new casinos' novelty — and credit extended to high rollers — likely boosted September. There's some concern that growth going forward will be limited.But back at home, are any Macau-heavy casino stocks are worth mulling a wager on? Let's take a look at Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts, MGM Resorts (MGM) and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL).Las Vegas Sands broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 51.33 buy point on Aug. 9.

MGM is the top casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip.MGM tried to break out on Sept. 8, but closed just below the 25.39 buy point.

Shares closed at 26.03 on Friday.MGM shares climbed 0.6% to 26.19 at the close Monday, still in buy range.MGM revenue declines have gradually gotten smaller. Q2 EPS rose 76%. Analysts expect a 17% drop in Q3, but then forecast several quarters of strong growth.Melco Crown Entertainment's U.S. shares have been forming a handle in a cup base with a 16.32 buy point. On Thursday, Melco Crown tried to break out, but reversed with the general market. Shares closed Friday at 16.11.Shares rose as high as 16.70 Monday morning, breaking past the entry point again in heavy volume.

174,MGM,"After enduring Macau's worst slump ever, casinos in the world's top casino gambling destination -- including Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts (MGM) and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) -- could collectively break even in August for the first time in more than two years.Las Vegas Sands stock is already in a buy zone, while Wynn Resorts and MGM are near proper buy zones.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report Monday that, based on checks on casinos there through Aug. 14, he estimates total Macau gaming revenue for August will be flat to down 2% on a year-over-year basis. That's better than the consensus of analysts who cover Macau casinos and have called for a 3%-4% drop. By comparison Macau revenue fell 48.6% in February 2015 vs. a year earlier, amid crackdowns on money laundering and smoking. If the upper end of McKnight's forecast is correct, it would be the first month since May 2014 that Macau's gambling revenue hasn't shrunk on a year-over-year basis. Casino stocks have rallied in recent months, as analysts and company executives also forecast the recession in Macau could be nearing an end.Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson said last month that he sees ""signs of stabilization"" in Macau.McKnight is keeping cautious, however. ""We remain on the sidelines on the Macau gaming names as estimates and valuations adjust to a 'new normal' of (1) a weak Chinese economy, and (2) a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds, contributing to more muted revenue growth in Macau.""McKnight has market perform (neutral) ratings on Sands, Melco Crown and Wynn. He has an outperform (buy) rating on MGM Resorts, which is huge in Las Vegas and less exposed to Macau than its peers.IBD'S TAKE: Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands are near buy points, and a new report suggests August could be the best month for Macau in years. However, recent moves by Macau's government could put a lid on growth.Timing could be right for new casinos in Macau. Wynn will open its newest multibillion-dollar casino -- Wynn Palace in the trendy Cotai Strip area of Macau -- on Aug. 22. Meanwhile, Sands is slated to open the doors to its newest resort, the French-themed Parisian Macao, on Sept. 13.Sands, the world's largest casino company by revenue, broke out of a bullish consolidation with a 51.33 buy point last week. Shares ended trading Monday up 1.5% to 52.56 on the stock market today.Wynn advanced 4% to 103.74, closing in on a 105.01 buy point. MGM Resorts, which has a 25.39 entry area above a two-year high, rose 1.4% to 24.84.Melco Crown advanced 5.2% to 15.52. Melco is not near a buy point, but it did rise above its 200-day line Monday.Red Rock Resorts (RRR), a Las Vegas-based casino company that caters exclusively to Las Vegas and Southern California locals, dipped 0.5% to 21.91, rising from an April IPO price of 19.50.

175,MGM,"Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts (MGM), Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) and other Macau-centric casino operators are seeing signs that the recession there may be nearing an end.Wynn Resorts is among those in the group opening new multi-billion-dollar casinos to welcome back tourists and high roller ""VIP"" gamblers when the expected upturn comes. July year-over-year gross gambling revenue for Macau was down 4.5% to $2.22 billion, slowing from an 8.5% drop in June and a 9.6% decline in June. But Macau officials told Steve Wynn that his new $4.2 billion Wynn Palace resort, scheduled to open by end of the year, will get 150 gaming tables. That's a little more than a third of the number he asked for. The Macau government also set a limit of 1,145 gaming machines for the casino.Wynn Resorts is ""satisfied"" with the table allocation, spokesman Michael Weaver told Bloomberg in an e-mail statement Friday.Lionel Leong, economy and finance secretary for Macau, said in a written statement that the government of the semi-autonomous region on China's southern coast will ""strictly follow"" the principle of allowing a compound annual growth rate of no more than 3% for new tables at casinos until Jan. 1, 2023, a limit meant to prevent overbuilding.IBD'S TAKE: Wynn Resorts has formed a couple of cup bases this year but has failed to break out amid continuing recession in Macau. Investors are expecting a rebound. To see a group that's already outperforming the market, check out this take on the software industry.Wynn Resorts stock plunged from an all-time high at 249.31 in early March 2014 to a 49.95 bottom on Jan. 14 of this year, when it turned up. It's up about 100% since then and has formed a short cup-with-handle base with a 105.01 buy point. Shares fell 2.8% to 99.75 in the stock market today.Las Vegas Sands, world's largest casino company, has also placed an application for new gaming tables for its $2.7 billion, 3,000-room Macau Parisian resort, slated to open its doors next month. Leong said that application is under review. Sands stock lost 0.6%, closing at 51.79.MGM Resorts International, which is the top casino company in Las Vegas and is less exposed in Macau, slid 1.6% to 24.50.Hong Kong-based Melco Crown's U.S. shares fell 0.3% to 14.75.

176,MGM,"Macau's total gambling revenue was down 4.5% in July vs. the same month a year earlier, dipping to about $2.22 billion from $2.33 billion in July 2015,the smallest decline in five months.But shares of Macau-centric casino companies such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), along with MGM Resorts International (MGM), all retreated in early trading on the stock market today.Investors had already priced in better news. Las Vegas Sands last week reported weaker-than-expected Q2 earnings, but CEO Sheldon Adelson said he sees ""signs of stabilization"" in Macau. That news sent Sands' stock up 6% last Wednesday. Wynn Resorts rallied after its Macau chief touted a ""return of some of the higher-end premium mass players."" Some analysts say the July report from Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau indicates the long recession in the world's top casino gambling spot may be bottoming, and its economy may be poised for growth again.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report Monday that he is still cautious on Macau, but ""July revenues (were) up in seasonally adjusted terms. July revenues were up 12% vs. June. This was above the trailing five-year average growth rate of around 4%-5% month-over-month for July -- suggesting revenues were up in seasonally adjusted terms.""McKnight maintained his market perform (neutral) rating on Las Vegas Sands, Wynn and MGM Resorts.IBD'S TAKE: Las Vegas Sands is forming the right side of a cup base, its first base this year, with a 54.90 entry point. Sands is still in recovery mode. To see some highly rated stocks that have outperformed Sands and the market see the IBD Stock Checkup.Sands stock is up about 45% from a 2016 low of 34.88 on Jan. 20, and it has been forming its first pattern this year, a three-month-long first-stage cup base with a 54.90 buy point. Sands fell 0.8% to 50.24 Monday. It has a 57 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 57% of all stocks on key metrics in recent quarters.Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts are set to open new Macau casino resorts soon.Wynn Resorts and MGM both lost 2 cents, to 97.93 and 23.96, respectively. Melco Crown Entertainment fell 0.8% to 13.85.
"
177,MGM,"Red Rock Resorts (RRR), which launched its initial public offering just three months ago, may be holding a winning hand as the Las Vegas economy improves.The parent of Station Casinos, Red Rock owns and operates nine large casino resorts and 10 smaller casinos in the Las Vegas regional market. It also collects management fees for operating casinos owned by Native American tribes.The Las Vegas-based company distinguishes itself from nearby global giants such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM) by mainly catering to Las Vegas residents and people who drive in from Los Angeles and other Southern California cities.""(Red Rock) is the dominant operator of assets in the Las Vegas locals market and it's the most direct play on Las Vegas growth in our universe,"" Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight wrote in a recent note to clients. McKnight initiated coverage on Red Rock on May 23 with an outperform rating and a 21-24 target price range.Red Rock was founded by Frank Fertitta Jr. in 1976 under the name Station Casinos, went public in 1993 and was taken private again in 2007.Fertitta died in 2009. His son Frank III, now chairman and chief executive, took it public again under the name Red Rock Resorts in April, selling 27 million shares and raising $531 million.Recent history suggests Frank III has a golden touch. He and his brother Lorenzo recently sold Ultimate Fighting Championship, the most successful mixed martial arts franchise, for $4 billion to a group led by talent agency WME-IMG, a record for a sports franchise. It was all the more impressive when you consider the brothers picked up UFC for a mere $2 million in 2001, when it was on the ropes and nearly bankrupt.Red Rock competes directly with regional casino companies like Boyd Gaming (BYD) in Las Vegas and soon with Eldorado Resorts (ERI), based in Reno, Nev.IBD'S TAKE: Red Rock Resorts launched its IPO in late April and has risen a decent 18% since then. The stock has been basing bullishly for the past five weeks. Check out Pattern Recognition on MarketSmith to see the proper buy point.According to Union Gaming analyst John DeCree, Red Rock is planning to build its first Reno casino.""They have filed some permits and are prepping some land in Reno for a small $70 million development there,"" DeCree told IBD.The casino company also is growing via acquisitions. On May 10, Red Rock announced it agreed to buy Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas for $312.5 million cash.""As a hybrid property that appeals to both Las Vegas residents and tourists alike, the Palms is uniquely positioned to benefit from the strong economic trends in southern Nevada as well as record visitation and visitor spending in Las Vegas,"" Red Rock Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Marc Falcone told analysts on the company's first-quarter earnings call on May 12.Tourist visits to Las Vegas in the first quarter reached a record 10.5 million, and convention attendance jumped nearly 15% vs. a year earlier. Based on public announcements, more than $13 billion in projects are in the works in Las Vegas. Nevada's total ""gaming win"" of $887 million for June was a 6.8% increase vs. June 2015.Red Rock began trading on April 27 after pricing at 19.50 a share. It's risen about 17% in the intervening three months. The stock holds an 89 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 89% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth. Shares ended trading Monday down 1.6% to 22.65.Union Gaming's DeCree said that Frank Fertitta III, with 35 years casino industry experience, and Lorenzo Fertitta with 21 years, are capable leaders.""They have been at the helm quite a while. They're experts at that business and they are also very familiar with the local market,"" he said.

178,MGM,"Matt Murphy, a managing director at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, sees something happening in Silicon Valley that he hasn't seen in a very long time.""There are more amazing private companies now than I can remember in my 17-year career in venture capital,"" said Murphy. ""There are more potential IPOs today than I can remember since 1999.""This ain't no 1999, for good and bad. The dot-com bubble sparked a near-record 486 initial public offerings in 1999. Early this year, IPO offerings hit a seven-year low. The lessons of the dot-com bust and Great Recession remain fresh, and the weak global economy has fueled caution.But the window has cracked open to show some of Murphy's buoyant view. Several stocks have made strong debuts, and several analysts say the enthusiastic welcome should lure more companies off the fence and into the public market in the second half.Eyes opened when cloud software provider Twilio (TWLO) popped 92% on its first day of trading June 23. The stock priced at 15, finished day one near 29 and was up 0.9% Monday at 41.85. The IPO raised $150 million.""Twilio broke the logjam,"" said Murphy.Acacia Communications (ACIA) (up 35% on its first trading day), Japan-based Line (LN) (up 27%) and software company Talend (TLND) (up 42%) are the other IPO highlights of a soft year.Two IPOs this past week got early bounces. At Home Group (HOME) priced at 15 and opened Thursday at 16.26. It raised $130 million. First Hawaiian Bank (FHB) priced at 23 and opened at 24.20. It raised $485 million. First Hawaiian is the largest U.S. bank IPO since Citizens Financial Group (CFG) in September 2014. At Home, a home decor retailer with 115 large-format stores, is the first retail chain IPO since Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) in July 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Acacia Communications, Twilio and U.S. Foods report quarterly earnings for the first time as public companies this week. For earnings estimates on these and other top-rated companies, check out IBD's weekly Investing Action Plan.Spotify, the online music service, is perhaps the biggest name that could be next up to the plate.An IPO, when a company sells its shares to the public for the first time, is a rite of passage for startups and an economic engine. Yet some of the biggest startups, like ride-hailing firm Uber, are happy to put off making IPOs. Uber has raised so much cash it doesn't need an IPO infusion and can avoid the scrutiny that comes with being publicly traded, while waiting for stronger economic conditions.But IPOs often provide the funding fuel that young companies use to grow into multibillion-dollar businesses that innovate and create jobs. Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) were once tiny outfits that ballooned after their successful IPOs.IPOs also bring big gains to VC firms and other early investors, allowing them to invest in the next star companies.But since the dot-com bust, more companies taking the plunge must show strong sales growth. They also need to show either earnings or a quick road to earnings.Even when those requirements are met, uncertainties in the global economy can weigh on the new-issue market, cooling investors' appetite for riskier investments. Brexit and potential interest rate hikes are just two of the factors fueling doubts this year.The 56 IPOs on U.S. stock exchanges in 2016 are 56% fewer than in the year-earlier period, and the $9.6 billion raised is down 57%, says Renaissance Capital, which manages two IPO-focused exchange traded funds.Q1 marked the slowest quarter for IPOs in seven years. A mere eight, all in the health care field, raised just $700,000 combined.Q2 brought 33 IPOs, raising $5.5 billion. That's still far below average, but it sparked hopes for an IPO rebound. This year's average return for IPOs is about 17% above the IPO price. This is a big turnaround from the IPO class of 2015, which is down 11%, says Renaissance.""That 17% return is very strong, and it's even higher if you take out small IPOs,"" said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance and manager of its IPO-focused ETFs. ""When the IPO market shuts down for long droughts, the market revives when we see a strong rate of return.""Twilio helped, as the first ""unicorn"" to make an IPO this year. Unicorn is the nickname for privately held companies valued above $1 billion. Twilio now has a market valuation of $3.4 billion.Venture capitalists count more than 150 unicorns in the U.S.There have been a few other biggies.Acacia came public on May 13 at 23 and has rallied sharply since, rising nearly 2% Monday to 65.24. Acacia makes high-speed fiber-optic communications gear.Line priced at 32.75 on July 14 and its shares edged up 0.6% Monday to 39.88. The mobile messaging service raised $1.1 billion, making it the largest tech IPO since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) roared onto the scene in September 2014, raising $25 billion in history's biggest IPO ever.The IPO market is always on a short leash. Even after a company files for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the offering doesn't really start to take shape until execs begin a road show to make their formal pitches to institutional investors.How big is the current pipeline of potential IPOs? At first glance, the numbers underwhelm.Just five companies are on a road show now, four biotechs and a provider of wireless networking technology.Four IPOs are scheduled to begin the week of Aug. 8, led by Medpace Holdings. It looks to raise $151 million by offering 7 million shares at a price range of 20 to 23. Medpace provides clinical development services to the biotech field. Displaying characteristics of a good IPO, Medpace is profitable, with revenue growing at a double-digit clip. In the first half of this year, Medpace reports revenue of $205.5 million, up 20%, and net income of $8.4 million. It's scheduled to begin trading Thursday under the ticker MEDP.But the IPO market typically slumbers in August.There are 101 companies in public registration for an IPO, down from 118 at the start of the year.But the decline in registrations doesn't change VC Murphy's outlook.""We think the second half will have significantly more IPOs than the first half, and expect substantially more IPOs in the next 12 months compared with the previous year,"" he said.Murphy says the number of Silicon Valley startups with annual revenue of $50 million to $100 million could be near an all-time high, providing a fertile field of potential IPOs.But whether the successful offerings of Twilio, Acacia, Line and Talend will spark more IPOs is impossible to say. Big-name unicorns Uber, Snapchat, Airbnb and Pinterest are making no IPO noises yet.Renaissance Capital's Smith expects a pickup this year. But she doesn't see 2016 matching the 170 IPOs and $30 billion raised in 2015, which itself was down from the two preceding big IPO years.IPO optimism can fade fast if the economy slumps.""The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility,"" said Garvis Toler, global head of capital markets at the New York Stock Exchange. ""We've had some high volatility in the past year, but that's moderated back down to normal levels.""The IPO window is ready to open, ""it's just a matter of when,"" he said. ""People need to perceive that it's a hospitable environment.""Some firms indeed have perceived the climate is right.Two consumer IPOs each raised more than $1 billion in Q2. MGM Growth Properties (MGP), a real estate investment trust spun out of MGM Resorts (MGM), raised $1.05 billion. It priced at 21 in April and was up 1.5% Monday at 26.92.The other was food distributor U.S. Foods (USFD), which raised $1.02 billion. It priced at 23 in late May but is edging closer to that level, trading Monday at 23.62.The first high-profile unicorn that might come public this year is music service Spotify, which has a market valuation of about $8 billion.Another possible brand-name IPO is Jose Cuervo, the world's largest tequila producer, with an estimated market value of $3 billion.Univision Holdings, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the U.S., is another possible IPO this year, observers say. It could raise as much as $1 billion. The company was taken private in 2007 in a $12.3 billion leveraged buyout by a group of investors led by Saban Capital Group.Univision postponed plans to make its IPO last year while it waited for more attractive market conditions. That's also true of grocery store chain Albertsons and retailer Neiman Marcus.They might be waiting awhile, says Greg Brogger, CEO of Sharespost. He doesn't expect a big IPO rebound this year. Sharespost connects buyers and sellers of shares in privately held companies and manages the Sharespost 100 Fund, a mutual fund that invests in late-stage, VC-backed companies.""I don't hear anyone thinking there will be a stampede, even if an IPO window opens,"" Brogger said. He says companies will continue to stay private as long as they can, in part to avoid the scrutiny that comes with being public.""The public market is not always a friendly place to be,"" he said. ""The strong private companies will stay private because they can"" as long as they are able to get funding.""I think a shift has happened,"" Brogger said. ""Companies want to stay private longer and get larger, with more predictable earnings, before coming public.""

179,MGM,"Gilead Sciences (GILD), Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) report quarterly results after the close Monday.Estimates: Analysts expect Gilead, the maker of hepatitis drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni and the HIV drug Truvada, to report second-quarter earnings per share down 4% to $3.02, with sales falling 6% to $7.768 billion.Results: Gilead earned $3.08 a share excluding items. Revenue was $7.776 billion. Both topped views but it was the first quarterly sales and earnings decline in years. Gilead's hepatitis C businesses has slowed, but the company has put more focus on potentially treating hepatitis B.HCV drug sales were $4 billion vs. $4.9 billion a year earlier. Gilead blamed weaker Harvoni sales. HIV and other antiviral drug sales rose to $3.1 billion from $2.7 billion. Gilead cut full-year net product sales forecasts.Gilead is the first of 5 big drugmakers reporting this week.Shares fell 4% in after-hours trading. Gilead closed up 2.3% to 83.55 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: The iShares biotech ETF IBB is close to breaking a downturn. It's meeting resistance near 286-288. Getting above those levels would also push IBB over its 200-day moving average for the first time in 10 months.Estimates: Wall Street expects the casino operator's second-quarter EPS to slip 7% to 56 cents, with revenue falling 6% to $2.756 billion.Results: Las Vegas Sands earned 52 cents a share adjusted. Revenue was $2.65 billion.Las Vegas Sands, like rivals MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), has struggled in the Macau region, a global casino hub in China that has been hurt by a weaker economy and a crackdown on money laundering and other corruption. MGM will report earnings on Aug. 4.""The operating environment in Macao remained challenging during the quarter; but we do see signs of stabilization, particularly in the mass market,"" Las Vegas Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson said in a statement. He expects strong June activity to continue.Las Vegas Sands rose more than 4% in after-hours action, despite missing EPS and revenue views, on those Macau ""stabilization"" signs. Sands stock climbed 1% to 47.80 at the close.MGM Resorts and Wynn Resorts also rose late after climbing during the regular session.Estimates: Second-quarter EPS of 72 cents, up 10%, on revenue of $3.2 billion, down around 1%.Results: Texas Instruments earned 76 cents a share on revenue of $3.273 billion.TI sees Q3 EPS of 81-91 cents on revenue of $3.34 billion-$3.62 billion.

TI closed 1.1% higher at 66.22, hitting a fresh all-time high.

180,MGM,"Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and other Macau-centric casinos aren't out of the woods yet.Gambling revenue for Macau, the world's top casino destination, fell in June. That marks the 25th month in a row revenue has fallen, despite earlier signs that the recession there may be nearing an end.Macau officials said total gambling revenue for the special administrative district on China's southern coast fell 8.5% in June vs. the same month a year ago to about $2 billion, worse than the 6.6% drop that many analysts expected. Shares of Las Vegas Sands closed up 0.5% at 43.71 in the stock market today. Sands dropped to a 3-1/2 year low at 34.88 on Jan. 20 of this year and then turned up on glimmers of possible recovery in Macau, where it and other Las Vegas Casinos operate multi-billion-dollar casino resorts. As of Friday midday it was up about 26% from that low point.MGM rose 0.7%, while Wynn Resorts climbed 1.3%. Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) added 2.5%.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said Macau's June revenue was 14% lower than May, two percentage points below the average 12% drop from May to June. He forecasts that Macau gambling revenue will decline 8%-10% in July vs. a year earlier, worse than consensus for a milder 5.8% drop.With Macau-centric casino stocks up 2% so far this year, ""we believe many investors are taking the view that Macau revenues have stabilized, vs. our view that additional regulation and new supply could weigh on (second-half) results,"" McKnight said.Macau went into recession a little more than two years ago amid weakening economic growth in China and the imposition of tough regulations by the Chinese government as part of a nationwide crackdown on corruption.The rate of revenue decline slowed earlier this year from the 20%-plus year-over-year drops seen in the early part of the recession, leading some market watchers to say the worst may be over in Macau. McKnight says that may be a bit premature.Wynn and Sands have confirmed plans to open new casinos in Macau in the third quarter. Wynn Palace is expected to open on Aug. 22 and Sands' Parisian in mid-September. That will boost the number of casinos and gaming lounges in Macau to nearly 50, according to the World Casino Directory, at a time when fewer tourists and high rollers are visiting the region.McKnight noted that, according to the Supreme People's Court in China, bankruptcies soared 52.5% in first quarter 2016 vs. the same quarter a year ago, to 1,028. That's 44% higher than the average quarterly case total over the past seven years amid weakened economic growth in China.Additionally, reports last week suggested that China's central bank is considering allowing a fall in the yuan to as low as 6.8 per dollar.""We note that a weaker Chinese currency would reduce mainland gamblers' purchasing power in Macau given the MOP (Macau currency) is pegged to the dollar, not the yuan,"" McKnight said.

181,MGM,"Following a Q1 that was the slowest quarter for initial public offerings in seven years, activity picked up in Q2, with 33 IPOs raising $5.5 billion.The second quarter was still well below average, but the returns were good, reports Renaissance Capital, which manages two IPO-focused exchange traded funds.The latest quarterly report from Renaissance said technology and consumer IPOs re-emerged, led by a highly successful debut from venture-capital-backed Twilio (TWLO), the first ""unicorn"" to complete an IPO in 2016. Unicorn is the designation given to companies with premarket valuations above $1 billion, and Twilio, a cloud-based communications company, was valued just above $1 billion.Health care IPOs have maintained their lead this year in the deal count. In Q2, the health care group had 14 IPOs, but half of those were among the worst-performing. There were four IPOs in the tech sector, compared with none in Q1.Twilio priced at 15 and popped 92% on its first trading day, June 23. Twilio stock finished 1.6% lower at 36.50 in the stock market today. But earlier Thursday, Twilio rose as high as 41.89, a record high for its short public life.Another big tech winner was Acacia Communications (ACIA), which priced at 23. Acacia stock rose 5.5% to 39.94 Thursday. Acacia technology is used for high-speed fiber optic communications gear.""Even with the aftermath of the Brexit vote and elevated volatility, we expect IPO activity to maintain its current pace or modestly improve for the balance of 2016, supported by a full pipeline, news of more tech companies and LBOs (leveraged buyouts) readying their IPOs, and the string of recent IPOs that have delivered double-digit returns,"" Renaissance said in its report.The largest IPO in Q2 was MGM Growth Properties (MGP), a real estate investment trust spun out of MGM Resorts (MGM). MGM Growth Properties raised $1.05 billion. The stock priced at 21 in April and is now trading near 26.50.The 33 IPOs in Q2 compared with eight in Q1, and the $5.5 billion in proceeds raised dwarfed the $700 million in Q1. The average IPO gained 9.9% in Q2, and 56% of deals ended June above the offer price, outperforming the S&P 500's 1% decline.

182,MGM,"Las Vegas officially has its first professional sports team after the National Hockey League decided to gamble on Vegas. On Thursday, the league's board of governors unanimously approved the 31st NHL team.Las Vegas Sands (LVS) CEO Sheldon Adelson immediately said he  wants to up the ante and bring a pro football team to the city as well.Getting the NHL team is expected to boost revenue and profits for Las Vegas Sands, MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Caesars Entertainment (CZR) and other casino resorts there.The new hockey team will begin playing at the at T-Mobile Arena, which has a hockey seating capacity of 17,500 in 2017. It means more people staying at their hotels, attending other entertainment events, eating at casino restaurants, shopping at their stores and gambling in their casinos.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report that the new Las Vegas NHL team will increase the number of events held at the arena by 30% to 35% a year, ""potentially driving up to 600,000 new visitors to the arena."" McKnight didn't speculate on how much money it could bring to the city.For Vegas casinos, it could help offset ongoing losses in Macau, the world's top casino gambling destination, on China's southern coast. Macau has been in recession for two years and Vegas casinos, which own the bulk of properties in Macau, have seen their revenue and profits there shrink.Las Vegas has tried in vain for years to get a pro sports team but met with resistance from sports leagues that didn't want to tie pro sports to gambling.Geoff Freeman, president of the American Gaming Association, said in a commentary in CDC Gaming Reports that the NHL team could open the door to other sports teams in Las Vegas and change people's perceptions regarding professional sports and gambling.""Most significantly, by breaking the Las Vegas dam, the NHL is pouring cold water on the argument that regulated sports betting harms the integrity of sports -- and boosting efforts to legalize sports betting across the country,"" Freeman said.Shares of Sands, the world's largest casino company, fell 60% from an all-time high at 88.28 in early March 2014 to a bottom at 34.88 on Jan. 20 of this year before turning up amid signs the recession in Macau may be nearing an end. Las Vegas Sands rose 2.7% at 46.16 on the stock market today.Wynn Resorts rose 1%, MGM Resorts was up 0.7% and Caesars gained 3.5%.Meanwhile, Adelson's Sands has partnered with Majestic Realty Co. and others in a consortium that proposes to build a $1 billion 65,000-seat domed stadium for a National Football League team, various reports said.Representatives of the consortium were slated to meet with a committee of government leaders on Thursday to review the plan. The Oakland Raiders have been reported looking for a new city to play in, and could be among teams courted by Las Vegas if the deal goes through.

185,MGM,"Gaming revenue from Macau this month could see its first annual growth in two years, an analyst said, potentially providing some relief for Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL).Union Gaming analyst Grant Govertsen said in a report that the worst is nearly over in Macau, and that June gross gambling revenue (GGR) could be in line with the daily rate of around $72.46 million that's been reported in recent non-holiday months.""This would result in total GGR of $2.2 billion and would represent the first year-over-year increase in GGR after 24 months of declines,"" Govertsen said.Govertsen expects Macau's gambling revenue in July and August to see mid-single-digit declines before returning to growth in September.""We feel better about fall GGR trends generally staying in the black simply because the two properties likely to come online in this period -- Wynn Palace and Parisian Macao” -- have potential to drive further growth, he said.Shares of Las Vegas Sands, the world's largest casino company, closed up 0.3% in the stock market today. MGM Resorts rallied 2.5% to 23.42, near a 23.44 buy point, and Wynn Resorts rose 0.6% as it forms a cup base with a 102.54 buy point. Melco Crown fell 1%.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a note to clients that he remains on the sidelines on Macau gaming names, as the region ""adjusts to a 'new normal' of (1) a weak Chinese economy, and (2) a recovery that is likely to be flatter than prior rebounds.""McKnight forecasts a 1%-7% decline for June vs. a year ago, with the midpoint a bit better than analyst consensus for a 3.7% drop.But May was a ""really tough calendar comp"" that saw two fewer weekend days for the month compared to a year earlier, Govertsen noted.Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau reported 18.39 billion Macau patacas ($2.3 billion) gambling revenue from all casinos for the month, down 9.6% from a year before. It was worse than expectations for an 8% drop, as well as lagging April's 9.5% decline.

But shares of all four rose Wednesday amid broad stock market gains.Moody's lowered Macau by one grade to Aa3, three notches below its highest rating, and assigned a negative outlook, saying it expects the economic contraction in the special administrative region on China's southern coast to continue this year and into 2017.In a written statement, the ratings agency said in part, ""Our expectation of a decrease in gaming revenues this year and next suggests that Macao's economic, fiscal and external metrics will likely weaken considerably from prior robust trends.""The city's monetary authority responded, saying in part, ""Macao’s economic and financial conditions are fundamentally sound,"" and prospects are ""supported by its solid external financial position, credible policy framework and reliable linked exchange-rate system.""Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company, saw its share price tumble 60% to a 34.88 intraday low on Jan. 20 of this year when it turned up.

190,MGM,"The drive to legalize online sports betting for money may get a boost this year as the Nevada Gaming Commission gets set to consider a process that would effectively legalize it nationally -- with restrictions.The proposed legislation would radically change the U.S. gambling environment and could draw the attention of casino giants such as Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN).They offer on-premise sports betting in their casinos and would likely participate in online gambling if it becomes widely legalized. So could smaller Las Vegas-based casino operators like Pinnacle Entertainment (PNK) and Boyd Gaming (BYD). The top casinos already offer apps for in-state online gambling in states that allow it.So far, only four states have legalized sports betting for money, whether online or in casinos: Nevada, Oregon, Delaware and Montana. But it's mainly confined to Nevada.Quinton Singleton, vice president and deputy general counsel at gaming technology company CG Technology, in February submitted a proposal to the Nevada Gaming Commission to amend the state's gambling regulations to allow betters in all 50 states to set up and fund mobile sports-betting apps. CG Technology's products include Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google Android- and Apple (AAPL)-compatible smartphone apps.It's not clear when the gaming commission will take up the proposal.The proposed rules would also simplify registering for online gambling, Legal Sports Report said, citing comments by Singleton. The report said the Nevada Gaming Commission could consider the proposal as early as this year.The proposed amended rules would only allow certain types of sports betting and would require a difficult registration process. Potential betters would have to complete a one-time in-person verification step at a Nevada-based sports book or casino. And betting on single game sports events would still not be permitted outside the state of Nevada.Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company, has seen its earnings-per-share growth contract for five quarters in a row amid a nearly two-year-long recession in Macau. Sands and other top casino companies operate billion-dollar-plus casino resorts in the gambling hot spot on China's southern coast.

193,MGM,"Wynn Resorts (WYNN) CEO Steven Wynn bought nearly 73,000 shares of his casino company, boosting his holdings to more than 12 million shares worth about $1.194 billion.In December, Wynn disclosed the purchase of more than 1 million shares for about $63.8 million.The latest buy comes amid analyst reports that the worst may be over for Macau, the world's top casino gambling destination, as it works through its deepest recession ever. Wynn, along with other Las Vegas majors Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and MGM Resorts International (MGM), owns multibillion-dollar casino resorts in the former Portuguese colony on China's southern coastal area, across the strait from Hong Kong.After jumping 3% early, Wynn stock closed essentially flat on the stock market today.

194,MGM,"Wynn Resorts' (WYNN) head Steve Wynn unveiled plans for a water park next to his Las Vegas hotels, complete with a lake, mile-long white sand beach with boardwalk and a nightly fireworks display -- putting yet another twist on what hotel-casino operators will do to get an edge in America's gambling capital.In what the company referred to as a ""recreational lake concept,"" the attraction will tentatively be called Wynn Paradise Park and is estimated to cost about $1.6 billion. The park will be constructed behind the company's two properties, the Wynn and Encore hotels, on what is now a 130-acre golf course operated by the company.In addition to the beach-front attractions, the park will offer water skiing, paddle boarding and parasailing. The nightly fireworks display will be launched from a small island in the center of the park's lake. Wynn also is planning to build a 1,000-room hotel on the site.Wynn shares gapped up 11.7%, closing at 99.99 on the stock market today. The stock dropped to an intraday low at 49.95 on Jan. 14 then turned up. In the intervening three months, it's shot up about 96%, trading above both its 10-week and 200-day lines.Wynn's plan is a new strategy for an industry that will do just about anything to attract families and visitors along with gamblers to Vegas. While other hotel-casinos have tried to attract families with everything from exotic big cats to medieval jousting to a replica of the Eiffel Tower, this is the first attempt to replicate, well, a day at the beach.""We could bring beach life to Las Vegas,"" Wynn told investors in a call on Wednesday. ""And we could charge admission to come into Paradise Park, which is what it’s going to be called, I hope.""Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz wrote in a note Thursday that the golf course brings in about $5 million in adjusted earnings. Paradise Park, meanwhile, could bring in $300 million to $400 million, Katz wrote.Katz said he saw the project as a ""shrewd move on the part of (Wynn) to unlock further value from the land."" He upgraded Wynn's stock to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 112 from 67.It's unclear how Wynn competitors -- such as MGM Resorts International (MGM), and the world's largest casino resort company Las Vegas Sands (LVS) -- will respond to this move.

195,MGM,"Casino giants Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) have all seen their shares rally in recent months on hopes Macau's recession may be coming to an end, but a rebound might take longer than some hoped.Macau's Gaming, Inspection and Coordination Bureau said Friday that gross gambling revenue for the month of March shrank 16.3% year over year to $2.25 billion.That was worse than consensus estimates early in March for a roughly 10% drop, Sterne Agee CRT said Friday, though its survey suggested a decline of 18%.""We consider the result neutral to slightly negative,"" Sterne Agee's David Bain said in a report, adding that March's drop ended three consecutive months of increases and was below the historical month-over-month average for an 8% increase.Bain forecasts that April gross gambling revenue will be down 10% annually to $2.2 billion.Las Vegas Sands, the world's largest casino resort operator, closed up less than 0.1% in the stock market today. Wynn Resorts initially fell but finished up 1.4%. MGM Resorts, which has less exposure than its rivals in Macau, rose 2.2%. Melco Crown Entertainment lost 1.1%.
"
196,MGM,"A chill that hit the IPO market in December turned into an all-out freeze in the first quarter, with the number of initial public offerings hitting a low not seen since the Great Recession of 2007-09.Just eight IPOs got out the door in Q1, down 76% from 34 in Q1 2015. That was the fewest IPOs since Q1 2009, which had just one. The $700 million in proceeds raised was the lowest total in 20 years, down 87% from the $5.5 billion raised in Q1 2015, according to Renaissance Capital, which manages two IPO-focused exchange traded funds.All eight IPOs were in the medical sector, and most of those only happened thanks to substantial buying of shares by existing shareholders and a reduction in the initial asking prices. Insider buying accounted for 67% of shares sold in the IPO of Editas Medicine (EDIT), and 48% at Corvus Pharmaceuticals (CRVS), for example.Recent trends provide hope that the IPO window will reopen in the second quarter, though the big names expected to be waiting for an opening -- companies such as Uber and Snapchat -- have been quiet on the IPO front.“While the IPO market has been frozen, we know it will open up again,” said Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital. “There’s a buildup of companies waiting for the appropriate time to raise capital.”The primary cause of IPO droughts has always been weakness in the stock market. Markets started tanking in late December and bottomed in mid-February. The uptrend in market indexes could ease jitters and bring institutional investors -- and companies -- back to the IPO table.The IPO rebound will likely proceed slowly at first, as it did in 2009, Smith says, but she see signs some IPO icebreakers could hit the market in April or May. Companies that could debut include US Foods, the second-largest food-service distributor, which submitted an IPO filing in early February that could raise up to $1 billion. Another is MGM Growth Properties, a real-estate investment trust backed by MGM Resorts (MGM) that also could raise up to $1 billion, Renaissance estimates.But there’s no sign yet that any high-profile names will come forward soon to spark a heat wave. This week, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said the ride-hailing company would wait as long as possible before coming public. It's among a large number of private companies that have raised hundreds of millions, in some cases billions, of dollars, with estimated market valuations well above $1 billion. An IPO is about the only route for investors in those privately held companies to get a healthy return from those investments.The IPO chill has been worsened by the sickly performance of last year's high-profile new offerings. Among them was Fitbit (FIT), the maker of wearable fitness devices. Fitbit had a heart-pounding start, with the stock jumping 48% on its first trading day June 18, pricing at 20 and closing above 29. Fitbit stock peaked at 51.90 in August, but now trades near 13.Box (BOX), the online storage service provider, had a similar story. It popped 66% on the first trading in January and closed at 24.73 on day one, which is still its peak. Box now trades near 12.50.Among all IPOs of 2015, their stocks are down 18% on average from their IPO price and down 28% after the first trading day, Renaissance says.The firm says the ultimate pace of the 2016 IPO market remains tough to call, yet it does expect some eye-catching IPOs to launch and deliver attractive returns to investors.Image provided by Shutterstock.

197,MGM,"With Wynn Resorts (WYNN) expected to capture more Macau market share when its new $4.1 billion Wynn Palace opens in the next few months, at least one analyst is wagering on the company right now.Shares of the Las Vegas-based casino company rose 2.4% to 95 in the stock market today, rising as high as 96.60 intraday, after Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen upgraded its stock to overweight from neutral, with a $120 price target.The 28-story, 1,700-room Wynn Palace hotel and casino will be the second resort that the company owns in Macau, the former Portuguese colony on China's southern coast that's grown into the world's top gambling destination. Wynn competes there with MGM Resorts International (MGM), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) and others.Macau entered its worst-ever recession in mid-2014 amid slowing economic growth in China, a crackdown on corruption by the Chinese government and a partial smoking ban in Macau. Casino executives and many analysts have said that the region shows signs of stabilizing and could begin growing again as early as this year.Allen said in a report that there's still too much market risk in Macau to recommend both Wynn and Sands, the top two Macau casino operators, but he thinks that Wynn's expanding market share as it opens the new facility makes it ""a good bet.""""With Macau at least stabilizing, and Wynn going from a double-digit EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) decliner to double-digit grower in the next six months, we believe stock momentum can continue, given Wynn's long-term potential,"" Allen said in the report.After plunging 80% from its all-time intraday high of 249.31 in March 2014, Wynn stock bottomed at 49.95 on Jan. 15 of this year before turning up. It's nearly doubled in the last two months.  Its stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 93.As expected, MGM Resorts International on Tuesday filed for an initial public offering of its real estate investment trust, MGM Growth Properties. The company announced the IPO, which is projected to be valued at about $1 billion, on its third quarter 2015 earnings call.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report Tuesday, ""Any multiple uplift from the IPO is largely in the stock."" McKnight has an outperform rating on MGM, which rose fractionally to 20.96.Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company, was flat at 53.27. Melco Crown Entertainment fell 1.35% to 16.85.

198,MGM,"Prospects are improving for Macau-centric casinos like Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM), but they're not out of the woods yet, said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon.He expects total Macau gambling revenue to shrink 6% this year, after sinking 24% in 2015, then go flat next year, and grow 3% in 2018.Macau went into recession in mid-2014 because gamblers and tourists stayed away in droves as China's economic growth began to cool, Chinese officials launched a nationwide crackdown on corruption, and Macau enacted a partial smoking ban.In a report on Friday, Beynon said that, based on a forecast model and channel checks, he has ""positively adjusted"" Macau market estimates, as well as company estimates. He maintained an outperform rating on his top pick, Sands, and raised his price target to 54 up from 48.He remains neutral on Wynn and lifted his price target to 70 from 63, saying Wynn ""historically generates the highest EBITDA per table among gaming companies.""He noted that both Wynn and MGM have delayed planned new Macau casinos. That's lowered total Macau gambling revenue but ""will help overall industry margins.""Beynon has an outperform rating on MGM and maintained a price target of 30.Shares of the big three Las Vegas casinos, which all depend in large part on Macau for growth, plus Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), another top Macau casino operator, have collectively risen an average of about 57% since mid-January.Other analysts have projected a return to revenue growth for Macau, on a quarterly basis, could come as early as the second half of this year.

200,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM) got a pair of good reviews from Morgan Stanley and from activist investor Land and Buildings, pushing its stock price higher.In an open letter to MGM investors, Land and Buildings CEO Jonathan Litt chastised Wall Street for what he sees as the ""distressingly low level"" of MGM's stock price relative to its peers.A separate Morgan Stanley report said that MGM is the most-efficient operator in Macau, besting Las Vegas peers Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), as well as Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL).Land and Buildings severely criticized MGM early last year and successfully pushed the casino operator to separate its land holdings and free shareholder value. In a turnaround from last year, Litt in the letter praised MGM's recent performance, saying there are ""multiple catalysts that should lead to substantial upside from current levels.""""MGM is many analysts' top pick with 40% upside to target price of $28.50,"" Litt said, adding that ""Fourth-quarter results and the outlook for 2016 are unambiguously robust."" He added, however: ""We will continue to watch the results of MGM very carefully to see if their actions back up their words.""After losing 44% of its stock value in the last two years, MGM bottomed at 16.18 on Feb. 9 before turning up. It has climbed about 24% from that point and closed 3.7% higher in the stock market today.On Oct. 29, MGM complied with Land and Buildings' request and agreed to place 10 of its properties, including seven on the Las Vegas Strip, into a real estate investment trust that's 70% owned by the casino giant.As reported earlier, recent numbers in Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned gambling hot spot on China's southern coast, have pointed to an upturn there after the special administrative district, beginning in mid-2014 went through its worst-ever economic downturn.Morgan Stanley analyst Praveen Choudhary said in a report Wednesday that staff is the largest fixed cost item for Macau casinos, contributing up to 70% of operating expenses. Choudhary said on that basis, ""MGM China generates higher EBITDA per person employed when compared to Wynn Macau,"" which traditionally had the best staff costs.In a comparison of all Macau operators, MGM China scored an 88 on employee efficiency costs in the Morgan Stanley report, vs. an 82 for Sands China, a 75 for Wynn Macau and 73 for Melco Crown Entertainment.Las Vegas Sands rose 2.25% and Wynn Resorts added 1.6%. Melco Crown climbed nearly 3.5%.
"
201,MGM,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and other Macau-centric casino companies have rallied recently, but Sterne Agee CRT says the upward move may be too much, too soon.Sterne Agree CRT analyst David Bain downgraded Wynn on Friday to a neutral rating from buy, with an 85 price target. Bain said its stock may be rising too fast, given conditions in Macau. Investors ignored the report and Wynn stock continued its weeks-long climb.Bain noted that at the time he wrote the report, Las Vegas-based Wynn's shares had risen 46% since Feb. 10 (Wynn was up 49% from that point as of Friday afternoon).Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) also have large casino resorts in Macau and have seen their stocks rise at a rapid rate this month on an increasing number of upbeat indicators from the Chinese special administrative district.Bain sounded a note of caution about Wynn's Macau casinos, saying, ""We believe upside is limited, especially with the backdrop of still continuing struggles in the VIP segment, which Wynn is more levered to versus peers.""Wynn plans to open the Wynn Palace in Macau in the back half of 2016, but Bain said benefits from that new casino are already priced in and ""the bear case may be underappreciated, given initial relatively soft results"" of competitors' recent expansions.UBS on March 7 upgraded Wynn Resorts to buy from neutral, with a 95 price target. UBS analyst Robin Farley said in a report that conditions in Macau are stabilizing and this might be a good time for investors to consider getting back into casinos with Macau exposure.Macau's slump began in mid-2014 amid a weakening of China's economy, partial smoking ban on casinos and a crackdown by the Chinese government on corruption, which made some VIP category high rollers nervous.Wynn shares closed up 2.4% in the stock market today. After five straight quarters in which its earning per share growth shrank at a double-digit rate, year over year, analyst consensus is for Wynn's EPS to climb 9% this quarter.Las Vegas Sands rose 1.9% Friday. MGM Resorts International added 2.3%. Wynn, Sands and MGM were all trading above both their 50-day moving averages and their 200-day lines. Melco Crown Entertainment climbed 3.2%, above its 50-day, but still below the 200-day.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
202,MGM,"Evidence continues to mount that Macau casinos are poised for recovery, which could give a boost to Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM).During the critical Chinese New Year holiday, gambling revenue on Macau was flat vs. a year earlier -- a sign of stabilization, as Macau's collective casino revenue has collapsed since mid-2014. UBS sees other signs of improvement.""We have three quarters of sequential stabilization in mass (tourists and middle-class gamblers) revenues and now two quarters of sequential stabilization in VIP revenues,"" according to a Monday report, which also noted that gaming stocks with Macau exposure have risen 20% year to date.UBS upgraded Wynn to buy from neutral and lifted its price target to 95 from 73, citing ""improved outlook and mitigating risk factors."" UBS raised its price target on Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company, to 52 from 45 and maintained a neutral rating.Wynn, Sands, MGM and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) all relied on Macau for the bulk of their growth until 2014, when the Chinese special administrative district across the strait from Hong Kong went into recession.The slump came amid slowing economic growth in China, a crackdown by the Chinese government on corruption, and a partial smoking ban that drove some gamblers away.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight in a March 4 report said that he, too, is seeing improvement in Macau, but he wasn't ready to call a bottom, noting that March is a better gauge of real demand, ""free of Chinese New Year volatility and other noise.""Wynn Resorts shares closed down 1.7% in the stock market today. Wynn has outperformed its peers recently. It's risen 69% since hitting a 17-year intraday low at 49.95 on Jan. 14 of this year. It's now trading above both its 50-day average and 10-week line.Las Vegas Sands fell 1.9%, but is up 47% from a Jan. 20 low at 34.88. MGM Resorts International ended flat, up about 23% from a Feb. 9 low. Melco Crown Entertainment skidded 3.55%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

A broad crackdown on corruption by the Chinese government kept some gamblers away from casinos, and a smoking ban and the slowdown of China's economy all combined to knock Macau's economy down.Union Gaming analyst Grant Govertsen said in a report Tuesday that ""February was shaping up well and it delivered.""Govertsen sees light at the end of the tunnel, but still in the distance. ""We would then look to June as the most likely month to see a return to year-over-year growth, which would be exactly two years after the first y/y decline in June 2014.""Last month, which included the Lunar New Year holiday and an extra leap year day, he noted that ""revenue per day was 4% higher than the month that included the most recent major holiday period (October Golden Week).""Shares of Las Vegas Sands, the world's biggest casino company by revenue, shot up 5% on the stock market today and have risen 37% from a Jan. 20 low.MGM Resorts climbed 5.3% and Wynn rose 2.5%.

"
205,MGM,"Charlton Heston had already starred in 1952's Oscar-winning “The Greatest Show on Earth” and was Moses in 1956's “The Ten Commandments.”But he wasn’t the first choice for the lead in 1959’s “Ben-Hur,” playing a Roman slave who earns his freedom and becomes a champion charioteer. Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson and Leslie Nielsen all turned down director William Wyler.Once Heston got the part, he spent four weeks learning to drive a chariot for the race that remains one of the most spectacular scenes in movie history. It took five weeks to shoot on an 18-acre set, the largest ever built, with 15,000 extras.“Ben-Hur” was another Heston box office smash, made for $15 million and raking in $90 million worldwide (equal to $731 million now), saving MGM from bankruptcy.It won 11 Academy Awards, including Oscars for best picture and, for Heston, best actor -- a record that only “Titanic” in 1997 and “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” in 2003 would equal.Heston (1923-2008) was born John Charles Carter in a suburb of Chicago. The family soon moved to rural St. Helen, Mich., so his father could work at a sawmill.The boy was shocked when his parents divorced when he was 9, and he lost touch with his father. A loner, he spent much of his time hunting and fishing.His mother married Chester Heston, who would provide his stepson’s surname for the stage and screen. (Charlton was his mother’s maiden name). They moved to Winnetka, Ill., where the youngster saw his first professionally produced play, Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night.”“He was hooked,” wrote Michael Munn in “Charlton Heston: A Biography.” “He joined the high school drama class. From that moment on, he never wanted to do anything else in life but be an actor. He certainly had a gift for it, which he developed through sheer enthusiasm and determination.”In 1941, his senior year, Heston was recruited for a Northwestern University play, Henrik Ibsen’s “Peer Gynt,” to replace the lead when he dropped out. It was to be staged and filmed. The resulting amateur silent movie with subtitles was his first time on the screen, and he used the name Charlton Heston. He entered NU in the fall.“The film was an incomparable learning experience for me,” he wrote in “In the Arena: An Autobiography.” “Somehow I left behind the nerd I’d been in high school. Now I was at NU, on a drama scholarship I’d earned, with an actual movie under my belt. … I managed to find the confidence that has never left me since.”In one of the acting courses, he met actress Lydia Clarke. But World War II interrupted his education, and in 1943 he began serving two years in the Army Air Corps. After training at bases around the country in radio and aerial gunnery on a B-25, he married Lydia in March 1944 (they would have a son and daughter). He flew to the Aleutian Islands off Alaska, but the Japanese had been driven out a few months earlier, never to return.Later, once he became famous, he was given top secret clearance to narrate classified instruction films for the military.Charlton and Lydia moved in 1948 to New York City, where he appeared in a Broadway revival of Shakespeare’s “Antony and Cleopatra” and had roles in dramas on CBS (CBS) TV’s “Studio One.”A Hollywood producer offered him a film contract, and he went West to make 1950’s crime drama “Dark City.”Then he turned down the lead in another picture, opposite Marilyn Monroe, because he wanted to be in a new play, ""The Tumbler,"" directed by Lawrence Olivier in February 1951. Critics hated it, but Heston said he “learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise.”The Heston couple decided to keep their apartment in New York and rent one in Los Angeles in 1952, so that they could do theater and movies. She made a few films, and he was in front of the cameras eight times that year.His most important movie was Cecil B. DeMille’s “The Greatest Show on Earth.” While playing the circus manager, Heston had to work with a crew of actors and real-life circus pros. The film received the best picture Oscar and earned $36 million in the U.S. (adjusted for the price of movie ticket inflation, it would be equivalent to $321 million today).“When I went to DeMille’s office the next morning after he picked up his Oscar to congratulate him, he said, ‘You’ve gotten some fine personal notices for this picture, but I want to read you one that may be the best review you’ll ever get in your life,’ ” Heston wrote. “He then read me a letter from a man who was enchanted with the picture … and concluded, ‘I was amazed at how well the circus manager did in there with the real actors.’ ”Heston's career stalled as he made forgettable films over the next three years.Then DeMille cast him as the star of “The Ten Commandments” because he thought Heston had an uncanny resemblance to the statue of Moses by Michelangelo in Rome.“Heston had meticulously prepared himself for the role, reading 22 volumes on the life of Moses, and he could recite whole passages of the Old Testament,” wrote Munn.The filming in Egypt was as lavish as the final film, with 10,000 extras on the set. DeMille recalled of Heston, “Before the big scene, he’d go off by himself for half an hour in costume and walk up and down in solitary thought. … When he came to the set and walked through the crowd of extras, their eyes following him, and they murmured reverently, ‘Moussa! Moussa!’ To them, Moslems all, he was the Prophet Moses.”The $90 million (worth $731 million now) that “Commandments” earned in the global market was exactly as much as “Ben-Hur” would.For this next spectacular, Heston was cast as the Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur in the Roman-ruled Jerusalem of 26 A.D.When Stephen Boyd's Messala, a childhood friend who is now a Roman leader, orders Ben-Hur to name critics of the government, he refuses and is made a galley slave. During a battle, he saves the life of the admiral (Jack Hawkins), who has all the charges against him dropped. Ben-Hur wins the chariot race against Messala, who dies soon after crashing in the race.""Ben-Hur"" is ranked No. 2 among the American Film Institute’s Top 10 epic movies, just below “Lawrence of Arabia” (“Commandments” is No. 10).Over the next decade, Heston continued to portray strong leaders in epics:“El Cid” in 1961, as the 11th century Spanish hero in the wars against the Moors.“55 Days at Peking” in 1963, as a U.S. soldier battling Chinese rebels in the early 1900s.“The Greatest Story Ever Told” in 1965, as John the Baptist.“The Agony and the Ecstasy” in 1965, as Michelangelo battling the pope over the Sistine Chapel.“Khartoum” in 1966, as a British general in North Africa.""Planet of the Apes” in 1968, as an astronaut who time-travels to a future Earth ruled by apes.Heston served as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1965 to 1971, but his politics increasingly clashed with more liberal members'. He had marched for civil rights and campaigned for gun control, but in the 1970s he often voted Republican. By 1998, he was president of the National Rifle Association and served until 2003.“Even those in Hollywood who did not care for Heston’s political stances could not help admiring his professionalism on the set,” Beverly Gray, a film historian and author of “Roger Corman: Blood-Sucking Vampires, Flesh-Eating Cockroaches, and Driller Killers,” told IBD. “He took pride in always showing up on time, knowing his role and never demanding what might be called the perks of stardom. Temper tantrums and other forms of self-indulgence were for him out of the question.”Heston’s remaining career was mixed. His successes included the science-fiction classic “Soylent Green” (1973), a theater production of Herman Wouk’s “The Caine Mutiny” (1985) and a starring role in the TV soap opera “The Colbys” (1985-87).When director James Cameron was asked why he cast Heston as the CIA director in 1994’s “True Lies,” he explained, “I need someone who can plausibly intimidate Arnold Schwarzenegger.”After announcing that he was diagnosed with the first stage of Alzheimer’s disease in 2002, Heston died six years later at 84.Star of epic films such as “The Ten Commandments” and “Ben-Hur.”Overcame: Partisan prejudices of Hollywood.Lesson: Have the courage to say truths that are unpopular.“Political correctness is tyranny with manners.”

209,MGM,"Shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Macau-centric casinos fell hard Tuesday on a report that Macau's government may cap the number of tourists coming from inland China. Credit Suisse revised its forecast for Macau casinos downward.Macau's government has decided to fight a decline in visitors that's led to its worst financial slump ever by — wait for it — proposing a cap on the number of visitors.Macau Business, a news publisher, said the government of the former Portuguese colony, now a special administrative district like Hong Kong, is proposing to China's government that the number of mainland tourists allowed to visit Macau be limited to fewer than 21 million a year.It wants to cap China tourists, who are mainly middle-class gamblers, to focus on attracting more high-roller VIP category gamblers, the report said. VIP gamblers are fewer in number but spend more, and most don't come from the mainland.Macau casinos' total revenue has already plunged amid tighter regulations by China's government and the shrinking growth rate of China's economy.Last year, Macau reported its first decline in year-to-year revenue, and the slump has continued this year.Macau's plan could backfire if the number of tourists from China falls and it isn't able to boost global tourist count. That could cause more pain for Sands, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and others.Sterne Agee analyst David Bain said Macau's government may be posturing, saying ""a key Macau contact with political insight suggests that comments regarding limiting visitation growth acts as a lever to address the mainland for additional (much needed/desired) land allowance for Macau for resident housing, etc.""Bain expects a 35% year-to-year decline in Macau gambling revenue in April. He doesn't expect much improvement in Macau until later this year, although by midyear the situation should be ""less bad.""Credit Suisse analyst Kenneth Fong on Tuesday cut his first-quarter forecast for Macau gross gambling revenue to a range of 23% shrinkage to 9% growth, from an earlier forecast of 21% reduction to 10% growth.And ""with fundamentals continuing to weaken"" and valuation of Macau casinos relatively high, ""gaming names may see downside here,"" Fong said.Sands shares gapped down 4% in strong volume in Tuesday afternoon trading in the stock market today.The world's biggest casino company's stock price is down 37% from a six-year high set in March 2014, and it fell below its 50-day average Tuesday.Wynn Resorts skidded nearly 5% and MGM,which has less exposure in Macau, fell 1%.

211,MGM,"Total gross gambling revenue for Macau fell nearly 40% to $4.76 billion in March vs. the same month a year ago, continuing the slide that began last summer for Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Macau-centric casinos.Though severe, the 39.4% drop in March was better than the 48.6% fall in the prior month, and in line with analyst estimates as market watchers and investors get used to the ""new normal' for the world's top gambling destination.Chinese officials last year imposed tighter government restrictions on lending and other practices in Macau as part of an ongoing national ""anti-corruption"" campaign. Many high-roller, VIP-category gamblers had relied on short-term loans to get around restrictions against bringing more than a limited amount of outside currency into Macau and are staying away.Additionally, shrinking economic growth in China and a smoking ban that went into effect in casinos last fall are keeping some some tourists away.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said the decline was in line with consensus. McKnight said in a report that, based on channel checks in Macau ""we expect April and May gaming revenue growth could be down 30%-plus.""We remain neutral on Macau gaming as estimates and valuations adjust to a 'new normal' of (1) tighter government oversight, (2) 10% and 15%-20% medium-term industry revenue and earnings growth, and (3) a recovery that is likely to be flatter than reflected in valuations.""Shares of Sands, the world's biggest casino company, closed down 0.1% on the stock market today.

Monday, on track to close higher for a seventh day in the last eight trading sessions, on upbeat reports about the global gambling hub Macau.HSBC Bank last Thursday said it thinks the strong dollar rally is coming to an end. The unfavorable currency rate has hurt U.S. global companies' revenue by weakening the value of revenue they derive from overseas operations. The dollar has continued to slide since the Federal Reserve signaled last Wednesday that rate hikes may be later and slower than previously expected.Early Monday, HSBC's head of equity strategy in Asia-Pacific, Herald van der Linde, said in a follow-up report said that Asian stocks will benefit from a more stable dollar.Van der Linde said among Asian equities, including subsidiaries of U.S. casinos with Macau interests: ""Consumer discretionary names tend to benefit the most from a weaker U.S. dollar.""Last Wednesday after the market closed, Brean Capital analyst Bryan Maher launched coverage of Sands and three other top casino companies with buy ratings. Maher expects the slide in gambling revenue there to reverse later this year and urged investors to position themselves for an uptick in share values.Sands fell hard in the back half of 2014 as the Chinese government continued a crackdown on casinos, China's economic growth weakened and Macau put a smoking ban into effect that kept some smokers away.Sands, the world's largest casino company by annual revenue, MGM Resorts International (MGM) Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and others with casino resorts in Macau rose in Monday afternoon trading even though the upbeat reports were tempered by a cautious outlook in Macau, where officials slashed their average monthly gambling revenue outlook 27% to $2.5 billion a month for calendar 2015.Macau Chief Executive Fernando Chui said in his annual policy address that Macau has also entered a period of slower growth and casinos need to add new features to the resort side of the business to attract visitors.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Cameron McKnight has doubts Macau is ready for a turnaround.""We remain neutral on Macau gaming, and continue to believe stocks will remain range-bound this year as Macau adjusts to the 'new normal' of greater government intervention and lower, steadier longer-term growth,"" McKnight said in a report Monday.After peaking at 57.27 by late morning, Sands shares had settled somewhat, still up 0.5% at 56.40 in afternoon trading in the stock market today.

"
301,MGM,"The Grammy Museum in Los Angeles has a special exhibit through Feb. 15 for Sinatra (1915-98).
"
302,MGM,"Yet the man many call the greatest entertainer of the 20th century seemed to have peaked in 1946.
"
303,MGM,"Five years earlier, he had been America's favorite male singer.
"
304,MGM,"In 1942, there was a riot when 35,000 fans couldn't get into a New York City concert. He co-starred in the first of three hit movies with Gene Kelly in 1945. The next year he sold 10 million records and CBS gave him a weekly radio show.
"
305,MGM,"Then came the crash of 1947-52: His sales plummeted and the label dropped him, the MGM studio terminated his film contract, he suffered a hemorrhaging of the vocal chords, had to borrow $200,000 to pay back taxes, and his wife, Nancy, divorced him.
"
306,MGM,"In 1953, he begged his way into being cast in the movie ""From Here to Eternity"" by working just for expenses.
"
307,MGM,"Presto. He won an Academy Award for best supporting actor.
"
308,MGM,"The Comeback Kid
"
309,MGM,"By 1954, he was at the top of the public polls again.
"
310,MGM,"""It was the biggest comeback in entertainment history, and he became the greatest popular singer of the 20th century,"" James Kaplan, author of ""Sinatra: The Chairman,"" told IBD. ""Although he was a high school dropout, he was intellectually ambitious, a voracious reader and did the New York Times crossword puzzle every day — in ink because he knew he wouldn't need to change his answers. He had a great appreciation for other talented people and learned from his mother the importance of having brilliant advisors, which became one of the secrets of his success.""
"
311,MGM,"Francis Albert Sinatra was born in Hoboken, N.J., the only child of two Italian immigrants.
"
312,MGM,"The delivery had to be done with forceps because he weighed 13-1/2 pounds, scarring on the left side of his face and neck and perforating his left ear drum.
"
313,MGM,"His father, Marty, was an illiterate boxer and later a fireman.
"
314,MGM,"His mother, Dolly, was a midwife and community activist who was smart and driven, toughing up her son, instilling self-confidence and making sure he always dressed well.
"
315,MGM,"His parents owned a tavern where Frank did his homework and sang for tips. But he was a troublemaker in high school and left before graduating.
"
316,MGM,"When he was 19, he was invited to join a local singing group mainly because he had a car and could drive the guys to events, but he helped them win a radio contest, and they went on a national tour.
"
317,MGM,"Back doing odd jobs, he got vocal training and in 1939, at 23, made his first solo record.
"
318,MGM,"Soon he was hired by bandleader Harry James, then a few months later jumped to a hotter band led by Tommy Dorsey. In 1940, the Sinatra single ""I'll Never Smile Again"" topped the charts for 12 weeks. The next year public polls voted him the No. 1 male singer, and he soon had 1,000 fan clubs.
"
319,MGM,"His first album, ""The Voice of Frank Sinatra,"" with Columbia Records, came out in 1946.
"
320,MGM,"The Right Tone And Roles
"
321,MGM,"""He worked very hard at perfecting his technique, including the ability to hold long phrases without pausing to inhale,"" said Kaplan, who wrote about his early career in ""Sinatra: The Voice."" ""He made a profound study of the lyrics so that by the time he sang them, he could communicate depths of meaning beyond what others could.""
"
322,MGM,"Sinatra had been disqualified from military service during World War II because of his bad ear, being four pounds underweight and emotionally volatile (today he would be diagnosed with bipolar disorder).
"
323,MGM,"During the war years, he taught himself acting and received rave reviews with Kelly in ""Anchors Aweigh"" and later also with the dancer in ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" and ""On the Town.""
"
324,MGM,"The series of 1947-52 disasters pushed him into such a deep depression that he made a feeble suicide attempt. The lowest point came after his 1939 marriage to Nancy Barbato fell apart in 1951, and she left with their three children. Later that year, Sinatra married Ava Gardner, though they would divorce in 1957. He would be married to Mia Farrow from 1966 to 1968, with his last wedding to Barbara Marx in 1976, a marriage that lasted until his death.
"
325,MGM,"After Sinatra's resurrection in 1953 due to ""From Here to Eternity,"" he became a full-fledged 1950s star, earning a best actor Oscar nomination for ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" and a Golden Globe best actor award for ""Pal Joey.""
"
326,MGM,"Capitol Spin
"
327,MGM,"When Columbia dumped him, Sinatra made a wise move to Capitol Records. His 1950s hit singles included ""I've Got the World on a String,"" ""Come Fly With Me,"" ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and ""The Lonely."" He also earned a Grammy Award for best album with 1959's ""Come Dance With Me!""
"
328,MGM,"""Capitol paired him with fellow musical genius Nelson Riddle, whose arrangements produced a series of incomparably great albums, but Sinatra grew frustrated with being unable to own the master recordings, something that very few artists have ever had the rights to,"" said Kaplan. ""That would have given him total control of the music when it was reissued or included in other albums.
"
329,MGM,"""He left to form Reprise Records in 1960, but it had some very rough times early on, partly because he refused to sign any rock 'n' roll acts.
"
330,MGM,"""Jack Warner wanted him for his movies, and Sinatra's attorney, Mickey Rudin, one of the sharpest lawyers of all time, required the deal to include Reprise. Warner agreed in 1963, and the label went on to become a powerhouse.""
"
331,MGM,"Sinatra's classic songs in the 1960s included ""That's Life,"" ""It Was a Very Good Year,"" ""Strangers in the Night"" and ""My Way.""
"
332,MGM,"He won Grammys for best album with two LPs, ""September of My Years"" and ""A Man and His Music,"" as well as the Lifetime Achievement Award.
"
333,MGM,"And his string of motion picture box office smashes continued with ""Ocean's 11,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Von Ryan's Express.""
"
334,MGM,"But 1970 was another rough year. A critically acclaimed LP, ""Watertown,"" sold just 30,000 and reached only 101 on Billboard's chart.
"

349,MGM,"""He was a one-of-a-kind maverick. The ultimate nonconformist, and as such, a monument to Emersonian self-reliance,"" wrote David Lehman in ""Sinatra's Century."" ""Sinatra is also a brand. You will hear him in commercials for vodka, as background music in your head, as the song playing over movie credits ... invaluable to one who believes in the greatness of the classic American popular song.""This is Frank Sinatra's moment. This year's Dec. 12 marks his 100th birthday. CBS recently broadcast ""Sinatra 100: An All-Star Grammy Concert,"" featuring Tony Bennett, Alicia Keys, Garth Brooks, John Legend and Celine Dion.The Grammy Museum in Los Angeles has a special exhibit through Feb. 15 for Sinatra (1915-98).Yet the man many call the greatest entertainer of the 20th century seemed to have peaked in 1946.Five years earlier, he had been America's favorite male singer.In 1942, there was a riot when 35,000 fans couldn't get into a New York City concert. He co-starred in the first of three hit movies with Gene Kelly in 1945. The next year he sold 10 million records and CBS gave him a weekly radio show.Then came the crash of 1947-52: His sales plummeted and the label dropped him, the MGM studio terminated his film contract, he suffered a hemorrhaging of the vocal chords, had to borrow $200,000 to pay back taxes, and his wife, Nancy, divorced him.In 1953, he begged his way into being cast in the movie ""From Here to Eternity"" by working just for expenses.Presto. He won an Academy Award for best supporting actor.The Comeback KidBy 1954, he was at the top of the public polls again.""It was the biggest comeback in entertainment history, and he became the greatest popular singer of the 20th century,"" James Kaplan, author of ""Sinatra: The Chairman,"" told IBD. ""Although he was a high school dropout, he was intellectually ambitious, a voracious reader and did the New York Times crossword puzzle every day — in ink because he knew he wouldn't need to change his answers. He had a great appreciation for other talented people and learned from his mother the importance of having brilliant advisors, which became one of the secrets of his success.""Francis Albert Sinatra was born in Hoboken, N.J., the only child of two Italian immigrants.The delivery had to be done with forceps because he weighed 13-1/2 pounds, scarring on the left side of his face and neck and perforating his left ear drum.His father, Marty, was an illiterate boxer and later a fireman.His mother, Dolly, was a midwife and community activist who was smart and driven, toughing up her son, instilling self-confidence and making sure he always dressed well.His parents owned a tavern where Frank did his homework and sang for tips. But he was a troublemaker in high school and left before graduating.When he was 19, he was invited to join a local singing group mainly because he had a car and could drive the guys to events, but he helped them win a radio contest, and they went on a national tour.Back doing odd jobs, he got vocal training and in 1939, at 23, made his first solo record.Soon he was hired by bandleader Harry James, then a few months later jumped to a hotter band led by Tommy Dorsey. In 1940, the Sinatra single ""I'll Never Smile Again"" topped the charts for 12 weeks. The next year public polls voted him the No. 1 male singer, and he soon had 1,000 fan clubs.His first album, ""The Voice of Frank Sinatra,"" with Columbia Records, came out in 1946.The Right Tone And Roles""He worked very hard at perfecting his technique, including the ability to hold long phrases without pausing to inhale,"" said Kaplan, who wrote about his early career in ""Sinatra: The Voice."" ""He made a profound study of the lyrics so that by the time he sang them, he could communicate depths of meaning beyond what others could.""Sinatra had been disqualified from military service during World War II because of his bad ear, being four pounds underweight and emotionally volatile (today he would be diagnosed with bipolar disorder).During the war years, he taught himself acting and received rave reviews with Kelly in ""Anchors Aweigh"" and later also with the dancer in ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" and ""On the Town.""The series of 1947-52 disasters pushed him into such a deep depression that he made a feeble suicide attempt. The lowest point came after his 1939 marriage to Nancy Barbato fell apart in 1951, and she left with their three children. Later that year, Sinatra married Ava Gardner, though they would divorce in 1957. He would be married to Mia Farrow from 1966 to 1968, with his last wedding to Barbara Marx in 1976, a marriage that lasted until his death.After Sinatra's resurrection in 1953 due to ""From Here to Eternity,"" he became a full-fledged 1950s star, earning a best actor Oscar nomination for ""The Man With the Golden Arm"" and a Golden Globe best actor award for ""Pal Joey.""Capitol SpinWhen Columbia dumped him, Sinatra made a wise move to Capitol Records. His 1950s hit singles included ""I've Got the World on a String,"" ""Come Fly With Me,"" ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" and ""The Lonely."" He also earned a Grammy Award for best album with 1959's ""Come Dance With Me!""""Capitol paired him with fellow musical genius Nelson Riddle, whose arrangements produced a series of incomparably great albums, but Sinatra grew frustrated with being unable to own the master recordings, something that very few artists have ever had the rights to,"" said Kaplan. ""That would have given him total control of the music when it was reissued or included in other albums.""He left to form Reprise Records in 1960, but it had some very rough times early on, partly because he refused to sign any rock 'n' roll acts.""Jack Warner wanted him for his movies, and Sinatra's attorney, Mickey Rudin, one of the sharpest lawyers of all time, required the deal to include Reprise. Warner agreed in 1963, and the label went on to become a powerhouse.""Sinatra's classic songs in the 1960s included ""That's Life,"" ""It Was a Very Good Year,"" ""Strangers in the Night"" and ""My Way.""He won Grammys for best album with two LPs, ""September of My Years"" and ""A Man and His Music,"" as well as the Lifetime Achievement Award.And his string of motion picture box office smashes continued with ""Ocean's 11,"" ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""Von Ryan's Express.""But 1970 was another rough year. A critically acclaimed LP, ""Watertown,"" sold just 30,000 and reached only 101 on Billboard's chart.Out, But Not For LongHe stopped performing at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas after an executive pulled a gun on him.The next year, he announced his retirement.Restless, Sinatra returned in 1973 with an album and a TV special titled ""Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back,"" which rose to No. 13 on Billboard.He also began touring, selling out major venues (having previously favored more intimate settings).In 1979, on his 64th birthday, he received the Grammy Trustees Award for 40 years in showbiz.In 1980, he released his first album in six years, ""Trilogy: Past Present Future,"" an ambitious triple record set that covered the variety of pop across the decades, including rock.

350,MGM,"Casino stocks got clobbered again Monday on a report projecting more bleak numbers from the world's top gambling destination, Macau, China.Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts International (MGM), as well as Hong Kong's Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), which all have multi-billion-dollar casino resorts in Macau, fell hard.The rout was led by declines of up to 10% for both Wynn and Melco Crown.Las Vegas Sands, the world's largest casino company, closed down 6.4% Monday on the stock market today, just above its 50 day average line. It's already well below its 200-day line and hasn't formed a viable base so far in 2015.Wynn Resorts recovered a bit from morning losses and closed down 7.3%, while Melco Crown Entertainment fell 6.8%.

That could be worse than the bank's estimate for a 30% drop.McKnight said in the report, ""Weekly numbers have been volatile since early June, and (we) expect this pattern to continue given continued instability in the VIP segment.""Deutsche Bank noted that after Macau's long run that made it the globe's premier gambling destination, optimism for a recovery is running out.Deutsche Bank analyst Karen Tang said in a research note reported by StreetInsider that November numbers are tracking weak, and pointed to ""unexciting"" early results from Melco Crown's huge new Studio City resort.Tang said that bad luck was partly responsible for the low initial turnout for Studio City but added that the data are still weak, considering the resorts' many attractions. Deutsche Bank has a hold rating on Melco Crown.High roller ""VIP"" category gamblers, who mainly play baccarat, account for a large portion of Macau profits, although ""mass market"" tourists who play other table games spend the most in dollars.In an earlier report, McKnight called out the recent opening of Melco Crown's Studio City resort, which is the first to have TV and movie studios on site, along with casinos, hotels and shops, saying it could give Macau a lift if it was a hit. No such luck.McKnight said in the report that checks suggested the average daily revenues last week for Macau were around 525 million Macau patacas (about $65.76 million), down 9% sequentially and off 36% vs. the same week last year ""despite a full week of results following the Oct. 27 opening of MPEL's Studio City."" As a result, he said, ""We remain on the sidelines on the Macau gaming names.""Follow James DeTar on Twitter @IBD_JDeTar and Facebook.

""Reports suggest that People's Bank of China officials do not view the rate cut as a change in the Central Bank's monetary policy.""He added that recent key monthly data out of the Middle Kingdom ""suggest that China's economic growth continues to decelerate.""Sterne Agee analyst David Bain agreed.""President Xi Jinping's visit to Macau is likely to disrupt the gaming appetite of some VIP (high roller) and premium mass (affluent tourist) players,"" Bain said.Sterne Agee forecasts a 23%-28% drop in Macau gambling revenue in December.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

414,MGM,"Macau-centric casinos such as Las Vegas Sands got a glimmer of hope Friday in a report that the number of visitors to the world's most popular gaming destination rose to 2.41 million, up 3% last month vs. the same month a year earlier .But it's unclear whether the rise in visitors will translate into a revenue increase for Macau casinos.The report comes ahead of Wynn Resorts' (WYNN) third-quarter earnings, slated for Tuesday after the market closes.The consensus of 19 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for Wynn to report $1.84 earnings per share for the September-ending quarter, unchanged from a year ago, and a 1.8% drop in revenue to about $1.37 billion.Like Las Vegas Sands (LVS), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Hong Kong-based Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), Wynn gets the bulk of its revenue from its Macau casinos.Macau finance secretary Francis Tam, in an interview with Macau radio and TV broadcaster Teledifusao de Macau, last week forecast the city's drop in casino revenue will worsen in October, and projected that recovery won't come until the second half of 2015.Meanwhile, the number of visitors from inland China to Macau, on China's southern coast across the strait from Hong Kong, rose 6% to nearly 1.6 million last month, macaubusiness.com reported, citing government figures.The number of visitors from South Korea and Japan rose, too. But the numbers from Hong Kong and Taiwan fell amid recent democracy protests in Hong Kong that curbed travel to and from the island.Investors are looking for any sign of upturn in the battered casino sector after stocks plunged over the summer and the downturn extended into fall.The slump in Macau came as China's economic growth slowed, and China's government tightened credit rules and cracked down on casinos amid a broad anti-corruption campaign. A smoking ban on Macau casinos that goes into effect this month also turned off some gamblers.June showed the first year-over-year monthly decline in Macau gambling revenue in five years. Revenue has now fallen an unprecedented five months in a row, according to Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau.Wynn shares were up fractionally in Friday-afternoon trading on the stock market today.Sands, the world's largest casino company, rose more than 6% on Oct. 16 after it lifted its dividend 30% and reported higher Q3 earnings but lower revenue, missing estimates on both.

MGM Resorts International (MGM) has been under pressure from shareholder Land and Buildings Investment to sell real estate.Sears (SHLD) spun off its property into Seritage Growth Properties (SRG).

511,MGM,"The spectacle of former child stars self-destructing has become so common as to be a cliche. The entertainer who defied that scenario was the girl whose star shone the brightest:Shirley Temple.Not that Temple, who dominated the Hollywood box office as a child during the Great Depression, didn't encounter hard times; she did.She had to cope with fickle moviegoers who lost interest in her when she reached adolescence.Her father, though loving and supportive, squandered her fortune on bad investments.There was a turbulent first marriage that ended in divorce and, later, a bout of breast cancer.But Temple enjoyed a solid second marriage and raised a family.And she became a diplomat and an ambassador to two countries.Solid StartHow did Temple avoid the conventional path of child stars?Part of it had to do with her mother's influence.""I was absolutely bathed in love,"" Temple wrote of her relationship with her mother, Gertrude.All the while, Gertrude protected her daughter from lavish praise and undue criticism.The main ingredient of Temple's perseverance was her optimism. As her second husband, Charles Black, said about her in 1988, ""I have participated in her life 24 hours a day through thick and thin, traumatic situations, exuberant situations, and I feel she has only one personality. She would be catastrophic for the psychiatric profession. ... What everybody has seen for 60 years is the bedrock.""Temple (1928-2014) was born in Santa Monica, Calif. Her father, George, was a bank employee, her mother a homemaker.Shirley had two older brothers, but Shirley was the one whom Gertrude was intent on making a star.At age 3, Shirley was enrolled in a Los Angeles dancing school and was soon spotted by a casting director who gave her an audition and movie contract. Then it was off to acting, singing and modeling gigs.Precocious, dimpled and curly-haired, Shirley emerged onto the movie scene in 1932's ""War Babies,"" part of the ""Baby Burlesks"" series of short films.At age 6, she starred in ""Bright Eyes,"" where she won global fame and performed her signature song, ""On the Good Ship Lollipop.""Next came a string of hit films such as ""Curly Top,"" ""Little Miss Marker"" and ""Stand Up and Cheer!"" Still 6 in early 1935, Shirley became the youngest actor to be honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences when she won its first Juvenile Award.Temple was on a streak. From 1935 to 1938 she was Hollywood's No. 1 box-office draw, starring in such films as ""The Littlest Rebel"" and ""Wee Willie Winkie.""It's tough to overstate Temple's immense popularity in the last half of the 1930s. She was said to have been photographed more often than President Franklin Roosevelt during those years. Her fan clubs comprised 384 branches, with nearly 4 million members.Face TimeTemple look-alike contests were held across the globe.And at the hysteria's height, the name Shirley rose from the 10th most popular baby name in the country to No. 2.Temple commanded today's equivalent of close to $1 million a movie before she turned 10 years old — on the way to what's worth $50 million now in earnings before she hit puberty. Her studio, 20th Century Fox, cashed in with $350 million in today's money.Temple's ascendancy in Hollywood coincided with the rise of the consumer culture in America.She endorsed numerous products: dolls and other toys, breakfast cereal, clothing lines, even items made by General Electric (GE).Her dolls alone generated $45 million (worth $725 million now) in sales before 1941.By the mid-1930s, her income from licensed merchandise royalties came to today's equivalent of $1.7 million a year.As John Kasson put it in his book ""The Little Girl Who Fought the Great Depression,"" ""Shirley Temple's films, products and endorsements collectively stimulated the American consumer economy at a crucial time, so much so that to some she appeared to be a relief program all by herself.""Temple's box office appeal began to fade as she moved into adolescence and turned in a couple of subpar performances.Slide And ComebackA bump in her road came in 1940 when 20th Century Fox terminated her contract.Temple then signed with MGM Studios and made other screen appearances, but never recaptured the critical or popular acclaim of her childhood.Her golden hair had turned brown, the wartime moviegoing tastes had turned to action and adventure films, and her stardom was eclipsed by that of other young actresses such as Judy Garland.Temple retired from acting at age 22, declaring, ""Enough of pretend.""Temple's late teens and early 20s were a tumultuous time. She married Army Air Forces Sgt. John Agar when she was 17. The couple had a daughter, Linda. Agar became a professional actor, and the couple made two movies together before divorcing after four years.Not long after, she met and married Charles Black, a World War II Navy intelligence officer and Silver Star recipient. That marriage would last 55 years until his death in 2005. The Blacks had a son, Charles Jr., in 1952 and a daughter, Lori, in 1954.Around this time, Temple learned that her father had wasted her millions on faulty investments.Temple responded with levelheadedness. ""I felt neither disappointment nor anger,"" she later wrote about the revelation.All these experiences kept Temple grounded. ""I think having a child, and finding herself broke and having to work in her early 20s kept her head on straight, as did a feckless first husband,"" Kathy Fuller-Seeley, a film professor at the University of Texas, told IBD. ""As did finding her really strong second husband, a military fellow who kept her busy raising a family.""After an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1967, Temple launched a diplomatic career, joining the Foreign Service and representing the U.S. at the United Nations under President Nixon.She served as ambassador to Ghana under President Ford, then as the first female chief protocol officer of the U.S. — in which she was responsible for advising the president and Cabinet members on global diplomatic procedures.Meanwhile, Temple faced down physical disaster. In 1972 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and became one of the first women to speak openly about the disease. She even held a press conference in her hospital room and encouraged women to get checked for lumps in their breasts.Temple underwent a mastectomy, with the cancer removed.From 1989 to 1991, with another Republican, George H.W. Bush, in the White House, Temple served as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and was present during the Velvet Revolution, in which dissident poet Vaclav Havel became the nation's first democratically elected president in four decades.In her later years, Temple was on numerous boards of corporations, including Disney (DIS), Del Monte Foods and Bank of America (BAC).When she died at age 85, Temple was hailed by many as the most popular child star in Hollywood history. Her immense popularity was partly a product of her ability to raise the spirits of a nation during soaring unemployment.""Shirley Temple was undoubtedly an astonishingly talented little girl as well as a delightfully cute one with a radiant personality and remarkable camera presence,"" said Kasson. ""Yet crucial to her achievement as the greatest child star in history was her historical timing. Her breakthrough came in 1934 during the depths of the Great Depression, when the American public craved figures of confidence, hope and cheer. Like FDR, she exuded optimism.""Kasson explained in his book, ""In all of her major roles in the 1930s Shirley's central task was emotional healing. ... Amid gloom, she encouraged everyone to keep on the sunny side of life.""John Belton, a film professor at Rutgers University, also notes that cheer as the secret to her screen triumph: ""Temple quite often played a destitute orphan with no interest in wealth or fame, whose only desire was for a stable family with which to share her boundless optimism for the future.""It was a bright outlook that Temple also rode to off-screen heights.""I don't like to do negatives,"" she said. ""There are always pluses to things.""

512,MGM,"Shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) climbed more than 5% intraday Monday, the biggest one-day gain this year, on a Macau Business report that Macau may back off of its proposed full ban on smoking in casinos.
"
513,MGM,"The report also lifted other Macau-centric casino resort companies including Wynn Resorts (WYNN), MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL).
"
514,MGM,"The move gave investors relief from a prolonged drop in casino stocks amid a slump in the world's most popular casino gambling destination.
"
515,MGM,"Macau, a special administrative district in China, with a strong local government like Hong Kong's, has already limited smoking to smoking rooms and VIP gaming areas and is considering a full smoking ban

516,MGM,"But Macau Business said Alexis Tam Chong Weng, Macau's secretary of social affairs and culture, told Macau's Legislative Assembly the government might let casinos retain smoking rooms if the company can prove that its smoking rooms could protect employees and customers from harm by tobacco smoke.
"
517,MGM,"Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said in a report Monday that, despite the proposed easing of the smoking ban, Macau is not flashing signs of recovery yet. He noted that casino operators would have to provide ""empirical proof"" that smoking rooms protect employees and customers.

FBR is looking for a midteens decline in September and said a recent sharp sell-off in casino stocks still hasn't revealed a possible bottom.Macau gambling revenue is weak amid sluggish China economic growth and a crackdown by Chinese officials on illegal lending practices in the former Portuguese colony.Additionally, a casino smoking ban that goes into effect in October, in a country where smoking is still popular among gamblers, is expected to cool enthusiasm for casino visits.Wells Fargo Securities analyst Cameron McKnight said Tuesday that, based on channel checks through Sept. 14, he expects September Macau revenue to be down in the midteens, worse than his prior estimate for a high single- to low double-digit decline.""The Chinese economy and Macau continue to remain soft, and weak growth trends into Golden Week and the smoking ban may create additional uncertainty,"" McKnight said.China's two-week Golden Week holidays in early October usually generate a big chunk of Macau casinos' fall revenue.Official numbers aren't out yet, but Macau Business Daily estimated Macau gambling revenue slid 5% in the June-to-August quarter.

633,MGM,"A pair of reports confirming falling revenue for Macau gambling proved a losing hand for Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Macau-centric casinos.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said Macau gaming revenue for July fell 3.6% to $3.5 billion. The drop came amid a crackdown on practices by local lenders who allegedly used credit cards to illegally launder money. Some of those lenders have been arrested as a result.Visitors to Macau routinely borrow money to get around restrictions on the amount of cash that can be brought into the special district across the strait from Hong Kong.The crackdown includes tighter restrictions on lenders that make it harder for visitors to borrow, causing some, especially high-roller VIP gamblers, to stay away.The revenue drop was led by a 13.9% slide in VIP gaming, mostly from baccarat play. Mass market (middle class tourist) revenue rose 17%, but that was the weakest growth since the bank started tracking Macau casinos in 2010.McKnight said Macau ""revenues did not improve materially in the back half of July, which could mean mainland China's political initiatives, and potentially transit visa changes, are impacting premium mass"" gambling revenue.In a separate report, Deutsche Bank lowered its third-quarter and full-year 2014 revenue forecast for Macau.Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli expects Q3 revenue to fall 0.9% vs. the same quarter a year ago and full year revenue to grow 6.5%, well below the region's usual growth rates, and down from his earlier outlook for 3% Q3 growth and 8.6% for the full year.Deutsche Bank also lowered its August gross gaming revenue forecast to a mild 3% increase ""to account for softer VIP volume and mass revenue trends against a tough comparison"" vs. the same month a year ago, StreetInsider quoted Santarelli as saying in the report.Las Vegas Sands shares were down more than 4% at 68.93 in Wednesday afternoon trading on the stock market today.Other large Las Vegas casinos with operations in Macau dived.

808,MGM,"Ron Weisner is used to having demanding clients.After all, he's a music manager.From the 1960s through the 1990s, he traveled the world with the likes of Michael Jackson (""obsessive perfectionist""), Paul McCartney (""zero ego"") and Madonna (""never grateful"").""The music business isn't normal on a good day,"" Weisner, author of ""Listen Out Loud,"" told IBD. ""Managing artists is like owning a chain of 7-Elevens — you're on call all the time and have to be there for one emergency after another. But I was fortunate in having clients who made timeless music.""He got out of artist management 15 years ago. Now he organizes arena concerts for corporations featuring top artists such as Beyonce and the Eagles. He also produces specials for BET, MTV and VH1.Grow With The BeatWeisner, 69, grew up in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, N.Y., where during the summer everyone played music with the windows open, mixing Elvis with Jamaican calypso, Motown and the Four Tops.In his teens, he would sneak over to the Apollo Theater in Harlem to catch concerts by the likes of Aretha Franklin and Little Stevie Wonder, and was usually the only white kid in the audience.""There's a whole generation of listeners who haven't experienced what it's like to see a tight, well-rehearsed band blow the roof off a theater, and it breaks my heart that today it's considered a successful show when the prerecorded vocal track to which the singer is lip-synching doesn't crap out in the middle of a song,"" Weisner wrote.In 1966 he got a job in the mailroom at MGM Records. He spent loads of time in the office of Harold Berkman, head of promotions, listening to how he pitched stations for new releases. Berkman decided to make Weisner his assistant.Weisner saw how singers did interviews with the press and noted that MGM's units worked closely together (""there were no divas"").After a year with Berkman, Weisner shifted to marketing in the Verve label, where he learned about distribution, production quality control and the label's artist and repertoire segment, which was signing new acts like Richie Havens, Janis Ian and the Velvet Underground.In 1969, Weisner followed two colleagues from MGM to Buddah Records (later renamed Buddha).""We knew that to survive, we'd have to outhustle and outthink the major labels, but we thought we could develop a reputation for being more artist friendly,"" he said.One of Buddah's most important clients was Curtis Mayfield, who had composed many of the anthems of the civil rights movement.""One of the great wordsmiths of our era,"" said Weisner.Mayfield and two other Buddah performers, Gladys Knight and Sha Na Na, became Weisner's first management clients.""What I wanted to do was to nurture the best talent, helping them put on brilliant live shows and build a following over the long run,"" said Weisner, who moved his management business to Los Angeles in 1972.""The first thing that grabbed me about Ron is how much he loved music,"" wrote Knight in the foreword to Weisner's memoir. ""When I asked him to be my manager, he said, 'I'll do what I can.' He didn't talk a big game like some managers do. The passion and loyalty he has for his artists, his business associates and his friends are unmatched.""Sha Na Na was a dozen guys who put on 250 shows a year, but each had a different idea of what the band should be doing.Weisner had to constantly intervene in their arguments while making their 1950s doo-wop style famous with their appearance in the 1978 movie ""Grease.""He also signed a syndication deal for a TV variety series for them, but it needed a sponsor. Weisner approached some Procter & Gamble (PG) executives, but they were skeptical about the group's appeal.Weisner came up with a flashy idea. He arranged for them to fly to New York so the P&G suits could see Sha Na Na perform, then called a billboard company. As the execs were driven up Sixth Avenue, the electronic billboards flashed pictures of the performers.P&G signed, and the show ran for four seasons.In 1977, Weisner got a call from a friend who said a group of brothers called the Jackson 5 needed help. They had left Motown for Epic Records, and their career had stalled because their light pop style had lost its appeal.The problem was that their dad and manager, Joe Jackson, didn't care what they sang, as long as he could squeeze every dollar out of the deal. They were petrified of him.""I knew I was walking into a minefield and became their manager anyway,"" Weisner said. ""Joe and I had constant fights, and my only real concern was that I could keep these away from Michael, who could make magic when he was in the studio.""Feet On The GroundWeisner found Michael to be a serious student of entertainment who had studied how Fred Astaire, Charlie Chaplin and James Brown danced and moved.""His energy level was off the charts, unmatched by anyone I've seen before or since,"" Weisner said. ""He wanted to be the best, then go beyond that.""Against the wishes of Epic, which thought Quincy Jones was too old to produce a record for what they thought was Michael's preteen audience, Weisner arranged for him to handle Jackson's solo record ""Off the Wall.""The process proved worth it.After it was released in 1979, ""Off the Wall"" sold 20 million copies — compared with the 1.3 million the label had expected.Jackson's next album, ""Thriller,"" was the ultimate smash after coming out in 1982. It sold 110 million copies, the greatest number ever.Michael had been calling Weisner 20 times a day when suddenly he stopped in 1984, after Joe Jackson reasserted his control over his son's careers.Downs And UpsBy then, Weisner had brought on a partner, Freddy DeMann, but by 1985 they had different visions for the business and decided to divvy up the clients.One of those clients was Madonna, and Weisner happily let DeMann have her.The singer had topped the charts the year before, but her demeanor wasn't for Weisner.""Sure I want to help my family have the good life, but I also want me to have a good life, and if Madonna were part of it, no amount of money was worth the headache,"" Weisner wrote.Paul McCartney sparked the opposite experience.""He was, without fail, a joy to work with — professional, energized and punctual,"" Weisner wrote. ""From him I learned that you must persevere not only when things are at their worst, but also when they're at their best. I learned that it's possible to balance your show business with your personal life and remain at the top of your game in both. I learned that entertainment is a noble profession.""Larry Schweikart, director of the independent film ""Rockin' the Wall,"" said: ""In interviewing musicians for our documentary on how rock music helped bring down the Iron Curtain, I learned that almost all of them had a very difficult time finding a manager they could trust. Ron Weisner was known for having built his success on being absolutely honest and always putting the client's benefit before his own. That's a lesson that can be applied to any profession.""

810,MGM,"Former National Basketball Association player Jackie Robinson plans to build a $1.3 billion arena and hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.Robinson said this week he expects to begin construction in the spring on a privately funded project near the renovated SLS Las Vegas hotel-casino and idle Fontainebleau tower. It would open in 2016.The 22,000-seat stadium would be the second new arena on the tourist corridor. MGM Resorts International (MGM) is building a similarly sized project on the opposite side of the Strip, in partnership with sports and entertainment promoter AEG.""I think it's the only place that's going to have the Chicago Bears at one end and Beyonce at the other end, and an arena in both places. It's a unique place — it's not like Kansas City. It can support more than one event,"" Robinson said.Developers say an 863,000-square- foot arena will have four levels, a retractable roof and a nightclub, and will host basketball, hockey, boxing, rodeos and concerts. Plans call for 75 luxury boxes and a VIP entrance.Robinson says an outdoor promenade with shops and eateries will lead to a 500-room luxury hotel.Minneapolis-based Cunningham Group Architecture is the designer.MGM's $350 million arena is expected to open in the spring of 2016 between the New York-New York and Monte Carlo hotel-casinos.Robinson played at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, then in the NBA 1978 to 1982 with the Seattle SuperSonics, Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls. He later worked as a general contractor, hotel manager and airport concession owner. Robinson, who's using loan financing, got the arena idea five years ago but waited for the economy to improve.

815,MGM,"Earnings season kicks into high gear this week, with a slew of high-profile quarterly results from some of the biggest and brightest companies. Many are the first to report for their given industry, giving investors a particular interest in analyzing the financials and outlooks.Here are six of the most important earnings reports on tap.TuesdayCharles Schwab (SCHW) was a pioneering discount brokerage, but it's still blazing new trails. Schwab shares hit a 13-year high on March 21. The stock consolidated and attempted a breakout on July 3. It fell back as the market sold off, though in light volume. Schwab rose 0.7% to 27.10 on the stock market Friday.Wall Street expects Schwab to report a 28% earnings per share gain to 23 cents. That would snap 3 quarters of accelerating growth.J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) has had a tough time of late. Once deemed the best-run Wall Street bank, JPMorgan Chase has paid billions of dollars in various settlements. Mortgage activity has slowed — affecting many lenders — while fixed-income trading seems permanently depressed. JPMorgan said in a SEC filing that it expected Q2 market revenues down 20% vs. a year earlier. Finally, the company reported on July 1 that CEO Jamie Dimon has throat cancer, though that should be ""curable.""Shares have retreated since hitting a 14-year high in late March.JPMorgan earnings likely fell 19% to $1.29 a share, matching Q1's 19% year-over-year decline. JPMorgan is just one of several major bank earnings. Wells Fargo (WFC) reported earnings Friday. Citigroup (C) reports Monday, with Goldman Sachs (GS) joining JPMorgan on Tuesday. Bank of America (BAC) results are due Wednesday.Intel (INTC) has seen a rebirth in recent months, with shares recently hitting a 10-year high, in the wake of solid Q1 results in early April and then upwardly revised revenue guidance on June 12. Intel is benefitting from the recent revival in corporate PC sales after Microsoft (MSFT) stopped supporting the venerable Windows operating system.Intel earnings should show a 33% gain to 52 cents a share, following yearly changes of -5%, 6%, 0%, -28% in the prior four quarters. Investors will want to have some indication if PC sales will remain strong in the second half of the year, or if Intel will find some other way to expand.Yahoo (YHOO) earnings will rise 9% to 38 cents a share, following Q1's flat reading. Q1 revenue edged higher, as display ad sales climbed 2%, offering some hope that CEO Marissa Mayer can generate top-line growth. Still, Yahoo's most important news may be about Alibaba. Yahoo owns a minority stake in the Chinese e-commerce giant, and it gives some headline figures on Alibaba's results.Alibaba's planned U.S. IPO is widely expected to take place in August. Yahoo will sell a significant share of its existing holdings as part of the offering.Yahoo shares have been in a downtrend since hitting a decade-best in early January.WednesdayLas Vegas Sands (LVS) is the world's largest casino operator. Despite its name, Sands — like Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) — gets the bulk of its revenue and profit from Macau, China's gaming enclave and the world's largest gambling site. Macau growth has slowed in recent months amid a crackdown on moneylenders in the area. But there are some signs that the worst is over for Macau. Meanwhile, Las Vegas casino revenue has been solid.Las Vegas Sands earnings should show a 40% gain to 91 cents a share, analysts predicted. That would the second straight quarter of moderate acceleration.But Sands stock has been in a modest downtrend for the past four months, falling below its 50- and 200-day moving averages last week.ThursdayGoogle (GOOGL) is involved in many ventures, from self-driving cars to alternative-energy investments to Android mobile software. The open-source Android has become the global leader over Apple (AAPL) iOS. It's a direct money-maker, though it likely does help boost mobile ad revenue. Search-based ads remain the bulk of Google's business. But it's a good business: Earnings likely rose 31% to $6.26 a share. That would follow decelerating growth for the past two quarters to just 8% in Q1.Google shares hit a record high of 615.05 in late February. The stock consolidated and has been building a handle on its cup base.

838,MGM,"The drive to legalize online gambling throughout the U.S. is gaining momentum, but the heads of the world's largest casino companies are divided on what could be an $8 billion market.MGM Resorts International (MGM) CEO Jim Murren and Caesars Entertainment (CZR) CEO Gary Loveman support it.""Gamers and casinos — those two industries are converging,"" Murren told IBD recently.""We think that's a good thing. There's a business opportunity if it's regulated pristinely, preferably at the federal level.""Caesars also has spun off Caesars Acquisition (CACQ), whose goal is to acquire online gaming sites and technology. Most of the rest of the U.S. casino industry, which generates more than $37 billion in revenue a year, supports legalizing online gambling.But Las Vegas Sands  (LVS) CEO Sheldon Adelson is vehemently against it, and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) CEO Steve Wynn has withdrawn his earlier backing.Possible FrameworkDespite this opposition, Nevada and Delaware recently took what many see as a significant step toward national legal online gambling.Last month they signed a compact — similar to the ones states use to enable multistate lotteries — that lets gamblers in both states play on sites based in each other's state.The agreement is for online poker only, but market tracker Union Gaming noted in a report that it is the first of its kind and ""could serve as a framework for future interstate compacts.""The two states hope to build on the Justice Department's 2011 decision to allow online gambling, except for sports betting, even though it limits betting to residents within a state playing on sites based in that state.Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware were the first to offer online gaming. Struggling Atlantic City venues are betting online games will drive interest in playing at casinos rather than encourage players to just stay at home.Other states, still licking wounds from the recession and looking to boost tax revenues, are mulling legalization too.They won't get any help from Adelson, who has said online betting will open the door to minors gambling and to unscrupulous sites preying on vulnerable people.In January, he launched the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling, which is calling on Congress to pass a federal ban on Internet gambling.An opposing group, the Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection, has formed with backing from MGM Resorts, the American Gaming Association and the Poker Players Alliance, among others.MGM's Murren says the industry must be ""absolutely vigilant and tireless"" in shutting down illegal gambling sites and warns they could damage the overall industry.""From our perspective at MGM, the most important dimension of the debate has to be on law enforcement,"" he said.Adelson may have found an ally in his bid to hold back the online gambling trend.888 Holdings On HoldUntil recently, Steve Wynn was preparing his company for online gaming. In September he agreed to have U.K.-based 888 Holdings develop his resort's online poker offerings.But in a January interview with industry tracker Jon Ralston at RalstonReports.com, Wynn said he now agrees with Adelson.Wynn added later it's possible he could change his mind again.""This is not a good entrepreneurial opportunity,"" he told Ralston. ""Where's the business opportunity? The big problem I see is I don't see the government letting us keep the money.""Wynn has since put its partnership with 888 Holdings on hold.Meantime, 888 is working with regulators in states considering legalizing online gambling to educate them about safety and security issues.888 CEO Brian Mattingley said in an interview with IBD that based on his conversations with analysts, the online gambling market could reach $5 billion-$8 billion when it matures.""The opportunity in the U.S. is going to be enormous,"" he said.

"
897,MGM,"By the late 1990s, Walt Disney shareholders could have whistled toward work — or retirement.
"
898,MGM,"The company stood atop the entertainment world, growing strongly as its animation division churned out hits, its live-action films flowered, and its dusty video library turned into content gold.
"
899,MGM,"Shares surged 8,943% from their 1984 low to their March 2014 peak, with the biggest run from '84 to '98.
"
900,MGM,"But in the spring of 1984, all of that was far off.
"
901,MGM,"A few years after the death of the visionary founder Walt in 1966, Disney (DIS) foundered under weak leadership and little sense of direction. Once the company's crown jewels, the animated movies had fallen by the wayside, and its live-action films — think of ""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1965) and ""Tron"" (1982) — weren't much better.
"
902,MGM,"In fiscal 1982, net income plunged 18% and fell 7% again the following year. The next year, corporate raider Saul Steinberg targeted Disney, which eventually paid him $32 million to go away.
"
903,MGM,"The Disney board knew that it needed change. In September of 1984, Michael Eisner started as CEO and chairman, and Frank Wells as president.
"
904,MGM,"""It was a fabulous management team. People were at their absolute best,"" said Chris Dixon, who covered Disney as a PaineWebber analyst at the time. ""Eisner was terrific in terms of imagination and energy, and Frank, because of his long-term experience, added a little gray hair.""
"
905,MGM,"""The '80s were golden,"" said Hal Vogel, a long-time entertainment industry analyst and investor who wrote ""Entertainment Industry Economics."" ""It was a very positive change and a very fruitful period.""
"
906,MGM,"One of the team's first smart moves, analysts say, was to recognize the cash potential of Disney's assets. By the early 1980s, the theme parks were generating 70% of company income, according to the website Funding Universe.
"
907,MGM,"""They sensed correctly that they could raise ticket prices and not affect demand for the parks,"" Vogel said.
"
908,MGM,"In fact, raising ticket prices by just $1 would yield $30 million more per year, wrote Kim Masters in ""The Keys to the Kingdom: The Rise of Michael Eisner and the Fall of Everybody Else.""
"
909,MGM,"Disney got lucky with demographics, says Vogel, as children of baby boomers got old enough to appreciate the theme parks. But it was a stroke of genius, not luck, that led Eisner to see Disney's existing film stock as an asset to be tapped.
"
910,MGM,"""Such a bounty has fallen into my lap. Every day a new asset falls out of the sky,"" Eisner said in Masters' book. Wells was said to have quipped, ""Every time I open a door at this company, there's money behind it.""
"
911,MGM,"No company had thought of marketing videocassettes cheaply enough that parents could buy them for children to watch over and over, Masters wrote, and that brainstorm made video a ""staggering source of revenue"" for Disney. Its video library, more than those of most studios, was easily distributed overseas because the films didn't require a lot of sophisticated translation.
"
912,MGM,"Eisner's recognition that old content had value changed the face of entertainment. It helped cable fill empty channels and gave rise to new business models such as Netflix (NFLX) and Roku.
"
913,MGM,"Again, Disney was in the sweet spot. Consumers weren't the only ones looking for videocassette content; scores of new TV channels also needed it, and Disney had family-friendly films galore.
"
914,MGM,"To create new movie and TV content, Eisner and Wells hired Jeffrey Katzenberg, who'd worked under Eisner at Paramount, as Disney Studios chairman.
"
915,MGM,"Under Katzenberg's direction, Disney revitalized its animation division, turning out hits like ""The Little Mermaid,"" which won two Oscars and grossed a record-setting $85 million; ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the first animated film to be nominated for a best-picture Oscar; and ""The Lion King,"" which took in a staggering $423 million in theatrical box-office revenues according to the website BoxOfficeMojo.
"
916,MGM,"Katzenberg ""lit a fire under people,"" said Bill Cotter, author of ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television."" Cotter worked for that Disney medium for years.
"
917,MGM,"Thomas Sito, who helped animate many of the hit films of the Disney renaissance, including ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin,"" believes another manager was also key to that revival: Roy Disney, Walt's nephew, who became head of the animation division in 1984.
"
918,MGM,"Roy was personally invested in the revival of animation, which had been the Disney Co.'s heart and soul. Sito told IBD that when it came to making decisions about the quality of the products, Roy used to growl, ""I have to care. My name's on the damn door.""
"
919,MGM,"The entire management team focused on bringing that sense of quality back to Disney films, Sito says. That was partly due to outside competition; former Disney animator Don Bluth had left and was producing popular animated films such as 1986's ""An American Tail.""
"
920,MGM,"Katzenberg used to liken Disney's status as synonymous with quality family entertainment just as the Kleenex brand is to tissues.
"
921,MGM,"""It was very exciting at the time, because as artists we always had faith in the art of animation and its ability to entertain,"" Sito said.
"
922,MGM,"Disney's new successes also showed Hollywood that animation could be big business again. The Lucasfilm spinoff Pixar had enormous hits with ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo"" and other films before being bought by Disney in 2006. And Katzenberg had hits like the ""Shrek"" films at DreamWorks Animation (DWA) after leaving Disney.
"
923,MGM,"Eisner, who was president of Paramount Pictures when Disney tapped him for the CEO job, also knew that there was value in live-action, non-G-rated movie fare. Disney had established Touchstone Films in 1983, before Eisner started, and had even had a hit with the Tom Hanks comedy ""Splash.""
"
924,MGM,"Eisner gave Touchstone lots of attention, and Touchstone hits such as ""Outrageous Fortune,"" ""Ruthless People"" and ""Pretty Woman"" were box-office gold.
"
925,MGM,"Eisner also expanded the moneymaking theme parks. He broadened Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., via a partnership with MGM for a studio-themed entertainment park, which opened in 1989.
"
926,MGM,"But Eisner thought even bigger. Tokyo Disneyland had opened in 1983, and while it did well, it was considered a missed opportunity because Disney had leased its characters and name to a local concessionaire rather than owning everything in the park outright. Still, Vogel said, ""It was quite lucrative, and Europe was the next logical decision."" Eisner began working on establishing a Disneyland in Paris: Euro Disney, which opened in 1992.
"
927,MGM,"Vogel lauds the decision to pursue global expansion. It spread Disney products to consumers around the world and reinforced the brand's iconic status.
"
928,MGM,"More than that, Eisner's long-distance shift meant that every interaction that a consumer had with Disney sparked another. A theme-park vacation would remind children of a love for Disney films, and re-viewing an old favorite movie could send a parent to buy a toy with a character's likeness. Some 22% of Disney's revenue came from international operations by 1991.
"
929,MGM,"All of those ventures were a prelude to one of Eisner's biggest steps: buying ABC/Capital Cities in 1996 for $19 billion. ""Once they were successful in being able to expand and demonstrate they could take the company to the next level and scale it, the next step was buying ABC,"" Dixon said.
"
930,MGM,"The acquisition got Disney a broadcast network along with TV and radio stations — plus ESPN, which at the time had 95 million worldwide viewers. ""ESPN was the crown jewel,"" Vogel said.
"
931,MGM,"The purchase was especially bold because it guaranteed Disney a network for its programs, Masters notes.
"
932,MGM,"ABC could air new Disney programming, which could be resold as reruns to cable. Yet Disney remained focused on quality entertainment rather than on churning out lots of content to dump on the network, says Cotter.
"
933,MGM,"The sense of rebirth touching the film animators reached the TV division as well, Cotter said: ""The more you keep a feeling of fire and ambition under a creative crowd, the more they're going to rise to the occasion.""
"
934,MGM,"Disney's market cap increased from $2 billion to $53 billion from 1984 to 1996. Eisner could point to 18 new businesses into which he'd led the company since taking the reins, including professional sports teams, live Broadway shows and Disney stores.
"
935,MGM,"""In the history of American business, this was a great group of people who complemented each other at the same time as expanding demand for American entertainment and rapidly developing technology delivered entertainment in new and different ways,"" Dixon said.By the late 1990s, Walt Disney shareholders could have whistled toward work — or retirement.The company stood atop the entertainment world, growing strongly as its animation division churned out hits, its live-action films flowered, and its dusty video library turned into content gold.Shares surged 8,943% from their 1984 low to their March 2014 peak, with the biggest run from '84 to '98.But in the spring of 1984, all of that was far off.A few years after the death of the visionary founder Walt in 1966, Disney (DIS) foundered under weak leadership and little sense of direction.

The next year, corporate raider Saul Steinberg targeted Disney, which eventually paid him $32 million to go away.The Disney board knew that it needed change. In September of 1984, Michael Eisner started as CEO and chairman, and Frank Wells as president.""It was a fabulous management team. People were at their absolute best,"" said Chris Dixon, who covered Disney as a PaineWebber analyst at the time. ""Eisner was terrific in terms of imagination and energy, and Frank, because of his long-term experience, added a little gray hair.""""The '80s were golden,"" said Hal Vogel, a long-time entertainment industry analyst and investor who wrote ""Entertainment Industry Economics."" ""It was a very positive change and a very fruitful period.""One of the team's first smart moves, analysts say, was to recognize the cash potential of Disney's assets. By the early 1980s, the theme parks were generating 70% of company income, according to the website Funding Universe.""They sensed correctly that they could raise ticket prices and not affect demand for the parks,"" Vogel said.In fact, raising ticket prices by just $1 would yield $30 million more per year, wrote Kim Masters in ""The Keys to the Kingdom: The Rise of Michael Eisner and the Fall of Everybody Else.""Disney got lucky with demographics, says Vogel, as children of baby boomers got old enough to appreciate the theme parks. But it was a stroke of genius, not luck, that led Eisner to see Disney's existing film stock as an asset to be tapped.""Such a bounty has fallen into my lap. Every day a new asset falls out of the sky,"" Eisner said in Masters' book. Wells was said to have quipped, ""Every time I open a door at this company, there's money behind it.""No company had thought of marketing videocassettes cheaply enough that parents could buy them for children to watch over and over, Masters wrote, and that brainstorm made video a ""staggering source of revenue"" for Disney. Its video library, more than those of most studios, was easily distributed overseas because the films didn't require a lot of sophisticated translation.Eisner's recognition that old content had value changed the face of entertainment. It helped cable fill empty channels and gave rise to new business models such as Netflix (NFLX) and Roku.Again, Disney was in the sweet spot. Consumers weren't the only ones looking for videocassette content; scores of new TV channels also needed it, and Disney had family-friendly films galore.To create new movie and TV content, Eisner and Wells hired Jeffrey Katzenberg, who'd worked under Eisner at Paramount, as Disney Studios chairman.Under Katzenberg's direction, Disney revitalized its animation division, turning out hits like ""The Little Mermaid,"" which won two Oscars and grossed a record-setting $85 million; ""Beauty and the Beast,"" the first animated film to be nominated for a best-picture Oscar; and ""The Lion King,"" which took in a staggering $423 million in theatrical box-office revenues according to the website BoxOfficeMojo.Katzenberg ""lit a fire under people,"" said Bill Cotter, author of ""The Wonderful World of Disney Television."" Cotter worked for that Disney medium for years.Thomas Sito, who helped animate many of the hit films of the Disney renaissance, including ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin,"" believes another manager was also key to that revival: Roy Disney, Walt's nephew, who became head of the animation division in 1984.Roy was personally invested in the revival of animation, which had been the Disney Co.'s heart and soul. Sito told IBD that when it came to making decisions about the quality of the products, Roy used to growl, ""I have to care. My name's on the damn door.""The entire management team focused on bringing that sense of quality back to Disney films, Sito says. That was partly due to outside competition; former Disney animator Don Bluth had left and was producing popular animated films such as 1986's ""An American Tail.""Katzenberg used to liken Disney's status as synonymous with quality family entertainment just as the Kleenex brand is to tissues.""It was very exciting at the time, because as artists we always had faith in the art of animation and its ability to entertain,"" Sito said.Disney's new successes also showed Hollywood that animation could be big business again. The Lucasfilm spinoff Pixar had enormous hits with ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo"" and other films before being bought by Disney in 2006. And Katzenberg had hits like the ""Shrek"" films at DreamWorks Animation (DWA) after leaving Disney.Eisner, who was president of Paramount Pictures when Disney tapped him for the CEO job, also knew that there was value in live-action, non-G-rated movie fare. Disney had established Touchstone Films in 1983, before Eisner started, and had even had a hit with the Tom Hanks comedy ""Splash.""Eisner gave Touchstone lots of attention, and Touchstone hits such as ""Outrageous Fortune,"" ""Ruthless People"" and ""Pretty Woman"" were box-office gold.Eisner also expanded the moneymaking theme parks. He broadened Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., via a partnership with MGM for a studio-themed entertainment park, which opened in 1989.But Eisner thought even bigger. Tokyo Disneyland had opened in 1983, and while it did well, it was considered a missed opportunity because Disney had leased its characters and name to a local concessionaire rather than owning everything in the park outright. Still, Vogel said, ""It was quite lucrative, and Europe was the next logical decision."" Eisner began working on establishing a Disneyland in Paris: Euro Disney, which opened in 1992.Vogel lauds the decision to pursue global expansion. It spread Disney products to consumers around the world and reinforced the brand's iconic status.More than that, Eisner's long-distance shift meant that every interaction that a consumer had with Disney sparked another. A theme-park vacation would remind children of a love for Disney films, and re-viewing an old favorite movie could send a parent to buy a toy with a character's likeness. Some 22% of Disney's revenue came from international operations by 1991.All of those ventures were a prelude to one of Eisner's biggest steps: buying ABC/Capital Cities in 1996 for $19 billion. ""Once they were successful in being able to expand and demonstrate they could take the company to the next level and scale it, the next step was buying ABC,"" Dixon said.The acquisition got Disney a broadcast network along with TV and radio stations — plus ESPN, which at the time had 95 million worldwide viewers. ""ESPN was the crown jewel,"" Vogel said.The purchase was especially bold because it guaranteed Disney a network for its programs, Masters notes.ABC could air new Disney programming, which could be resold as reruns to cable. Yet Disney remained focused on quality entertainment rather than on churning out lots of content to dump on the network, says Cotter.The sense of rebirth touching the film animators reached the TV division as well, Cotter said: ""The more you keep a feeling of fire and ambition under a creative crowd, the more they're going to rise to the occasion.""Disney's market cap increased from $2 billion to $53 billion from 1984 to 1996. Eisner could point to 18 new businesses into which he'd led the company since taking the reins, including professional sports teams, live Broadway shows and Disney stores.""In the history of American business, this was a great group of people who complemented each other at the same time as expanding demand for American entertainment and rapidly developing technology delivered entertainment in new and different ways,"" Dixon said.

993,MGM,"A pair of reports confirming falling revenue for Macau gambling proved a losing hand for Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Macau-centric casinos.Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight said Macau gaming revenue for July fell 3.6% to $3.5 billion. The drop came amid a crackdown on practices by local lenders who allegedly used credit cards to illegally launder money. Some of those lenders have been arrested as a result.Visitors to Macau routinely borrow money to get around restrictions on the amount of cash that can be brought into the special district across the strait from Hong Kong.The crackdown includes tighter restrictions on lenders that make it harder for visitors to borrow, causing some, especially high-roller VIP gamblers, to stay away.The revenue drop was led by a 13.9% slide in VIP gaming, mostly from baccarat play. Mass market (middle class tourist) revenue rose 17%, but that was the weakest growth since the bank started tracking Macau casinos in 2010.McKnight said Macau ""revenues did not improve materially in the back half of July, which could mean mainland China's political initiatives, and potentially transit visa changes, are impacting premium mass"" gambling revenue.In a separate report, Deutsche Bank lowered its third-quarter and full-year 2014 revenue forecast for Macau.Deutsche Bank analyst Carlo Santarelli expects Q3 revenue to fall 0.9% vs. the same quarter a year ago and full year revenue to grow 6.5%, well below the region's usual growth rates, and down from his earlier outlook for 3% Q3 growth and 8.6% for the full year.Deutsche Bank also lowered its August gross gaming revenue forecast to a mild 3% increase ""to account for softer VIP volume and mass revenue trends against a tough comparison"" vs. the same month a year ago, StreetInsider quoted Santarelli as saying in the report.Las Vegas Sands shares were down more than 4% at 68.93 in Wednesday afternoon trading on the stock market today.Other large Las Vegas casinos with operations in Macau dived.

1012,MGM,"Las Vegas hit a winning streak in May as gambling revenue surged 17% compared with the same month last year. That could lift shares of Las Vegas Sands (LVS) and other Vegas-based casinos.Nevada's Gaming Control Board said Friday that gambling revenue hit $592.9 million in May, up from $505.4 million a year earlier. Year to date, its gambling revenue is up 3.9%. For Nevada statewide, including Lake Tahoe and Reno casinos in northern Nevada, revenue grew 8.1% to $970.3 million in May compared with May '13.Union Gaming analyst Robert Shore said the 17% growth figure was the highest for Las Vegas since November 2013, when revenue surged 22.6%.""The results are encouraging,"" Shore told IBD, adding, ""Las Vegas is still an aspirational place where people want to come to see shows and gamble.""Wells Fargo analyst Cameron McKnight agreed: ""We view these results positively for our Las Vegas Strip exposed coverage,"" including Sands and smaller rivals MGM Resorts International (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), which all have casinos both in Las Vegas and Chinese gambling hot spot Macau.Vegas casinos have been losing ground for years to Macau, the top global casino destination.But VIP gamblers have shied away from Macau this year amid a crackdown on lenders who provide money to visitors there, so Las Vegas may have picked up some of that high-rolling business for the month.Shore notes Las Vegas Strip baccarat revenue in May exploded, rising nearly 90% to $170.9 million.Asked whether this indicates Vegas may regain market share from Macau, he said the monthly gain was more of an event-driven improvement.

1018,MGM,"DineEquity, Inc. (DIN  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 20.Shares of the company have declined 19.6% in the past year against the industry’s 12.4% gain. A challenging operating environment in the U.S. restaurants space has been affecting the company. Revenues, comps and earnings per share also declined in the same time period.Unfortunately, the situation is expected to remain unchanged in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Let’s find out why.Tough Sales Environment Likely to ContinueDineEquity operates under the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar and International House of Pancakes (IHOP) brands.A continuing choppy sales environment in the overall restaurant space along with weak comps at both the brands might limit revenue growth. In fact, the consensus estimate for the quarter’s revenues of $148 million projects a decline of 3.9% when compared with the year-ago figure. Last quarter, total revenues of $144.7 million missed the consensus mark and decreased 7.3% year over year.DineEquity, Inc Revenue (TTM) DineEquity, Inc Revenue (TTM) | DineEquity, Inc QuoteComps to Stay Under Pressure Currently, Applebee’s casual dining restaurants are facing stiff competition from fast-food and quick service restaurants. As a result, despite various efforts to reinvigorate the brand, its comps remained weak for quite some time.Meanwhile, steps taken to revitalize the brand via increased focus on food and culinary innovation, consumer satisfaction and marketing are expected to drive comps over the long term, with an improvement likely 2018 onwards. Hence, given that 2017 was a transitional year for the brand, comps are very much likely to remain pressurized in the fourth quarter as well. Notably, the consensus estimate for Applebee's domestic system-wide comps shows a decline of 2%. Comps fell 7.7% in the previous quarter.Furthermore, comps at the IHOP brand have not been showing improvement over the last five reported quarters. Though initiatives to improve guest satisfaction via remodeling program, online ordering as well delivery services and IHOP mobile application are expected to create improved revenue channels, the results are likely to take time. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IHOP's domestic system-wide comps are expected to remain unchanged. In the preceding quarter comps fell 3.2%.Rise in Sales Initiative Expenses to Hurt Bottom lineAn increase in expenses related to sales initiatives might dent the quarter’s profits. Also, incremental investments in marketing programs and promotional activity to combat competition are expected to weigh on margins. In fact, the consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings of 64 cents reflects a year-over-year decline of a massive 53.3%. In the third quarter, earnings of 91 cents per share surpassed the consensus mark but declined 37.8% year over year.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1019,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20, before market opens.The company’s strong business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations are likely to drive the top line in the fourth quarter. However, costs associated with sales building and an alarming debt pressure might dent earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.MGM Resorts’ shares have gained 11.9% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 25.1%.Let’s look deeper into how the company will shape up in the to-be-reported quarter.Sales-Building Efforts to Drive Top LineThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.49 billion, reflecting 1.4% year-over-year growth. We believe that strong sales-building initiatives like digital technology maximization, opening of resorts and providing non-gaming activities when coupled with a robust presence, are favoring the top line.MGM Resorts utilizes various types of technology to maximize revenues and efficiency in operations. The company continues to adopt ways that drive bookings. To this end, MGM Resorts implemented an M life Rewards program for its customers at domestic resorts that can be redeemed at restaurants, box offices or M life front desk at participating properties to ensure guest loyalty. Moreover, MGM Macau’s loyalty program, Golden Lion Club meets the needs of a range of customers. Also, the company’s website, mlife.com continues to generate substantial revenues.The company’s strong domestic presence and improving tourism market in Las Vegas is also aiding the top line. Apart from gaming services, the company also includes hotel, food, beverage and entertainment that attract greater number of customers and drive revenues. These initiatives are likely to reflect in the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.MGM also derives a solid share of its revenues from Macau, the largest gaming destination in the world. Per the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues increased in all the three months of the fourth quarter, thereby continuing the revival in Macau. This, in turn, is likely to boost revenues at MGM China in the to-be-reported quarter.Debt Pressure & High Costs Likely to Dent EarningsThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is 7 cents, mirroring a 36.4% year-over-year decline.One of the factors that can affect the company’s earnings is its heavy reliance on debt financing. Although debt can be used to lever up earnings, a wrong mix of debt and equity can lead to bankruptcy. As of Sep 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were nearly $2 billion against a much higher long-term debt of $13 billion.Moreover, the company has been grappling with high labor costs and expenses associated with technological initiatives. These costs are likely to put pressure on the company’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter and hurt the bottom line.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a BeatMGM Resorts has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +42.50%.

1020,MGM,"Wyndham Worldwide Corp  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings on Feb 14, before the market opens.A diversified product portfolio, effective marketing techniques and a robust loyalty program are likely to boost the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. However, effects of the recent hurricanes might have lingered in the fourth quarter and put pressure on earnings.Meanwhile, shares of the company rallied 42.2% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 35.1%.  Let’s find out how the company’s results will look like in the fourth quarter.Factors Likely to Drive RevenuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fourth quarter is pegged at $1.40 billion, reflecting 6.2% year-over-year growth. This growth is largely attributable to the company’s strong presence across the globe that allows it to rake in additional revenues. The company’s strong loyalty program also attracts customers and should aid the top line.Through repeated acquisitions and divestitures, Wyndham is successfully expanding its presence worldwide and has further expansion plans for the Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Indian Ocean (EMEAI) region. Meanwhile, the company also gains from the collaboration between its rental brands as they continue to expand on the cross-selling of each other's product.Also, it is continuously emphasizing on marketing campaigns and partnerships, digital experiences, website development, on-property amenities and travel perks to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy. To this end, Wyndham offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry that generates 64% additional revenues for its franchisees.Moreover, Wyndham intends to keep boosting its strong proprietary distribution network through global partnerships with several industry leading online travel and vacation rental portals. These tools are expected to drive revenue in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings Likely to Raise ConcernThe consensus estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35, in line with the prior-year quarter’s reported earnings. Notably, the company’s predicted earnings in the to-be-reported quarter do not reflect the fruits of Wyndham’s recent acquisition of AmericInnand its ongoing strategic initiative of expanding the number of new owners.Although these efforts are slated to bring long-term growth for the company, high costs associated with such initiatives might pose a concern for Wyndham’s to-be-reported quarter’s margins. This in turn might dent the company’s fourth-quarter earnings.Moreover, management predicted the effects of the recent hurricanes to linger in the fourth-quarter, affecting earnings.Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatWyndham does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -1.12%.

1021,MGM,"Shake Shack Inc. (SHAK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 15, after the market closes.In the quarter, we expect the company to post an encouraging top-line performance driven by significant growth in both licensing revenues and Shack sales. However, Same-Shack sales (or comps) are likely to stay under pressure due to a soft consumer spending environment.In the last six months, Shake Shack stock has rallied 20.7% significantly outperforming the industry’s 5.1% growth.Expansion, Diversification and Digital Initiatives Should Boost ToplineThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported is pegged at $93 million, reflecting an increase of $27.4 million from the year-ago figure. Both licensing revenues and Shack sales are expected to grow in the quarter.Shake Shack’s cult following and successful expansion into various cities around the world are likely to boost Shack sales and continue driving traffic. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Shack sales is $90 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 26.8%.We also expect the company to continue cashing on the diversification of its licensing business, the resource-light and efficient model, the low-risk royalty stream and the opportunity to reach places that it could not reach domestically. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for licensing revenues in the quarter stands at $3.1 million, reflecting an improvement of 29.2% year over year.Although various sales and digital initiatives such as menu extension and innovation, limited time offerings, menu price increase along with mobile ordering Shack App for iOS bode are in place, a soft consumer spending environment in the U.S. restaurant space might limit revenue growth to some extent and hurt comps. The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the quarter’s comps to witness a decline of 1.1%. Comps grew 1.6% in the year-ago quarter.Shake Shack, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Shake Shack, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Shake Shack, Inc. QuoteCosts and Currency May Hurt ProfitabilityFor the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 5 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 44.4%. Elevated labor and pre-opening costs are likely to dent the quarter’s profitability. Further, macroeconomic and political challenges in some of the key operating markets and unfavorable foreign exchange translations might hamper the quarter’s performance.What Our Model PredictsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1022,MGM,"Marriott International, Inc. (MAR  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 14, after the bell.In the quarter, we expect the company to post an encouraging performance on both counts driven mainly by significant RevPAR (revenue per available room) growth. In fact, the company is witnessing increased RevPAR in most markets around the world over the last few quarters.Notably, over the past year, Marriott stock has rallied 56%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 35.1% growth.Higher RevPAR and Starwood Synergy to Drive the Top Line The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Marriott’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $5.6 billion. This, when compared with the year-ago actual figure, reflects growth of 3.1%. We believe that this anticipated growth will mainly be driven by decent RevPAR growth across both domestic as well as international markets owing to increased scale and distribution post Starwood purchase and strong leisure demand. In the last reported quarter, worldwide, system-wide RevPAR rose 2.1%.Increasing business and leisure travel on the back of improving economic indicators and positive employment numbers, along with strong transient demand is likely to boost performance in the quarter. Rising North American business and large international exposure bode well for the company.Cost Controls and RevPAR Growth to Boost EPS The consensus mark for adjusted EPS stands at $1, reflecting an increase of 17.6% from the year-ago actual figure. We expect higher RevPAR, solid cost controls and synergies from Starwood acquisition to contribute significantly to margin improvement, which in turn will boost EPS. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share increased 26.4% year over year.Marriott International EPS Diluted (TTM) Marriott International EPS Diluted (TTM) | Marriott International QuoteOur Model Does Not Suggest a BeatPlease note that according to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

1023,MGM,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.  (HLT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter numbers on Feb 14, before market opens.Relentless expansion and efforts to fortify global presence make Hilton a major hotelier, which is continuously gaining momentum and is set to become the world's largest hospitality company.However, significant international presence makes the company vulnerable to global economic conditions and currency translation.We note that the stock has rallied 30.3% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 27.2%.Let’s find out what is in store for Hilton in the to-be-reported quarter.Currency Translation Likely to Dent EarningsThe consensus estimate predicts earnings of 44 cents for the fourth quarter, suggesting a 37.1% decline from the year-ago quarter. Hilton’s guided range for fourth-quarter earnings was 41 cents to 45 cents.The company’s significant international presence exposes it to fluctuations in exchange rates which may hurt earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Since, Hilton’s net income is mostly sourced from foreign subsidiaries and franchisees, its bottom line may remain under pressure, given a stronger dollar.Top-Line Forecast BleakThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $2.26 billion, reflecting a 22.6% year-over-year decline. We believe that this projected revenue decline is due to weak anticipated revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth.In the United States, RevPAR growth is being dented by softer group performance and weakness in oil and gas markets, despite good leisure transient trends. In fact, the company continues to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth toward the low half of its 1%-3% system-wide range. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter RevPAR is pegged at $100 million, same as the year-ago quarter. It is also likely to decline 13.8% from the prior quarter.In the Middle East, political unrest, lower government spending and increased hotel supply continue to hurt tourism. In fact, for 2017, the company expects RevPAR growth to be flat to slightly positive in the region. Also, a cooling Chinese economy might hurt discretionary spending as well as travel. Further, business conditions in Europe are plagued by economic uncertainties in the northern region and deflation in the Eurozone.Our Quantitative Model Predicts a BeatHilton has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hilton has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1024,MGM,"Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) posted mixed fourth-quarter 2017 results, with the top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line missing the same.Adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share missed the consensus mark of 23 cents by 13% but grew 58.9% year over year. The upside was driven by higher casino revenues from Studio City and Altira Macau, partially offset by lower revenues from City of Dreams in Macau.Quarterly net revenues totaled $1,332.6 million, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1,326 million by 0.5%. Net revenues grew 12% year over year, driven by higher rolling chip revenues across all properties and increased mass market table games revenues from Studio City and City of Dreams Manila. This was partially offset by lower mass market table games revenues from City of Dreams in Macau.Melco Crown Entertainment Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Melco Crown Entertainment Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Melco Crown Entertainment Limited QuoteThough shares did not move in after-hours trading following the earnings release, the stock has gained 60.6% in the past year, outperforming its industry’s 29% rally.The company’s mass and premium mass gaming revenues are likely to drive growth in Macau business. Additionally, the anticipated completion of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge and the ongoing build-out of Cotai will boost demand for Macau services. The company’s integrated resort offerings are also likely to drive traffic and revenues.Let’s take a closer look at the quarterly results.Property PerformancesCity of Dreams Net revenues at City of Dreams were $612.6 million, down 7.3% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $169.7 million, reflecting a decline of 10.1% year over year. The deterioration can be blamed on lower mass market table games revenues.

The rolling chip win rate was 2.7%, up 10 basis points (bps) year over year and at the low end of the projected 2.7% to 3% Range.Mass market table games drop amounted to nearly $1.22 billion, up 10.5% year over year.

Net income totaled $81.2 million, up 87.5% year over year.Adjusted EBITDA was $339.8 million, up 12% year over year. The upside was mainly attributable to higher contribution from Studio City and Altira Macau driven by increased casino revenues, partially offset by lower contribution from City of Dreams in Macau.Net non-operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $58.5 million, showing a year-over-year decline of $36.8 million. Depreciation and amortization costs totaled $133.5 million in the quarter under review.Balance SheetTotal cash and bank balances as of Dec 31, 2017, were $1.5 billion, including $9.9 million bank deposits with original maturities over three months and $45.5 million restricted cash, primarily related to Studio City.Total debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, was $3.6 billion.

1026,MGM,"The Chinese economy is growing much faster than the U.S. China reported GDP growth of 6.9% in 2017 and 6.8% in the first quarter of 2018.  Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that by 2022, 76% of China’s urban population will be “middle class.”  Compared to the U.S., Chinese savings rates are high (households save nearly 40% of their incomes, compared to almost zero in the United States) and debt levels are low. Chinese consumer consumption is growing 9% annually, and at $6.5 trillion/year, it trails only the U.S. and is well in front of Japan, Germany, the U.K. and France.With a massive and growing number of people who can now afford once unobtainable luxuries like vacations, the gaming industry in China has been surging. The Chinese island of Macau, technically a “special administrative region” – meaning it is protected by the Chinese government but runs its own autonomous government -  is China’s only site for legal casino gambling.  Though gambling has existed in Macau since the 1800’s, a 2002 order relaxed a 40-year old monopoly license, paving the way for foreign casino operators to enter the market. By 2007, gaming revenues on Macau had eclipsed those of Las Vegas.MGM Resorts international (MGM  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) have all established vast resort and gambling complexes on the island.  All three beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 2018 earnings.MGM, with a large portfolio of U.S. properties, generated 18% of its first quarter profits in China, with $151M out of a total of $807M coming from the region. With earnings estimates rising, MGM Resorts is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Wynn Resorts’ first quarter earnings were $564M, with $210M of the total, or 37% coming from Macau.  Posting earnings of $2.30/share in Q1 – a surprise of 17% over the estimate of $1.96/share – Wynn is clearly a significant player in the Asian gaming landscape.  Currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), analyst expectations for 2018 are on the rise, and the consensus now stands at $8.40/share, up from $7.84/share just 30 days ago and a 54% increase over the $5.46/share they earned in 2017.The most pure China play in the gaming industry is Las Vegas Sands.  While reporting a big earnings beat last week ($1.04/share vs an expected $0.86/share), LVS earned 56% of its net profits from its 6 Macau properties.  With another 36% coming from its Singapore Marina Bay Sands resort, just over 10% of Las Vegas Sands profits come from U.S resorts, with the balance coming from the Asia-Pacific region.With 6 analyst upward revisions for 2018 in the past 7 days, LVS is a Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy). Even in a strong sector, LVS stock has outperformed, with a total return of 29% over the past year versus the gaming industry average of 18%.LVS also pays a 4.2% dividend - considerably higher than MGM and WYNN at 1.5% and 1%, respectively.Amid uncertainty about the potential effect of trade wars, Gaming companies with significant Chinese exposure are a smart way to bet on China’s continued economic expansion while avoiding the political impacts on traditional industrials.

1027,MGM,"With Q1 earnings season in full swing, some investors may get easily carried away by earnings beat and quarterly performances. One may think it’s quite an easy task to choose stocks during this time.Actually, it’s the opposite. Just because a company has performed well in a particular quarter, it can’t be picked for investment. Thorough research is required before investing in any stock.For an individual investor, going through financials for each and every company and then deciding which ones to buy can be a daunting task. So here, some expert advice could be helpful. By following broker recommendations, one can find investment worthy stocks.Brokers have deeper insight into what’s happening in a particular company as they directly communicate with management. Also, they have a comprehensive understanding of the overall industry.Brokers research on a company’s publicly available financial statements, listen to conference calls and engage in talks directly with top management. At times, they even talk with customers to gauge what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company.Further, brokers understand the company fundamentals and try to place them against the present economic background to figure out how it may fare as an investment. Hence, after thorough research, brokers decide to rate that particular company’s stock. So, when an analyst upgrades a stock, one can easily depend on it.However, solely depending on analysts’ upgrades is not the right way to build an investment portfolio. One should also take into consideration certain other factors to ensure robust returns.Picking the Winning StrategyWe have a screening strategy that will help in your search for potential winners:Broker Rating Upgrades (4 weeks) of 1% or more: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks.Current Price greater than 5: The stocks must be trading above $5.Average 20-day Volume greater than 100,000: A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank equal to #1 or #2: No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) have a proven record of success.

The company had reported earnings of 36 cents in the prior-year quarter.Total revenues of $2.82 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of $2.80 billion by 0.7% and increased 3.9% year over year.

The deal is expected to close in summer this year.MGM Resorts International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise MGM Resorts International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | MGM Resorts International Quote MGM ChinaMGM China’s net revenues increased 25% year over year to $596 million, courtesy of $85 million net revenue contribution from recently opened, MGM Cotai.Opening of MGM Cotai also facilitated a 20% year-over-year increase in Main floor table games win. VIP table games win rose 26% from the prior-year quarter primarily driven by a 24% increase in turnover at MGM Macau.MGM China’s adjusted property EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) increased 5% to $152 million from $145 million in the prior-year quarter. However, adjusted property EBITDA margin came in at 25.5%, a decline of 500 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 9.2% in the quarter.Domestic OperationsMGM Resorts owns and operates several properties in Las Vegas. It also owns a number of assets in Mississippi and Michigan.Net revenues of $2.1 billion from the company's domestic resorts declined 1% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, casino revenues rose 2%, owing to a 6% increase in table games win and a 2% increase in slots win, which again was driven by an increase in slots volume at MGM National Harbor.Room revenues fell 5% due to a 4.3% decrease in RevPAR (revenue per available room) at the company's Las Vegas Strip resorts.

Occupancy dipped 200 bps.Operating income at the company's wholly owned domestic resorts deteriorated 5.3% to $451 million. The decline in operating income was due to a decrease in room revenues and food and beverage revenues owing to a decline in occupied room nights and lower convention base at the company's Las Vegas Strip resorts. Also, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% year over year to $616 million.Income From Unconsolidated Affiliates – CityCenter HoldingsMGM’s urban complex, CityCenter operates through two segments — Resort and Residential.

1029,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry. The company’s properties are well-diversified within United states and Macau, which is the only gambling destination in China.MGM Resorts’ earnings are benefitting from higher demand at its properties in Las Vegas on the back of improving employment rate trends and increasing tourism numbers in the region. Moreover, diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options bode well.Notably, gross gaming revenues increased in all the three months of the quarter, thereby continuing the revival in Macau. However, despite significant improvement in the VIP market, the company’s VIP business has been largely struggling. Increased competition from new openings in Cotai may further hamper the company’s market share and business and result in underperformance at MGM China.Investors should note that the consensus estimate for MGM has been moving slightly upwards over the last 60 days. However, MGM’s earnings have not been strong over the past few quarters. The company posted negative earnings surprises in one of the last four quarters, with an average miss of 10.79%.MGM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) but that could change following MGM Resorts’ earnings report which was just released.

1030,MGM,"Welcome to the tenth episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we discuss the current American sports betting landscape after the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Christie v. NCAA last week.The case, in which the state of New Jersey and governor Chris Christie question the constitutionality of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA), could prove to be a seminal moment in the legalization of sports betting in the U.S.Sports gambling is currently illegal almost everywhere outside of Nevada. But if America’s highest court rules in favor of New Jersey—which many legal experts expect—Christie v. NCAA could eventually lead to more widespread legalization of sports betting throughout the country.The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans currently bet more than $150 billion on sports every year. This massive figure is on the lower end of some illegal gambling estimates, as the NBA’s pro-sports gambling commissioner, Adam Silver, noted that the industry could be worth $400 billion in his now-famous New York Times op-ed.The case threatens to shake up the Las Vegas sports betting world, but casino and gaming giants like MGM (MGM  -  Free Report), Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report), Caesars (CZR  -  Free Report), and others could expand in order to get in on the proliferation of sports betting. However, U.K.-based betting companies such as William Hill WMH, PaddyPower (PDYPY  -  Free Report), and Ladbrokes  might also be ready to grab a share of the U.S. sports betting market.Still, as the world shifts online, sports betting has also transitioned to the internet and mobile apps. This has led a few of the world’s biggest tech companies, such as Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), to put in patent applications in the betting category that could be of great importance if sports betting is legal throughout much of the U.S.The Supreme Court’s ruling is not expected until sometime in spring 2018. But no matter what happens, it is likely to change the multibillion-dollar sports betting industry and could leave investors with a plethora of options to get in on the action.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1033,MGM,"The Q1 reporting cycle is underway with 87 S&P 500 members having released their quarterly numbers (as of Apr 20). Per the latest Earnings Preview, 82.8% surpassed earnings estimates while 67.8% beat revenue estimates and 62.1% outpaced both the counts. Further, total earnings of these companies increased 25% from the same period last year on 10.7% higher revenues.The report projects an 18.3% year-over-year rise in total earnings for S&P 500 companies, with revenues likely to increase 7.7%. This compares favorably with the year-over-year increase of 13.4% for earnings in the fourth quarter but unfavorably with 8.6% year-over-year revenue growth in the last reported quarter.Consumer Discretionary Sector on Growth TrajectoryLike some other sectors, the widely diversified Consumer Discretionary sector is likely to put up a stellar show in Q1 earnings.Currently, the domestic economy is favorable for the consumer discretionary sector on increased demand for goods and services. According to the Fed’s latest forecast, the economy will grow at a reasonable rate of 2.7% in 2018. Unemployment is predicted at 3.8% for 2018. Moreover, high real disposable income and low inflation are resulting in improved purchasing behavior. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the highest consumer spending in three years.Total earnings for the sector are expected to increase 7.2% in the first quarter, up from 0.8% in the last reported quarter. Revenues are projected to grow 6.8%, higher than 4.6% growth recorded in the preceding quarter. Even though margins are not  expected to grow for the sector in the first quarter, it compares favorably with 0.4% decline in the fourth quarter of 2017.Promising Gaming Industry Scenario The Zacks Gaming industry, under Consumer Discretionary, has performed well in the past year. The industry gained 24.1%, outpacing the S&P 500’s rally of 12.2%. We expect the industry to have grown in the first quarter on increasing demand for gaming services and rapid expansion of these service providers. Also, according to Research and Markets, the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 10.16% in the 2017-2021 period.Within this growing market, Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) is the distinguished owner and operator of 22 gaming entertainment properties. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Apr 26, after market close. Over the past year, the company has gained 50.7% outperforming the industry.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 34 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.3%.

The company’s shares grew 21.1% in the past year, lagging the industry.MGM Resorts’ top line in the first quarter is expected to be driven by strong business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high-quality assets and attractive property locations. Further, maximization of digital technology is likely to boost the company’s performance. (Read More: MGM Resorts Q1 Earnings: Macau Operations Hold Key).The consensus estimate pegs first-quarter earnings at 31 cents, reflecting a decline of 18.4% year over year.

However, with the recent Toys “R” Us liquidation, we expect the industry to grow at a much slower pace for quite some time.First-quarter results for the famous toymaker Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) will be affected, as a considerable portion of its revenues were generated from sales to Toys ""R"" Us. (Read More: Factors Setting the Tone for Mattel's Q1 Earnings).

A strong economy, higher income and increased consumer confidence have driven demand for both leisure and business travel. The supply-demand environment in the United States has been favorable since 2010, with growth in demand outpacing supply growth. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) expects demand (2.1% rise) to outpace supply (increase of 1.9%) in 2018. Moreover, per a report by Deloitte, the hotel industry is expected to sustain strong 5-6% growth throughout 2018.The Zacks Hotels and Motels industry has rallied 30.1% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500.Hotel bigwig Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.

The hotel chain’s aggressive expansion strategies and industry-leading loyalty program are expected to have majorly aided revenues in the first quarter.

This exceeds the company’s expected earnings in the range of 43-47 cents per share for the quarter to be reported.Hilton carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of +3.09%, a combination that increases the odds of a beat. Also, the company has gained grew 40.2% in the past year.Another major hotelier Extended Stay America, Inc. (STAY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after market close.

1035,MGM,"Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) experienced marginal gains on Monday, just one day before the company is scheduled to report its first quarter financial results. This climb is part of a larger 9% surge over the last four weeks, which might suggest that investors are expecting big things from the resort and casino giant in Q1.Wynn looks like it could be set for even more changes on top after Elaine Wynn recently demanded that the company make changes to the board. She asked that one of Wynn’s directors overseeing the internal investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn be removed, noting he is too closely allied to Mr. Wynn.This move could go a long way in further distancing Wynn from its embattled former CEO. But beyond a positive public relations move, investors will want to understand what to expect from Wynn’s first quarter to see if the stock might be worth buying before the company reports its Q1 results on Tuesday afternoon.Latest Outlook & ValuationOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Wynn’s revenues to climb by 15.5% to $1.70 billion. Investors might be even more pleased to note that the company’s earnings are projected to reach $1.96 per share, which would mark a 58% expansion from the year-ago period.Of course, top and bottom line growth estimates are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Wynn reports its first quarter financial results. We can also turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.According to these consensus estimates, Wynn is on track to report Macau revenues of $638 million in Q1. This would mark a roughly 34% climb from the year-ago period, in a unit that is quickly becoming one of the resort giant’s most important businesses. Last quarter, Wynn reported $618.6 million in Macau revenue, which marked a 24.1% jump.Heading into Monday, Wynn was trading with a Forward P/E of 23.2, which marked a slight premium to the “Gaming” industry’s average of 21.3. With that said, the company is currently offering investors strong comparative value against its median Forward P/E of 25.1. Wynn also sits well below the 29.3x forward earnings it was trading at near the end of January.  Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance Wynn has to surprise with better-than-expected earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Wynn is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and holds an Earnings ESP of 5.45%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $2.07 per share, which comes in 11 cents above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, Wynn is a stock that could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates.Surprise HistoryWynn’s earnings surprise history and the effect that these surprises have had on its share prices are two other important factors to consider ahead of the casino power’s first quarter earnings report.Wynn Resorts, Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Wynn Resorts, Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Wynn Resorts, Limited QuoteWe can see that Wynn has posted strong earnings results over the last year, posting an average earnings surprise of 22.43% during this period. However, these beats haven’t always led to positive momentum immediately following Wynn’s quarterly earnings release.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report.

1036,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before market opens. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 100%.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 31 cents, which is lower than 38 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, the consensus mark has witnessed an upward revision of 1 cent over the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of nearly $2,799 million, up 3.3% from the prior-year quarter.Let’s take a look at how the company’s top and bottom lines will shape up in the to-be-reported quarter.Factors at PlayMGM Resorts’ top line in the first quarter is expected to be driven by strong business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations. Further, maximization of digital technology is likely to boost the company’s performance. In fact, over the past few years, MGM Resorts has taken various initiatives to align every recognized brand into one global entertainment brand. This, in turn, resulted in a disciplined business model with a unified view of strategy.Moreover, MGM Resorts derives a solid share of its revenues from Macau — the largest gaming destination in the world — which is likely to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Per the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues increased in all the three months of the first quarter, thus continuing with the revival in Macau. This might boost first-quarter revenues at MGM China.However, MGM Resorts, which owns and operates several properties in Las Vegas, is likely to witness revenues decline in the region. The company had earlier stated that revenues from Las Vegas are likely to decline in the range of 3-5%. Moreover, revenue per available room growth (ReVPAR) from the region is expected to decrease by 4-6%.On the earnings front, the company is likely to witness a sharp decline in the first quarter. Also, MGM Resorts has been grappling with high labor costs and expenses associated with technological initiatives. These costs are likely to put pressure on the company’s margins in the to-be-reported quarter and hurt the bottom line. Higher costs associated with Monte Carlo construction might weigh on the company’s margins as well.Furthermore, heavy reliance on debt financing remains a concern. The company’s cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017 were nearly $1.4 billion compared with a much higher long-term debt of $12.8 billion. Therefore, any severe slowdown in future macroeconomic and credit market conditions are likely to affect the company’s ability to pay or refinance its debt.MGM Resorts International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise MGM Resorts International Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | MGM Resorts International QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that MGM Resorts is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

James Pitaro, who filled the vacancy left by John Skipper, joined the sports network at a rocky and highly important time.Pitaro’s first big challenges will be rolling out the company’s new streaming platform and dealing with low viewership numbers for some its prime programming, including SportsCenter and Monday Night Football.

1042,MGM,"Perhaps it is because trading stocks can often mirror the thrill of winning big at the blackjack tables, or maybe it is because Las Vegas conjures images of the world’s most flashy brands and businessmen. Regardless of the reason, it is clear that gambling stocks are always among the most popular on Wall Street.Luckily for investors, now is also a great time to be buying gambling stocks, as continued Vegas strength, a great recovery in Macau, and overall international interest in gaming have led to rising share prices. What’s more, the U.S. Supreme Court just overturned a decades-long ban on sports betting, opening the door for many new legal gambling avenues soon.According to our Zacks Industry Rank data, the overall “Gaming” industry has outpaced the S&P 500 over the past year and on a year-to-date basis. With casino stocks this hot right now, investors are not going to want to miss out.Luckily, we can use Zacks’ proven stock-picking methods to find solid stocks in any industry. Check out these casino stocks today:1. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report)Melco receives the majority of its revenue from Macau, so the company has benefitted from the continued recovery in the region. Analysts are warming on MLCO, with three positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates coming in the past 60 days. This has moved the Zacks Consensus Estimate 18 cents higher and earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Melco is now expected to witness earnings growth of 45% in 2018. The stock is trading with a slightly-stretched P/E of 22.6, but its PEG of 1.9 implies that investors are still getting a decent price for its growth trajectory. The company’s dividend yield of 1.8% is also worth mentioning, and that could be on the cusp of improving thanks to cash flow growth of 29%. 2. Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report)Penn National Gaming is an operator of a number of casino and gambling properties in North America, specifically located in smaller markets and non-Vegas gambling hotspots. Recently, analysts at Morgan Stanley called the Supreme Court gambling verdict as a “slight positive for regional gaming stocks” and named PENN as one that could benefit the most.Penn National is also currently holding a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The stock has also been one of the hottest gaming picks on Wall Street recently, surging more than 30% in the past three months and nearly 64% in the last year. Still, with new growth catalysts ahead, PENN could very well break higher. 3. Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report)With properties like the Venetian and the Parisian, Las Vegas Sands is the epitome of luxury and style in the casino industry. LVS is only sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, but the company has solid growth prospects and feels like a long-term play for a variety of reasons. The stock has an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system, and management looks to be balancing the books well.Las Vegas Sands is generating cash flow growth of 21% right now. The firm is now bringing in about $4.63 in cash per share, more than quadrupling its industry’s average. LVS also boasts a better-than-average net margin of 28% and RoE 36%.

1045,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry. The company’s properties are well-diversified within United states and Macau, which is the only gambling destination in China.MGM Resorts’ earnings are benefitting from higher demand at its properties in Las Vegas on the back of improving employment rate trends and increasing tourism numbers in the region. Moreover, diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options bode well.Notably, gross gaming revenues increased in all the three months of the quarter, thereby continuing the revival in Macau. However, despite significant improvement in the VIP market, the company’s VIP business has been largely struggling. Increased competition from new openings in Cotai may further hamper the company’s market share and business and result in underperformance at MGM China.Investors should note that the consensus estimate for MGM has been moving slightly downwards over the last 60 days.

Third quarter earnings season has 81% of S&P500 companies completed.To date, the market has been rewarding upside earnings surprises less than average and is punishing downside earnings surprises more than average.Why? Trump tax ebullience got this market ahead of itself on valuation. The forward P/E ratio is at 18.0. That’s high, folks.Yet, other than for insurance companies, results have been good. The earnings growth rate for the third quarter is at +5.9%.48 S&P500 companies report results in the week ahead. Interesting names to watch include:Monday: Knight Swift Transportation (KNX  -  Free Report), Manitowoc (MTW  -  Free Report)Tuesday: Hecla Mining (HL  -  Free Report), Royal Caribbean (RCL  -  Free Report)Wednesday: MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report), Regeneron Pharma (REGN  -  Free Report)Thursday: Brookfield Asset Management , Macy’s (M  -  Free Report)Friday: Arcelor Mittal (MT  -  Free Report)For the rest of the world, Reuter’s bureau in London identified five World Market Themes.(1) President Trump Tours AsiaU.S. President Donald Trump is on his first trip to Asia. He has stopped in Japan already, and will go on to South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.Security concerns in the Korean peninsula and the South China Sea will grab a lot of attention.But investors will also look at trade talks, with Trump particularly keen to address his country’s vast trade deficit with China that Beijing calls unintentional, but which he calls “horrible.”(2) Bitcoin Talk Bubbles OverInvestors’ appetite for bitcoin appears to have no bounds.The digital currency climbed above $7,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, after an astronomical increase of more than 900 percent over the past 12 months. News that the world’s biggest derivatives exchange operator, CME Group, was set to launch bitcoin futures was seen as a significant step in bitcoin’s road to mainstream adoption, driving the latest surge in price.But with high-profile investors such as Warren Buffett and the head of Credit Suisse saying in recent days that the bitcoin market represents a bubble, could that be set to burst in spectacular fashion?What is to stop a rival cryptocurrency — of which there is a potentially unlimited quantity — from becoming investors’ digital currency of choice?With bitcoin now worth more than $120 billion, more than Citi or Goldman Sachs, the consequences of a sudden crash could be severe.(3) The JOLTS Labor Market Survey Is Out for the USAThe Nov. 7th release of the September Job Opening and Labor Turnover (JOLT) survey will show whether demand for labor has held up or is in need of an — ahem — jolt.At the moment, the ratio of job openings versus quit jobs is close to 2 to 1, hovering in a range close to the all-time peak of 2.12 hit in July 2015.(4) Italian Bank Earnings Are OutItaly’s biggest banks, including UniCredit, Intesa and Banco BPM, report their latest earnings and they could make encouraging reading following the euro zone-wide pick-up in growth and a strong rally in Italian debt over the last month.It certainly seems a long time since last year’s bail out of problem child Monte dei Paschi di Siena. It is now back in the market, and the main Italian banks are comfortably outperforming their euro zone peers in share performance, so the results round should be telling.(5) Ah Yes, VENEZUELA!After what feels like years of speculation, OPEC member Venezuela’s socialist leader Nicolas Maduro wants to restructure the ailing country’s foreign debt.Maduro has invited Venezuelan bondholders to a Nov. 13th meeting in Caracas to discuss the matter, although getting clearance from the compliance department could be interesting for the bankers involved.Vice President Tareck El Aissami, who is on a U.S. blacklist for alleged drug trafficking, said the country remained committed to paying all its debt but wanted to reformulate terms with creditors, which is likely to mean some lively bouts of price discovery.Top Zacks Rank Stocks(1) Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report): This is the $352 billion market cap oil giant.

1047,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 numbers on Nov 8, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings owing to an improvement in revenues. Also, MGM Resorts has a decent earnings surprise history.Evidently, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 161.64%.MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise  MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise | MGM Resorts International QuoteHowever, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of 33 cents reflects a year-over-year decline of 43.1%.Also, a look at the company’s price performance shows that it underperformed the industry. Shares of MGM Resorts have gained around 2.8% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 15.6%.Will the upcoming earnings release give a boost to MGM Resorts’ stock? Well, this depends largely on whether the firm is able to post a beat in the third quarter.Our quantitative model predicts that MGM Resorts does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: MGM Resorts has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: MGM Resorts has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  As it is we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsPer the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues increased in all the three months of the quarter, thereby continuing the revival in Macau. This, in turn, is likely to boost revenues at MGM China in the third quarter.Despite significant improvement in the VIP market, the company’s VIP business has been largely struggling and this may weigh on MGM China’s results. Increased competition from new openings in Cotai may further hamper the company’s market share and business in the quarter and result in underperformance at MGM China.Meanwhile, higher demand at its properties in Las Vegas on the back of improving employment rate trends and increasing tourism numbers in the region are expected to propel results. However, higher-than-normal table games hold and solid revenue per available room (RevPAR) growth at Las Vegas Strip resorts in prior-year quarter is set to provide tough year-over-year comparisons in the third quarter.Moreover, higher than anticipated disruption at Monte Carlo as the property undergoes its transformation to Park MGM is likely to hamper results. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the property’s revenues is pegged at $68 million, reflecting a decrease of 6.8% on a year-over-year basis.Nevertheless, given its strong event calendar, the company expects Las Vegas Strip revenues in the third quarter to increase slightly, with its strip RevPAR expected to improve 2-3%. Additionally, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options is likely to boost the top line. Notably, the consensus estimate for the quarter’s revenues is pegged at $2.77 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 10.2%.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.97% and sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1048,MGM,"Stocks of leading casino operators in Las Vegas took a beating on Oct 2, after at least 59 people lost their lives and more than 500 were wounded in a mass shooting.  On Oct 1, a gunman opened fire on attendees at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.Consequently, share price of MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) that owns Mandalay Bay declined nearly 6% in yesterday’s trading session.Shares of Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) have also decreased 1.2% and 0.04%, respectively. Meanwhile, after initially trending down, shares of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) regained most of the losses and gained 1.3%.What’s the Fuss About?The Las Vegas Strip has been recording high occupancy rates over the past year. The improvement in employment rate and rise in tourism numbers have been boosting demand at the casino companies’ properties in the region and adding to their top-line growth.Reportedly, Las Vegas’ casinos, nightclubs and shopping attract roughly 3.5 million visitors each year from around the world.Investors are thus apprehensive that tourists might choose to stay away from Las Vegas in the wake of what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.Our TakeMGM Resorts owns and operates 13 resorts and casinos on the Las Vegas Strip. In fact, this casino operator has maximum U.S. exposure compared with its peers and is thus severely affected by the incident. Additionally, a potential revenue loss from its Mandalay Bay property might have an impact on the company’s fourth-quarter results.We believe the latest rampage that rattled the Strip might bring the region’s revenues under pressure and in turn hamper casino operators’ performance in the near term. Thus, we will have to wait and see what impact it has on casino companies’ properties on and around the Las Vegas Strip.While Wynn Resorts currently holds a Zacks Ranks #2 (Buy), MGM Resorts, Boyd Gaming and Las Vegas Sands carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

However, prior to that, its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the three quarters with the trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise coming in at 6.32%.Pool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Pool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Pool Corporation QuoteMarkedly, these earnings beats along with solid fundamentals helped Pool’s shares gain 20.2% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s 12.9% rally.Will the stock’s rally continue post third-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Pool this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Pool has an Earnings ESP of -1.01%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pool carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Notably, we caution you against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Likely to Affect Q3 ResultsPool marked year-over-year growth in sales, gross profit and operating earnings for the 29th consecutive quarter in the second quarter of 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, backed by solid business sales growth and favorable trends in the housing market.Furthermore, the company’s leading market share position and opportunistic expansion strategies is likely to propel the top-line growth. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter’s earnings and sales is projected at $1.16 and nearly $728 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 12.3% and 5.3%, respectively.Also, continuous growth in the remodel and replacement sectors of its business is a major positive. In addition, stronger consumer discretionary spending along with a tight supply situation are expected to have driven continued growth in new pool construction.However, unfavorable seasonality might hamper the company’s business and, in turn, impact sales. Meanwhile, macroeconomic headwinds given the company’s considerable international presence along with higher expenses might dent the quarter’s profitability.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc.

1051,MGM,"On Oct 9, we issued an updated research report on leading international developer of multi-use integrated resorts primarily operating in the United States and Asia, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report).Diversification – The Need of the HourWe note that diversification is the need of the hour and Las Vegas Sands is thus consistently trying to diversify its revenue sources. The company remains focused on a convention-based Integrated Resort business model that helps in generating the most diversified set of cash flows and profit from non-gaming segments while bringing unsurpassed economic and diversification benefits to the regions in which it operates. In fact, non-gaming revenues have been relatively better over the past few quarters.We also believe that properties like Sands Cotai Central and The Parisian Macao are likely to increase the company’s dominance in the Cotai strip, a region where Las Vegas Sands already has a considerable presence. The company would be able to significantly grow its retail business and meetings, incentive, convention and exhibitions (MICE) space. Both these areas of business will aid non-gaming revenues and appeal to middle-class travelers. These projects thus demonstrate the company’s commitment toward diversifying its business as these are not solely meant for gaming.Meanwhile, the company is concentrating on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties in order to drive segmental performance. The improvement in employment rate and the rise in tourism numbers in the region have been boosting demand at the company’s properties in the region and are expected to continue doing so. Further, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options is likely to contribute significantly to revenues.Macao’s Recovery & Regulatory IssuesA tough operating environment in Macao weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. However, Macao's gambling revenues have recovered and have been improving since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers. Evidently, Macao’s gaming revenues were up in September, thus marking the 14th consecutive month of gains and signaling the casino hub’s recovery.In fact, Las Vegas Sands’ Macao operations is experiencing strong growth in both its mass gaming and non-gaming segments. Also, its industry-leading Cotai Strip property portfolio in Macao is witnessing strong visitation and higher hotel occupancy rates buoyed by the addition of The Parisian Macao. The resort is expected to continue to attract tourists and leisure gamblers, thereby boosting revenues.However, the Macao government recently collaborated with the mainland authorities to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing and beefed up its anti-money laundering framework with a much wider scope and stringent compliance measures. Macao's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) is increasing its audits of the junket industry over concerns of money laundering as well.Thus, this latest crackdown may hamper Macao’s revenue growth and reverse the 14 month streak of year-over-year gains and weigh on Las Vegas Sands’ performance.Bottom LineShares of Las Vegas Sands have jumped 15.7% in the last six months, underperforming 17.3% gain of the industry it belongs to. Even so, upward estimate revisions for the current-quarter and full-year earnings reflect analysts’ optimism about the stock’s prospects. Given the ongoing recovery in gaming revenues in Macao and continued improvement in the Las Vegas business, the stock should perform well in the quarters ahead.However, Las Vegas Sands’ The Parisian Macao along with other upcoming resorts at the Cotai Strip faces extreme peer pressure from several Chinese casino operators and other U.S.-based companies. Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) opened a full-scale integrated resort, Wynn Palace, on the Cotai Strip for over $4 billion in August 2016. MGM Resorts International’s (MGM  -  Free Report) $2.9 billion casino hotel is also set to open in Cotai in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe these openings might pose a huge threat to the company’s business in the region.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is well poised for growth given a solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets, attractive property locations and a fairly favorable macro environment.A better-ranked stock in this sector is Churchill Downs Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.For 2017, Churchill Downs’ EPS is expected to increase 22.6%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1052,MGM,"Late Sunday evening, the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was going strong, with country artist Jason Aldean headlining for a crowd of about 22,000 concertgoers. But all of a sudden, bullets began raining down, and chaos ensued: a lone gunman, situated on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, had opened fire on attendees.58 people have been killed so far, and 515 injured, making this the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history (Updated).Police say the suspected shooter, Stephen Craig Paddock, had at least 10 weapons with him inside the hotel room. While motive is unclear at this point, authorities do believe Paddock killed himself prior to police entry.Flights in and out of Las Vegas’ McCarran International Airport were temporarily halted because of the shooting, and agents for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have responded to the scene; the FBI, too, is assisting with the investigation.Monday morning saw shares of some of the biggest casino stocks react to the news.

1053,MGM,"The appetite for discussing stocks and markets ahead of today’s opening bell is substantially curbed by news reports that Las Vegas’ Mandalay Bay was struck by the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. In what was clearly an act of terror, at least 50 people attending were murdered and as many as 400 are currently recovering from their bullet wounds from the attacker’s automatic rifle.At an open-air concert performed by country music star Jason Aldean (who was not one of those injured), the attacker fired into the large crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Casino, which is owned by MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report), randomly hitting attendees of the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival. According to reports, a SWAT team blew open the locked door to the room where the muzzle flashes had appeared out the window, and the suspect, nearby Mesquite, NV resident 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was shot dead, putting an end to the onslaught. His female companion is reportedly in custody now.Of course, there are always plenty of questions following senseless tragedies such as these. Currently, police believe the suspect had no direct ties to any domestic militia groups. Further investigations, including those tracking the hotel lobby where the suspect likely checked into the hotel without his weaponry having been detected, are expected to follow in the coming days. We extend our deepest sympathies to those victims and their families of this horrid incident, which is called the worst attack on U.S. soil since the morning of September 11, 2001.Over the weekend, 800 protestors were injured after attacks by riot police in Catalonia — a northeastern region in Spain, home to well-known destinations like the city of Barcelona — following a resounding “Yes” vote there for Catalonia to declare its independence from Spain. Those having led the independence campaign have stated they will appeal to the European Union (EU) to investigate human rights violations on behalf of the Spanish state.According to reports, 90% of Catalonians — known as the Catalan locally — voted to separate the region from Spain, and demonstrations in the streets afterward resulted in truncheons and rubber bullets striking unarmed citizens. Some reports of activists provoking police have also been reported, but many more state that it was Spanish government forces who were the aggressors in this incident.We will have the rest of this week to discuss an upcoming tax plan first announced by President Trump and cabinet officials like Steve Mnuchin, as well as expectations for Q3 earnings season, which opens the spigots of information mid-next-week. But for today, we use this space to mourn the victims of these two tragic events, which already look to have numbered more than 1000 overall.As far as what we might expect as fallout from these events, we may argue that the Catalonian attack may have more repercussions. It’s unlikely that the U.S. will make any changes toward gun ownership as a result of this mass killing, and the suspect, being a local Caucasian man, does not look at this time to be inviting suspicions that the attack was in any way ISIS or al-Qaida oriented. But should the EU penalize the already economically-troubled Spain on human rights grounds in the coming weeks or months, perhaps this could add to concerns regarding the viability of the Eurozone in a way not seen since a year ago last summer, when Great Britain voted to exit the EU (“Brexit”).

1054,MGM,"Monday, October 2, 2017The appetite for discussing stocks and markets ahead of today’s opening bell is substantially curbed by news reports that Las Vegas’ Mandalay Bay was struck by the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. In what was clearly an act of terror, at least 50 people attending were murdered and as many as 400 are currently recovering from their bullet wounds from the attacker’s automatic rifle.At an open-air concert performed by country music star Jason Aldean (who was not one of those injured), the attacker fired into the large crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Casino, which is owned by MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report), randomly hitting attendees of the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival. According to reports, a SWAT team blew open the locked door to the room where the muzzle flashes had appeared out the window, and the suspect, nearby Mesquite, NV resident 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, was shot dead, putting an end to the onslaught. His female companion is reportedly in custody now.Of course, there are always plenty of questions following senseless tragedies such as these. Currently, police believe the suspect had no direct ties to any domestic militia groups. Further investigations, including those tracking the hotel lobby where the suspect likely checked into the hotel without his weaponry having been detected, are expected to follow in the coming days. We extend our deepest sympathies to those victims and their families of this horrid incident, which is called the worst attack on U.S. soil since the morning of September 11, 2001.Over the weekend, 800 protestors were injured after attacks by riot police in Catalonia — a northeastern region in Spain, home to well-known destinations like the city of Barcelona — following a resounding “Yes” vote there for Catalonia to declare its independence from Spain.

1055,MGM,"It was a busy week for the gambling industry, with some of the major companies witnessing a decline after May gambling revenues from the Macau region missed analyst expectations. Shares of companies such as Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) declined following the news.On the other hand, stocks like MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) and Boyd Gaming Corp. (BYD  -  Free Report) ended the last week on a positive note. While MGM Resorts signed an agreement to buy Empire City Casino's race track and casino, Boyd Gaming completed the acquisition of Lattner Entertainment Group Illinois, LLC.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMacau’s Lower-Than-Expected Gambling RevenuesGambling revenues from Macau increased 12.1% to 25.5 billion patacas ($3.16 billion) in May. The metric not only lagged analyst expectations but also declined 0.9% from the figure registered in April. Although gambling revenues were up for the 22nd straight months, it still remains below the highest level achieved in 2012.A tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. In fact, the crackdown on corruption in China compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau.As a result, footfall declined at the local casinos, leading to a constant decrease in gaming revenues. A slowdown in China, tighter visa policies, political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes. Nevertheless, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016, with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers.MGM Resorts to Buy Empire City CasinoMGM Resorts and MGM Growth Properties LLC have reached an agreement to buy Empire City Casino's race track and casino. If Empire City gets a license for live table games on or before Dec 31, 2022 and MGM Resorts accepts it by Dec 31, 2024, then the latter will pay an additional amount of $50 million to the former. Valued at $850 million, the deal is expected to close in first-quarter 2019.On completion of the deal, MGP will acquire the developed real property related to Empire City from MGM Resorts and will lease it to a subsidiary of the same. MGM Resorts subsidiary will control the property. The deal will help the company solidify its position on the East Coast, where MGM Resorts has been constantly increasing its presence over the past two years. MGM Resorts said that “With Empire City's approximately 40 percent share of gross gaming revenues in the market, we believe there are significant opportunities for MGM Resorts to further drive growth.” The company expects the deal to be value assertive within the first year of closing. In 2017, Empire City recorded net revenues of nearly $230 million and $70 million in adjusted EBITDA.We believe this latest buyout will be a major growth driver for the company. This is because Empire City Casino not only has 5,200 slots and electronic table games but also offers live and simulcast horse racing, besides numerous dining outlets.MGM Resorts has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Boyd Gaming Closes Lattner Entertainment Group BuyoutBoyd Gaming has completed the previously announced acquisition of Lattner Entertainment Group. Following the news, the company’s shares gained 2.3% on May 1, 2018. The value of the deal was $100 million. Currently, in Illinois, Lattner Entertainment operates approximately 1,000 gaming units in 220 locations. This acquisition is expected to help the company diversify its business.Boyd Gaming has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major gambling stocks in the past week and the last six months: In the last five trading sessions, Boyd Gaming, Las Vegas Sands Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. (MCRI  -  Free Report) and MGM Resorts were the top gainers.Also, key sector participants like Pinnacle Entertainment, Wynn Resorts Melco Resorts, Las Vegas Sands and Boyd Gaming were the major gainers in the past six months.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

In fact, the court ruling has opened the door for other states to enter sports betting business. MGM Resorts had said that “We have already established the architecture to deploy sports betting as soon as the states allow us to do that.”Stock PerformanceFollowing the news, not much movement was witnessed in the stock price. However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company has lost 8% against the industry’s increase of 2.5% in the past six months.Stocks such as Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report), Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) and Penn National Gaming, Inc.

1057,MGM,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MGM due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.MGM Resorts Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat EstimatesMGM Resorts reported adjusted earnings of 34 cents for the first quarter of 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at earnings of 31 cents. The company had reported earnings of 36 cents in the prior-year quarter.Total revenues of $2.82 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of $2.80 billion by 0.7% and increased 3.9% year over year. The improvement was backed by higher revenues at MGM China.The company also announced that CityCenter Holdings — a prominent venture between MGM Resorts and Infinity World Development — entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas and adjacent retail parcels for approximately $214 million in cash. The deal is expected to close in summer this year.MGM ChinaMGM China’s net revenues increased 25% year over year to $596 million, courtesy of $85 million net revenue contribution from recently opened, MGM Cotai.Opening of MGM Cotai also facilitated a 20% year-over-year increase in Main floor table games win. VIP table games win rose 26% from the prior-year quarter primarily driven by a 24% increase in turnover at MGM Macau.MGM China’s adjusted property EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) increased 5% to $152 million from $145 million in the prior-year quarter. However, adjusted property EBITDA margin came in at 25.5%, a decline of 500 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 9.2% in the quarter.Domestic OperationsMGM Resorts owns and operates several properties in Las Vegas. It also owns a number of assets in Mississippi and Michigan.Net revenues of $2.1 billion from the company's domestic resorts declined 1% from the prior-year quarter. Notably, casino revenues rose 2%, owing to a 6% increase in table games win and a 2% increase in slots win, which again was driven by an increase in slots volume at MGM National Harbor.Room revenues fell 5% due to a 4.3% decrease in RevPAR (revenue per available room) at the company's Las Vegas Strip resorts. Las Vegas Strip RevPAR decreased 4.5% in the quarter with average daily rate (ADR) declining 2.3%. Occupancy dipped 200 bps.Operating income at the company's wholly owned domestic resorts deteriorated 5.3% to $451 million. The decline in operating income was due to a decrease in room revenues and food and beverage revenues owing to a decline in occupied room nights and lower convention base at the company's Las Vegas Strip resorts.Also, adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% year over year to $616 million.Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates — CityCenter HoldingsMGM’s urban complex, CityCenter operates through two segments — Resort and Residential. Currently, the company has two properties — Aria and Vdara — under the Resort operations.Net revenues from CityCenter declined 3% year over year to $304 million due to a decrease in casino revenues.Operating income from resort operations was $40 million in the quarter, compared with $58 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA from resort operations was $93 million, marking a 16% year-over-year decrease.Balance SheetMGM Resorts ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.52 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with $1.49 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.On Apr 25, 2018, the company's board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of 12 cents per share, totaling $67 million. The dividend will be payable on Jun 15, 2018 to holders of record as of Jun 8, 2018. During the first quarter, MGM Resorts repurchased 10 million shares of its common stock at $36.24 per share for a total aggregate amount of $362.4 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter.MGM Resorts International Price and Consensus MGM Resorts International Price and Consensus | MGM Resorts International QuoteVGM ScoresCurrently, MGM has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a D. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise MGM has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

1058,MGM,"Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) has done exceedingly well and emerged as an attractive investment option amid an intensely competitive gaming industry. This is evident from the company’s performance in a year’s time. While the stock has surged 37.8%, the industry rallied 26.4%.We believe there is still momentum left in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company. This is because the stock has an earnings growth rate of 25.7% for 2018 and a Growth Score of A. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Apart from Las Vegas, stocks such as Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR  -  Free Report), MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) and Century Casinos, Inc. (CNTY  -  Free Report) that belong to the same industry have witnessed gains of 15.7%, 2.3% and 6.5%, respectively, in the past year.Let’s delve deeper and find out the reason that kept Las Vegas ahead of its peers.Impressive Earnings & Sales TrendLas Vegas began 2018 on a positive note, with both top and bottom line beating the consensus mark for the fifth straight quarter, when it reported first-quarter 2018 results. Moreover, the company’s trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 17.5%. At Las Vegas, results were driven by robust performance across Macao, Singapore and Las Vegas in the first quarter.In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company let’s look at Las Vegas’ earnings estimate revisions. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 has moved north by 12.4% and 3.3% to $3.82 and $3.76, respectively. For second-quarter 2018, the consensus mark has moved up by 1 cent to 79 cents in the same time frame.Solid Business ModelLas Vegas is one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry. Additionally, its solid business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations are encouraging. In fact, the company’s strong portfolio has somewhat aided Las Vegas in withstanding the economic downturn in China, which has hurt its Macao operations.Meanwhile, with the economic recovery in the United States, the company’s business should continue growing in Macao. Also, some entertainment offerings in the pipeline are expected to deliver increased profitability across the company’s properties.Macao Business to Spur Growth Over the Long-termLas Vegas generates a major part of its revenues from Macao. In first-quarter 2018, the company reported robust growth in its Macao business. EBITDA from Macao operation in the quarter was up 26% year over year to $789 million.Expansion Efforts in Las Vegas Aid ProfitabilityNet revenues from Las Vegas operations that comprise The Venetian Las Vegas and The Palazzo, including the Sands Expo and Convention Center, increased 7.2% to $477 million owing to a 3.3%, 15.4% and 14.1% rise in rooms, casino and convention, retail and other revenues, respectively. Also, the company is concentrating on renovation and promotion of its Las Vegas properties in order to drive segmental performance. In fact, the Las Vegas Strip has been recording high occupancy rates over the past year.The improvement in employment rate and rise in tourism numbers in the region has been increasing demand at the company’s properties in Las Vegas. Further, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options should contribute to significant revenue growth.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1059,MGM,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains breaks down everything investors need to know about the future of the legal sports gambling industry after the U.S. Supreme Court’s historic ruling.At this point, many investors have heard that legalized sports betting could be headed to a state near them. But many questions remain: from which states will adopt sports gambling and which companies stand to benefit the most to how revenues will be taxed.These questions will begin to be sorted out over the next several years. And investors will want to pay close attention because the illegal sports gambling industry is reportedly worth as much as $400 billion a year in the U.S. alone.The big four North American sports leagues, the NFL, NBA, MLB, and the NHL are set to benefit, with billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, going as far as to tell ESPN that the Supreme Court decision “doubled the value of the professional sports franchises in a second.""The leagues hope that legalized sports betting creates more engagement with their sports, which in turn should help them negotiate better television deals with the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), FOX (FOXA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), and maybe even Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), and other streaming players.Furthermore, tech companies such as Amazon, along with Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) have the infrastructure and user base that could see them benefit from legalized sports betting if they wanted to. Meanwhile, the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and some Wall Street financial firms have reportedly applied for sports betting patents.Even if these big-name tech firms don’t roll out their own sports betting platforms, they could easily invest in the array of app-based startups that are sure to pop up as mobile gambling becomes more and more popular. Therefore, the need for real-time data along with fast and secure payments will also become paramount.Investors should pay close attention to how the MGMs (MGM  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) of the world adapt and invest in the future of sports betting. Meanwhile, William Hill WMH, Stars Group TSG, as well as DraftKings and FanDuel, and many other companies could benefit hugely from legalized sports betting.Make sure you listen to the full episode in order to gain a more complete understanding of what the future of sports betting in the U.S. might look like.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1060,MGM,"The mecca of casino gaming, Macau, has finally returned to life. In fact, gaming revenues in the region grew on an annual basis in September to register 14 consecutive months of gains, following the extended slump of over two years. Notably, new resorts continue to attract high rollers as well as leisure gamblers.Meanwhile, notwithstanding the recent shooting massacre in Las Vegas, casino players’ properties therein are expected to continue to cash in on the favorable trends of an improving employment rate and positive tourism numbers. In fact, the Las Vegas Strip has been recording high occupancy rates over the past few years.Therefore, given the upbeat macro environment trends, this makes it the right time to add casino companies to your portfolio. Leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts, Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) is one such stock, which is worth considering.Notably, shares of Wynn Resorts have soared 69.9% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 28.1%. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Wynn Resorts’ current-year earnings has moved up nearly 1%, reflecting three upward revisions versus two downward, over the last 60 days. Also, the next year’s earnings estimates have climbed 2.3% on the back of six upward revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction.In fact, all these positive earnings estimates revision testifies analysts’ unwavering confidence on the company and also substantiates its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This apart, Wynn Resorts continues to reflect strength in several areas and should thus make a value addition to your portfolio.Earnings & Revenue Growth: Wynn Resorts’ current-year revenues are anticipated to increase 35.1% year over year, widely outpacing the industry’s projected average growth of 1.4%.Strong top-line growth is expected to translate to an even more robust bottom-line performance. Evidently, the company’s projected EPS growth is a whopping 46.8% compared with the industry average of 18.7%.Arguably, nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.Focus on Non-Gaming Revenues: Apart from the gaming business in Macau, the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non-gaming revenues. Given the decent visitation pattern in Macau, infrastructure development and government’s efforts to increase tourism in Macau, non-gaming sources are anticipated to boost revenues, going forward.Additionally, Wynn Resorts’ full-scale integrated resort — Wynn Palace — opened in August 2016 in Cotai, Macau. The resort is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term, which should fortify the company’s position in the Cotai strip. Notably, such projects are expected to draw business and leisure travelers, and provide a solid platform for growth. In fact, building resorts in Asia is expected to help the company capitalize on the strong consumer spending trend in the region.Expansion in Domestic Market: In order to boost performance in Las Vegas, the company has remodeled rooms at its properties and the baccarat pit. Also, Wynn Resorts’ casino resort that is anticipated to open in Massachusetts in 2019 is likely to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Further, it plans to start building Wynn Paradise Park by year-end or early 2018, taking over a footprint that includes the Wynn Golf Club comprising restaurants, hotels and other entertainment options. Backed by the optimism surrounding tourism in Las Vegas and increasing visitation pattern, the company’s revenues are likely to grow as well.Favorable ROE: Wynn Resorts delivered return on equity (ROE) of a whopping 165.8% in the trailing 12 months compared with the industry’s gain of 7.5%. This supports its growth potential and indicates that the company reinvests more efficiently compared with its peers.Bottom LineWynn Palace is likely to face extreme peer pressure from several local Chinese casino operators as well as the The Parisian Macao (opened in September 2016) and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report). Another US-based company, MGM Resorts International’s (MGM  -  Free Report) $2.9 billion casino hotel is also set to open in Cotai in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe these openings might pose a huge threat to the company’s business in the region in the future.Nevertheless, given the company’s solid fundamentals, strong brand recognition, increasing market share, focus on non-gaming revenues and a fairly favorable macro environment, the stock should keep performing well in the quarters ahead, thus making it a top investment choice.Another stock worth considering in this sector is Churchill Downs Incorporated (CHDN  -  Free Report) holding the same bullish rank as Wynn Resorts. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Churchill Downs’ current-year earnings climbed nearly 1% over the last 60 days. Further, for 2017, EPS is expected to increase 22.6%.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1061,MGM,"(1:00) - What The Framers Couldn't Imagine(7:00) - Monty Hall: The Probability Brain Buster(12:30) - Jeff Yass: The Power Of Rational Thinking(18:30) - Breaking Down The Probability Of The Monty Hall Problem(24:00) - Daniel Negreanu: Probability Simulation(28:45) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comWelcome back to Mind Over Money. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of Behavioral Economics.Last week, I made a video presentation called Gaming the Stock Market with Poker Smarts where I drew some very important connections between the behavioral analysis of poker champion Daniel Negreanu and the work that I do in playing stocks.I wanted to follow-up this week with an expanded discussion on the topic.And then something happened over the weekend that made me more certain about what angle to take: the legendary game show host Monty Hall of ""Let's Make a Deal"" fame passed away at the ripe young age of 96!Monty's fun and laughs with his infamous Big Deal to win a new car simply by choosing one of 3 doors became a fantastic probability brain buster because of the fact he always gave contestants a chance to switch their original choice -- and risk ending up with a goat.But Hall helped you by opening one of the doors that had a goat, so now you knew there was one less goat lurking behind the door you chose and the other that he was offering you. In the 1970s and 1980s it became a big discussion in national newspapers about whether it mattered if you switched your original choice.And many times it was math professors who got the answer wrong.I learned to dissect this probability challenge from one of the great Market Wizards in Jack Schwager's books.I'll explain both The Monty Hall Problem and the options trader who helped me understand it in a moment.Prayers for VegasBefore I dive into today's episode though, I want to be thoughtful and respectful with regard to one of the US kingdoms where this gambling math reigns: Las Vegas, NV.Just two days ago, on Sunday October 1 at around 10pm Las Vegas time, a twisted coward opened fire with several assault weapons on a large concert crowd by the Mandalay Bay resort and casino, owned by MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report).At this time, nearly 60 people have lost their lives and hundreds more are injured, with dozens still fighting for their lives.While there will be endless media coverage all week, all any of us really need to do is just imagine the horror of watching one of your friends or loved ones die in your arms. It makes me want to be very quiet, utterly speechless in sadness.I have taken many moments of silence in the past two days for all that pain and suffering at the hands of some angry idiot with access to too much lethal military-grade destructive force.But more importantly, in the aftermath of the tragedy as so many families in Vegas and beyond are hurting terribly, we have to lift up our heads and acknowledge all the police, fire, and medical personnel who helped and continue to help victims. Their lives will never be the same.And then there are the strangers who helped one another, and those heroes who lost their lives trying to protect and save others. Strength and peace to all of them.The Monty Hall ProblemIn the mid-1990s as a clerk on the trading floors of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, I was fortunate to come across two books by a thinking man's trader, Jack Schwager. His Market Wizards books were packed with interviews of great commodity, currency, and stock traders like George Soros, Paul Tudor Jones, and Monroe Trout.In The New Market Wizards, Schwager talked to Jeff Yass who used a variation of Monty Hall's Big Deal to explain the power of probability-based thinking.Do you know how to put the odds in your favor to win a car instead of a goat?It's trickier than you think, even when you think Monty is trying to trick (or help) you.That's where Jeff Yass, a billionaire trader and founder of options giant Susquehanna International, comes in to help us.Yass built his options empire, with five other partners, near Philadelphia where he earned his wealth of trading experience as a member of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in the early 1980s. This was just about the time that stock options trading was really taking off with the aid of computers.And it was after Yass and his buddies made millions gambling the odds in Vegas.In 2009, PhillyMag.com profiled Yass and gave a great intro to the Monty Hall Problem...Let's play a game. Let’s say you’re a contestant on Let’s Make a Deal, Monty Hall’s game show from a generation ago. It’s your moment. There are three doors. Behind one door is a brand-new Camaro. Behind each of the other doors, there’s a goat. If you pick the right door, the Camaro is yours.Silky-voiced Monty Hall gives you the big question:“Do you pick door number one, door number two or door number three?”The studio audience weighs in, and tension builds, as you think. Finally you pick, let’s say, door number one. But Carol Merrill, Monty’s assistant, doesn’t open it, not yet. Instead, Monty Hall directs Carol to open one of the other doors — door number two, say. Behind that door is … a goat. The audience titters nervously — that Camaro, still hidden, might yet be yours.First, though, Monty is going to give you another choice. He’s going to give you both an option, and a dilemma:“Would you like to stay with door number one,” he asks, “or would you like to switch to door number three?”You ponder. But it’s a no-brainer, right? With two doors left, there’s a 50-50 chance the Camaro is behind either one. So you might as well stick with door number one.(end of PhillyMag.com excerpt)For the wisdom of Jeff Yass on the best way to think about this dilemma, be sure to listen to my podcast.I also explain what inspired me to teach myself probability and statistics in my 30s (after spending the first 30 years of my life ""allergic to algebra"") and two reasons why everyone should strive to learn more of these essential maths:First, because it has always been true that people can lie and fool you with statistics, whether from science or public policy.Second, we have never been more inundated with data in the age of IBM, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), the data-crunching and creating monsters, and their data workhorses, the semiconductor companies creating the future of advanced computing and AI, like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report).Hence, being adept with probability and statistics will become an absolutely vital 21st century knowledge-skill set.Disclosure: I own shares of NVDA and AMD for the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio.Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research where he runs the TAZR Trader service.

1062,MGM,"Things are looking up for Casino stocks and ETFs. VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF (BJK  -  Free Report) has gained about 7.2% so far this year (as of May 14, 2018), beating the S&P 500 (up 1.3%) on a volley of favorable happenings in the space. On Monday, casino stocks jumped on the news of legalization of sports betting in several U.S. states. The casino ETF BJK in fact added 2.2% on May 14 (read: Basket March Madness Gains With These ETFs).The Supreme Court annulled a federal law that bans sports gambling in a breakthrough decision that allows states to legalize betting on sports. The court ruled 6-3 to invalidate the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, a 1992 law. Per the older law, a person could bet on the outcome of a single game only in Nevada.Is the New Rule a Mid-Term Harm to Renowned Casino Stocks?The court's decision now potentially permits legal sports betting in several states like New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and possibly nationwide. The ruling will end Nevada's monopoly on the sports gambling practice, which earns billions of dollars annually. Some states expect sports betting as a good source of tax revenues, per CNBC.But since Nevada-based casino operators are likely to lose on the monopoly under the new rule, the likes of Wynn Resorts (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report), Nevada-heavy casino companies, saw shares sliding following the Court decision, per CNBC.WYNN was down 2.1% on May 14 and LVS lost about 0.9%. Instead, companies like Churchill Downs Inc. (CHDN  -  Free Report) and Penn National Gaming Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report) benefited more on the news and added about 4.6% each on Monday.No Major Threat: Macau & Earnings Are PositivesMajor gaming companies like WYNN, LVS and MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report) have wide exposure to China apart from the United States. And a surge in gaming revenues in Macau — a Chinese territory and “the country’s only legal casino hub” — should help these companies tide over the sports betting monopoly issue in Nevada.Gambling revenues in Macau jumped 27.6% in April and beat analyst expectations of an 18-22% rise thanks to solid demand. April represented the 21st consecutive month of gaming revenue gains.  However, revenues are still off the highs seen in 2014, per Reuters.Overall, the earnings picture is also positive. MGM Resorts International’s adjusted earnings of 34 cents for the first quarter of 2018 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. Total revenues of $2.82 billion surpassed the consensus estimate of $2.80 billion by 0.7% and increased 3.9% year over year. MGM China’s net revenues increased 25% while net revenues from the company's domestic resorts declined 1%.Las Vegas Sands’ adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents by 14.3% and increased 41.9% year over year on higher revenues. Net revenues of $3.4 billion beat the consensus mark by 6.3% and increased 11.7% year over year. The solid performance can be attributed to services across Macao and Singapore operations.Among the trio, Wynn Resorts seems to suffer more. The company beat on both lines in Q1 but Wynn Macau revenues climbed 11.9%, which fell below our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate of $638 million.Better to Play Casino ETF BJK?Against this backdrop, it is intriguing to play the casino gaming ETF BJK as it gives exposure to a wider array of casino stocks, irrespective of location specifics. The basket approach actually minimizes stock-specific risks (see all Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).The fund holds 45 stocks in total. Galaxy Entertainment (8.3%), Las Vegas Sands (8.1%), Sands China (6.9%), Aristocrat Leisure (6.3%) and MGM Resorts (6.3%) are the top five holdings. The United States has about 42% exposure while China and Australia take the next two spots. The fund charges 65 bps in fees.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1063,MGM,"On Sep 8, we issued an updated research report on leading developer, owner and operator of casino resorts, Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report).Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Key Growth DriversWynn Resorts generates a solid share of its revenues from Macau resorts. Apart from the gaming business in Macau, the company has been increasingly focusing on boosting non-gaming revenues. Given the decent visitation pattern therein, infrastructure development and government’s efforts to boost tourism, non-gaming sources are expected to boost revenues, going forward.In fact, building resorts in Asia might help the company to capitalize on the strong consumer spending trend in the region.Meanwhile, its properties in Las Vegas are likely to continue to cash in on the favorable trends of improving employment rate and positive tourism numbers in the region.Moreover, the company’s casino resort that is expected to open in Massachusetts in 2019 is likely to strengthen its presence in the U.S. market. Moving ahead, Wynn Resorts plans to start building Wynn Paradise Park by year-end or early 2018, taking over a footprint that includes the Wynn Golf Club comprising restaurants, hotels and other entertainment options.Macau’s Recovery & Regulatory IssuesA tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. However, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been improving since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers. Evidently, Macau’s gaming revenues were up in August, thus marking the 13th consecutive month of gains and signaling the casino hub’s recovery.We thus note that the opening of Wynn Palace (in August 2016) has been a major reason for the turnaround in gambling revenues in Macau  as it attracted visits from tourists and leisure gamblers. Moreover, the resort is poised to fortify the company’s position in the Cotai strip over the long term.However, continual construction around Wynn Palace has been hampering foot traffic therein, of late. Therefore, the company failed to fully capitalize on the rebound in Macau gaming revenues given somewhat lower-than-expected results at Wynn palace in the second quarter.Furthermore, the Macau government recently joined hands with the mainland authorities to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing and beefed up its anti-money laundering framework with a much wider scope and stringent compliance measures. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) is increasing its audits of the junket industry, over worries of money laundering as well.Thus, this latest crackdown may hamper Macau’s revenue growth and reverse the 13 month streak of year-over-year gains, thus somewhat weighing down on Wynn Resorts’ performance.Bottom LineShares of Wynn Resorts’ have rallied 47.2% in the last six months, outperforming 24% gain of the industry it belongs to. Given the ongoing recovery in gaming revenues in Macau and continued improvement in the Las Vegas business, the stock is likely to perform well in the quarters ahead.Additionally, earnings estimates for current quarter and year have moved up 2.5% and 4.4%, respectively, over the past 60 days. This reflects ongoing optimism in the stock.However, Wynn Palace is likely to face extreme peer pressure from several local Chinese casino operators as well as the The Parisian Macao (opened in September 2016) and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report). Another US-based company, MGM Resorts International’s (MGM  -  Free Report) $2.9 billion casino hotel is also set to open in Cotai in the fourth quarter of 2017. We believe these openings might pose a huge threat to the company’s business in the region in the future.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is well poised for growth given its solid fundamentals, strong brand recognition, increasing market share, focus on non-gaming revenues and a fairly favorable macro environment.A better-ranked stock in this sector is Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Melco Resorts’ 2017 earnings climbed 2.7% over the last 60 days. Further, for 2017, EPS is expected to increase 98.7%.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1064,MGM,"On Aug 31, we issued an updated research report on global hospitality company MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report).Though the company has solid long-term growth potential but the risks from near-term headwinds might somewhat restrict its growth momentum.Domestic VenturesMGM Resorts’ Las Vegas business is doing well on the back of the ongoing economic recovery and growing tourism in the region. It is expected to continue growing over the long term, driven by a strong convention calendar and the completion of several capital initiatives on the Las Vegas Strip.Notably, the acquisition of full ownership of Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa — Atlantic City’s top casino — complements MGM Resorts’ increasing presence in the Northeastern United States and should continue to drive top-line growth.Meanwhile, MGM National Harbor, a casino resort that opened in December 2016 is off to a great start. Another casino resort in Western Massachusetts is set to be developed on roughly 14 acres of land in downtown Springfield, MA, the construction of which is slated to be completed in late 2018. Both these resorts include a number of gaming as well as non-gaming amenities.Thus, the company is expected to witness increased occupancy and better pricing in the domestic markets as a result of these efforts and openings. This, in turn, should drive incremental revenues at the company’s properties in the region. Moreover, these projects demonstrate this Las Vegas, NV-based company’s commitment toward diversifying its business.Macau’s Recovery & Regulatory IssuesA tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. However, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016 with new resorts attracting high rollers as well as leisure gamblers. In fact, Macau’s gaming revenues were up in July, thus marking the 12th consecutive month of gains and signaling the casino hub’s recovery.Markedly, after been mostly weak for the last two years, the VIP business in Macau has started to recover. Meanwhile, the main floor gaming has also been mostly faring well in the recent times. Additionally, MGM China is undertaking initiatives to increase revenues and junket productivity in Macau as it anticipates a positive trend buoyed by upgrades to main gaming floor products and marketing initiatives. MGM Cotai’s construction too is in the final stages and is expected to boost revenues when it opens in the fourth quarter of 2017.Thus, though it seems that the worst is over for Macau’s gambling industry, it will still take some time for the company to fully capitalize on the rebound in Macau gaming revenues. This is evident from the company’s weak results at MGM China in the second quarter. Notably, revenues declined 1% in the quarter due to lower revenues from main-floor table games.  However, the Macau government recently joined hands with the mainland authorities to tackle money laundering and terrorism financing and beefed up its anti-money laundering framework with a much wider scope and stringent compliance measures. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ) is increasing its audits of the junket industry, over worries of money laundering as well.Thus, this latest crackdown may hamper Macau’s revenue growth and reverse the 12 month streak of year-over-year gains, thus weighing down on MGM Resorts’ performance.Bottom LineMGM Resorts’ Profit Growth Plan continues to bear fruit as being reflected in improving profits. Evidently, the second quarter of 2017 marked the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) growth at the company.Nevertheless, the company faces stiff competition in the markets of Las Vegas and Macau due to increased hotel openings and promotional activities. In fact, the company’s upcoming project in the Cotai Strip is expected to face competition from several Chinese casino operators and the Sands Cotai Central project of Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report). Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) also opened a full-scale integrated resort, Wynn Palace, on the Cotai Strip in August 2016.Despite the headwinds, we note that MGM Resorts’ shares have rallied 19.4% in the last six months, outperforming 15% gain of the industry it belongs to.Given the company’s strong fundamentals, superior business model, extensive non-gaming revenue opportunities, high quality assets and attractive property locations, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is likely to keep performing well in the quarters ahead.A better-ranked stock in this sector is Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Melco Resorts’ full-year 2017 earnings climbed 8.6% over the last 60 days.

1065,MGM,"Shares of some casino industry powerhouses fell across the board on Thursday, many of which have ties to Macau, the world’s newest gambling Mecca. However, with tensions surrounding North Korea escalating, the hotspot’s close proximity to the tumultuous region might possibly hurt stock prices.Lower travel numbers could spark trouble for U.S.-based companies that now operate in Macau. The area’s success has helped the gaming industry gain over 21% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500 by almost double, according to our Zacks Industry Rank data.Shares of Melco Crown Entertainment (MLCO  -  Free Report), which receives the majority of its revenue from Macau, fell 2.22% on Thursday. Las Vegas Sands (LVS  -  Free Report) also has a presence in the region, and the company’s stock price fell 1.07%.Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report), both of which own casinos in Asia’s gambling capital, sank by around 3%.June travel to Macau rose 0.86% year-over-year according to an Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation report. Mainland Chinese visitor rates to the gambling destination increased by 0.8%. But travel from nearby Hong Kong fell by 3.9%, and Taiwanese tourism dropped by 9.9%.The report cited expensive transportation costs and pricey accommodation as possible reasons for June’s slowdown in tourism.But it seems for now casinos can breathe easy if June numbers hold, as visitor rates weren’t down across the board. The number of overnight visitors to Macau grew for the 23rd month in a row.Japanese tourism increased by 13.5% and South Korean numbers skyrocket by 42.2% according to the OCBC report. However, June was a long time ago in terms of the geopolitical climate. If the North Korea situation keeps getting worse, which seems like a strong possibility, travel to Macau could slow and in turn help bust some casino stocks.Investors should keep a close eye on these numbers from Japan and South Korea, two U.S. allies that have a lot at stake in the current climate. If tensions continue to increase, fear could keep tourists at home.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1066,MGM,"Last week was a big one for the gambling industry, as major casino operators came up with their second-quarter 2017 earnings results.Among the most notable players were the likes of Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) that reported better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report), Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report) and Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed bag.Though MGM Resorts’ earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the mark. Meanwhile, both Melco Resorts and Boyd Gaming failed to beat bottom-line expectations while their top line surpassed the same.Meanwhile, the Nevada Gaming Control Board announced an increase in revenues in the region in June.Gaming Industry 5YR % Return  Gaming Industry 5YR % ReturnRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    Wynn Resorts posted earnings of $1.18 per share in the second quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 by 8.3%. Further, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s earnings increased 10.3% from the year-ago figure of $1.07 mainly on higher revenues. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Net revenue of $1.53 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion by 5.3%. Moreover, revenues increased 44.5% on significant contributions from Wynn Palace along with favorable performance by the company’s Las Vegas operations and higher revenues from Wynn Macau.Adjusted property earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) surged 37.5% year over year to $430 million (read more: Wynn Resorts Stock Falls Despite Q2 Earnings Beat).Weakness in Macau’s mass market and somewhat lower-than-expected results at Wynn palace hampered the company’s quarterly performance to a certain degree.2.    Las Vegas Sands’ second-quarter earnings of 73 cents topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents by 19.7% and jumped 37.7% year over year led by higher revenues.Quarterly net revenue of $3.14 billion also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02 billion by over 4% and increased 18.6% year over year. The improvement was primarily attributable to robust performance at its Las Vegas properties and mostly solid results in Macao. On a consolidated basis, adjusted property EBITDA increased 26.5% year over year to $1.21 billion during the quarter owing to higher revenues (read more: Las Vegas Sands Q2 Earnings Top on Solid Revenue Growth).This Zacks Rank #2 company also stated that strong mass revenue growth along with higher hotel occupancy and growth in the VIP segment drove its adjusted property EBITDA in Macao to $600 million, up 23% year over year.3.    MGM Resorts posted first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents by 10.7%.

The upside reflects a significant rise in revenues from the company’s Las Vegas operations, offset to an extent by weak results at MGM China.Notably, MGM China’s net revenue fell 1% year over year to $449 million due to lower revenues from main-floor table games, somewhat offset by an increase in revenues from VIP gamblers.Adjusted property EBITDA at MGM Resorts’ wholly owned domestic resorts was $658 million, up 28% year over year (read more: MGM Resorts' Q2 Earnings Beat on Higher Revenues).4.    Melco Resorts’ second-quarter earnings of 16 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents by 20% However, earnings increased significantly year over year on the back of higher revenues.This Zacks Rank #2 company’s net revenue of $1.30 billion surpassed the consensus mark by almost 7%. Moreover, revenues increased 21.3% year over year primarily driven by better group-wide rolling chip revenues.Adjusted Property EBITDA was $329.5 million in the second quarter, up 34% year over year. The upside was prompted by improved performance in the group-wide rolling chip segment (read more: Melco Resorts Misses on Q2 Earnings, Stock Falls).  5.    Boyd Gaming posted second-quarter adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 30 cents by 13.3% and decreased 62.5% on a year-over-year basis.

1067,MGM,"Ushering in good news for casino operators in the United States, the Supreme Court has overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) that banned sports betting outside Nevada. The court supported the legality of a 2014 New Jersey law, which allows sports betting at casinos as well as racetracks in the state.Following this latest verdict, New Jersey will not only legalize and control sports betting but will also collect tax revenues. The decision also broke the Nevada's monopoly on the betting market.Furthermore, the Court ruling has opened the door for other states to enter sports betting business. Per Eilers & Krejcik Gaming 2017 reports, legal sports betting market is likely to garner $6.03 billion in revenues annually by 2023. In fact, in a bid to legalize sports betting, nearly 20 states have introduced bills and many other states have started working on this matter.We believe that the scope for the casino operators will intensify if the betting gets legalized in other states as the illegal betting in the United States is valued at billions of dollars annually.Top Gainers From Court RulingPenn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report), which own and manages gaming as well as racing facilities, and operates video gaming terminals, gained 4.7% following the Supreme Court verdict on May 14. In the past year, the stock has rallied 72.7%. We believe this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company that operates in jurisdictions like California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and other states to gain the most owing to this ruling. The inclusion of sports betting might further solidify its position in the gaming industry. The company has also expanded into online social gaming. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Shares of Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR  -  Free Report) also gained 5.5%. Also, it was the top gainer among the other companies from the gaming industry. Although based in Las Vegas, Caesars Entertainment operates all over the United States. Investors are optimistic that the addition of sports betting to its existing operations might drive the company’s long-term growth.MGM Resorts International’s (MGM  -  Free Report) stock gained nearly 2%, following the court ruling. The company, which operates in the United States and China, said that “We have already established the architecture to deploy sports betting as soon as the states allow us to do that.” This apart, the company has its own mobile app called PlayMGM, which is active in Nevada. Per MGM Resorts, legalization of sports betting will result in “hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to the company.”International Game Technology (IGT  -  Free Report), which designs, develops, manufactures and markets casino-style gaming equipment, systems technology, and game content, gained 3.1%. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s top line is likely to witness a sharp gain backed by increase in demand for gaming equipment.Rally to ContinueIn a year’s time, the gaming industry has rallied 21.1%, outpacing the S&P 500’s gain of 13.6%. This bullish trend in gambling industry is expected to continue through 2018 and beyond. According to Research and Markets, the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 10.16% in the 2017-2021 period. The stellar rally of casino stocks on the bourses has been supported by strength in domestic market, turnaround in Macau business and overall international interest in gaming space.Furthermore, lenient government regulations with respect to online casinos have led to a rapid rise in casino operators. Notably, online gambling has been a primary growth driver for the market as a wide range of customers has gained access to such portals. In fact, the scope for the gambling industry has widened, courtesy of legalized online gambling in more than 80 countries. Europe is considered the world’s largest online gambling market.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1069,MGM,"“Should you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.”- Warren Buffett.At the moment, the quote fits perfectly for MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) as the company’s near-term future looks bleak. In fact, investors need to exercise extreme caution when it comes to the stock as it is unlikely to show any major improvement moving ahead. In the past six months, shares of MGM Resorts have plunged 17.4%, wider than the industry’s 2% decline.Let’s delve deeper to find out the reasons behind the company’s dismal performance.MGM Resorts Vs Industry Scorecard    Disappointing Macau Revenues a Major ConcernMacau, which is the world’s largest gambling hub, has disappointed investors with lower-than-expected revenues for the second successive month. Gambling revenues from Macau increased 12.5% to 22.49 billion patacas ($2.78 billion) in June. The metric not only lagged analyst expectations but also declined 12% from the figure registered in May. Even though gambling revenues were up for the 23nd straight months, it still remains below the highest level achieved in 2012.Notably, MGM Resorts generates more than 20% of its revenues from Macau region, which declined sharply close on the heels of the news. Other stocks such as Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd. (MLCO  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report), which belong to the same industry and has highest exposure to Macau region, have also declined due to lower-than-expected Macau’s gambling revenues.Furthermore, MGM Resorts operates in the highly competitive markets of Las Vegas and Macau. Increased hotel openings and promotional activities have made these markets highly competitive. Thus, excess supply, especially in the Macau market, might reduce the company’s market share.High DebtMGM Resorts’ heavy reliance on debt financing remains a concern. As of Mar 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $1.5 billion compared with a much higher long-term debt of $12.7 billion. Therefore, any severe slowdown in macroeconomic and credit market conditions in the future may affect the company’s ability to pay or refinance its debt.Estimate RevisionsIn order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company, let’s look at MGM Resorts earnings estimate revisions. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 has moved south by 5.7% and 12.5% to $1.33 and $1.61, respectively. For second-quarter 2018, the consensus mark has moved down 11 cents to 27 cents in the same time frame.MGM Resorts currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1070,MGM,"Macau, which is the world’s largest gambling hub, has disappointed investors with lower-than-expected revenues for the second successive month. Although gambling revenues from the Macau region increased 12.5% in June, it fell short of analyst expectations.  Shares of companies such as MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report), Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report), Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) have declined 3%, 10.6%, 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively, following the news. All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Gambling revenues from Macau increased 12.5% to 22.49 billion patacas ($2.78 billion) in June. The metric not only lagged analyst expectations but also declined 12% from the figure registered in May. Even though gambling revenues were up for the 23nd straight months, it still remains below the highest level achieved in 2012.A tough operating environment in Macau weighed on casino stocks from June 2014 to most part of 2016. In fact, the crackdown on corruption in China compelled Macau officials to impose restrictions on high rollers to stop billions of dollars from being siphoned off illegally from mainland China to Macau. As a result, footfall declined at the local casinos, leading to a constant decrease in gaming revenues. A slowdown in China, tighter visa policies, political unrest and a smoking ban on mass market gaming floors compounded the woes. Nevertheless, Macau's gambling revenues marked a turnaround and have been rising since the second half of 2016, with new resorts attracting high rollers and leisure gamblers.Will Dismal Macau Show Hinder Gambling Stock Rally?In the past two years, the gaming industry has rallied 50.2%, outpacing the S&P 500’s gain of 30.2%. Though revenues from the Macau region have lagged analysts’ expectation, the overall industry trend remains encouraging. In fact, this bullish trend is likely to continue through 2018 as the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which banned sports betting outside Nevada, has given the industry a new lease of life. Scope for casino operators will grow if betting is legalized in other states as the activity could be worth a lot of money.Despite the fact that demand in the gambling space is relatively inelastic and a fixed range of consumers will continue to seek such services irrespective of market conditions, there are reasons to believe that the industry will see consistent growth over the long haul. Notably, lenient government regulations related to online casinos have led to a rapid rise in casino operators. In fact, online gambling has been a primary growth driver for the market as a wide range of customers has gained access to such portals. Currently, the scope for the gambling industry has widened, courtesy of legalized online gambling in more than 80 countries. Europe is considered the world’s largest online gambling market.Further, according to Research and Markets, the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 10.16% in the 2017-2021 period. The stellar rally of casino stocks on the bourses has been supported by strength in domestic market, turnaround in Macau business and overall international interest in gaming space.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1071,MGM,"With the 2018 Football World Cup event gathering steam, investors might want to take a sneak peek at the casino space. This is pertaining to the recent report confirmed by NDTV Sports that Russia’s offshore illegal gambling business is on a constant flourish. Per Alena Sheyanova, spokeswoman for the legally registered bookmaker Leon, ""The legal online betting industry is developing at phenomenal rates"".Meanwhile, the United States is also not free from illegal betting. In fact, the business is valued at billions of dollars annually in the country. This is why it was a piece of welcoming news for U.S.-based casino giants when the Supreme Court supported the legality of a 2014 New Jersey law, which allows sports betting at casinos as well as on the racetracks in the state. Furthermore, the Court ruling has opened the doors for other states to enter sports betting business.Per Eilers&Krejcik Gaming 2017 reports, the legal sports betting market is likely to garner $6.03 billion in revenues annually by 2023. In fact, in a bid to legalize the act of laying a wager in sports field, nearly 20 states have introduced bills and many others have started dabbling in this matter. The legalization of betting is likely to intensify the scope of activities for various casino operators.In fact, following the news of betting legalization, MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) said that “We have already established the architecture to deploy sports betting as soon as the states allow us to do that.” This apart, the company has its own active mobile app PlayMGM, in Nevada. Per MGM Resorts, legalization of sports gambling will result in “hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to the company.”Improved internet access worldwide is being exploited by many anonymous websites with no licenses but burgeoning business. The online casino market is witnessing a solid momentum, courtesy of high profile tournaments like soccer World Cup.Casino Giants Treading on the Path of Advanced TechnologyA closer look at the gambling industry reveals its rapid adherence to the advent of technology beyond the usual confines of casinos. With frequent innovations and rampant use of smart phones as well as other electronic devices, online gambling is fast gaining popularity and comfortably positioned for long-term growth.Per a report by Forrester, more than a meager 55% of the world’s population is projected to become a smartphone subscriber by 2018. In order to capitalize on this booming trend of smartphone penetration, U.S. casino big shots are consistently devising ways to upgrade their digital capabilities and expand service portfolios to online social gaming. Thus, in the ongoing FIFA World Cup, online betting businesses visibly have high chances to thrive.Industry Poised for Growth in the Long RunIn the past three months, the Gaming industry has collectively gained 8.9%, outpacing the S&P 500 Composite’s growth of 6.5%. This bullish scenario in the gambling industry is expected to continue through 2018 and beyond. According to Research and Markets, the global casino gaming market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 10.16% during the 2017-2021 period. The stellar rally of casino stocks on the bourses has been supported by lenient government regulations with respect to online casinos.Moreover, demand in the casino space is relatively inelastic as the business targets a fixed range of consumers. These buyers will continue to lap up services at casinos irrespective of market dynamics. Meanwhile, a rising middle-class segment with increased spending on leisure items and services is driving the gambling market to a great degree.Stocks That Might Interest YouWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on casino stocks with a favorable Zacks rank and northward earnings estimate revisions.

1072,MGM,"Welcome to the latest episode of the of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. With the 2018 FIFA World Cup underway, Ben Rains dives into why it is so important that the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America. Rains then discusses all of the latest happenings in the sports betting world, as more companies get in on the action.The U.S. didn’t make the World Cup for the first time since 1986, which will likely impact Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) coverage this summer. However, the company also holds the rights to the 2022 and 2026 World Cups, along with Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The 2026 bid was a little shady and upset the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and others—helping FIFA live up to its somewhat poor reputation.But with the United States set to host 60 games in 2026—many of which are likely to be in primetime—in what will be the first 48-team World Cup, Fox and Telemundo look to be the clear winners. More matches, more teams, and primetime games will likely attract many more companies on top of the major players Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY, and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Moving onto sports betting, a small soccer related partnership between William Hill WIMHY and Las Vegas Lights FC, of the United Soccer League USL, will see the betting company become the soccer team’s official sports book. The deal will allow fans to make live in-game bets through William Hill’s mobile app—partnerships like this are sure to become more commonplace as legalized sports betting becomes more popular.Sports gambling is now up and running in Delaware and New Jersey. Daily fantasy giant DraftKings has already applied for a sports betting license in New Jersey, which could kick off a wave of established companies, including Wynn (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM (MGM  -  Free Report), rolling out sports betting locations and platforms throughout the country.Meanwhile, investors should pay attention to tech companies, like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and even Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), to see if they utilize their infrastructure to get in on the massive mobile sports betting scene. It will also be worth keeping an eye out for any sports betting acquisitions, as startups are sure to pop up. As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1073,MGM,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup at Russia will take full charge ofsports lovers all over the world till Jul 15. For the coming one month, sponsors of the event will put up hoardings and adopt every means of advertisement to promote their brands. According to marketing agency Zenith, the event will likely inject about $2.4 billion to the global advertising market.Not only the official partners of FIFA, companies that are into tourism and entertainment will also be in focus due to this event as athletes, event organizers and most importantly spectators from all over the world will gather in the hosting country Russia.In short, the event is a golden goose and will likely have a substantial impact on several companies and stocks. In this regard, below we highlight a few winning bets.Broadcasting Broadcasting appears to be the most important money-spinner in such events. The majority of FIFA’s revenues originate from the sale of television broadcasting rights. The organization has forecast revenues of $5.65 billion in the four years up to the Russia tournament, which if realized would mark a 5% rise on the earlier World Cup cycle.In the United States,Twenty-First Century Fox Inc.'s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Fox Sports is the official broadcaster, while Telemundo, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will air the matches in South America. In some South American countries, DirecTV, owned by AT&T (T  -  Free Report) will broadcast the event.Social Media Social media is mightier than TV broadcasting these days when it comes to a match. Fans also follow players on Instagram (owned by Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report).Takeaway Restaurants While fans are likely to avoid fine dining restaurants in this one month, they will surely not say no to refreshments. So, takeaway firms are sure to score higher as fans won’t want to lose a moment of the match. Pizza joints like Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report) should benefit from higher takeaway sales.BeerBeer consumption normally increases during the World Cup period. Morgan Stanley analysts pointed to a historical trend and concluded that volumes of beer normally see a 2-3% rise in host countries during a World Cup year.Carlsberg (CABGY  -  Free Report), the market leader in Russia and Budweiser maker ABInBev (BUD  -  Free Report), a global sponsor, can be winners thanks to this trend, as quoted on Reuters. ABInBev forecast that its sales in soccer hubs Brazil and Argentina will likely increase by 0.5 to 1 percentage points. The credit can be given to the football-mania as both Heineken and ABInBev topped their counterparts during the last World Cup in 2014.PubsMany will hit the pubs to enjoy the game with a like-minded crowd. Many analysts are of the view that Britain’s pub operators including Greene King Plc GKNGY is likely to be a winner. Morgan Stanley noticed that the pub chain’s sales increased 3.5% during Euro 2016.CasinosBetting at casinos on which team to win the match or finally pick the trophy should be rife now. Also, the Supreme Court's decision to potentially permit legal sports betting in several U.S. states gave a boost to the space.So, casino-hotel companies like MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) and Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report) should be watched closely. The U.K.-based Paddy Power Betfair Plc PDYPY, which operates as an online betting and gaming company, can also get a short-term boost, if England performs well, per Reuters.Sportswear Brands Arrangements of such a sporting extravaganza definitely put the spotlight on sportswear makers Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report). German behemoth Adidas has been a FIFA partner while both Adidas and Nike have famous football players for promoting their brands. The companies are outfitting football teams in the tournament. While both are set to gain from this event, Adidas holds an edge over Nike as the former has managed to bag more teams (12 vs 10) to outfit.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1074,MGM,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down a 1992 federal law that had so long barred gambling on individual sporting events. The recent ruling now frees states to legalize gambling on individual sports, thus opening a whole new line of business for casinos and betting-technology developers that promise to attract billions of dollars in wagers.This saw shares of gaming and casino companies rallying on Monday. However, this also increases competition for casinos in Nevada, which until now enjoyed the monopoly of being the only state where sports gambling was allowed.Supreme Court Turns the TableThe Supreme Court announced that it will allow states to regulate their own sports gambling, overturning the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) that prohibits sports gambling across the United States barring Nevada, where it is legal for decades. That said, the United States now joins the likes of the U.K., Australia, Canada and France where sports betting is legal.Now, the ruling doesn’t mean that sports gambling will become legal across the country immediately. Instead, it will allow states to formulate their own regulatory structures. However, New Jersey is expected to be the first state to start legal gambling on individual sports, given that the state instigated the legal fight by doing away with its gambling prohibition.Other states like Mississippi, New York, Delaware, West Virginia and Pennsylvania are likely to follow suit. Interestingly, NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA and Major League Baseball had strongly opposed this legalization.Competition for Nevada CasinosWhile the ruling is being cheered by casino operators and technology providers, it will also increase competition for Nevada-based gaming companies. While the other states bite into Nevada’s share, the picture is not that gloomy for the monopoly state.This is because many casino operators feel that footfall will not decrease in Nevada resorts, as obviously gaming isn’t their only attraction.High Roller for Casino Operators  The new ruling will allow a new line of business for casinos and betting technology providers, opening a potential $4 billion market for the industry. Casinos and racetracks will soon be able to take bets on sports and seem to be the clear winners from the new ruling. Understandably, the decision was cheered by casino operators. Conseuquently, shares of Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR  -  Free Report), Boyd Gaming Corporation (BYD  -  Free Report) and MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) surged 5.5%, 3.1% and 1.6%, respectively. That said, a few gaming stocks worth buying are Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS  -  Free Report), Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN  -  Free Report) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment Limited (MLCO  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Las Vegas Sands Corp. is a hotel, gaming and retail mall company headquartered in Las Vegas, NV. The company has expected earnings growth of 8.2% for the current quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 13% over the past 30 days.Melco Resorts & Entertainment is a developer, owner and operator of casino gaming and entertainment casino resort facilities primarily in Asia.  The company has expected earnings growth of 62.50% for the current quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 16.1% over the past 30 days.Penn National Gaming owns, operates or has ownership interests in gaming and racing facilities and video gaming terminal operations with a focus on slot machine entertainment. The company has expected earnings growth of 172.2% for the ongoing quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 4.8% over the past 30 days.Summing UpThe Supreme Court’s new ruling certainly is to be cheered by casino operators, many of which had to start operations in the Macau Cotai Strip, as betting on sports wasn’t legal in the United States. The recent development will now help them add sports gambling to their properties in the United States, which definitely is going to push up their profitability. Moreover, a new line of business will also help betting technology providers with increased demand for their products. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1075,MGM,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in MGM.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen six estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just one upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.41 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.34.Also, for the current quarter, MGM Resorts has seen four downward estimate revisions versus one revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 27 cents a share from 37 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 9% in the past month.MGM Resorts International Price and Consensus MGM Resorts International Price and Consensus | MGM Resorts International QuoteSo it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Gaming industry, you may instead consider a better-ranked stock - Las Vegas Sands Corp.

Today’s Bear of the Day will also benefit from the ruling, but I want you to know what the earnings picture was like ahead of the recent event. It’s not as rosy as you’d like to believe.MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) owns and operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts in the United States and China. The company operates through two segments, Domestic Resorts and MGM China. Its casino resorts offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail, and other resort amenities. Its casino operations include various slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. The company operates 14 resorts in the United States; and MGM Macau resort and casino in China, as well as develops an integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip, Macau. The company also owns and operates Shadow Creek golf course, Primm Valley Golf Club, and Fallen Oak golf course. I certainly agree that gaming across the country could help MGM. But until analysts start changing their EPS estimates based on the ruling, MGM is likely to remain a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Over the last thirty days, four analysts have dropped their earning estimates for the current quarter while six have dropped their numbers for the current year. The bearish sentiment has dropped the Zacks Consensus Estimate from 38 cents to 27 cents for the current quarter while current year numbers have gone from $1.45 to $1.34.Again, analysts could very well come in an increase their estimates based on the Supreme Court’s ruling. But an important benchmark for investors should be the previous consensus numbers of 27 cents for the current quarter and $1.45 for the current year.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1077,MGM,"Thanks to decent jobless claims figures and a plethora of strong earnings reports, stocks moved higher almost across the board early Thursday. With Q2 earnings season panning out well for most, there’s an even harsher spotlight on the few companies—like Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and MGM Resorts (MGM  -  Free Report)—that disappointed investors this morning.Interestingly enough, all of the aforementioned companies actually surpassed earnings estimates, but their share prices are slumping for a variety of other reasons. For example, Twitter’s loss of two cents per share was significantly narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents, but investors were more focused on the company’s stagnant user figures.MAUs in the quarter were 328 million, which was unchanged from the first quarter of 2017 and up just 5% year-over-year. DAUs were up about 12%. Total revenues slumped about 4.7% to $573.8 million, although that result did surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $536.8 million (also read: Twitter Q2 Loss Narrows, Stagnant User Base Hits Stock).Despite beating on both the top and bottom line, shares of Twitter opened at $17.36 on Thursday, nearly 11.5% lower than Wednesday’s close. The stock dipped to an intraday low of $16.85 per share in morning trading, and investors will hoping to avoid a double-digit loss on the day will now need quite the mid-day bounce.Southwest was also able to post a double beat, with earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $5.74 billion surpassing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.20 and $5.73 billion. Revenue per available seat mile—the ever-important RASM figure—was up a respectable 1.5% year-over-year.Southwest’s problem was its outlook for the third quarter, a period that includes most of the busy summer travel season. The company is expecting RASM growth of just 1%, and unit costs—excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing—are expected to increase about 2% to 3%. Higher costs and sluggish unit revenue is, of course, not a great combination for an airliner (also read: Southwest Airlines Beats on Q2 Earnings).Shares of Southwest opened about 5% lower on Thursday, eventually hitting an intraday low of $53.77 in morning trading. However, the stock has already started to bounce back a bit; shares were down less than 3% heading into the afternoon.Casino giant MGM Resorts also reported on Thursday morning. The company posted earnings of 31 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents, but revenues of $2.64 billion lagged our consensus estimate of $2.66 billion.Improvements in Las Vegas helped MGM’s profits growth more than 19% year-over-year, but weak results at MGM China contributed to its revenue miss. MGM China’s net revenue fell 1% year over year to $449 million due to lower revenues from main-floor table games, which isn’t the best result considering the overall improvement of the Macau region (also read: MGM Resorts' Q2 Earnings Beat on Higher Revenues).MGM shares quickly slumped to an intraday low of $32.31, a drop of more than 4.6% from yesterday’s close. The stock has since recovered slightly, but it is unlikely to win over too much investor favor given the relative strength of its competitors’ earnings reports so far.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1079,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for MGM broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 1.5% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for MGM stock.If that wasn’t enough, MGM isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while 1 has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for MGM. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1080,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is one of the leading companies in the gaming and lodging industry. The company’s properties are well-diversified within U.S. and Macau, which is the only gambling destination in China.MGM Resorts’ earnings are benefitting from higher demand at its properties in Las Vegas on the back of improving employment rate trends and increasing tourism numbers in the region. Moreover, diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options bode well. Particularly, the opening of MGM National Harbor, a casino resort, on Dec 8, 2016, should drive revenues. Additionally, the company’s profit growth plan is also poised to further boost profits.Given the improved operating environment in Macau, the company’s consistent efforts to boost tourism and traffic therein, has started yielding results with revenues at MGM China improving on a year-over-year basis in the last two quarters. In fact, this happened after it witnessed consistent year-over-year declines since the second quarter of 2014.Though it seems that the worst is over for Macau’s gambling industry, concerns related to the sustainability of revenues from the VIP market still linger, suggesting that it will take some time for the region to return to its former glory.Investors should note that the consensus estimate for MGM has hardly witnessed any significant movement over the last 60 days. Meanwhile, MGM’s earnings have been mostly strong over the past few quarters.

1081,MGM,"Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN  -  Free Report) posted solid results for second-quarter 2017, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.However, the company’s shares declined nearly 4% in afterhours trading on Jul 25, mirroring investor concerns surrounding the weakness in Macau’s mass market and somewhat lower-than-expected results at Wynn palace.Earnings and Revenues DiscussionAdjusted earnings per share of $1.18 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09 by 8.3%. Further, earnings increased 10.3% from the year-ago figure of $1.07, given a substantial rise in revenues.Wynn Resorts’ revenues of $1.53 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 billion by 5.3%.

Meanwhile, table games turnover in the VIP segment soared 35.3% to $16.02 billion. However, the VIP table games win rate (based on turnover) was 3.53%, down 45 basis points (bps) year over year but above the projected range of 2.7% to 3%.Table drop in the mass market segment was $1.07 billion, down 9%.

Thus, the second quarter of 2017 represents the third full quarter of operations for this resort.Wynn Resorts’ revenues from Wynn Palace were $414.7 million in the quarter, while casino revenues totaled to $372.2 million.While table games turnover in the VIP segment was nearly $11.60 billion, VIP table games win rate (based on turnover) was 2.18%, below the expected range of 2.7–3%.Notably, table drop in the mass market segment was $729 million.

In the quarter, adjusted property EBITDA stood at $87.4 million.Though Wynn Palace is poised to witness increased visits from tourists and leisure gamblers over the long term, foot traffic has been low of late due to construction around the resort. As a result, the company failed to fully capitalize on the rebound in Macau gaming revenues in the quarter.Las Vegas OperationsWynn Resorts’ revenues from Las Vegas operations were up 3.1% to $431.9 million on the back of higher casino and non-casino revenues.

1082,MGM,"MGM Resorts International (MGM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 numbers on Jul 27, before the opening bell.Last quarter, MGM Resorts pulled off a 46.15% positive earnings surprise. In fact, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 164.92%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise  MGM Resorts International Price and EPS Surprise | MGM Resorts International QuoteFactors Likely to Affect Q2 ResultsGiven the improved operating environment in Macau, the company’s consistent efforts to boost tourism and traffic therein, has started yielding results with revenues at MGM China improving on a year-over-year basis in the last two quarters. In fact, this happened after it witnessed consistent year-over-year declines since the second quarter of 2014.Per the Macau Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau, gross gaming revenues (GGR) rose in all the three months of the quarter too, thereby continuing the revival in Macao. This, in turn, should boost second-quarter results.But VIP table games’ revenues witnessed a decline of 5% in the previous quarter as turnover plunged 16%. Thus, the results in the to-be-reported quarter may also be somewhat hampered given the lingering anxieties related to the sustainability of revenues from the VIP market.Nevertheless, MGM Resorts’ earnings in the to-be-reported quarter are expected to benefit from higher demand at its properties in Las Vegas on the back of improving employment rate trends and increasing tourism numbers in the region. Moreover, the diversification of its resort portfolio and non-gaming options is likely to propel revenues. Meanwhile, the company’s profit growth plan is poised to increase the quarter’s profits.However, the company expects the Easter calendar shift in April to negatively impact convention room nights. This along with higher-than-normal table games hold in prior-year quarter is thus set to provide tough year-over-year comparisons in the to-be-reported quarter. MGM Resorts thus anticipates its Las Vegas Strip revenues to be flat in the quarter, with casino revenues projected to decline slightly. Nevertheless, non-gaming revenues are expected to rise marginally.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for MGM Resorts this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: MGM Resorts has an Earnings ESP of -3.45%.
