2,WRK,"European automakers led by Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Daimler (DDAIF), Volkswagen (VLKAY) and BMW (BMWYY) steered auto stocks higher Thursday amid unconfirmed reports that Germany and the U.S. may favor a bilateral removal of auto tariffs.The CEOs of Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW met Wednesday with the U.S. ambassador to Germany to discuss American duties on imported European cars, according to Handelsblatt newspaper. Ambassador Richard Grenell reportedly proposed eliminating auto tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic.That idea may have the backing of German carmakers and the German government. It stood in sharp contrast to President Donald Trump's threat of a new 20% levy on EU car imports weeks ago, an RBC Capital Markets analyst said Thursday.""This could also ease fears of an impending trade war, which has been an overhang on the auto industry,"" RBC analyst Joseph Spak wrote. ""Further this could be an indication that the threat of higher tariffs is simply a ploy to get reduced tariffs as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross recently implied.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe news sparked a sector rebound with Fiat Chrysler stock jumping 6% in today's stock market action. Daimler stock, Volkswagen stock and BMW stock surged about 5% each. General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Toyota Motor (TM) and Honda Motor (HMC) rose roughly 1%. Tesla (TSLA) stock fell 0.55%, continuing to skid lower this week.The U.S. currently imposes a 2.5% tariff on EU passenger cars and 25% on imported pickups and SUVs. Meanwhile, the EU slaps a 10% tariff on imported U.S. vehicles, according to RBC Capital Markets.Since President Trump threatened a 20% levy on EU auto imports weeks ago, auto stocks have plunged, especially foreign automakers. The Trump administration argues that it seeks fair and reciprocal trade.In June, Italian-American Fiat Chrysler's stock fell 19%. Germany's Daimler and Volkswagen tanked 12% and 11%, respectively. BMW fell nearly 10% for a second straight month.GM and Ford didn't fall as much in June, but losses were heavy. GM stock fell nearly 8% while Ford stock slid 4%. Global supply chains mean that U.S.-made cars typically have a high share of foreign parts, so Trump tariffs could raise costs substantially. Also, Europe likely would retaliate.No. 2 U.S. carmaker Ford said Thursday it has no plans to hike imported Ford and Lincoln prices in China, as a potential tariff war escalates, Reuters said.China cut tariffs on all auto imports days ago.But it plans to hit back with a tit-for-tat additional 25% levy on American products, including cars, if the U.S. proceeds with tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports starting Friday.Daimler last month warned on full-year earnings, citing in part the U.S.-China trade fight.RBC's Spak also noted ""solid"" car registrations in the European Union in June, up more than 1% year over year. The region saw strong demand for gas and plug-in vehicles, while poor diesel sales weighed on the month, he said.""This highlights the accelerating shift away from diesel in Europe,"" Spak added. ""This bears monitoring for suppliers with diesel portfolios"" such as Borg Warner (BWA), Delphi Technologies (DLPH), and Tenneco (TEN).Shares of all three auto parts giants rose solidly Thursday.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

4,WRK,"Even as President Donald Trump has hit trading partners around the globe with tariffs and sought to carve out protections for key U.S. industries, he has called for tearing down trade barriers. Now the European Union is responding to Trump tariffs with carrots as well as sticks.The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, said Wednesday that 25% tariffs on $3.2 billion worth of American imports, including Harley-Davidson (HOG) motorcycles, will take effect on Friday. Eventually, the slice of U.S. imports hit with EU tariffs could more than double.Yet at the same time, German automakers are moving to head off an expanded Trump trade war threat of a 25% tariff on U.S. imports of European cars. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Daimler (DDAIF), BMW (BMWYY) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) have pitched the idea of both sides killing their auto tariffs, which stand at 10% in the EU vs. 2.5% in the U.S. Daimler has good reason to want a deal.Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross responded positively to the idea, but it comes with a big catch: The German automakers also want the U.S. to kill a 25% tax on imports of pickup trucks and SUVs.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

8,WRK,"Kraton (KRA) has put together the right chemistry since making its critical acquisition of Arizona Chemical two years ago.Just look at the numbers. Shares in Houston-based Kraton, a producer of specialty chemicals, have jumped nearly 90% in the past year as cost-cutting and improved margins expand earnings. Kraton's September-quarter earnings popped 140% year-over-year to $1.51 per share. Analysts estimate 120% profit growth to 64 cents in the December quarter.X Worries over the high-yield debt that Kraton added to pull off the $1.37 billion purchase of Arizona Chemical in early 2016 have faded as the outlook for free-cash-flow growth brightens, Jason Freuchtel, analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, told Investor's Business Daily. Plus, a strong global economy usually bodes well for chemical makers as demand grows for consumer and industrial products.""Arizona was a transformational acquisition and provided a new avenue of growth,"" Freuchtel said. ""Kraton is a value story right now. They're going to be growing free cash flow significantly over the next couple of years. They have a pretty high leverage ratio right now, so Kraton is going to be paying down debt, reducing their interest expense. And Arizona puts them in new geographies with higher margins.""Kraton's legacy petroleum-based polymer products find their way into road asphalt, roofing and shoe soles as well as disposable baby diapers, surgical gloves and rubberized grips of toothbrushes. It diversified through the Arizona Chemical acquisition. Arizona Chemical's products are derived from pine tree pulp, and are used in oilfield services, construction materials, tires and household cleaners.While company debt remains a risk, analysts say that by late 2018, Kraton may be able to refinance high-yield bonds tied to the Arizona Chemical deal, lowering interest expenses. In 2018, analysts estimate Kraton's profit will grow 28% to $3.60 per share following expected 19% growth last year.Kraton outbid several private equity firms for Arizona Chemical, which had passed through several hands on its way to Kraton. International Paper (IP) sold Arizona Chemical to buyout firm Rhone Capital in 2007. Then Rhone Capital sold Arizona Chemical to American Securities in 2010.With the purchase of Arizona Chemical, Kraton became a rival of Ingevity (NGVT), which was spun off by WestRock (WRK) in 2016. Ingevity in October agreed to buy the pine chemicals business of Georgia-Pacific for $315 million.The pricing power of both Kraton and Ingevity could improve, thanks to industry consolidation and higher energy prices that boost demand for oilfield services, Chris Kapsch, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, told IBD. Kraton's management pounced on an opportunity by targeting Arizona Chemical, says Kapsch.""In this environment, with an increasingly global chemical industry, and with capital markets placing a premium on companies that have more scale, scope and liquidity, Kraton recognized that Arizona would enhance value over time. It nearly doubled the size of the company,"" Kapsch said.Kraton is no stranger to buyouts. Its roots go back to the mid-1960s when it was part of Shell Chemical. The company was spun out by Shell in 2001 and acquired by private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings. JPMorgan (JPM) and TPG Capital, in turn, bought Kraton from Ripplewood in 2003.Kraton went public in late 2009 during the global recession, with the initial public offering raising $139 million. TPG and JPMorgan exited in 2011 through a secondary offering. Kraton's biggest institutional holders currently are BlackRock and Frontier Capital Management.Prior to the Arizona Chemical deal, Kraton aimed at getting bigger through a merger with Taiwan's LCY Chemical in 2014. The deal fell apart after various issues at LCY surfaced. Freuchtel says, however, that Kraton management likely would have stayed on had the merger gone through.In another move targeting the fast-growing Asian market, Kraton formed a joint venture with Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical. Kraton and Formosa opened a new manufacturing plant in May 2017 for products made from what's known as a hydrogenated styrenic block copolymer, or HSBC. The plant will make HSBC products for plastic automotive parts, medical applications and other markets.Kraton's polymer business uses raw materials butadiene, styrene and isoprene to make products for adhesives, coatings, consumer and industrial products. The pricing of those raw materials can be volatile, impacting earnings. Kraton's bottom line took a hit in the first half of 2017 from a spike in butadiene prices.HSBC products, specialty polymers, often use butadiene and are more complex to manufacture. HSBC products provide strength, flexibility or durability depending on the end-market. Kraton's specialty polymers provide the soft feel in the rubberized grips of toothbrushes or power tools; they make diapers stretchier.Lower-margin unhydrogenated styrenic block, or USBC, products use styrene and are ingredients for asphalt paving, roofing materials and footwear.Kraton's Cariflex-branded, isoprene-based rubber latex, meanwhile, has given it a strong position in allergy-resistant surgical gloves, says Freuchtel. He says Kraton has focused on markets with higher pricing, such as surgical gloves and condoms, and has reduced its reliance on commodity products, such as those used in asphalt and footwear, where it competes with larger companies such as Sinopec.Kraton's specialty HSBC business has been growing revenue at about 5% while the Cariflex business has been growing at 10% to 15%, says Freuchtel.""Their whole business plan is to really focus on expanding share with Cariflex and HSBC while still maintaining share in USBC,"" he said.Kraton has manufacturing plants in Ohio, Germany, France, Brazil and Japan. It's aiming to make manufacturing more efficient globally. The joint venture in Taiwan will help realign HSBC production, says Kapsch.After buying Arizona Chemical, Kraton aimed for $70 million in cost savings by the end of 2018 and it seems on track to deliver, analysts say.One plus for Kraton is a long-term supply deal with Arizona Chemical's former parent, International Paper, which sells Kraton raw pine material, called crude tall oil. Kraton distills various pine-based specialty chemicals from the oil.

9,WRK,"Ford Motor (F) won't dash hopes when it reports earnings Wednesday, having recently warned investors that its profits for 2017 and 2018 will miss expectations. But Ford managers may not reassure analysts on shortfalls in its electric and autonomous strategy.X Rival Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) issues its results Thursday, with General Motors (GM), which unlike Ford gave upbeat guidance last week, set to follow Feb. 6.For Ford, analysts see EPS growing 47% to 44 cents as revenue edges up 3% to $37.15 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares edged up 0.2% to 12.02 in Monday's stock market trading, following a sharp 9% tumble last week.That drop in Ford stock — to the lowest level since November — came after the automaker's preliminary 2017 results and 2018 guidance, provided at the Detroit auto show, underwhelmed investors. The company cited higher commodity prices and currency volatility.Ford said preliminary 2017 EPS was likely $1.78 vs. the Zacks estimate of $1.81. It's unclear how much analysts have adjusted their official Q4 estimates as a result.Ford plans to shake up its production lineup, as consumers continue to forsake passenger cars for big-ticket SUVs and trucks. Automakers also must juggle plans for the vehicles in demand today with plans for the technologies that will shape the future of cars.Ford is eager to be seen as a leader in emerging auto technologies. It said earlier this month it will more than double its investment in electrified vehicles. It also will test self-driving cars for ride-sharing in a new and unnamed city this quarter. But Ford's 2021 target for launching a new robotaxi business trails that of rival GM by two years. Moreover, its management has been light to date on details about its autonomous and electric car strategy, and long lead times may mean that changes implemented now won't produce results until 2019-2020, analysts at RBC Capital Markets say.""Ford seems to be investing for industry change,"" RBC's Joseph Spak wrote in a Monday note. ""However, if the cycle turns or if the secular challenges accelerate, time may not play into Ford's favor.""Spak lowered his price target from $14 to $13, but said Ford's attractive and above-average dividend yield of 5% adds support.IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine high dividend yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend.For Fiat Chrysler, EPS should grow 76% to 67 cents (Zacks does not have revenue).Shares rose 1.1% to 24.19 on Monday for a fresh closing high. They have gained 32% from their breakout past an 18.43 flat-base entry in six weeks, putting them in profit-taking sell territory.Fiat Chrysler stock has more than doubled in the past year, on hopes of rising profits and talk of strategic deals, including with China's Great Wall Motor and South Korea's Hyundai.In the Jeep SUV, the Italian-American automaker sees a valuable brand poised to greatly expand its global appeal this year. The Jeep brand is worth more than Fiat Chrysler, a Morgan Stanley analyst said last year, leading to speculation about a spinoff, similar to that of the luxury Ferrari (RACE) sportscar brand in 2015-2016.Fiat Chrysler joined the self-driving alliance among BMW (BMWYY), Intel (INTC) and Intel's recently acquired Mobileye unit.

According to Mobileye, EyeQ5 targets Fully Autonomous Driving (Level 5) vehicles that will hit the road in 2020.Krzanich added: ""Where the rubber hits the road is deep learning — you have to turn that data into an understanding of the world, have high confidence in that, then (determine) how do I navigate from point A to point B.""While the new EyeQ5 SOC harnesses technologies from Israel-based Mobileye, Intel's recent $15.3 billion acquisition, Intel also has been working with Alphabet (GOOGL)-unit Waymo on self-driving cars and has a self-driving coalition with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) and BMW (BMWYY), among other partners.BMW said at Automobility LA on Tuesday that its autonomous cars, developed in partnership with Intel and Mobileye, will be on the road in 2021.

16,WRK,"The pain that often comes with radical change — such as the internet explosion disrupting just about every industry on the planet — could soon visit automakers.XExperts say electric vehicles, a market fueled by Tesla (TSLA), could bring widespread disruption and dramatically shrink the number of carmakers over the next couple of decades.In a recent blog post, Richard Windsor, analyst at Edison Investment Research, called the advent of electric vehicles an ""extinction level event"". One sign: China has said it will eventually ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles.""Electric vehicles could trigger a huge decline in vehicle demand,"" Windsor wrote. ""Unlike the optimists, we do not see EVs as the beginning of a new golden age for the vehicle makers but instead be the trigger for a potential collapse in demand from which most of them will never recover.""Every major auto manufacturer is going full throttle into making electric vehicles, including General Motors (GM), Ford (F), BMW (BMWYY), Volvo and Volkswagen (VLKAY). And you can find within their ranks that Windsor isn't alone in being concerned about the tectonic shift in manufacturing and competition.Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler (DDAIF), one of the most aggressive developers of electric vehicles, delivered a strong warning about electric cars at its annual investor's day conference last week. As electric vehicle manufacturing kicks into full swing, profit margins could swoon, the company said.""In the beginning of the cycle we believe that we will have to face a significantly lower margin, for some vehicles half of the margin of the vehicles they replace,"" Frank Lindenberg, vice president of finance at Mercedes-Benz Cars, said at the conference. He said Daimler plans to cut billions in spending to help offset the lower profits on electric cars.There are several factors that come into play in order for the electric car revolution to succeed. Among them is the expansion of charging stations, which is just getting underway. Second, carmakers need to make inroads in their never-ending battle toward making a single charge last as long as a tank of gas, as well as shortening charging times to compete with the five-minute fill-up at the service station.The other is the need to bring down battery costs. Right now, electric cars cost more than piston-engine cars because of the batteries. Tesla, Daimler and others are building large battery manufacturing plants to bring costs down and build supply. Daimler thinks that electric will reach cost parity with piston-engine cars by 2025, which will accelerate mass production of electric cars.Tesla recently began producing its first mass-market car, the Model 3, its third all-electric vehicle. It's also preparing to unveil an all-electric semitrailer truck, possibly by Oct. 26, adding to the disruption. Other truck manufacturers say they support the electric vehicle movement and are in it for the long haul.IBD'S TAKE: The automakers rank 21st in stock performance out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD. Tesla holds an IBD Composite Rating of 81 out of a possible 99. Innovation can be the key to future big-winning stocks. To learn which stocks are leading the market now, check out IBD's Stock Lists.""We believe Tesla's reveal of its autonomous, electric Class 8 semi-truck this month could be the biggest catalyst in trucking in decades and potentially set off separation between the technology leaders and the laggards among carriers, shippers, truck OEMs and suppliers,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker in a research note to clients on Thursday.Windsor's prediction of mass disruption includes massive consolidation, with the industry shrinking to about 5 or 6 vehicle makers, down from more than two dozen today.Edison Research has concluded that owning an electric vehicle could easily halve the amount of money that the consumer spends on private transportation. Windsor said this is because electric vehicles should last much longer than internal combustion vehicles, allowing them to travel up to five times more miles than vehicles that run on fuel before they need to be replaced.Of the vehicle makers, said Windsor, ""We continue to think that BMW and Tesla have the best chances of survival but we think even BMW might struggle to survive a decline in demand of this scale.""The electric vehicle trend also comes as manufacturers are pouring billions into driverless vehicles, which also are expected to lower auto demand. Uber plans to have fleets of autonomous vehicles delivering passengers to destinations, negating the need for some to own a car, for example.When electric vehicles reach cost parity with internal combustion vehicles, they will be much cheaper to own when considering the cost to drive per mile, Windsor believes. They will have far less moving parts than internal combustion vehicles, meaning there is less to go wrong and fix or replace, he wrote.With the greater longevity of electric vehicles, Windsor thinks, a vehicle market that is all electric will sharply lower annual consumption. Consumer purchases of new vehicles could fall to half the size of the current market, even as low as 20%, he thinks.""In the U.S.A., this means a market of 3.4 million to 8.5 million light passenger vehicles compared to the 17 million that are sold today,"" Windsor wrote.There is an upside, though.Electric vehicles will all likely to be connected to the cloud, collecting a myriad data while on the road.""This data should enable a series of highly valuable services for which users will be willing to either pay for or consume advertising,"" Windsor wrote. ""We very much doubt that it would make up for the revenue lost from lower vehicle demand but it will be much higher margin than selling vehicles which should soften the blow.""Among  recent activity in the all-electric auto market, Ford recently signed a pact with a China-based automaker to explore jointly building and selling all-electric vehicles in that country. Ford has invested $4.5 billion to make electric vehicles for customers worldwide.Plus, General Motors is investing heavily in its Chevrolet Bolt EV, an all-electric vehicle. The Bolt recently beat Tesla in mileage range in tests conducted by a consumer watchdog group.Tesla shares are currently at the high end of a buy range and touched a new high Monday at 389.61 before closing trading at 385, up 1.4%. GM, meanwhile, was down fractionally Monday to 38.59. Ford was essentially flat at 11.63.RELATED:Tesla Second-Quarter Results Beat As Model 3 Production RampsNissan Turns Over New Leaf, But Will It Challenge Tesla Model 3 Or Chevy Bolt?Tesla, China Are Driving An 'Epic' Revolution In Auto Engineering

25,WRK,"In a rare disclosure of its auto sales, Tesla Motors (TSLA) towered over Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the U.S. luxury sedan market in the third quarter.Sales of the Tesla Model S luxury sedan captured nearly a third of all sales in the category and thumping Mercedes-Benz (DDAIF) and BMW (BMWYY).IBD'S TAKE: Tesla's stock has not been great in 2016. For a top-rated, high-growth auto-related stock, check under the hood. Nvidia released a new AI chip for self-driving cars.According to data accessed by Bloomberg and compiled by Tesla, sales of the Model S leapt 59% in Q3 vs. Q3 2015, to 9,156 vehicles. In second was the Mercedes-Benz S Class at 4,921 vehicles sold, down 9%. No. 3 was the BMW 7 Series, with 3,634 sold but up a strong 219%.In the luxury SUV market, according to Bloomberg, Tesla says its new Model X sold 5,428 U.S. cars in Q3. The Model X outsold Porsches and Land Rovers but trailed seven SUV models made by Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac, Volvo, Audi, and Lexus.Tesla says the high-end version of its Model S is the third-fastest-acceleration production car ever produced, able to hit 60 mph in 2.5 seconds.Last week, Tesla announced it delivered a record 24,500 vehicles in Q3 — 15,800 Model S vehicles and 8,700 Model X vehicles. It's a 70% increase over Q2's 14,402 deliveries and above various analyst forecasts for about 22,000.Tesla stock, however, fell a fraction, to 200.24, in the stock market today, and has been below its 50-day moving average — a key support level — for more than six weeks.Musk urged employees in an Aug. 29 email to push hard on deliveries and achieve profitability in Q3 to ""convince potential investors to bet on us.""Tesla, while it holds an advantage in electric vehicle production and sales, could lose its edge to premium auto companies in the long run, a survey by UBS suggests.Tesla is juggling several big clubs. It's working on ramping production as it also fights to complete the proposed acquisition of SolarCity (SCTY). Tesla needs billions of dollars to help finish the battery Gigafactory and to expand facilities to gear up for the Model 3, which is slated to start deliveries in late 2017.This week Tesla and SolarCity set Nov. 17 as the date for shareholders to vote on whether to approve the merger of both companies.

26,WRK,"The public spat between Tesla Motors (TSLA) and Mobileye (MBLY), who are ending their partnership, became increasingly acrimonious over the past week, but Wall Street has decided that one stock is the clear loser.Last week, Mobileye shares tumbled 9.5% last week, plunging through the 50-day line. It was the biggest weekly loss since January. Mobileye fell 2.65% to 41.80 on the stock market today, hitting its worst levels since June 29.Tesla Motors shares rose 5.6% last week, rebounding from 11-week lows. Tesla edged up 0.5% Monday. However, it's hard to declare Tesla a clear-cut winner. Tesla is still down slightly in September and is still below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.On Sunday, Sept. 11, Tesla announced that it would update its Autopilot software, relying more on radar systems and less on camera-based systems. CEO Elon Musk said that the upgrades would ""very likely"" have prevented the fatal crash of a Model S operating under Autopilot.Favoring radar over cameras seemed to undercut Mobileye, which focuses on camera-based driver assistance programs.IBD'S TAKE: While Tesla and Mobileye engage in rhetorical road rage, Nvidia offers a quality autonomous driving play. The chipmaker has stellar earnings growth and now has a proper flat base, with a 63.60 buy point after finding support at the 10-week line. In the current market, be cautious about making purchases, but keep an eye on Nvidia's stock chart.On Wednesday, Mobileye Chairman Amnon Shashua said Tesla was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety,"" spurring the company to cut ties with the electric car maker in July. He said Tesla's use and marketing of Autopilot was irresponsible.""It is not designed to cover all possible crash situations in a safe manner,"" he told Reuters. ""No matter how you spin it, (Autopilot) is not designed for that. It is a driver assistance system and not a driverless system.""On Thursday, Tesla said the split reflected its desire to build more driver-assistance programs in-house.""Tesla has been developing its own vision capability in-house for some time with the goal of accelerating performance improvements,"" the automaker said in a statement. ""After learning that Tesla would be deploying this product, Mobileye attempted to force Tesla to discontinue this development, pay them more, and use their products in future hardware.""On Friday, Mobileye fired back at Tesla:""In communications dating back to May 2015 between Mobileye Chairman and Tesla's CEO, Mobileye expressed safety concerns regarding the use of Autopilot hands-free. After a subsequent face to face meeting, Tesla's CEO confirmed that activation of Autopilot would be 'hands on.' Despite this confirmation, Autopilot was rolled out in late 2015 with a hands-free activation mode.""Mobileye's statement continued:""Tesla's response to the May 7 crash, wherein the company shifted blame to the camera, and later corrected and shifted blame to the radar, indicated to Mobileye that Mobileye's relationship with Tesla could not continue. Failing agreement on necessary changes in the relationship, Mobileye terminated its association with Tesla. As for Tesla's claim that Mobileye was threatened by Tesla's internal computer vision efforts, the company has little knowledge of these efforts other than an awareness that Tesla had put together a small team.""Also Friday, Elon Musk said in a tweet that he hoped to roll out the Autopilot update, which also includes safeguards vs. hands-free driving, on Wednesday.@vicentes @EdibleApple Hoping to start WW rollout of 8.0 on Wednesday if no last minute issues discovered.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 16, 2016Mobileye has partnerships with many automakers, including a pact with BMW (BMWYY) and Intel (INTC) to have a fully autonomous vehicle ready for market by 2021.

29,WRK,"A preliminary report by federal regulators on the fatal crash of a Tesla Motors (TSLA) vehicle in Florida does not state the probable cause for the crash, and the cause might not be known for a year.The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday issued its preliminary report for the investigation of the fatal highway crash on May 7 near Williston, Fla.The NTSB said the report details the collision involving a 53-foot semitrailer and a 2015 Tesla Model S. According to data downloaded from the car, the indicated vehicle speed was 74 mph just prior to impact, and the posted speed limit was 65 mph.The report came on the same day that Mobileye (MBLY), a Tesla supplier of advanced driver-assistance systems, disclosed that its partnership with Tesla was ending. Mobileye executives said its EyeQ3 technology used for image analysis in Tesla's cars with its Autopilot technology would not extend beyond what's currently used in Tesla vehicles.Mobileye stock plunged 8% to finish at 45.33.

The car was also equipped with automatic emergency braking that is designed to automatically apply the brakes to reduce the severity of or assist in avoiding frontal collisions, it said.Aspects of the crash remain under investigation. While no timeline has been established, final reports are generally published 12 months after the release of a preliminary report, the NTSB release said.""A team of five NTSB investigators traveled to Williston to conduct the on-scene phase of the investigation,"" the release said. ""The team used three-dimensional laser scanning technology to document the crash location, the damaged trailer and the damaged car.""NTSB investigators continue to collect and analyze performance data from the car's multiple electronic systems. These data along with other information collected during the on-scene phase of the investigation will be used to evaluate the crash events.""All aspects of the crash remain under investigation.Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk released his ""Secret Mast Plan Part Deux"" that outlined his long-term plan for the electric-car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY).Tesla has made a $2.8 billion bid to acquire SolarCity, a move that's been widely criticized.

35,WRK,"“A well-diversified portfolio needs just four stocks,” believes billionaire investor Charlie Munger. Going by his words, we bring to you four stocks from top-ranked Zacks sectors to make the most of this earnings season.  But why choose stocks from four different sectors? In a volatile market, portfolio diversification is the key to mitigate risks of overexposure to one sector. Currently, markets are suffering from heavy bouts of volatility as investors apprehend a trade war from the bitter exchanges between the Unites States and China over tariffs and also from the recent chemical bomb attack on Syria. In the wake of this, diversification can be considered an ideal way to safeguard one’s portfolio from market upheavals.Sectors in SpotlightThe Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Construction and Aerospace sectors are ranked as the top four, out of 16, based on our in-house classifications. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two. (Learn more: About About Zacks Sector Rank).Further, per the latest Earnings Trends, earnings and revenues from these sectors are expected to surge in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick stocks from these sectors which are also likely to outperform earnings estimates. But before that, let’s take a closer look at these sectors to find out what has been working in favor of them.Industrial Products (1 out of 16) Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 24.1%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 12.5%Rise in industrial production data indicates that manufacturing activity remains strong. Tax cuts and strong economic conditions have provided a firm basis for manufacturing activity. With the Purchasing Managers' Index touching 50.9% in March, the manufacturing space looks in good shape. A reading of 50 or higher signals at a thriving manufacturing industry in the United States.Basic Materials (2 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 41.3%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 20.3%Sustained growth, stronger inflation and government policies have worked in favor of the sector to a large extent. The U.S. government’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum is likely to provide a short-term boost to basic materials. Also, with Trump’s $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan in place, basic materials prices are likely to receive a boost.Construction (3 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 35.4%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 15.8%Construction sector is in fine fettle buoyed by robust gains from home building investments, strong economic growth and recent tax reforms. Moreover, government project spend is expected to increase in 2018, with the Trump Administration’s $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan in place. As per the study by Dodge Data & Analytics, public works construction is expected rise 3% in 2018.Aerospace (4 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 13.4%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 3.6%Increasing budget allocations in America -- in view of escalating geopolitical tensions worldwide -- have been boosting the stocks in this space along with a steady improvement in air traffic that has substantially driven commercial airplane demand. Moreover, advent of innovative technologies in warfare and their increased application as well as higher demand for cost-efficient production are driving revenues in the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry.How to Pick the Winners for the Season?Selecting an S&P 500 stock from each top-ranked sector should be the first step.

36,WRK,"A sustained period of low growth and low inflation has ensured that basic materials stocks have been out of favor for quite some time now. Their capital intensive nature made them unsuitable investment choices in such an environment. But these out of fashion picks recently made a comeback after Trump announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, potentially skewing the pitch in favor of domestic producers.Currently, multiple factors are working in the sector’s favor, boosting its investment worthiness in the short run. Prospects of a sustained period of growth and a pickup in inflation are likely to brighten the prospects of basic materials companies. Further, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select basic materials stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.Inflation Pickup, Trump’s Actions Boosting Sector ProspectsInflation fears had caught investors unaware earlier this year, leading to heavy losses for markets in early February. Such fears have receded somewhat at present. But sustained wage increases over recent months mean that inflation is likely to tick higher in the near term. In March, average hourly earnings registered a year-over-year increase of 2.7%, higher than the 2.6% recorded in February.Further, Trump’s $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan boosted the price of industrial metals substantially last year. With the White House firm on pushing ahead with this plan, basic materials prices are likely to receive a further fillip. Also, while Trump’s tax cuts are likely to boost U.S. Inc. as a whole, his decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum are, at the very least, likely to provide a short-term boost to basic materials.Earnings Prospects Remain StrongDuring the fourth-quarter, earnings and revenue growth for basic materials was second only to the energy sector. Total Q4 earnings were up +45.2% on +21.3% higher revenues. This trend is likely to continue during the upcoming earnings season. Total Q1 earnings for the sector are expected to be up +41.4% on +20.2% higher revenues. This is second only to expectations for energy, total Q1 earnings for which are expected to be up 60.3% on 15.6% higher revenues.That’s far better than the more vaunted autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by -9.3% and -9.8%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up +17.9% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues. (Read: Bank Earnings Finally Taking Off)Our ChoicesAfter remaining out of favor for quite some time, basic materials stocks are making something of a comeback.

37,WRK,"Arconic Inc. (ARNC  -  Free Report) is slated to release its first-quarter 2018 results before the bell on Apr 30.Arconic’s adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents, translating into a 29.2% positive surprise.Revenues rose around 10% year over year to $3,271 million in the quarter, driven by improved volumes across all segments and higher aluminum prices. Sales also beat Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,070.5 million.Arconic has underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past six months. The company's shares have declined around 10% over this period, compared with roughly 9.3% gain recorded by the industry. Its shares were hit hard following the release of the fourth-quarter results on its downbeat earnings and cash flow guidance for 2018. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayArconic, in its fourth-quarter call, said that it expects revenues for 2018 in the range of $13.4-$13.7 billion. It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.45-$1.55 per share and free cash flow to be around $500 million. Arconic also initiated portfolio and strategy review, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Arconic for the first quarter stands at $3,330 million, reflecting a year over year growth of 4.1%.Arconic is focusing on cost reduction and productivity improvements across its businesses, which should lend support to its bottom line. The company achieved net cost saving of 2.1% of revenues in the last reported quarter and is expected to continue to benefit from its cost actions in the March quarter.Arconic is also seeing strong momentum in automotive, driven by the transition of the auto industry to lightweighting. The company saw a 22% growth in the automotive end-market in 2017 and expects 15-20% growth this year.Moreover, Arconic is witnessing healthy demand trends in the aerospace market and is actively pursuing its aerospace expansion strategy. It is well placed to gain from major contract wins in aerospace. Arconic is witnessing strong momentum in commercial aero engines with sales rising 8% year over year in 2017. The momentum in aerospace is expected to continue in the first quarter.  The company sees a 4-6% growth in aerospace and defense end-market in 2018, higher than 2% in 2017.However, Arconic is exposed to headwind from charges associated with higher aluminum prices, driven by LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting, increased processing costs and metal lag. Higher aluminum prices led to a negative impact of $42 million in the fourth quarter and $84 million for full-year 2017 on its EBITDA margin and may pose some headwinds in the March quarter.  Arconic is also seeing weak sales in industrial gas turbine market due to soft market conditions. The market was down 7% in 2017 and the company expects at least 40% decline in 2018. The company also expects pricing pressure to continue in many of its markets, especially aerospace, and also sees higher raw material prices in 2018.Arconic Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Arconic Inc.

38,WRK,"LyondellBasell Industries (LYB  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results ahead of the bell on Apr 27. The company’s adjusted earnings came in at $2.73 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.52. Revenues increased roughly 18% year over year to $9,135 million in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,785 million. The company witnessed higher sales across its segments in the quarter. LyondellBasell surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters while missing in the other two, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 2.14%. Shares of the company have moved up 21.7% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 9.1% gain.    Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider LyondellBasell, in its fourth-quarter call, noted that strong global demand and delays in capacity additions across the industry have led to improved outlook for 2018. The company expects to realize the benefits of strong operating rates across its global portfolio of assets and continue to reap profits courtesy of the Houston refinery. The company expects strong contributions from its refinery in 2018 driven by the efforts to improve its reliability and performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for LyondellBasell for the first quarter stands at $9.4 billion, reflecting an expected year-over-year growth of 11.4%. Revenues for LyondellBasell’s Intermediates and Derivatives segment for the soon-to-be reported quarter is projected to witness a 34.6% rise from the prior-year quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $2,291 million.  At the Olefins & Polyolefins – Americas segment, revenues are expected to rise 30.4% from the year-ago as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at $2,758 million. Revenues from the Olefins & Polyolefins – Europe, Asia, International division is expected to increase 24.2% year over year as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is projected at $3,201 million for the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Refining segment is pegged at $1,726 million for the first quarter. This reflects an estimated 80.7% increase on a year over year basis. The Technology segment sales are expected to fall 6.8% year over year in the to-be-reported quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $123 million. LyondellBasell is benefiting from the favorable North American natural gas environment. It is executing its expansion projects to leverage the U.S. natural gas liquids advantage. The company’s expansion initiatives are expected to boost capacity and add to its earnings.  Moreover, LyondellBasell, in February, agreed to buy A. Schulman in a deal worth $2.25 billion. The company, last month, secured the U.S. antitrust clearance for its proposed buyout. The buyout doubles the size of LyondellBasell's existing compounding business. It also creates a platform for future growth with reach into additional high-growth markets such as packaging and consumer products, electronics and appliances, building and construction, and agriculture. The acquisition will enable the company to offer a comprehensive range of innovative solutions to customers. LyondellBasell expects to capture $150 million in run-rate cost synergies within two years. Moreover, LyondellBasell and SUEZ, last month, completed a transaction that makes them 50/50 partner in the Netherlands-based premium plastics recycling company, Quality Circular Polymers. For many years, LyondellBasell has been witnessing increased demand for reused and recycled plastics, particularly in Europe. The latest move helps the company to create an innovative system that can be scaled as the circular economy grows. The two partners will be able to leverage their respective strengths through this joint business. However, LyondellBasell’s operations remain subject to maintenance outages which is affecting its results. The company expects lost production due to a planned maintenance on one of its two crackers at Channelview during first and second quarter of 2018 to affect its results by roughly $100 million, with half of the impact expected in the first quarter. Moreover, the U.S. Gulf Coast experienced unusually cold weather during the third week of January 2018, causing disruptions across the industry and affecting the company’s assets. LyondellBasell expects these disruptions to reduce its first quarter results by roughly $45 million.  LyondellBasell Industries N.V. Price and EPS Surprise  LyondellBasell Industries N.V.

39,WRK,"The following is an excerpt from Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank’s full Apr Market Strategy report To access the full PDF, click here. April has arrived.A potential for a major trade war with China weighs heavily upon the market’s mind.Read on.I supply you with more background on how this might play out. The global narrative the market is listening to offers a chaotic mix of contradictions, with positives and negatives.There are 60 days to go before major China tariffs are to be imposed. Until then, watch the China-U.S. trade negotiations undertaken by the U.S. Treasury.It won’t be the only political theater available. This is just the most hopeful one.Zacks April Global OutlookFor a Global Outlook I make Five Points in April. Unfortunately, they contradict each other.(1) Trade War now the Biggest “Tail Risk” to the Stock Market…(2) However, Rotation to Global Growth Sectors Must Be Favored, Based on EPS Outlooks. The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q1 2018 is 17.0%.–      For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the earnings growth rate is 16.1%.–      For companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the earnings growth rate is 19.3%.Global Exposure Double Sales Growth!–      The estimated sales growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q1 2018 is 7.2%.–       For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the sales growth rate is 5.8%.–      For companies that generate less than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the sales growth rate is 11.4%. This is the best reason to stick with global growth stocks. (3) What Sectors Drive the Expected Outperformance of S&P 500 Companies with Higher Global Revenue Exposure? •       At the sector level, the Info Tech, Energy, and Materials sectors are projected to be the largest contributors to earnings and revenue growth in Q1-2018 for S&P 500 companies with more global exposure.•       At the sector level, Info Tech (60%),Health Care (58%), and Energy (57%) sectors also have the highest percentages of Buy ratings, from covering analysts.•       Take Energy off the list. With close to 990 Horizontal Fracking rigs up and running in N. America, the oil price outlook is not favorable (basically flat to $2 a barrel down)(4) “Canary in the Coal Mine”The Trade War issue is a big problem for Japan right now. The Yen is being used as a safe haven, in a U.S. political environment that has ratcheted up worry over a trade war. 106 on the Yen is safe haven driven. Keep your eyes on the Yen as the proxy for Trade War uncertainty.(5) The Current Monthly Pace of European Central Bank Bond Buying: €30 billion. It is intended to run to the end of Sept. 2018, or beyond, if necessary. Keep this stimulus in mind.Zacks April Sector/Industry/Company TelescopeApril Zacks Industry Ranks shows EPS upside leaders to be international revenue growth related.The three sector leaders were the most exposed internationally: Info Tech, Industrials, & Materials specifically.The fourth strong sector was Consumer Discretionary. Such sector strength says there remain internal cyclical domestic drivers within a profitable, earnings-driven, late stage economy. The low 4.0% U.S. unemployment rate must matter.A number of sectors fell back to a Market Weight in April: Financials, Energy, Health Care, and Consumer Staples. That happens when earnings season reporting is not underway.Utilities rose in April. So did Telcos. But the sector defensives remain at the back.1) Info Tech stays HOT and Very Attractive. Misc. Tech is the new leader, although Semiconductors stay as a top niche again in April. Electronics is another hot Tech industry to watch.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stock: Micron (MU  -  Free Report)(2) Industrials stay Very Attractive. The leaders in order: Machinery, Aerospace & Defense, Pollution Control, and Metal Fabricating.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stock: Schneider Electric SE (SBGSY  -  Free Report)(3) Materials stay Very Attractive. The 2 leaders are Paper and Containers & Glass.Zacks #1 Rank (STRONG BUY) Stock: WestRock Company (WRK  -  Free Report)(4) Consumer Discretionary stays Attractive. Leaders are Home Furnishing-Appliance, Autos-Tires-Trucks, Electronics and Other Consumer Discretionary.(5) Financials sinks to a Market Weight. The strong spot is Insurance. After that, Major Banks. Then, it settles into “Muddle Through” industry ranking here.(6) Energy sinks to Market Weight. The 2 leaders are Coal and Oil Exploration & Production. Nothing pops up after that.(7) Health Care sinks to Market Weight. The soft leader stays Medical Care.(8) Consumer Staples sinks to Market Weight. The sole strong industry is Food.(9) Utilities rise to Market Weight. Utilities-Gas Distribution looks great.(10) Telco Services rise up to Unattractive.

40,WRK,"WestRock Company (WRK  -  Free Report) remains well-poised for growth, backed by its focus on execution of capital allocation strategy and KapStone acquisition. Improving industry conditions and a positive volume along with pricing dynamics are other key growth drivers for the company. However, raw material cost inflation and weak demand for processed foods as well as carbonated drinks remain headwinds.The provider of paper and packaging solutions with a market capitalization of approximately $16 billion, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 12.8%.Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible downsides.Factors Favoring WestRockPositive Estimate Revisions, Growth ProjectionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 for WestRock has been revised nearly 1% and around 5% upward, respectively, over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings is pegged at $3.90, reflecting an estimated year-over-year growth of 49%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2019 is pegged at $4.76, representing an estimated year-over-year surge of 82%.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryWestRock outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 13.48%.Price PerformanceShares of WestRock have outperformed its industry over the past six months. The stock has gained around 12% compared with the industry’s growth of 10%.  Higher Inventory Turnover RatioOver the trailing 12 months, the inventory turnover ratio for WestRock has been 7.1% compared with the industry’s level of 6.1%. The higher the metric is, faster will be the rate at which it is sold, suggesting effective inventory management.  Growth Drivers in PlaceWestRock is well-poised to gain from a continuous focus on the execution of disciplined capital allocation strategy. The company paid $110 million as dividends in first-quarter fiscal 2018, invested $214 million in capital expenditures and $108 million to increase its ownership interest in Grupo Gondi.The company has strong opportunities to invest in business as well as M&A activity. Thus, it expects to allocate more capital toward growth and margin improvement opportunities than share repurchases in the near term.Further, the company projected base capital expenditures of $850 million for fiscal 2018. Approximately, half the amount will be spent on maintenance and replacement projects while the remaining for improving mill and converting assets. Additionally, the company has plans to invest $100 million in two strategic projects namely the Brazilian box plant and the installation of the state-of-the-art curtain coder at the Mahrt mill.In January 2018, WestRock agreed to acquire all the outstanding shares of rival KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (KS  -  Free Report). The buyout will enhance WestRock’s North American corrugated packaging business and provide complementary products. The deal will also help WestRock fortify its presence in the Western United States and to compete better in the growing agricultural markets in the region.Moreover, the company anticipates robust growth in fiscal 2018 owing to overall congenial industry conditions, a positive volume and pricing dynamics. WestRock predicted revenues of around $16.3 billion in the fiscal, reflecting 10% year-over-year growth. Its adjusted segment EBITDA will likely be higher than $2.8 billion, a 20% jump over fiscal 2017.Headwinds for WestRockDuring second-quarter fiscal 2018, WestRock apprehends moderate inflation in OCC (old corrugated container) prices. Commodity inflation is projected at around $40-$45 million pretax for the quarter. Moreover, the wintry chill may leave an additional $15-$20 million sequential impact.Again, the folding carton markets remain challenged by soft demand for processed, frozen and dry foods. This is in line with the ongoing consumer preference for fresh foods. Moreover, demand for carbonated drinks continues to be a drag, particularly in North America, which might affect WestRock’s performance.Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock for the moment as it shows ample prospects of outperforming its peers in the near future.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Veritiv Corporation (VRTV  -  Free Report) and Stora Enso Oyj (SEOAY  -  Free Report). While Veritiv Corporation sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Stora Enso carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Veritiv has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6%. Its shares have climbed 20% over the past six months.Stora Enso has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.5%. The stock has surged 31.5% in the past six months.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

41,WRK,"On Mar 6, we issued an updated research report on WestRock Company (WRK  -  Free Report). Favorable industry conditions and positive volume along with pricing dynamics will drive the company’s fiscal 2018 results. Execution of its capital allocation strategy and the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (KS  -  Free Report), once complete, will drive growth. However, increased debts to fund the deal along with inflationary costs of raw materials remain headwinds. First-Quarter 2018 Results Top, Upbeat Outlook WestRock’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share soared 85% on a year-over-year basis and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Despite commodity cost inflation, the company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter to be higher than year-ago quarter’s adjusted EPS of 54 cents. Backed by overall industry conditions, positive volume and pricing dynamics, the company anticipates strong growth in fiscal 2018. Net sales growth is projected to be up approximately 10% year over year, leading to revenues of around $16.3 billion. Adjusted segment EBITDA is likely to be higher than $2.8 billion, a 20% increase over fiscal 2017. This includes approximately $275 million-$300 million in productivity and acquisition-related synergies. KapStone Buyout Will Enhance Presence, Product Portfolio WestRock previously announced that it will acquire all the outstanding shares of rival KapStone at $35 per share. On conclusion, the deal is anticipated to be accretive immediately to WestRock's adjusted earnings as well as cash flow and lead to around $200 million of annual cost synergies and performance improvements, with half to be realized within first 12 months. KapStone’s corrugated packaging operations will enhance WestRock’s North American corrugated packaging business and provide complementary products in geographical locations that will enable WestRock to better serve customers across the system. The deal will help the company strengthen presence in western United States and to compete better in the growing agricultural markets in the region. It also fast-tracks its target to improve margins of North American corrugated packaging business. The company will also be able to broaden portfolio of paper grades, allowing it to capitalize on the kraft bag market with the inclusion of KapStone's complementary specialty kraft paper offerings. Focus on Corrugated Packaging to Stoke Growth In a bid to tap growing demand for corrugated packaging, WestRock bought the assets of Island Container Corp. and Combined Container Industries LLC — two independent producers of corrugated boxes, sheets and point-of-purchase displays. The company purchased five corrugated converting facilities in Ohio, PA, and Louisiana, from U.S. Corrugated, a large independent manufacturer of corrugated products for packaging and displays.  The acquisition of Plymouth Packaging will help the company to tap growing on-demand corrugated packaging market. Notably, the addition of Plymouth Packaging’s Box on Demand system will enhance WestRock’s differentiation in e-commerce and other custom applications, where on-site box making is required. The buyout will also fortify its automated packaging systems business. The pending KapStone deal is another step in sync with the strategy. Inflated Costs to Hurt Q2 Transportation costs are being negatively impacted by winter weather. The winter weather is also pushing virgin fiber costs higher by 2-3%. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, commodity inflation is projected at around $40-$45 million pre-tax for the quarter. Moreover, the winter weather may have an additional $15-$20 million sequential impact. Higher Debt to Fund Deal  WestRock plans to fund the cash portion of the KapStone deal through new debt and plans to refinance KapStone's assumed debts at the close of the deal. WestRock’s current debt-to-capitalization ratio is at 37%. Higher interest expenses will affect margins.  WestRock has underperformed the industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has gained 29.5%, while the industry has recorded growth of 30.5%.  Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider WestRock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same sector include Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) and CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report). Both stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Allegheny Technologies has delivered an average earnings surprise of 41.72% over the past four quarters. Its shares have rallied 56% in the past year. CF Industries has delivered an average earnings surprise of 72.87% over the past four quarters. Its shares have gained 56% in the past year. Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than Visa The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months. They’re now bigger than Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Visa! The new asset class may expand even more rapidly in 2018 as new investors continue pouring in and Wall Street becomes increasingly involved. Zacks has just named 4 companies that enable investors to take advantage of the explosive growth of cryptocurrencies via the stock market. Click here to access these stocks >>

46,WRK,"CVR Partners, LP (UAN  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results, ahead of the bell on Apr 26. The company reported a negative earnings surprise of 71.4% in fourth-quarter 2017. CVR Partners reported a loss of $27.4 million or 24 cents per share, higher than a loss of $14.5 million or 13 cents it logged a year ago. The reported loss per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 14 cents. The company raked in net sales of $78.2 million in the quarter, down around 8% year over year.  The company’s results in the quarter were affected by unscheduled downtime at the East Dubuque fertilizer facility and a few maintenance days on the urea ammonium nitrate (UAN  -  Free Report) plant at Coffeyville. Reduced ammonia and UAN sales prices also affected the results. CVR Partners missed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average negative surprise of 144.1%. CVR Partners’ shares have declined around 36.5% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 22.9% gain.    Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider CVR Partners is exposed to pricing pressure stemming from lower nitrogen fertilizer prices, as witnessed in the last reported quarter. UAN prices fell by a roughly 10% in fourth-quarter 2017. Urea prices have been under pressure due to excess nitrogen supply. Ammonia prices also slipped around 25% in the last quarter.  However, CVR Partners, during its fourth-quarter call, said that it has been witnessing lower nitrogen product imports, steady customer demand and higher prices for nitrogen. The company also noted that most industry participants are expecting around 90 million corn acres to be planted for the spring season. Meanwhile, the company remains committed to ramp up its UAN production capacity. It should also benefit from the Rentech acquisition and healthy demand for nitrogen. With the buyout of Rentech Nitrogen Partners, the company has been able to create an entity with larger scale, enhance production capacity and increase operating reach. The combined company is now the second-biggest producer of UAN in North America.  CVR Partners, LP Price and EPS Surprise  CVR Partners, LP Price and EPS Surprise | CVR Partners, LP Quote Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not show that CVR Partners is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

47,WRK,"WestRock Company (WRK  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 27, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered year-over-year improvement in both its top and bottom lines. While revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, earnings beat the same. The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 13.48%. WestRock Company Price and EPS Surprise  WestRock Company price-eps-surprise | WestRock Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive SurpriseOur proven model shows that WestRock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Zacks ESP: WestRock has an Earnings ESP of +2.32% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 85 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. A positive ESP indicates a likely earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: WestRock carries a Zacks Rank #1. This when combined with a positive ESP, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Factors at Play Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates, WestRock will witness sales growth in its major segments — Consumer Packaging and Corrugated Packaging. The Consumer Packaging’s revenues are projected to grow 17% to $1,821 million. The Corrugated Packaging segment’s revenues are anticipated to rise 9% year over year to $2,260 million. The Land & Development segment is expected to report revenues of $79 million, down 21% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $4.06 billion, projecting year-over-year growth of 11%. The Corrugated Packaging segment’s operating profit is anticipated to grow 53% to $244 million.  However, the Consumer Packaging segment’s operating profit is expected to dip 11% year over year to $106 million. The Land & Development segment is projected to report operating profit of $2.1 million, a substantial drop from $17.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. During second-quarter fiscal 2018, the company apprehends moderate inflation in OCC (Old Corrugated Containers) prices. Further, transportation costs are being negatively impacted by winter weather, higher diesel costs and truck and rail shortages driven by strong economic conditions. The winter weather is also pushing virgin fiber costs higher. Overall, commodity inflation is projected at around $40-$45 million pre-tax for the quarter. Moreover, the winter weather may have an additional $15-$20 million sequential impact. Despite these headwinds, for the fiscal second quarter, WestRock expects adjusted earnings per share to be higher than the 54 cents per share achieved in the prior-year quarter driven by overall industry conditions along with positive volume and pricing dynamics. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 83 cents for the quarter, a 53.7% year-over-year growth. Share Price Performance  Over the past year, shares of WestRock have outperformed the industry. The stock gained 23% ahead of the industry’s rise of 22%. Other Stocks That Warrant a Look Here are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.63% and a Zacks Rank #1. Its shares have gone up 43% in a year’s time. The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.71% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its shares have gained 33% over the past year. Methanex Corporation (MEOH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.58% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its shares have gone up 46% in a year’s time. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

Allegheny also expects its Flat-Rolled Products (FRP) unit to build on the operational improvements and product mix benefits attained last year and improve operating margins. However, the company expects first-quarter 2018 results to be unfavorably impacted by roughly $10 million, on a sequential basis, owing to reduced ferrochrome surcharges and required accounting changes on retirement benefit cost capitalization in inventory. The company sees the production ramp-up of the proposed joint venture with Tsingshan Stainless to benefit FRP results in second-half 2018. For the first quarter, Allegheny’s revenues are expected to be $932.6 million, reflecting an estimated year-over-year growth of 7.7%. Last month, Allegheny and Tsingshan Group formed their previously announced 50-50 JV deal to produce 60-inch wide stainless sheet products for the North American market. The JV will be a 50-50 equity investment with the partners sharing its cash flows and operating profit. Moreover, all necessary regulatory and anti-trust clearances for the JV have been received on time and initial customer shipments are expected in the first half of 2018. The JV will offer cost competitive stainless sheet products made for the North American market through a unique combination of Allegheny’s innovative, low-cost Hot Rolling and Processing Facility (“HRPF”) and Tsingshan’s unparalleled Indonesian refining, mining and castings assets, and the JV’s unique Direct Roll Anneal and Pickle facility in Midland, PA. The JV supports Allegheny’s considerable investment in the U.S. manufacturing operations, especially its HRPF facility, which will provide value addition to the processing services for the JV’s finished products. Per the company, this move will also benefit its FRP unit that employs more than 2,000 people in the United States. Moreover, the JV will lay foundations for the company’s long-term objectives and additionally support job creation in the United States by directly creating roughly 100 manufacturing jobs in Western Pennsylvania. Allegheny’s shares have soared 53.8% in a year, outperforming the industry’s 40% gain.   Earnings WhisperOur proven model conclusively shows that Allegheny is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.  Zacks ESP: Allegheny has an Earnings ESP of +9.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 25 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 23 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Allegheny sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which when combined with a positive ESP, makes us confident of an earnings beat.

64,WRK,"On Jul 5, we issued an updated research report on WestRock Company (WRK  -  Free Report). Favorable demand price and mix trends across paper and packaging businesses will drive the company’s fiscal 2018 results. Execution of its capital allocation strategy and the acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (KS  -  Free Report), once complete, will drive growth. However, increased debts to fund the deal along with inflationary costs of raw materials remain headwinds. Gearing Up for a Sound Q3 & Fiscal 2018 Despite Inflated Costs WestRock’s second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share surged 54% on a year-over-year basis to 83 cents. Adjusted earnings per share in third-quarter fiscal 2018 are expected to improve further from the second quarter. Lower recycled fiber costs are anticipated to positively impact margins. Further, sales price increases, seasonally higher volumes, favorable mix and continued productivity gains will lead to sequential rise of $98 million to $118 million in adjusted EBITDA. However, higher transportation and certain chemical costs are likely to dent margins in the quarter. Further, maintenance downtime is likely to increase 83,000 tons sequentially across the company’s mill system in the third quarter, which will have an estimated $20 million cost impact quarter over quarter. Further, higher expected tax rate, higher depreciation and amortization and higher interest expense will impact adjusted earnings per share by 8-10 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently pegged at $1.05, reflecting year-over-year growth of 42%. WestRock is benefiting from favorable demand, price and mix trends across its paper and packaging businesses. The company projects generating revenues of more than $16.4 billion and adjusted segment EBITDA to come in above $2.9 billion in fiscal 2018. Adjusted EBITDA margins are likely to increase by more than 250 basis points year over year to approximately 18%. WestRock maintained full-year adjusted operating cash flow guidance of greater than $2.45 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is $4.04 (54% year-over-year growth) on the back of revenues of $16.3 billion (10% year-over-year growth). Productivity Improvements Will Aid Results WestRock was formed by the merger of MeadWestvaco and Rock-Tenn in July 2015. The company is realizing the strategic benefits of the merger. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, WestRock achieved $64 million in year-over-year productivity improvements, and a run rate of $975 million of synergy and performance improvements. The company anticipates achieving its $1 billion target in the next two months. This will be achieved by the productivity and performance improvement programs across its manufacturing footprint, as well as cost savings from capital investments. Further, manufacturing optimization and reductions from the elimination of duplicate corporate costs and support functions will support results. KapStone Buyout Will Enhance Presence, Product Portfolio WestRock previously announced that it will acquire all the outstanding shares of rival KapStone at $35 per share. On conclusion of the deal, it is anticipated to be accretive immediately to WestRock's adjusted earnings as well as cash flow and lead to around $200 million of annual cost synergies and performance improvements, with half to be realized within first 12 months. Notably, the deal is anticipated to be concluded by the end of the September quarter or during the December quarter. KapStone’s corrugated packaging operations will enhance WestRock’s North American corrugated packaging business. It will help strengthen presence in western United States and to compete better in the growing agricultural markets in the region. The company will also be able to broaden portfolio of paper grades, allowing it to capitalize on the kraft bag market with the inclusion of KapStone's complementary specialty kraft paper offerings. Higher Debt to Fund Deal  WestRock plans to fund the cash portion of the KapStone deal through new debt and plans to refinance KapStone's assumed debts at the close of the deal. The company’s current debt-to-capitalization ratio is at 33%. Higher interest expenses will affect margins.  WestRock has underperformed the industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has dipped 1%, while the industry has recorded growth of 10%. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider WestRock currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an impressive VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. The score is a weighted combination of these three scores (Value - B, Growth - A, Momentum - B). Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors. Some better-ranked stocks in the sector include KMG Chemicals, Inc. (KMG  -  Free Report) and Domtar Corporation (UFS  -  Free Report). Both the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. KMG Chemicals has expected long-term growth rate of 28.5%. Its shares have appreciated 56% over the past year. Domtar has expected long-term growth rate of 5%.

65,WRK,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for WestRock Company (WRK  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.7% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is WRK due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.WestRock Q2 Earnings In Line With Estimates, Up Y/YWestRock Company reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018) adjusted earnings of 83 cents per share, in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the figure logged a year-over-year improvement of 54%. Including one-time items, the company posted earnings of 86 cents per share in the second quarter compared with 40 cents per share recorded in the prior-year period. Operational Update WestRock’s total revenues rose 10% year over year to $4,017 million. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,064 million. The year-over-year improvement in sales was primarily driven by increased sales in the Corrugated Packaging driven by higher selling price/mix and Consumer Packaging segments. This helped mitigate lower Land & Development sales and absence of net sales from the company’s former Home Health & Beauty (HH&B) business in the current-year quarter due to the sale of the same in April 2017. Cost of sales went up 8% year over year to $3,220 million in the second quarter. Gross profit improved 18% to $797 million. Gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 19.8% in the quarter. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $669 million compared with $547 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Segment Performance Corrugated Packaging: Sales at the segment improved 9% year over year to $2,244 million in the quarter.

Cash flow from operations came in at $371.6 million in the reported quarter compared with $299.7 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, WestRock completed the acquisition of all the assets of Plymouth Packaging, Inc. — a corrugated packaging company. Notably, the addition of Plymouth Packaging’s Box on Demand system will enhance WestRock’s differentiation in e-commerce and other custom applications, where on-site box making is required. The buyout will also fortify the company’s automated packaging systems business. WestRock initiated integration planning for the planned acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corp. Pursuant to customary closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the September quarter or during the December quarter. Upon conclusion, the buyout is anticipated to be immediately accretive to the company’s adjusted earnings and cash flow. The acquisition will help WestRock expand its presence in the western United States and broadens the company’s differentiated paper and packaging solutions portfolio with the addition of attractive paper grades and distribution capabilities. With these acquisitions, the company is strengthening its capabilities and solutions offerings for customers. WestRock stated that it has achieved $64 million in year-over-year productivity improvements in the fiscal second quarter, and a run rate of $975 million of synergy and performance improvements since its creation. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.
