27,EQIX,"The explosion of data resulting from the digital age is keeping company executives on the lookout for better ways to handle the tsunami of information.X It first led to the emergence of cloud computing services, driven by the growing need for scalable data centers that can handle the growing complexities of a modern digital enterprise. Then the rise of cloud computing wrought a complementary type of data center known as a colocation, or a method of outsourcing data centers where the provider sells space in its data centers by contract.One company that provides colocation services is Interxion Holding (INXN), which has seen a 71% rise in its stock price over the past 12 months. It's the second-largest provider of colocation services in Europe, behind market leader Equinix (EQIX).""The trend among companies is to move away from owning and running their own data centers,"" said John Dinsdale, research analyst at Synergy Research Group. ""Running data centers is often viewed as an expensive and time-consuming distraction.""Interxion has more than 1,600 customers and about 49 data centers across 11 European countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. It offers equipment space for servers and storage, and also provides the power and cooling systems designed for smooth running. Customers typically pack the warehouse-size data centers with their own computer servers and other gear.The broad picture is that data-center outsourcing and the ongoing surge in cloud services continue to drive the colocation market, said Dinsdale. This growth is funneled from cloud providers and lifted as well by enterprise technology spending.Amsterdam-based Interxion is a long way behind market leader Equinix, but it's also far ahead of the other major colocation providers. In January, Interxion announced its largest facility expansion to date, adding colocation facilities in seven European cities.""The increased pace of cloud adoption combined with an improving economy in Europe continues to drive broad-based demand for our colocation services across our entire footprint,"" Interxion Chief Executive David Ruberg said in prepared remarks announcing the expansion.When combined with previously announced expansion projects, Interxion has active projects that will increase the company's equipped space by more than 25% compared with the end of the third quarter.Many enterprises are partnering with colocation providers to support growth initiatives. Rather than expand their company-owned data centers, they are turning to colocation providers to reduce costs and increase sales. Colocation helps them to mitigate risks, scale faster, and reduce capital and operating expenditures.Interxion's colocation facilities connect to a broad range of telecommunications carriers, Internet service providers, and most leading cloud and digital media platforms. Among the cloud platforms it connects with are Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure.As consumption of data increases on mobile devices, cloud computing continues to grow and new technologies like artificial intelligence increase in size, demand for infrastructure and services provided by Interxion will keep the company moving forward.RBC Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Atkin in a recent research note to clients said cloud computing growth continues to be a key driver for Interxion.IBD'S TAKE: Interxion has a IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99, and is trading comfortably above its 50-day moving average, which is a positive indicator. It also has a Relative Strength rating of 89, meaning it tops 89% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength.""Interxion's pan-European portfolio has benefited its growth profile, as it has enjoyed growth at different times in markets at varying stages of cloud adoption,"" Atkin wrote.The business outlook for colocation operators is strong. Synergy Research's Dinsdale estimates the market for data-center colocation services will top $62 billion by 2022, nearly double its $31.5 billion size last year, for a compound annual growth rate of about 15%. Research firm IDC says that 53% of European businesses currently use or plan to build a hybrid cloud solution.In addition to Interxion and Equinix, other colocation providers include Digital Realty (DLR) and DuPont Fabros Technology. Others include CoreSite Reality (COR) and CyrusOne (CONE).In the third quarter, Interxion showed revenue growth of 25% to $147.4 million from the year-ago period, with adjusted earnings rising 38% to 18 cents a share. Recurring revenue in the third quarter represented 94% of total revenue.On the company's earnings conference call, Ruberg said the demand from cloud computing vendors is strong and coming from multiple providers, which he said was ""in line with our strategy and our expectations.""Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan, following Interxion's January expansion announcement, reiterated a buy rating on Interxion and raised his price target to 68, from 62.""Interxion announced the largest capacity expansion in its history, evidence that demand across Europe is intensifying,"" Horan wrote in his research note.For a variety of reasons, said Synergy Research's Dinsdale, the colocation market is heavily focused around key metropolitan areas. Just four of those regions — London, Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam — account for almost half of the total European market.""Interxion is well positioned in those metro markets, being a top five player in Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt, and a top ten player in London. It is also well positioned in some secondary key metros such as Zurich and Dublin,"" Dinsdale said.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Cloud Services Drive New Data CentersIBD Rating Upgrades: Equinix Flashes Improved Technical Strength

32,EQIX,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

64,EQIX,"F5 Networks soared in 2014 and looks poised for another strong run this year. Demand is mounting for its security products as clients do more business via digital means and require heightened protection from hackers.Though not solely a security provider, Seattle-based F5 (FFIV) says that it is well-positioned to meet increasing needs on that front, needs amplified in 2014 by a range of breaches, from a cyberattack on banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) to the infamous attack on Sony (SNE) and release of its executives' internal emails.Cooper Werner, F5's senior vice president of finance, told investors recently that the percentage of the company's product revenue tied to its security business reached 36% in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. It marked a 41% year-over-year jump.""Obviously, this is probably the biggest driver to our overall growth,"" Werner said while speaking at an investor conference hosted by Barclays in December.In its latest completed fiscal year, F5's revenue climbed 17% to $1.73 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project top-line growth of 13% for the current fiscal year.Upselling SafetyF5, whose clients include big online operators such as Facebook (FB) and Pandora Media (P), is the leading seller of application delivery controllers. ADCs are electronic devices that, in a nutshell, efficiently direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, enhancing the work processed in these areas and boosting website and communication network speeds.Werner said that F5 has worked to deepen business relationships with its ADC clients by also offering them data-center security products and services.In short, F5 views security ""as a natural extension of its ADC offerings, to help applications perform efficiently"" and make them ""more secure,"" as UBS analyst Amitabh Passi summed it up in a research note to clients.With demand now surging for data center protections, F5 finds itself at the center of what many observers expect will prove a long-running trend.""All it takes is a read of the headlines to see why demand for data security is on the rise and will continue to rise,"" BMO Private Bank Chief Investment Officer Jack Ablin told IBD.""I think that is the next frontier,"" Ablin said. He added that companies staking their ground now stand to be well-positioned to capitalize on the secular trend.F5's stock surged nearly 44% in 2014. It finished the final trading day of the year at $130 per share. It currently trades near 128.F5 is the No. 3 company by market cap after Equinix (EQIX) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM) in the Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 38 out of 197 groups that IBD tracks. The next largest players in the category are Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI). With an IBD Composite Rating of 98, F5 is one of the highest-rated companies in the Internet-Network Solutions group, topped only by Rackspace and SolarWinds, each of which gets a 99.A global survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that information security breaches skyrocketed in 2014, leaping 48% from 2013 to 42.8 million detected incidents. Total financial losses attributed to security compromises jumped 34% over 2013, the PWC survey said.""The rise in security incidents would account for some of this increase in financial losses, of course. But another explanation might be that today's more sophisticated compromises often extend beyond IT to other areas of the business, and financial losses may now include remediation of more customer impacts and not just operational disruptions,"" PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report. Companies and organizations ""must remain vigilant and agile in the face of a continually evolving threat landscape.""GBT Capital Management Chairman Gary Townsend told IBD that cyberattack concerns are deepening and spreading across sectors, making security a top priority for companies of all sizes. ""One needs to be concerned about it everywhere,"" he said. ""No one is immune from attack.""Demand OutlookDeutsche Bank analysts said in a December note that their recent checks on F5 suggested ""no incremental slowdown in demand"" for the company's services, indicating that results for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 are likely to be strong. The analysts cited ""an expanding order pipeline"" for application and cloud-based security products from Fortune 500 companies.Depending on the traffic level and the number of servers needed to manage it, F5 charges between $50,000 and $300,000 for its ADCs. Competitors include Citrix Systems (CTXS) and A10 Networks (ATEN). F5 also sells virtual ADCs that run in clients' data centers as opposed to on F5's own hardware.Analysts on average anticipate that F5 will report earnings per share of $1.49 for the quarter that ended Dec. 31, which would be up 22% year over year, on sales of $467 million, which would be up 15%. The Deutsche Bank analysts anticipate that the momentum will continue. ""We see 2015 as a positive year,"" they wrote. The analysts have a buy rating on F5, with a $150 price target.Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, recently raised his price target on F5 to $162 from $153 and kept an outperform rating. In a December research note, Bracelin cited F5's ""increasingly strategic positioning in security headed into the new year.""Acquisitions have augmented F5's growth. In 2014, the company bought Defense.Net, a provider of cloud-based security services. And in 2013, it acquired Versafe, whose software guards Web applications from malware and fraud. Analysts anticipate more deals to come, providing an additional reason to expect growth.Speaking at the Barclays conference in December, Edward Eames, F5's executive vice president of business operations, said that the company could continue on the M&A path, with a focus on small, add-on deals.""I think we're very happy with the small technology purchase — and then fold that into the company and add it into our product line,"" Eames said.""And that's definitely the strategy we have going forward. So I don't think we'd be looking for larger M&A,"" he said. ""But yes, security, cloud — perhaps services and subscription around the two, as well — would all be focus areas, and we are continuing to look.""

70,EQIX,"One important metric to look for in a stock is an 80 or higher Relative Strength Rating. Equinix (EQIX) just hit that mark, with a jump from 76 to 81 Thursday. X IBD's unique RS Rating tracks technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that shows how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks matches up against the rest of the market. Over 100 years of market history reveals that the best stocks tend to have an RS Rating of at least 80 as they begin their biggest climbs.Equinix broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 447.36 entry from a flat base. In the scenario where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to form. Also understand that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings growth declined last quarter from 35% to 14%, but sales rose from 12% to 18%. The company holds the No. 29 rank among its peers in the Finance-Property REITs industry group. Coresite Realty (COR), Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) and Agree Realty (ADC) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

X This proprietary rating measures technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that shows how a stock's price performance over the trailing 52 weeks matches up against other publicly traded companies. Decades of market research reveals that the stocks that go on to make the biggest gains tend to have an RS Rating north of 80 in the early stages of their moves.Equinix broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 447.36 entry from a flat base. If a stock you're watching climbs above a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new base and breakout. Also keep in mind that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. While the company's bottom line growth dropped in the prior quarter from 35% to 14%, revenue grew 18%, up from 12% in the prior report. The company holds the No. 18 rank among its peers in the Finance-Property REITs industry group.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also shredded their gains, the Nasdaq ending flat and the S&P 500 down less than 0.1%.All the indexes remained firmly positive for the week.Compared to busy sessions Monday and Tuesday, Wednesday's action was comparatively quiet, with preliminary data showing trade slightly higher on the NYSE and slightly lower on the Nasdaq.At either end of the Dow industrials, United Technologies (UTX) rose nearly 2% and Procter & Gamble (PG) dropped 2%, both on quarterly results.

91,EQIX,"Akamai Technologies, a provider of content delivery network and cloud infrastructure services, is riding a wave of open-ended technology trends to steady growth.As companies and their customers do more business online and via the cloud, demand for faster online user experiences and greater levels of security is mounting, and each of those developments fits directly into Akamai's (AKAM) wheelhouse.The company's system of servers and other equipment that accelerates online content delivery and bolsters security against cyberattacks is in increasing demand, Chief Financial Officer James Benson says, and it has boosted revenue throughout 2014 and positioned the firm for the year ahead.""The secular tailwinds are going to remain,"" Benson told IBD.Akamai posted a third-quarter profit of $91.2 million, up from $79.8 million a year earlier, on $498 million in revenue. Its top line was up 26%. Adjusted earnings per share — excluding stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges and other special items — climbed 24% year over year to 62 cents.'Right Direction'Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, forecast EPS of 64 cents for the fourth quarter on sales of nearly $529 million. For all of 2014, they anticipate sales of nearly $1.96 billion, 24% ahead of 2013. Analysts forecast full-year EPS of $2.42, a 20% jump.""I absolutely see the trends continuing to be strong (and) going in the right direction"" for Akamai, B. Riley analyst Sameet Sinha said.Akamai is the No. 2 company by market cap after Equinix (EQIX) in IBD's Internet-Network Solutions industry group, which ranks No. 50 out of 197 groups. The next largest players are three highly rated firms: F5 Networks (FFIV), Rackspace Hosting (RAX) and SolarWinds (SWI).Akamai's Media Delivery Solutions category posted a revenue increase of 22% for the third quarter. More double-digit growth lies ahead as people increasingly weave online activities into their daily routines, Benson says.Akamai's global network of servers stores copies of online content in order to expedite delivery to its clients' customers. Those end users experience relatively few video streaming interruptions and faster downloads because Akamai's services effectively route them around Internet congestion, Benson says. Akamai also provides a range of software updates such as the routine upgrades issued for products like Apple's (AAPL) iPads.""We believe it will continue,"" Benson said, referring to the robust demand for Akamai's media services. The business, he added, ""has been a nice growth accelerant for the company.""At the same time, as corporate clients of myriad stripes — from online retailers to banking companies — capitalize on cloud-based service and handle more customer transactions online, they want higher levels of security to guard against hackers and data breaches.Headlines about breaches at banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and retailers like Home Depot (HD) have called attention to the need for cybersecurity and lifted demand for Akamai's services, Benson says.What Akamai provides in this regard are firewalls for Web applications and added layers of protection around clients' data centers. The company, he says, detects breaches at the edge of its network, ""far from customers' data centers. ... (and) we thwart the attacks.""Akamai's Performance and Security Solutions segment generated 29% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter.Benson says that Akamai does about 70% of its business in the U.S., but he added that its international operations, in Asia and Europe, are growing at a faster rate. He cites strong demand for its services in Japan, Korea and Singapore.Sinha says that Akamai should benefit from solid demand as its clients recognize that they must defend against security threats and as end users demand high-level online video, gaming and social media.""They have major tailwinds at their back,"" Sinha said.Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., says that gaming and social media should continue to boost Akamai. ""Clearly, we're seeing acceleration in media delivery,"" he said. ""That's really where they have outperformed this year.""He expects growth on those fronts to build into long-term trends. ""That's the bull case for this story,"" Synesael said.Tough FieldAll of that noted, Akamai's story is not free of headwinds.The company has formidable competition that includes Limelight Networks (LLNW), Level 3 Communications (LVLT) and Verizon Communications (VZ).It could also lose some ground with one of its most prominent clients, Apple, Synesael says. Apple, which accounts for 6% of Akamai's revenue by Synesael's estimation, is building its own internal content delivery network.""The concern is, are they going to shift more in-house in 2015?"" Synesael said of Apple, adding that other Akamai clients could make similar moves.After reporting third-quarter results, Akamai executives conceded to analysts that because the firm's media business is based on traffic volumes, its growth from one quarter to the next could be bumpy, given that gaming and software releases, as well as the adoption of new social media and video platform upgrades, tend to vary.But over the course of several coming quarters, Benson expects that favorable tech trends will continue to advance in Akamai's favor.""We are not opportunity constrained,"" he said.

125,EQIX,"The wealth manager to Facebook (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg and other technology entrepreneurs is starting a unit to invest in data centers to profit from growing demand for cloud-based services.Iconiq Capital, the San Francisco-based investment advisor run by Divesh Makan, registered a new subsidiary with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month that will put client funds into technology-related real estate, according to documents filed with the agency. Its holdings will range from direct investments in data centers to securities issued by real estate investment trusts specializing in the sector.Facebook, the world's largest social-media company, and other technology giants have already spent billions of dollars building data centers to provide cloud-based computer services to individual customers, according to Anand Srinivasan, a senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. That spending pales in comparison to the amount of funding that will be required as global corporations turn to the cloud to meet their computing needs.""We are just scratching the surface on the large data center expansion trend,"" Srinivasan said. Iconiq, in starting a fund to invest in data centers, ""has definitely picked up on a trend.""The demand for additional capacity has already fueled a surge in the market value of publicly traded tech companies and REITs that own and operate data centers. A basket of seven data-center stocks, including Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX), has jumped about 30% this year, according to recent data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a gain of around 7% by the S&P 500 Index.""The public REITs in the data-center space have been the best-performing sector of stocks in the past eight months,"" Jerald Kent, chairman of TierPoint, a closely held provider of cloud-computing services, said in a telephone interview. ""Historically, they are trading at very robust multiples,"" said Kent, whose St. Louis-based company owns 39 data centers.Iconiq referred calls to an outside spokeswoman, who declined to comment. The firm is owned by Makan along with partners Chad Boeding, Michael Anders and William Griffith.Iconiq opened in 2011, the year before Facebook held its $16 billion initial public offering, the biggest ever by a U.S. technology company. Before starting the firm, Makan, Boeding and Anders all worked at Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), two of the main underwriters for the Facebook IPO.As a multifamily office, Iconiq focuses on providing wealth-management services to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. It had about $16.7 billion of assets under management at the end of last year, including $4.8 billion in discretionary accounts. According to regulatory filings, clients include Sean Parker, the co-founder of Napster; Reid Hoffman, the chairman of LinkedIn (LNKD); and Zuckerberg, who at age 32 ranks as the world's fifth-richest person with an estimated net worth of more than $57 billion, mostly in Facebook stock.While Iconiq primarily helps clients allocate their money to outside hedge and private equity funds, the firm also runs its own proprietary investment vehicles. On Aug. 8, it completed the registration process for Iconiq DC Management, the subsidiary setting up private funds to make real estate investments in data centers or ""technology connectivity-related assets,"" according to the SEC filing.The new money manager is organizing its first fund, the filing shows. Once it has raised capital, the funds will make direct investments in property, sponsor or invest in REITs, provide mortgage financing and form joint ventures with other investors.""Given Iconiq Capital's broad relationships with some of the world's leading technology companies and innovators,"" the unit is ""able to access proprietary market insights unavailable to most sponsors"" of investment funds, Makan's firm said in the filing.RELATED:In Hot REIT Space, Data Centers Seen Having An AdvantageFacebook, Microsoft Capital Spending Good For Data Center REITsData Center REITs Hit New Highs As Cloud Expands

126,EQIX,"In the pantheon of cloud computing, consider Amazon Web Services the Zeus-like leader, with Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM) also ranking among the top service providers.Not found in the cloud hierarchy, however, are telecom companies AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and CenturyLink (CTL).While telecom leaders in other markets have surfaced as cloud-computing services leaders, that's not so in the U.S. -- not that AT&T, Verzon and CenturyLink didn't try.But they failed, and observers point to cloud vendors ramping up security faster than the telecoms expected, outspending the telecom firms in key areas and being quicker to help app developers.For telecom firms, their chances for cloud dominance are gone, as the kingpins scale up, says Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research.""At this point, it's over for anyone to break into a competitive, global, hyper-scale mega-cloud with the scale and feature-breadth of AWS, Microsoft, Google and IBM,"" Bartoletti said.AWS, part of e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN), battle for supremacy along with Microsoft's Azure and Google in what's called infrastructure-as-a-service. IaaS is the fast-growing business of renting out computing resources -- number-crunching machines, data storage and software tools -- to companies and other enterprises.IBD'S TAKE: Make no mistake, despite its huge growth in e-commerce, Amazon's AWS cloud business has become another huge growth driver for the company, boosting its outlook and helping it take up residence among the select IBD Leaderboard companies. IBD scans all of our proprietary data to find stocks with the most potential for big gains, and only those companies make Leaderboard.There's room in the cloud assemblage for data center operators and co-location companies such as Equinix (EQIX). The Redwood City, Calif.-based company provides space, power lines, cooling and access to high-speed internet connections. Customers bring their own computer servers. Equinix runs data centers globally for corporate customers, including internet companies like Facebook (FB), as well as the IaaS players such as Amazon.In the data center part of the cloud field, too, telecom firms have come up short.Yet Japan's leading fixed-line telecom NTT (NTT) and Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) have made inroads in cloud services, says Camille Mendler, an analyst at U.K.-based research firm Ovum.""NTT has built and acquired vast global data center assets as part of a wider strategy to become a digital services provider,"" Mendler said. ""NTT is doing this not just in the developed economies of North America and Western Europe, but also in emerging markets.""U.S. telecom firms had their own aspirations. Verizon acquired cloud service firm Terremark in 2011 for $1.4 billion, while CenturyLink that same year acquired another cloud services/data center company, Savvis, for $2.5 billion. But both Verizon and CenturyLink have put their data center operations up for sale, and AT&T is said to be looking to sell its data centers as well.Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said last month that the telecom firm is close to decisions on its data centers. The Verizon data center assets that are widely considered to be the most desirable are in Miami and Culpeper, Va., near Washington, D.C. Observers say demand might be tepid, however, for much of the former Terremark assets.Analysts say Verizon's data centers might attract interest from private equity firms, but probably not from AWS, Microsoft or Google. The technologies and approaches don't mesh well.CenturyLink, meanwhile, is expected to announce a deal by year-end. And according to analysts, AT&T's 35 data centers also have been ""available"" at an asking price of around $2 billion. It's unclear if there's been any interest.The telecom firms might be unable to find a single buyer who wants all their data center assets and might instead be forced to sell them off separately, Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche said in a research report.Equinix has expressed an interest in some of these data center assets.Cloud services have a stormy history with telecom firms.AT&T acquired USinternetworking, a co-location provider, in 2006 for $300 million, but it missed a chance to take the next step and buy its way into the cloud when IBM gobbled up Softlayer for $2 billion in 2013. Instead of buying Softlayer, AT&T a year later settled for a consolation prize -- a marketing partnership with Softlayer.""IBM is a player in the public cloud market only because of their Softlayer acquisition,"" Bartoletti said. After buying Softlayer, IBM spent billions to build more data centers.Both Verizon's Terremark and CenturyLink's Savvis had sizable web hosting businesses when acquired. With the acquisitions, Verizon and CenturyLink aimed to be bigger players in the co-location business and the public cloud, where customers rent computing resources via the internet.Verizon in 2011 bought CloudSwitch, whose technology makes it easier for companies to run business applications in the public cloud. Verizon built up a cloud IaaS offering using technology from VMware (VMW). In February, though, Verizon shut down its public cloud services, crushed by AWS and Microsoft's Azure.Verizon and AT&T, analysts say, aimed to set themselves apart by packaging their cloud services with private internet networks, security, data storage and service guarantees. AT&T's Synaptic compute-as-a-service business combined virtual private networking and enterprise-class cloud services, rivaling that of AWS. AT&T also sells cloud data storage services, mainly to government agencies.Many corporations were at first leery of the public cloud because of security concerns, but more are now shifting even their most important workloads to the public cloud offerings from AWS and Microsoft's Azure. ""I think the telcos were caught by surprise as security in the public cloud dramatically improved,"" said Forrester's Bartoletti.As public cloud security worries ease, Verizon and AT&T have one less argument to make with potential customers, analysts say.""The market changed,"" said Lydia Leong, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink haven't provided tools to help software developers create new apps and services in the cloud, she says.""It's not an asset game. You need capital to compete, but it's not just about data centers,"" Leong said. ""Verizon tried to build the next-generation cloud with CloudSwitch, but that project failed.""AT&T and Verizon aren't the only ones to struggle vs. Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Shares of Rackspace Hosting (RAX) have plunged. Rackspace put itself on the market in 2014 before pulling itself off the market. But early Friday, Rackspace announced an agreement to be acquired by private equity firm Apollo Global Management (APO) for $32 a share, or $4.3 billion, and the company will go private. Rather than compete in IaaS, Rackspace has shifted to providing support services for AWS and other cloud computing providers.The telecom firms may have underinvested to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google, whose capital spending on warehouse-sized data centers has soared. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are among the few firms that are bigger -- their market caps are $100 billion or more larger -- than even telecom leaders AT&T and Verizon.If that's the case, then it's not a mistake for Verizon to want to repeat in digital media and advertising. After acquiring AOL in 2015 for $4.4 billion, Verizon has doubled-down by agreeing to purchase Yahoo (YHOO) for $4.8 billion. Verizon has made other digital media acquisitions as well.Gartner's Leong says it's not only the millions of computer servers packed into data centers that sets Amazon apart.""The IaaS market rewards intellectual property and the ability to leverage software developers,"" she said. ""Carriers are capital assets companies, they're not IP companies. Amazon has invested enormously in software, automation and engineering.""Amazon stock finished Monday trading up 0.3% to 771.29 on the stock market today. Alphabet gained 0.3% to 795.82 while Microsoft edged up 7 cents to 58.10. Verizon added 0.8% to 52.50 as AT&T climbed 0.8% to 41.RELATED:How Amazon, Microsoft Can Unlock Small-Business Market For SaaSRackspace Accepts $4.3 Billion Buyout From Apollo Global

133,EQIX,"Corporate America has been moving computing workloads to the cloud more slowly than expected. Equinix aims to change that with Cloud Exchange, a new offering for enterprise customers.Equinix (EQIX), a provider of computer data centers, is expected to lay out more of its Cloud Exchange strategy at its analysts day event in New York on Wednesday. Equinix stock touched a 13-month high Thursday.Data-center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the centers with their own computer servers and other gear. Equinix also specializes in providing connections to high-speed, fiber-optic networks operated by AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and other telecom services providers. Equinix's customers include some of the biggest cloud-services providers, such as Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure unit.The biggest users of cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS) have been small and midsize businesses. Many large companies and other enterprises still process their most important workloads in their own private data centers for security and other reasons.With IaaS prices falling rapidly, though, corporate IT departments are being tempted to move more workloads to shared, public cloud-computing systems.Equinix anticipates that many large companies will adopt a hybrid cloud model that meshes private and public infrastructure. Companies will keep some business apps behind a private corporate firewall and access public IaaS providers for other services.That's where Equinix's Cloud Exchange comes in. It enables large companies to access cloud-computing services as well as cloud-based software products from companies such as Salesforce.com (CRM).To use Cloud Exchange, enterprises buy access to a communications port. It provides high-speed, private connections to cloud-based services. A self-service, automated system lets companies connect to cloud service providers.In 19 Markets By Year-EndEquinix offers Cloud Exchange in 13 markets and plans to expand to 19 markets by year end. Equinix Chief Operating Officer Charles Meyers said at a JPMorgan conference last month that the company has big expectations for Cloud Exchange.""We view the cloud opportunity as essentially the next transformational ecosystem for our business,"" Meyers said. ""We've seen record bookings in cloud, bringing cloud service providers onto the platform over the last several quarters.""He said that Cloud Exchange will give corporate IT departments and chief information officers flexibility in choosing cloud-computing services ""on a workload-by-workload basis.""""Our goal is to essentially enable the CIO to place the workloads into the right infrastructure option flexibly, cost-effectively and efficiently,"" Meyers said. ""By putting a small implementation inside of Equinix sites, you can, in real time, provision workloads to the appropriate infrastructure choice on demand.""Equinix saw Q1 revenue rise 12% to $580 million. Yet it garners only 9% of its revenue from enterprise customers, excluding financial services, analysts say.Demand for data-center space has been driven by the rise of social networking, mobile devices, cloud services, online gaming, computer-based stock trading and more.Equinix Chief Technology Officer Ihab Tarazi has focused on building hybrid cloud products since he came aboard in October, analysts say. Tarazi had been vice president of enterprise network services at Verizon Communications.""Equinix is expanding its product offerings to ease (corporate) deployments using a hybrid cloud model,"" said Adam Ilkowitz, a Nomura Securities analyst, in a research report. ""Cloud Exchange seems especially timely ... . It's early days, but so far Microsoft and AWS have signed on as cloud providers, while TW Telecom (TWTC) and Level 3 (LVLT) are providing connectivity. We expect to hear more about this at the investor day.""Level 3 on Monday announced an agreement to acquire TW Telecom for $5.7 billion, creating a bigger rival for Verizon and AT&T in business and Internet services.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael Bowen is upbeat on Cloud Exchange's prospects. ""Equinix estimates that approximately 82% to 84% of IT resources still reside in-house at enterprises, but the pace of cloud adoption is slowly beginning to accelerate,"" Bowen said in a research report this week. ""Cloud Exchange offers customers the ability to eliminate cloud access across the public Internet.""Cloud Exchange (should) have a positive impact on pricing at Equinix as a result of affording enterprises the ability to directly access cloud providers as well as interconnect with other enterprises.""

"
159,EQIX,"A lot of moving parts go into identifying valid base patterns. The depth and length of the base, the position of the buy point and the accompanying volume characteristics are all critical factors, and all slightly different depending on the type of base.A common trait -- and one on which investors often feel they can fudge the numbers -- is the uptrend that needs to occur before the base forms.There are a few good reasons why this factor sometimes confuses even experienced investors.In his book ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" IBD founder William O'Neil explained that ""chart patterns, or 'bases,' are simply areas of price correction or consolidation after an earlier price advance.""It is easy to become focused on the patterns themselves and forget about the prior advance. But the standard rule is a stock needs to rise at least 30% before beginning a base. You would normally use a weekly chart, and look for a run of at least 30% from an intraweek low to the high that marks the left-side start of a cup base, or the first down-week marking the start of a flat base.To start, this runs against some conventional wisdom. It bumps a lot of ""buy low, sell high"" disciples -- who see a stock as spent after a 30% run -- out of the picture. But O'Neil and many others profess a buy high, sell higher philosophy that taps into strong companies with powerful fundamental traits: outstanding earnings-per-share growth, the most innovative products in a rising industry, and exploitable markets.Current leaders such as China's NetEase (NTES), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Equinix (EQIX) are just a few examples. All have powered higher in multiyear advances, despite a market that has been inhospitable to growth stocks.In addition to a rise of at least 30%, an uptrend before a base should also generate improving relative strength and ""very substantial increases in trading volume"" at some points, O'Neil wrote.There are a number of ways to check relative strength. The easiest is using the daily and weekly charts (accessible via the IBD Charts link under the Research tab on Investors.com) and Stock Checkup to provide relative strength lines and ratings.You want to see a rising RS line (highlighted in IBD charts in blue) during the stock's run-up before a base. This tells you that the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. You can also track bullish volume characteristics using these same IBD features.After a breakout, rallying stocks often rise around 20% before starting a new base. This means that from the buy point to the lip of a new base may only be 20% or so. But if you measure from the low of the prior base, the run will more times than not be at or above 30%.Another confusing factor: base-on-base patterns. These occur when breakouts fizzle, rise only a small amount or fail to materialize, but a stock continues consolidating. In these bases there is no prior uptrend, but there must be an uptrend before the initial base on which the base-on-base forms.

164,EQIX,"In their Q1 earnings reports, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big Internet companies have signaled continued strong spending on cloud infrastructure -- and that bodes well for data center operators, says Pacific Crest.“The five largest cloud companies (Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Facebook (FB) and Apple), which account for 80% of the capital investments by top-20 cloud companies, showed an acceleration in capital investments during Q1,” Brent Bracelin, a Pacific Crest analyst, said in a research report.Data center operators have been among the best-performing real estate investment trusts in 2016. REITs are essentially portfolios of income-producing properties. They bypass the standard corporate income tax obligations by distributing at least 90% of their income to shareholders in the form of dividends.Among the top data center companies, Equinix (EQIX) reports Q1 earnings on Wednesday after the close, while CyrusOne (CONE) reports on Thursday.Equinix stock, which has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 64, is up 9% in 2016. But CoreSite Realty (COR) stock has shot up 32% and leads its group with a highest-possible CR of 99. DuPont Fabros (DFT) is up 25%, while Cyrus One has jumped 17%. Digital Realty (DLR), meanwhile, has climbed 16%.Still, IBD's 50-company Finance-Property REIT group overall is up just 3% this year and ranks No. 53 out of 197 groups tracked.Bracelin said Facebook’s capital spending jumped 125% to $1.1 billion. Microsoft’s capital spending rose 66% to $2.3 billion, while Amazon.com’s increased 35% to $1.2 billion.“Because many of these cloud operators use custom software and white-box infrastructure, there are few direct beneficiaries across the traditional technology landscape beyond some of the data center REITs,” said Bracelin.

166,EQIX,"When QTS Realty Trust (QTS) opens its newest so-called data center in downtown Chicago later this year in a former Chicago Sun-Times printing plant, it expects little trouble filling the space.Unlike a shrinking newspaper industry, data centers are enjoying a secular upswing, thanks to cloud computing, mobile devices, streaming and the Internet of Things. These warehouse-like buildings contain computer servers and other gear used to power websites and store information for a variety of businesses in the digital age.""Other (Chicago data center) facilities downtown are highly utilized. There is not a lot of space left,"" Jeff Berson, QTS chief investment officer told IBD. ""We have a tremendous amount of interest and are actively engaged with a number of (potential) customers.""QTS's data-center customers are largely skewed to financial services, technology, health care and retail, he says. The company keeps their identities confidential, alluding to them in general terms for the most part, such as ""a large Internet company"" or ""global bank."" Berson says two of the big accounting firms are customers, as well as one of the largest cloud companies and software-as-a-service tech firms.""One Internet customer pays them $35 million a year in rent,"" analyst Jordan Sadler of Keybanc Capital Markets told IBD, citing a reference from a company filing.According to the Atlanta Business Chronicle, Twitter (TWTR) has taken a large amount of space at QTS's Atlanta data center. Asked if this was true, Berson said, ""I can't comment.""Based in suburban Kansas City, QTS Realty may be the smallest of six publicly traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs, that focus on data centers. But it has plenty of available space and is adding more of it, which gives it an edge over its bigger rivals, says Sadler.Those rivals include large-cap firms Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Realty Trust (DLR); as well as smaller companies CyrusOne (CONE), DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT) and CoreSite Realty (COR).""Right now, demand is strong, and availability across the entire space is dwindling,"" Sadler said. ""Having space to lease at a time when demand is spiking is a good thing. Some companies are out of space.""QTS offers big blocks of wholesale space under long-term contracts, as well as smaller retail locations with shorter-term contracts. In addition, it provides managed services and cloud offerings in both settings. It operates 24 data centers, most of them in the U.S. Several are sprinkled outside the U.S. -- in Canada, Europe, Hong Kong and Sydney, Australia.""We see a lot of companies in the sector offering just one of those,"" Berson said. ""Offering three as opposed to just one is an important differentiator for us.""Eight of the firm's data centers are owned outright, including the former printing plant in Chicago that it purchased for $18 million in 2014.""We think it was at a significant discount in terms of what the Chicago Sun-Times had invested in the facility,"" Berson said. ""More important, it gives us a building that can support over 130,000 square feet of saleable data-center space.""And since it also comes with 30 acres of land, QTS can more than double that capacity, Berson says.Around 90% of the company's total capacity comes from its fully owned data centers, Berson says. They include several large mega centers -- two in the Atlanta area; Dallas; Princeton, N.J.; and Richmond, Va.; with Chicago coming online in the third quarter. The usable leasing space at those centers ranges from more than 100,000 square feet to 556,000 square feet, the latter in its Richmond center.""If you're running larger facilities, you can bring in more customers and revenue on fixed costs,"" Berson said.Before they were developed into data centers, QTS's Richmond and Dallas locations were originally semiconductor manufacturing plants and were purchased at discounts, Berson says.The rest of the company's locations are leased, including 14 small centers that came by way of last year's $326 million acquisition of Virginia-based Carpathia Hosting, a provider of cloud and infrastructure services to enterprise and government customers.""We bought Carpathia because it supported the service side of our business,"" Berson said, adding that it contributes about $90 million a year in revenue. ""When you sell a lot of services, you can get more revenue per square foot.""Services accounted for a little over 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter, while retail ""co-locations"" generated 45%, followed by large wholesale spaces at 35%.Total revenue in the quarter jumped 55.6% to $92.7 million. For the full year, revenue rose 42.8% to $311.1 million, helped by the Carpathia acquisition, strong growth in Dallas and new business at overseas locations. QTS reported fourth-quarter funds from operations -- essentially earnings in the REIT universe -- of $31.5 million, or 65 cents a share, up 17.3% from the earlier year.The company plans to spend $300 million to $350 million this year on data-center development, placing around 125,000 square feet of selling space into service, including Chicago. It forecasts operating funds from operations of $2.54 to $2.64 a share this year, up from $2.29 in 2015.Leasing volumes picked up in the fourth quarter, following a slower-than-usual third quarter, with $9.8 million in incremental annualized revenue, up 16% from the earlier year's annualized average. Excluding a $2 million downgrade by one unnamed customer, net leasing activity would have been up 40% over the prior four-quarter average.""It was good to see QTS demonstrate that Q3 (leasing) results were an anomaly, not a trend,"" said analyst Jonathan Petersen of Jefferies in a recent note to clients. ""We have renewed confidence in QTS's ability to achieve attractive (funds from operations) per share growth as the company builds out existing shells.""Of the 2.2 million square feet of real estate in its portfolio, including Chicago, QTS has developed 1.1 million of it, which includes power and cooling. To develop the remaining 1.1 million square feet would cost about $1 billion, Berson says.""We believe that is below market cost because we already have the buildings, and the capacity from 1.1 million square feet to 2.1 million can support our growth for another five years,"" he said.

167,EQIX,"CyrusOne (CONE) stock hit an all-time high on the heels of Tuesday’s investor day, where the data center operator outlined goals to double the company’s revenue by 2020.Cloud computing and corporate outsourcing of IT infrastructure has increased demand for data center space. Data center operators -- including DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT), Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and CoreSite Realty (COR) -- are among the top performers in IBD’s Finance-Property REIT group. It’s ranked No. 46 out of 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Many data center operators are real estate investment trusts.Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are among tech companies expanding data centers.Data center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the warehouse-sized data centers with their own computer servers and other gear. The data center market has been divided among wholesale providers -- such as Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros -- and retail operators such as Equinix (EQIX), though some lines are blurring.CyrusOne stock was up a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, above 42, but earlier rose nearly 5% to 43.42, its record high. Shares have gained nearly 13% in 2016.At its investor day event, CyrusOne said that it aims to double its enterprise value from around $4 billion to $8 billion by 2020, said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen & Co., in a research report.“The company plans to achieve this goal by doubling its revenue, EBITDA and normalized FFO from 2016 to 2020 while being prudent to maintain (debt) leverage at 4.5 times or less, so that it can achieve an investment grade credit rating over that period,” added Synesael.REITs use a cash flow metric called funds from operations, or FFO.DuPont Fabros stock has shot up more than 25% this year, while CoreSite has gained about 20%. Digital Realty is up 15%. Equinix, part of IBD’s Internet-Infrastructure Solutions group, has gained 5%.Capital spending has been rising at data center operators. DuPont Fabros, aiming to raise $275 million, announced a stock offering on March 17.“New leasing volume suggests that demand remains robust and should support DFT’s growth plans with low leverage,” said Barclays analyst Ross Smotrich in a report. “However, the trade-off is that DFT had made it abundantly clear at their November 2015 investor day that their growth strategy would not include new equity. When future capital needs arise, therefore, investors may anticipate an equity raise.”Image provided by Shutterstock.

168,EQIX,"Equinix’s (EQIX) global footprint of data center assets and network connections to cloud services providers give it a growing edge over rivals, says Pacific Crest Securities, which raised its price target on the stock to 375.Equinix stock is about even for 2016 so far, after breaking out of a flat base with a 304.87 buy point at the end of 2015. It's been consolidating ever since. Shares of Redwood City, Calif.-based Equinix edged up a fraction in early trading in the stock market today, near 302.Pacific Crest analyst Michael Bowen said the company's acquisitions of Europe-based Telecity Group and Japan-based Bit-isle in 2015 will expand Equinix’s reach.“The magnetic pull Equinix has been able to achieve by having a dense global footprint of data center assets cannot be ignored. No other data center company in the world can offer equivalent scale of interconnection services as Equinix,” Bowen wrote.Data center operators provide space, power and cooling. Customers pack the warehouse-sized data centers with their own computer servers and other gear. Equinix also specializes in providing connections to high-speed, fiber-optic networks.Demand for data-center space has been driven by the rise of social networking, mobile devices, cloud services, online gaming, computer-based stock trading and more. Equinix’s customers include leading cloud computing services providers Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), as well as other large companies.“Equinix  is the only company that can enable enterprise adoption of the cloud, since it has created an ecosystem in which service providers can connect with enterprises,” added Bowen. “The ecosystem should be very difficult to replicate, and interconnection is one of the keys to Equinix's success.”The data center market is divided among wholesale providers such as Digital Realty (DLR) and DuPont Fabros (DFT) and retail operators such as Equinix. Wholesale providers sell huge amounts of space over contracts that run several years, while retail operators sell less space over shorter contracts and provide more specialized services, such as hook-ups to high-speed data networks.Image provided by Shutterstock.

169,EQIX,"Cable TV leader Comcast (CMCSA), coffee king Starbucks (SBUX),  “innovative” drug companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and a few biotechs make Morgan Stanley’s list of companies with pricing power.Amid a low-inflation environment and worries over a global recession, stocks with pricing power should get a serious look, says the Morgan Stanley report.Its list also includes American Tower (AMT), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG), Constellation Brands (STZ), Equinix (EQIX), L Brands (LB), Mindbody (MB), Phillip Morris (PM), Reynolds American (RAI), Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH), and Sherwin-Williams (SHW).Here’s Morgan Stanley’s take on why some of these companies have pricing power.1) American Tower. “Towers effectively offer local monopolies, and there is little alternative for wireless carriers wishing to add capacity to improve network quality.”2) Amgen. “While drug pricing has been a topic of debate since U.S. presidential candidates raised focus on the topic in the late summer of 2015, we continue to see pricing power among large cap biotech.”3) Biogen. “In 2015, management took around 11% to 12% gross price increases across its portfolio.”4) Celgene. “Management in 2015 took 7-10% gross price increases across its portfolio and we would expect a similar net price trend in 2016.”5) Comcast. “We are positive on CMCSA’s broadband growth story and see improved results in video given X1 (set-top box deployment).”6) Sherwin-Williams. “(Its) pricing power relates to its control of its own distribution, as well as its outsized leverage to professional painting contractors.7) Starbucks. “SBUX remains the category leader in the high-margin, premium coffee segment and benefits from selling an often-craved, habitual product.”

170,EQIX,"Facebook’s (FB) capital spending boom is giving data center stocks a lift.Facebook last week said it plans to increase 2016 capital spending to $4 billion-$4.5 billion, up about 70% from 2015’s $2.52 billion. Facebook continues to be a bright spot for data center operators, as spending moderates somewhat at Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Apple’s capital spending in the December quarter, its fiscal Q1, rose 12% to $3.6 billion. Apple has forecast about $15 billion in current fiscal year spending, with some of that going to such areas as retail stores and manufacturing equipment, such as robotics technology. It spent $11.24 billion last year.Facebook reported Q4 earnings on Jan. 27 well above Wall Street expectations. Shares of data center players Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and DuPont Fabros (DFT) rose on Thursday and Friday, but Digital Realty stock was down a fraction in morning trading in the stock market today, while DuPont Fabros stock was down 3%.“Stock prices of data center wholesalers Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros increased meaningfully after Facebook reported Q4 results,” said Evercore ISI in a research report. “Facebook uses a combination of in-house and third-party development, and is currently the No. 2 customer of DFT and No. 5 of DLR, respectively.”Amazon, Microsoft and China-based Alibaba Group (BABA) are other key companies to watch for spending trends, says the report.The data center market is divided among wholesale providers, such as Digital Realty and DuPont Fabros, and retail operators, such as Equinix (EQIX). Wholesale providers sell huge amounts of space through contracts that run several years. Retail operators sell less space over shorter periods and provide more specialized services, mainly hook-ups to high-speed data networks.Both Digital Realty and Equinix are viewed as possible buyers of data centers that Verizon Communications (VZ) might sell, analysts say.Data center operators such as Equinix provide space, power and cooling.

173,EQIX,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

183,EQIX,"Prospects of a looming rate hike by the Fed scared investors. REITs return at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, leaving them sensitive to interest-rate increases as they seek financing to grow, since they don't have much cash on hand. Or so investors like to think.

"
205,EQIX,"REITs tied to the rise of the rental market — and the millennials who have been flocking to rental apartments — are also expected to stay at the forefront in 2016.
"
206,EQIX,"Self-storage REITs have shown the best total equity returns this year, with the sector up a whopping 35.6% through Dec. 4. Total returns for multifamily apartment REITs were up 14.4%.
"
207,EQIX,"Self-storage REITs operate storage facilities that apartment dwellers and others rent to store their extra stuff. They include Extra Space Storage (EXR), CubeSmart (CUBE), Sovran Self Storage (SSS) and Public Storage (PSA), the largest by market cap.

"
211,EQIX,"SNL Financial expects self-storage and multifamily REITs to each log around a 15% gain in operating earnings next year, putting the two just behind health care and specialty REITs.Last year may have been the year of the REIT, as total returns for the dividend stocks fetched an alluring 27.5% total return in aggregate, double that of the S&P 500 Index.But this year, the group of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, got battered.They logged a paltry total return of just 1% through Dec. 4 vs. the S&P 500's 3.6% gain, according to SNL Financial. But self-storage and apartments were standouts.Prospects of a looming rate hike by the Fed scared investors. REITs return at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, leaving them sensitive to interest-rate increases as they seek financing to grow, since they don't have much cash on hand. Or so investors like to think.""Rumors of rising interest rates have certainly weighed on REITs,"" said Jason Lail, manager of real estate research at SNL Financial.With a rate hike expected imminently, will REITs falter again in 2016?REIT experts say that it might be better to look at fundamentals such as operating earnings, which in REIT parlance are known as funds from operations, or FFOs.""A rising interest rate environment is indicative of the overall health of the economy,"" Lail said. ""REITs are much more tied to economic health than to interest rates in regard to their performance.""And as Ron Kuykendall, a spokesman for the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, put it: ""If operating earnings are improving, that income is going to be translated into growing dividends. And that has a positive impact on share performance.""Battered Sectors May ShineBy that measure, some of this year's most battered sectors may shine next year, with health care seen emerging at the top.Through the first week in December, health care's total return sunk by 12.4%, according to SNL Financial.But operating earnings jumped by 25.6%, the best showing of any sector. ""And that can definitely have a positive impact on health care REIT equity pricing in 2016,"" Lail said.Health-care dividend yields were also higher this year than any other sector, at 6.63% on average vs. 4.82% for all equity REITs.Gerry Casimir, portfolio manager of the $21 billion of assets in the variable annuity TIAA Real Estate Account, says that his team has started to invest in life sciences and biomedical properties in Boston and San Francisco, and is eying others in San Diego and elsewhere.""It's a subset we're excited about,"" he said. ""The returns are extremely strong, and there are real long-term prospects for growth.""SNL forecasts that FFOs for health care REITs will jump 25.6% in 2016, followed by specialty REITs' 23.9% gain, thanks in part to strong performance from data centers.Demand For Data Centers""Data center REITs are enjoying continued increases in demand for space,"" especially from cloud service providers and digital media, Lail said.Four data-center REITs are among Lail's top-25 picks for 2016 in terms of FFO growth, led by CoreSite Realty (COR), which is projected to grow FFO by 16.9%.Others are CyrusOne (CONE) (16.3%), QTS Realty Trust (QTS) (15.9%) and Equinix (EQIX) (13.2%), which has the largest market cap, at $18 billion, and counts Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) (Web services and cloud computing) as customers.In health care, Lail singles out Physicians Realty Trust (DOC) and Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) for impressive FFO growth in 2016.

298,EQIX,"F5 Networks (FFIV), a maker of application delivery controllers (ADCs), has continued its winning ways under new CEO Manuel Rivelo, boosting revenue and profit by capitalizing on high demand for new software and security services to guard against digital data breaches. The Seattle-based company, whose client base ranges from the U.S. government to Facebook (FB), is the No. 1 seller of ADCs. The electronic devices direct traffic to corporate computer servers and data centers, helping to make websites and communication networks faster and more efficient.F5 has in recent years expanded its ties with customers by also selling them security products and services, and continues to do so under Rivelo. Demand in this arena is mounting amid a torrent of headlines about major organizations suffering cyberattacks that resulted in costly data breaches. In recent months alone, cybercriminals have infiltrated systems at Harvard University, health insurer Anthem (WLP), and the U.S. government's Office of Personnel Management.F5 competes with Citrix Systems (CTXS), Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) and A10 Networks (ATEN). The company is part of IBD's Internet-Network Solutions group, which also includes Rackspace Hosting (RAX), Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Equinix (EQIX).""It's just going to keep growing and growing,"" U.S. Global Investors trader Mike Matousek told IBD, referring to demand for data security. He said investors are increasingly interested in companies such as F5 because they are continuously hearing that organizations fear the worst when it comes to cybersecurity and view as vital their ongoing investments in the latest technology to thwart breaches.Investors See Opportunity""So there's more opportunity here,"" Matousek said. ""There's a lot of potential ahead.""F5's stock is up about 14% over the past year. The company in July posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $483.6 million, up 10% from a year earlier, and GAAP net income of $93.2 million, up 8.7%. On a per-share non-GAAP basis, earnings rose 5% to $1.67.The sales trajectory is expected to continue. For the quarter ending Sept. 30, F5 set a revenue goal of $500 million to $510 million.A company executive told IBD that F5 does not break out the percentage of its product revenue generated by its security business. But during the company's earnings call in July, F5 executives said software sales, which are often linked with security services, have more than doubled over the past three years and now make up about a third of revenue. Customers, the company said, are moving more of their systems into the cloud, via software, and need accompanying security protections.Rivelo, a former Cisco Systems executive, officially took the helm at F5 on July 1. But he began leading the company after his promotion, from executive vice president of strategic solutions to CEO, was announced last spring. He replaced John McAdam, who had been F5 Networks' chief executive for about 15 years.Rivelo was not available to comment for this article, but during the earnings call he said F5's security business will remain ""a major growth driver"" for the company.Given the spate of highly publicized cyberattacks, he added, ""more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access, and mitigate application attacks across traditional data centers, and public and private clouds.""Rivelo said in F5's third quarter alone it established major new business relationships on the security front with a branch of the U.S. government and ""a prestigious medical research group,"" among others.New Global Sales ChiefCFO Andy Reinland told investors recently that security ""continues to be key for us. And we're going to continue to incentivize the sales force to really push that."" This week F5 named John DiLullo to lead global sales, reporting to Rivelo.James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management and an observer of companies affected by cyberattacks including banks, said in an interview that ""it is hard to see where the threat ends.""He said regulators of various industries and leaders of major governments around the world are increasingly paying attention to cybersecurity and likely will over time join forces to create stronger global security standards. This, he said, should make it easier for companies and governments to work together to combat cybercriminals.Should all of that materialize in coming years, Paulsen said, it could help more companies get beyond playing catch-up on the security front and instead make investments to continuously stay ahead of criminals. This, he said, could ultimately minimize the number of high-profile breaches. But it would not diminish the need for high-level security services.Looking For Acquisitions""It's never going to go away,"" he said of the threat of attacks. ""They aren't going to just shut this down, but the good guys are going to get better and better at this.""Toward that end, F5 said it is on the lookout for acquisitions that can fortify its suite of products and help drive more growth.""We look for a nice technology tuck-in that we can bring in, integrate the code into the platform, and then offer it as part of a platform solution,"" Rivelo said at an August conference. ""We do aggressively look at companies ... We look at them every week.""He said sellers' pricing expectations are currently a bit lofty. ""In general, right now it's a little heated,"" Rivelo said of the M&A market. But if F5 finds an appealing and affordable target, ""we'll bring it on board to accelerate our roadmap and our vision.""

300,EQIX,"Global data-center service provider Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) recently announced plans of its public offering of €750-million aggregate principal amount of senior notes.

(JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, MUFG, RBC Capital Markets, TD Securities and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as book-running managers for this purpose. HSBC, ING and Barclays PLC (BCS  -  Free Report) are acting as joint global coordinators and joint book-running managers.Equinix, along with the underwriters, will determine the interest rate and offer price. The offering will be “made under an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"")”, the company stated in its press release.The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including meeting the working capital requirements, acquisitions, capital expenditure and other strategic transactions.Notably, this will be the company’s first senior notes offering in 2018. Last year, Equinix had commenced three offerings of combined worth of €3.25 billion.Though the Fed has been raising interest rates for the past year, borrowing costs are still very low, enabling companies to obtain easy financing. Furthermore, we believe the company has been offering senior notes at the right time as the Fed is likely to raise interest rates much faster than previously anticipated.However, escalating interest expenses due to increased debt burden may dampen the company’s profitability. It should be noted that at the end of 2017, Equinix had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.441 billion, while the total debt principal outstanding was $10.17 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

301,EQIX,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2017 results, wherein the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased from the year-ago quarter as well.The company’s adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) advanced from $4.08 per share reported in the year-ago quarter to $4.82 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $4.80. The uptick primarily stemmed from robust top-line growth and strong operating performance, partially offset by elevated cost of revenues and share count.AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure generally used in the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) industry.Quarter in DetailTotal revenues came in at $1.2 billion, up 27.3% from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.193 billion. This marked the 60th quarter of consecutive revenue growth. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong booking activity, global expansion, continued enterprise momentum and synergies from acquisition.Equinix continues to witness solid demand for cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing the firms’ networks. The company observed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Robust growth in the global Colocation and Interconnection platforms provided a boost to the top line.Moreover, solid performance in MRR (monthly recurring revenues) per cabinet, MRR churn rate (2.2%) and cross connect additions drove the top line. Recurring revenues came in at $1.123 billion (94% of total revenues), up approximately 25.8% from the year-ago quarter. Non-recurring revenues climbed 54.6% to $77.6 million (6% of total revenues).Revenues from the three geographic regions increased on a year-over-year basis as well. Revenues from the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific were up 38.9%, 22.4% and 9.8% to $606.2 million, $369.6 million, and $224.4 million, respectively.Gross margin was 48.4%, down from 50.6% reported in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to elevated cost of revenues as a percentage of sales. Total operating expenses flared up 19.3% to $348.6 million. Further, operating expenses contracted 200 basis points (bps) as a percentage of revenues to 29%.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $564.8 million, up 29.4%. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 47.1% as compared with 46.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. AFFO increased 29.9% to $381.5 million during the reported quarter.Equinix, Inc.

The company’s total debt principal outstanding was $10.17 billion as on Dec 31, 2017. It generated cash of $1.439 billion from operating activities in 2017.GuidanceEquinix provided outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2018. For 2018, the company anticipates revenues to come above $5.010 billion, reflecting an increase of 15% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.05 billion. The company predicts adjusted EBITDA to exceed $2.385 billion.The company anticipates full-year 2018 AFFO to be more than $1.635 billion, reflecting growth of 14% year over year.The company expects cash gross margin for the full year to be approximately 67%. Cash selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are projected in the range of 19-20% of revenues.Coming to the first quarter, Equinix expects revenues in the range of $1.204-$1.212 billion (mid-point $1.208 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.21 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to lie between $549 million and $557 million.Cash gross margin for the first quarter is anticipated to be approximately 67%. Cash selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are projected be approximately 21% of revenues.Our TakeEquinix reported stellar fourth-quarter results. Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services from corporations and benefits of Equinix's global platform. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Further, the company provided encouraging revenue guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2018.The company is currently focusing on improving customer experience through the Equinix Customer One program. We are also optimistic on its recurring revenue model and expansion plans announced in March last year.Further, it operates across various geographical regions and is becoming increasingly popular among major players in the tech industry for data management, which should drive revenues in the near term.Notably, acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix. We expect the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo to prove conducive to growth.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important components of Equinix's core strategy. We believe the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster revenues and profitability, going forward.However, intensifying competition from established Internet data-center operators, such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report), might impact product pricing, consequently denting the margins.A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

303,EQIX,"Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 earnings results on Feb 14. This company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Equinix surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $4.80, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 17.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.19 billion indicates around 26.5% growth from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayEquinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers, and internet-exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators, and network service providers. The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the fourth quarter.Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand its data-center capacity in many of the company’s key markets since 2003. We anticipate the company’s buyouts of data-center assets from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo to boost the top line in the quarter under review.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been important parts of Equinix's core strategy. We believe the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which might dent Equinix’s fourth-quarter profitability. It should be noted that the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.629 billion, while the total debt principal outstanding was $10.12 billion as on Sep 30, 2017. Growing debt burden will affect the company’s profitability in the quarter as interest expense would flare up.Moreover, heightening competition from established internet data-center operators, such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon, will affect product pricing, thereby thwarting the company’s margins.Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Equinix, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.80. The combination of Equinix's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.A Stock With Favorable CombinationHere is a company you may want to consider as our model shows that this stock has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.57% and a Zacks Rank #3.

304,EQIX,"Benchmarks ended in the red on Monday following a shift in investment from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields reached their best level since April 2014. Expectations of an increase in growth and inflation boosted yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, following which sectors like real estate and utilities that are considered as alternatives to bonds declined.Additionally, shares of tech giant Apple slumped during the day, which in turn led the tech-based index Nasdaq to post its second worst one-day drop in 2018. Further, both the S&P 500 and the Dow witnessed their biggest one-day drop on Monday since Sept 5, 2017.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.7%, or 180.19 points to close at 26,439.48.

A total of around 7.1 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.9 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 4.65-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 2.16-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?Higher rate environment and optimism of a steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices. Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.661% to 2.695% on Monday, reaching its highest settlement since April 2014. Higher treasury yields weighed on steady dividend paying sectors like real estate and utilities.The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) declined 1.2%, becoming one of the worst performing sectors of the S&P 500. Some of its key holdings, including Equinix, Inc. (REIT) (EQIX  -  Free Report) and Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) declined 1.5% and 1.6%, respectively.

305,EQIX,"A successful portfolio manager is aware of the importance of having well-performing stocks in one’s portfolio. Indicators of a stock’s continued performance include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals.One such stock that investors need to hold on to right now is Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). Though there are a few concerns, these are short lived. The stock has the potential to perform well over the long run.Equinix’s share-price movement has been quite encouraging. Over the past year, its shares have gained 25.1%, while the industry, to which it belongs to, witnessed a decline of 9.9%.What’s Driving Equinix?Equinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers and internet-exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and network service providers. The company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and robust fundamentals.It delivered a positive earnings surprise in three out of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.8%.Last quarter, Equinix reported solid year-over-year improvement in revenues as well as earnings. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong booking activity, Equinix's global platform, continued enterprise momentum and synergies from acquisition. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals.Acquisitions have been a major contributor to growth at Equinix. The company has made several buyouts to continue expanding its data-center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. Last year, the company bought various assets, including Itconic and Zenium businesses, and data-center assets from IO UK and ICT-Center AG.Furthermore, the company completed the pending acquisition of 24 data-center sites, which consist of 29 data-center buildings across 15 metro areas, in operation from Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report) for a total cash consideration of $3.6 billion in 2017. Other notable acquisitions in the recent past include Telecity Group Plc, Bit-isle and Nimbo. All these acquisitions are making decent contributions toward total revenue growth.Bottom LineExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in the existing ones are important parts of Equinix's core strategy. The company strives to boost its revenue base and profitability by offering upgraded technology to clients. Moreover, its recurring revenue model has provided the much-needed support to the company's revenue stream over the years. The company's cloud and IT service businesses are its fastest growing segments, and account for roughly one fourth of its total revenues.Further, Equinix remains positive on the growing demand for data centers. To meet the rising demand for cloud services, this global interconnection and data-center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally, and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management.Additionally, the company’s earnings are projected to grow 15.3% over the long term and it has a Growth Style Score of B.Nonetheless, we are slightly concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which will affect operating results as interest expenses are likely to flare up. Also, intensifying competition from established internet data-center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) might affect product pricing, thereby denting Equinix’s margins.Equinix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

306,EQIX,"It seems that Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is firing on all cylinders to expand its data-center business across different regions. Yesterday the company announced a deal to buy Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan’s all the equity interests held in the Metronode group of companies for a total cash consideration of A$1.035 billion or approximately US$792 million. The transaction is anticipated to close by the end of the first half of 2018.By leveraging Metronode’s sturdy local presence, Equinix will be able to further penetrate into the Australian and broader Asia-Pacific region, which is currently one of the fastest growing markets. Notably, Equinix currently generates approximately 21% of its revenues from the Asia-Pacific region.The acquisition will add 10 data-center facilities to Equinix in Australia, in turn increasing its total number of IBX data centers to 15. Also, total number of IBX data centers across the Asia-Pacific region will reach 40.Acquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix. The company remains optimistic on this rising demand for data centers. To meet the growing demand for cloud services, this global interconnection and data-center company has been expanding its IBX data centers globally and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management.Therefore, the company anticipates its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2013 to 2017, and reach $24.0 billion. Based on this projection, Equinix estimates a revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Consequently, we believe by acquiring the Metronode data center, Equinix will be in a better position to capitalize on this opportunity. Moreover, the deal will help the company fortify its global footprint and bring in additional revenues. The latest buyout deal will also increase the company’s global data-center count to 200 across 52 countries.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

309,EQIX,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) cloud services arm — Amazon Web Services (AWS) — strengthened the companies’ years long partnership yesterday, with the latter choosing the former’s four additional IBX data centers for its AWS Direct Connect services.Per the agreement, Equinix will provide high-performance direct network access to AWS Direct Connect services via Equinix data centers in Helsinki, Madrid, Manchester and Toronto. With this, AWS services are now available at 21 Equinix metro IBX data centers.With this extended collaboration, Equinix will help AWS customers benefit from its cloud services, including secure connection, outstanding scalability and infrastructure dependability.Cloud Exchange provides seamless, on-demand and direct access to multiple clouds, across multiple global networks. These virtual circuit connections enable customers to use the cloud of their choice with dedicated, low-latency connections.We believe the recent deal is beneficial for both companies. The partnership will enable AWS to expand the reach of its cloud platform, and provide private connectivity to corporate customers globally in an uncongested and cost-effective manner. Moreover, Equinix helps manage multiple connections through a single port, in turn making it easier for customers to access the AWS cloud platform.In addition to the above, although AWS is ruling the cloud computing market, it needs to continuously extend the company’s global reach as other players, including Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Oracle, are aggressively trying to build a position in this fast-growing segment.On the other hand, as more and more cloud service providers are picking Equinix’s colocation and interconnection services, this will drive the company’s revenues over the long run. Its list of customers includes Alphabet, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce and IBM.Equinix’s share price movement has been quite favorable.

Further, the company provided strong revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and raised full-year 2017 projection. The company’s top and bottom-line results also improved on a year-over-year basis. Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services from corporations and benefits of Equinix's global platform. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals.The company is presently focusing on improving customer experience through the Equinix Customer One program. We are also optimistic on its recurring revenue model and expansion plans announced in March this year.Further, it operates across various geographical regions and is becoming increasingly popular among major players in the tech industry for data management, which should drive revenues going ahead.Notably, acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix. We expect the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo, to remain catalysts.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important components of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster revenues and profitability, going forward.However, intensifying competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT&T and CenturyLink Inc. may affect product pricing, consequently denting the margins.A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

312,EQIX,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), it seems, is set to expand its data center business across different regions. In a move to spread its European operations, the company recently completed the acquisition of an Istanbul-based data center from Zenium.The all-cash deal is valued at $93 million, and was signed and closed on Oct 6, 2017.The new data center, will be popularly known as IS2, and will help the company to meet growing demand for data center services in the region. The takeover will significantly expand Equinix’s presence in Turkey as well as Europe, where Zenium enjoys a significant presence. Istanbul data center acts as a bridge between Europe and Asia consequently addressing the increasing demand for colocation and interconnection services in Turkey.Per the definitive agreement, Equinix agreed to acquire three buildings and land from Zenium business. The IS2 data center will provide an area of approximately 1,500 square meters, with the provision to increase this to 12,000 square meters. This enables the company to proceed aggressively with its plan of developing data centers across different geographies.Equinix stock has gained 27.9% in the last one year, against a loss of 11% incurred by the industry it belongs to.Benefits of the AcquisitionThe addition of the aforementioned facilities will be beneficial for Equinix for a number of reasons. The deal will help the company expand its data center business in Turkey. Per International Monetary Fund, Turkey has the world's 17th largest nominal GDP and a population of around 80 million. Therefore, expanding its facility in the city will attract more enterprises to opt for Equinix’s data center services, leading to a revenue boost.According to the Global Interconnection Index, Europe is projected to increase 44% per annum reaching 1451 Tbps of installed capacity by 2020. Consequently, this deal will bode well for Equinix as the expansion of data centers will strengthen its portfolio in one of the major global trade hubs and financial centers.Additionally, Equinix believes that the buyout will help it support traffic growth between Europe, Latin America and Africa, which is anticipated to be driven by new submarine cable systems. Therefore, the company will be able to expand its interconnection capabilities across these three continents backed by this acquisition.Bottom LineAcquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix. Worldwide, the company owns 180 IBX data centers across 44 countries.The company remains positive on growing demand for data centers. To meet the growing demand for cloud services, the global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management. Therefore, the company anticipates its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2013 to 2017 and reach $24.0 billion. Based on this projection, Equinix projects a revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Consequently, we believe that by acquiring Zenium data center, Equinix will be in a better position to capitalize on this opportunity. Moreover, the deal will help the company fortify its global footprint and bring in additional revenues.Nonetheless, we are concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which will adversely affect the operating results as interest expense would flare up. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), as well as industry consolidation remain other near-term headwinds.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Materials has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 17.1%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

313,EQIX,"Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on May 2, after the market closes. The company’s funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to rise year over year.In the last reported quarter, Equinix delivered a positive surprise of 5.4% in terms of FFO per share. Results were primarily driven by strong booking activities, global expansions, continued enterprise momentum and synergies from acquisitions.The company witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous four reports. In fact, Equinix surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%.Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Equinix, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Equinix, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEquinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers and internet-exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and network service providers. The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech-industry players, those are looking for data management, is likely to drive revenues in the first quarter.Acquisitions have been major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand data-center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. We anticipate that the company’s buyouts of data-center assets from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo to boost the top line in the quarter under review.Expansion in major markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important parts of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its revenue is pegged at $1.21 billion for the quarter under review, reflecting projected growth of 27.6% from the year-ago period.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which might dent Equinix’s first-quarter profitability. It should be noted that at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, Equinix had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.441 billion while the total debt principal outstanding was $10.17 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. Growing debt burden will affect the company’s profitability in the quarter under review as interest expenses would flare up.Moreover, heightening competition from established internet data-center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon will affect product pricing, thereby, thwarting the company’s margins.The company’s activities during the first quarter could not gain adequate confidence from the analysts. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of $4.94 for the first quarter remained unchanged over the past month. Nonetheless, the figure witnessed rise of 19.3% from the prior-year quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Equinix has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.94.Zacks Rank: Equinix’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about a positive surprise.Stock With Favorable CombinationHere is a company that you may want to consider as our model shows that this stock has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Amanda Hoffer Properties (AHH  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter results on May 1, has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

315,EQIX,"Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of the Infomart Dallas from ASB Real Estate Investments in an $800-million cash-debt transaction. This move is in sync with the company’s effort to expand in the region. Further, it offers scope to capitalize on the solid growth potential of the Latin America market in terms of Interconnection Bandwidth.The buyout seems a strategic fit for Equinix. Specifically, the acquisition has enhanced the company’s portfolio with around 1.6 million gross square feet of space. It includes multiple diverse fiber entry points. Also, the company gained from the addition of more than 50 tenants, including networks, colocation providers and office tenants.Around $50 million of revenues were generated by the Infomart building in 2017. One year from closing, Equinix estimates this transaction to be adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share breakeven. In addition, future development of the adjacent acquired land parcel offers significant AFFO upside potential.In fact, Equinix’s global platform gets a boost with the acquisition of Infomart, which is one of the largest inter-connection hubs in the United States. It currently houses four of eight Equinix Dallas International Business Exchange data centers.Moreover, the Dallas market has been experiencing sizable growth with solid demand stemming from a rising number of enterprises across different verticals setting their regional or national headquarters in the region.Furthermore, according to the company, Dallas serves as a key interconnection point for LATAM traffic, with routes serving Central and South America. Therefore, with LATAM predicted to be the fastest growing region in terms of Interconnection Bandwidth through 2020, per the Equinix published 2017 Interconnection Index Report, this Infomart facility acquisition in Dallas, and its operative units in Miami, Los Angeles, Bogotá, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro will likely help the company leverage on the growth potential of the Latin America market.Notably, acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand its data-center capacity in many of the company’s key markets since 2003. Last year, the company bought various assets, including the Itconic and Zenium businesses, and data-center assets from IO UK and ICT-Center AG. Furthermore, in 2017 the company completed the acquisition of 29 data centers and their operations from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), for a total cash consideration of $3.6 billion. All these acquisitions are expected to make decent contributions toward the company’s total revenue growth.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

317,EQIX,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) recently unveiled Equinix SmartKey, an encryption and secured key management related service available on Platform Equinix aimed at simplifying the process of data protection across any cloud storage structure.Equinix had collaborated with Fortanix for the actualization of the project, which had been in the beta phase since November 2017.  SmartKey is supported by hardware security module (HSM) Fortanix, which is based on Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) Software Guard Extensions (SGX).The idea is to ease the process of data encryption across varied cloud environments including the likes of multi-tenant, hybrid, and heterogeneous cloud storage spanning across different regions via a centralized management process.The company’s management stated that SmartKey will ensure that data and keys are stored separately, thereby providing further security in case of a breach. This HSM-based service will be available at the company’s all 190 International Business Exchange (IBX) data centers across 48 markets.Per the press release, “SmartKey is available globally and will be expanding physical points of presence in multiple regions to support particular data sovereignty requirements. Colocation at an Equinix IBX data center is not required to use the service.”The company is planning to demonstrate the solution at the RSA 2018 Conference to be held between April 16 and 20, 2018 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.Notably, this is the first of its kind HSM as a service that Equinix has come up with and is anticipated to provide the company with a first mover’s advantage in the market. Equinix stock has gained 6.3% over the past year, substantially outperforming the 8.5% decline of the industry it belongs to. HSM for Cloud SecurityPer a recent report by Equinix, data transmission between enterprises and multi-cloud environments is expected to grow around 160% annually in the 2016 to 2020 time frame. In such a scenario where shared resources are used, the threats of the data being infected also increase, which  calls for data protection.Mostly, an on-premise model is used for “cryptographic operations” but these increase costs as well. Additionally, as these solutions face difficulties  during deployment in the cloud environment, enterprises are slowly turning toward HSM to solve the purpose.However, in general, HSMs store the data and the encryption keys in the same cloud environment. The unique selling point (USP) for SmartKey in this regard is the separated storage of these, ensuring further security.We believe that this surge in demand for HSM-along with  its USP will increase adoption of Equinix’s SmartKey, eventually boosting the top line. Additionally, private connectivity options permitted to public and hybrid clouds including Amazon Web Services is expected to increase SmartKey’s popularity going ahead.Zacks Rank and  Stocks to ConsiderEquinix currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corp.

318,EQIX,"Digital Realty Trust Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), a data center real estate investment trust (REIT), is making efforts to expand its core business in the Asian markets on the back of strategic acquisitions and partnerships.The company pointed at the current fragmented market conditions to justify this move. Management anticipates that future market consolidation will bring efficiencies of scale and enable the company to capitalize on cost effectiveness.After fortifying its position in the U.S markets, the company intends to strengthen its base in the Asian markets of Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, as well as in Australia. Although it is the least developed of all other markets, there is growth in demand for data centers in Asia. This will favor Digital Realty’s plans to make strategic in-fill acquisitions and attain organic growth.The company is considering various factors like quality of assets, appropriate locations and possibility of building client relationships, while assessing prospective acquisitions.  This will enable it to efficiently meet the elevating demand in targeted markets and widen its customer base.Further, Digital Realty’s investment grade balance sheet and strong liquidity position will aid in pursuing these buyouts. The company enjoys a diversified source of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, with nominal near-term maturities.Digital Realty set foot in Singapore with the Jurong East data center. Since then it has been expanding its global footprint, operating a network of data centers around Singapore, Hong Kong, Osaka, Melbourne and Sydney.The company recently commenced the construction of a new data center development in Western Sydney, expanding its presence in Australia. This is a notable step because the nation serves as a crucial market for not only the company’s Asia-Pacific business but also its global operations as well.With growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. Amid these, the company’s focus on Asian markets is likely to drive top-line growth.However, Digital Realty faces stiff competition from other industry players like CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) and Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). In fact, the company competes with several data center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets in locations same as Digital Realty. Given the solid growth potential of the data center real estate market, competition is expected to increase in the upcoming period from existing players, as well as entry of new players.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

319,EQIX,"Global data center service provider, Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), announced that it has opened the 13th International Business Exchange (IBX) data center — SV10 — in the Silicon Valley. The new center will enable the company to meet the growing demand for data center services in this region.Notably, the 13th data center is located at Equinix’s Great Oaks campus in San Jose. In the first phase, the company invested $122 million and added 930 cabinets, covering an area of 37,000 plus square feet. It has planned for two additional phases, upon completion of which, the facility’s capacity will increase to accommodating 2,820 cabinets.The above-mentioned facility will help Equinix address the rising demand for cloud services in the region. The increase in demand is also evident from its recently released market study report on Global Interconnection Index.Per the report, the United States is the world’s largest and most advanced region for Interconnection Bandwidth growth. It is anticipated that 82% of the organization’s bandwidth will be “dedicated to interconnection to networks and cloud by 2020.” The report further states that the Silicon Valley is among the top four regions within the United States which are witnessing the fastest Interconnection Bandwidth growth. Moreover, the region is projected to witness 39% growth through 2020.Therefore, we believe that expanding its facility in the Silicon Valley will attract more enterprises to opt for Equinix’s data center services, in turn, boosting the company’s revenues.Shares of Equinix have been steadily trading higher on a year-to-date basis. The stock generated a return of approximately 27.3%, while the industry, to which it belongs to, has incurred a loss of 3.6% during the same time frame.Over the years, Equinix has invested approximately $400 million in the Silicon Valley. The company’s data centers across the region serve more than 625 customers who have options to chose from more than 125 network service providers and cloud service providers, including biggies like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Cloud Platform and Oracle’s (ORCL) Oracle Cloud.The recent expansion plan is in sync with Equinix’s $1-billion investment plan announced in April 2017.

321,EQIX,"It seems that Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is firing on all cylinders to expand its data center business across different regions. The company, in a move to expand its European operations, recently announced an agreement to acquire certain businesses — Itconic and its subsidiary CloudMas — from The Carlyle Group. The all-cash deal is valued at €215 million or approximately $259 million and is anticipated to close during fourth-quarter 2017.Itconic provides data center services, connectivity and cloud infrastructure solutions across Spain and Portugal. The above discussed acquisition will bring in five data centers for Equinix, with two located in Mandrid, and one each in Barcelona, Seville and Lisbon. On the other hand, Cloudmass is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Itconic that focuses on supporting enterprise adoption and use of cloud services.The deal marks the company’s third European acquisition this year. Notably, earlier this year, Equinix acquired IO UK's data center operating business in Slough, the United Kingdom and ICT-Center AG’s Zurich-based data center operating business in Switzerland.Following the announcement, shares of Equinix gained 2.7% during yesterday’s trade. Notably, Equinix has outperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. The stock has gained 32.8% in the said period while the industry lost 3.8%.Buyout Makes Sense for EquinixThe addition of the aforementioned facilities will be beneficial for Equinix for a number of reasons. The deal will help the company expand its data center business in the two countries, particularly in Spain, which is the world's 14th and Europe’s sixth largest economy.Furthermore, the acquisition will bring in over 400 customers and 250 trained employees. It will also strengthen Equinix’s business ecosystem as like itself, Itconic also “provides customers with the broadest choice of service providers for IT and multicloud deployments to accelerate business performance.”Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS, Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Cloud are some of the IT-services providing companies which are Itconic’s clients.Additionally, Equinix believes that the buyout will help it support traffic growth between Europe, Latin America and Africa, which is anticipated to be driven by new submarine cable systems. Therefore, the company will be able to expand its interconnection capabilities across these three continents backed by this acquisition.Acquisitions — Key Growth StrategyAcquisitions have remained one of the key growth strategies for Equinix. Last year, the company completed the acquisition of Telecity for $3.8 billion, in turn becoming the leading European data center operator. Moreover, so far this year, the company has completed two European acquisitions and is in the middle of the third one.The company is also expanding its data center business in other regions as well. In May this year, Equinix completed the acquisition of 24 data center sites from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report). This acquisition expanded its interconnection capabilities in the United States and Latin America.Its other notable acquisitions include Nimbo — a leading professional services company — primarily focused on enabling enterprises to develop and implement hybrid cloud, and Tokyo-based Bit-isle. All these acquisitions have made decent contributions toward total revenue growth.Bottom LineExpansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been an important part of Equinix's core strategy. Further, the company remains positive on the elevated demand for data centers. To meet the growing demand for cloud services, this global interconnection and data center company is expanding its IBX data centers globally and gaining popularity among tech companies looking for data management. Thus, the company expects its total addressable market for retail data centers to increase at a CAGR of 8% from 2013 to 2017 and reach $24.0 billion. Based on this projection, Equinix forecasts revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Therefore, we believe that by acquiring data center assets, Equinix will be in a better position to capitalize on this opportunity. Furthermore, the acquisitions will help company further strengthen its global footprint and bring in additional revenues.Nonetheless, we are concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which will adversely affect the operating results as interest expense would flare up. Also, intensifying competition and industry consolidation are other near-term headwinds.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

325,EQIX,"Data-center REITs will likely continue experiencing a boom market, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. Also, the estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five-eight years.These factors, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, are anticipated to provide substantial growth impetus to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report) and CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report), and others.Specifically, Digital Realty is poised to benefit from this strong demand for data centers through accretive acquisitions and development efforts. In September 2017, Digital Realty announced the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros, in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced the company’s portfolio in the top U.S. data-center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped the company enhance its hyper-scale product offering and grow Digital Realty’s blue-chip customer base.Recently, Digital Realty unveiled its third data center in Toronto. The move further expands the company’s presence in the fourth largest city in North America which is also the financial and business capital of Canada. Further, the company had acquired Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of eight high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) from Equinix in July 2016. Also, it has fortified its presence in Europe, Australia and Asia in recent years through development of high-quality facilities.The company focuses on maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and is committed to a conservative capital structure. It enjoys ample and growing liquidity, with diversified sources of capital and has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Additionally, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Digital Realty remains committed to that. Much to the delight of its shareholders, on Mar 1, 2018, the company announced an 8.6% hike in dividend. The company has raised dividend every year since its initial public offering and the March 2018 raise marked the 13th consecutive year of increase.However, Digital Realty faces stiff competition in its industry. In fact, the company contends with several data-center developers, owners and operators, many of which enjoy ownership of similar assets at locations same as Digital Realty. Also, there are multiple local developers in the United States and several regional operators across Europe, Asia and Australia.Given the solid growth potential of the data-center real estate market, competition is expected to intensify in the upcoming period from existing as well as new players. Amid all this, an aggressive pricing pressure is anticipated in the data-center market.Moreover, Digital Realty’s earnings have a notable exposure to foreign currency translation. Also, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company. In fact, it has substantial debt burden. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate, and lower dividend payouts as well. Moreover, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Shares of Digital Realty have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. The stock has gained 15.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 12.4%. However, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share remain unchanged at $6.55 over the past month.Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3(Hold).

Valued at more than $1 billion, Ascenty has a superior infrastructure, with redundancy, security and high connectivity, enabling it to have contracts with clients like Oracle Corp., Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report).Notably, data-center REITs are expected to continue experiencing a boom market with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. Also, the estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five-eight years. These factors, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, are anticipated to provide substantial growth impetus to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty, Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), and others.Specifically, Digital Realty is poised to benefit from strong demand for data centers through accretive acquisitions and development efforts. In September 2017, Digital Realty declared the completion of a merger with DuPont Fabros in an all-stock deal, for an enterprise value of about $7.8 billion. This move enhanced the company’s portfolio in the top U.S. data center metro areas across Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. It helped it to enhance hyper-scale product offering and grow its blue-chip customer base.Moreover, the company acquired Telx in October 2015 and a portfolio of 8 high-quality, carrier-neutral data centers in Europe (Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London) from Equinix in July 2016. Such acquisitions offered a leading colocation and interconnection platform, superior connectivity infrastructure and better scope for growth in attractive locations. Also, it enhanced its presence in Europe, Australia and Asia in the recent years through the development of high-quality facilities. We believe that such expansion efforts would drive the company’s top and bottom lines in the years ahead.However, Digital Realty faces intense competition in the industry. Aggressive pricing pressure is also likely to continue in the upcoming period. Furthermore, it has a substantial debt burden, hence, rate hike adds to its woes.Currently, Digital Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

330,EQIX,"In a bid to expand into the Croatian market, Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Zagreb-based Arhiv Trezor. The company has selected Arhiv Trezor for its expansion because the latter has a robust base of customers and enjoys a great reputation.The expansion into the Croatian market, with the acquisition of Arhiv Trezor, seems a strategic fit for Iron Mountain as this will enable the company to benefit from the rising record and information management business. Further, this will fortify the company’s presence within Southeastern Europe.Notably, as a result of the application of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the requirements for data privacy and protection have become extremely stringent. This requires clients to associate themselves with companies who aid them in adhering to the rules, thus increasing business opportunities for companies like Iron Mountain.Arhiv Trezor, which is a leader in storage and management of records, digitization, protected information destruction and safe transportation, was founded in 2002. The company has also received ISO 9001: 2015 Certification for records and business documentation archiving in Europe.Per Ernest Cloutier, executive vice president and general manager, International for Iron Mountain, ""Acquiring a known market leader like Arhiv Trezor fits our strategy of seeking established local providers that share our commitment to service delivery, trust and security in markets with strong growth trends in information management outsourcing.""Iron Mountain has an aggressive acquisition strategy to drive growth of storage revenues. The company has not only gained new customers from these acquisitions but has also been able to expand operations in international regions such as Greece, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Australia, Turkey, India, Brazil, China, Colombia and Poland.The company completed the acquisition of Recall Holdings in May 2016, which has broadened its footprint.

331,EQIX,"Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report) recently unveiled its third data center in Toronto. The move further expands the company’s presence in the fourth largest city in North America which is also the financial and business capital of Canada.The latest 46-megawatt facility, situated on the former Toronto Star Printing Plant site at One Century Place in Vaughan, Ontario, enjoys proximity to downtown Toronto, major highways, and an international airport. With 23 computer rooms, this facility can house power capacities from one to three megawatts per room.The expansion in Toronto is a strategic fit for Digital Realty as the capital city is home to several financial and technology companies, as well as emerging tech start-ups that are making significant strides in digital transformation, and require reliable provisioning of IT services and capabilities. Ranking among the top technology clusters in North America, Toronto has more than 15,000 technology companies along the Toronto-to-Waterloo corridor. Moreover, the city’s diverse population is growing rapidly, thereby offering bright prospects for Digital Realty.Data-center REITs are expected to continue experiencing a boom market with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure. Also, the estimated growth rates for the artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality markets will remain robust over the next five to eight years. These factors, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, are anticipated to give significant impetus for growth to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty, Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), CyrusOne Inc. (CONE  -  Free Report) and CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report).Specifically, Digital Realty is poised to benefit from the stellar demand for data centers, as well as accretive acquisitions and development efforts.

332,EQIX,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) recently announced its plan to build the company’s fifth International Business Exchange (IBX) in Hong Kong. The new IBX infrastructure, which will be known as HK5, will commence operation in fourth-quarter 2017. With an area of over 48,000 square feet, the HK5 facility will accommodate about 1,200 cabinets.This expansion will enable the company to meet the growing demand for data center services in the city. Citing a report of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Equinix noted that “business leaders in Hong Kong are showing urgency in embracing the fourth Industrial Revolution, and 66 percent recognize the need to transform to a digital business to enable future growth. However, the study also cited a lack of supporting Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure as one of the major barriers to digital transformation.”Upon completion of the HK5 facility, Equinix will have 30 data centers in the Asia-Pacific region. Worldwide, the company owns 180 IBX data centers across 44 countries.Equinix stock has gained 22.1% in the last one year, substantially outperforming the 18.5% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.The investment is part of Equinix’s latest string of expansion initiatives across the Asia-Pacific region. This is in sync with the company’s recent development of data centers in Melbourne, Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo.The aforementioned investment will enable Equinix offer customers the benefit of its cloud infrastructure, including a secure connection, outstanding scalability and infrastructure dependability.We believe that the new data center will widen the company’s footprint across the Asia-Pacific region. The facility will help Equinix address the rising demand for cloud services in the region. The increase in demand is also evident from the findings of an independent research firm – Gartner.According to this technology research firm, total public cloud services market in the Asia-Pacific region is anticipated to grow 17.7% in 2017 and reach $10 billion, up from $8.5 billion in 2016.An increase in public cloud services will boost demand for data centers. Per the Gartner report, the mature Asia-Pacific market covers Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.Bottom LineEquinix remains positive on growing demand for data centers. Toward this end, the company is expanding its IBX data centers globally and gaining popularity among tech companies, which are seeking data management. Thus, the company expects its total addressable market for retail data centers to witness a CAGR of 8% from 2013–2017 and reach $24 billion. Based on this, Equinix projects revenue growth rate of 10% through 2017.Therefore, we believe that the expansion of its data center assets will enable Equinix to capitalize on this opportunity. Moreover, the expansion will help the company fortify its global footprint and bring in additional revenues.Nonetheless, we are concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which will adversely affect the operating results as interest expense would flare up. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report), as well as industry consolidation remain other near-term headwinds.Currently, Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is American Assets Trust, Inc.

Further, the company provided strong revenue guidance for the third quarter and raised full-year 2017 projection. The company’s top-line and bottom-line results also improved on a year-over-year basis. Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services from corporations and benefits of Equinix's global platform. Equinix witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals.The company is presently focusing on improving customer experience through the Equinix Customer One program. We are also optimistic on its recurring revenue model and expansion plans announced in March this year.Further, it operates across various geographical regions and is becoming increasingly popular among major players in the tech industry for data management, which should drive revenues going ahead.Notably, acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix. We expect the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo, to remain catalysts.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones are important components of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster revenues and profitability, going forward.However, intensifying competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT&T and CenturyLink Inc. may affect product pricing, consequently denting the margins.A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: Tech Opportunity Worth $386 Billion in 2017                 From driverless cars to artificial intelligence, we've seen an unsurpassed growth of high-tech products in recent months.

336,EQIX,"In a bid to expand into the Amsterdam market, Iron Mountain Inc. (IRM  -  Free Report) has acquired the Dutch EvoSwitch data-center business. The company shelled out €205 ($235) million for this acquisition which involved the purchase of EvoSwitch Netherlands B.V and EvoSwitch Global Services B.V. (EvoSwitch NL) in particular. The move comes after Iron Mountain’s expansion in London through data-center facility purchase from Credit Suisse in the past 12 months.The latest acquisition brings in 11 megawatts (MW) of existing data-center capacity in the Netherlands which happens to be fully leased. Moreover, there is an additional 23 MW expansion capability.  As a result, the total data-center portfolio capacity of Iron Mountain, now grows to more than 285 MW.The expansion into the Amsterdam market, which happens to be the second largest European data-center market, with the acquisition of EvoSwitch NL seems a strategic fit for Iron Mountain. Founded in 2007, EvoSwitch NL operates one of the largest colocation facilities centers in the Metropolitan Region Amsterdam (MRA).The MRA serves as a crucial node in the FLAP data-center market, i.e. Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and therefore, the acquisition of EvoSwitch NL significantly boosts Iron Mountain’s presence in the region. Particularly, two locations in the MRA join Iron Mountain’s portfolio with this acquisition.Further, the present campus of EvoSwitch NL already caters to more than 50 connectivity and telecommunication providers, together with internet exchanges, such as the Amsterdam Internet Exchange AMS-IX. Its customers base is diversified as well as global. Moreover, Leaseweb Netherlands B.V., (Leaseweb NL), a cloud hosting company operating in more than 30 countries, represents around 45% of EvoSwitch NL's contracted revenues under a 10-year lease agreement, and will become one of the top five customers of Iron Mountain data centers.Iron Mountain expects the transaction, including integration costs, to lead to modest dilution to AFFO of around 0.5% in 2018, but be accretive in 2019 following integration. Specifically, stabilized net operating income yield is estimated to be around 12-13% subsequent to build-out and lease-up of the expansion capacity at the EvoSwitch NL sites, while the present capacity is likely to generate annualized revenues of about $30 million at mid-50% adjusted EBITDA margins, the company noted.Importantly, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data-center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, the top tier markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace. This, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to spur demand for data centers and offer ample scope for growth to data-center REITs, including Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) and Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report).Iron Mountain’s latest endeavors in this space also command appreciation and will likely boost its top-line growth by leveraging on the healthy fundamentals. In fact, aggressive acquisitions, along with diversified revenue base, a strong product portfolio and cost-cutting initiatives, bode well for long-term growth. Further, transformation initiatives and continued strong performance of its storage rental business are positives. However, heavy investments in setting up the company’s data-center business dampen its financials, especially as the company already has a highly leveraged balance sheet.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its total return was 7.8% in the past year, underperforming its industry’s growth of 9.5%. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

337,EQIX,"The current reporting cycle has already crossed the half-way mark and results are still pouring in from the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry. In fact, on Aug 2, a number of S&P 500 constituents – residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), data center REIT Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), and retail REITs Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) – are slated to release quarterly figures.So far, results from the broader market revealed broad-based growth, record earnings tally, an abundance of positive surprises and favorable trends on the revisions front. (Read more: Q2 Earnings Season Past the Halfway Mark)Nevertheless, the performance of the REIT sector has so far been mixed, with results from some of the top notch REIT stocks either matching estimates or beating, and a few others falling shy of expectations.Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind.In fact, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang, driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.On the other hand, we note that mall traffic continues to decline owing to a change in shopping patterns. Online purchases have taken precedence over in-store purchase. This has forced retailers to reconsider their strategy and shift investments from traditional retailing to online channels and optimize their brick-and-mortar presence.While it is quite normal for retailers to do so, these optimization efforts and the consequent decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD) and JC Penney (JCP) in recent months, have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords. Also, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is resulting in higher vacancy in existing malls.    Therefore, not all players in the REIT space are equally poised to excel this time around. To predict that, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s have a look at what’s in store for the five REITs set to release second-quarter results on Wednesday:Arlington, VA-based, residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. In addition, increasing consumer confidence, on the back of job growth, rising wages, and a healthier balance sheet, promise bright prospects for the company. The company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although pace of rental growth has slowed down from the previous years, it is now likely to achieve stability. (Read more: Can AvalonBay Pull Off A Surprise in Q2 Earnings?)AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of +0.94 %. This positive ESP combined with its Zacks Rank #3, increases the chances of a positive surprise this season.Over the trailing four quarters, with respect to FFO per share, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and missed in the other three.

This includes an upgrade of the tenant mix. Such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term. However, their short-term adverse impact on occupancy and net operating income cannot be bypassed.

338,EQIX,"Equinix Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2. Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 16.95%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 20.96%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayEquinix is a global provider of network-neutral data centers and internet exchange services for enterprises, content companies, systems integrators, and network service providers. The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the second quarter.Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it expand data center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. We anticipate the company’s buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo, to boost the top line in the quarter.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been important parts of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company’s focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which may dent Equinix’s second-quarter profitability. It should be noted that Equinix had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $4.938 billion, while the total debt principal outstanding was $9.27 billion as on Mar 31, 2017. Growing debt burden will affect the company’s profitability in the quarter as interest expense would go up.Moreover, increasing competition from established internet data center operators, such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon, will affect product pricing, thereby thwarting margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Equinix is 0.00%.

339,EQIX,"Interconnection and data-center REIT, Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), has announced its plan to expand the company's London data center. Specifically, the $39 million of investment will be made for expansion of the company’s LD4 IBX data center at its London Slough campus.This move will help the company address the growing demand from financial services companies. Particularly, the latest phase will support the expanding multi-asset class electronic trading ecosystem, comprising interconnected execution venues, trading platforms, market data vendors, service providers as well as buy-side and sell-side firms.The expansion, which is slated to open in the fourth quarter this year, will lead to the addition of 1,075 cabinets in around 3,300 square meters of colocation area at the LD4 data center. LD4 currently has 3,777 cabinets, in about 10,000 square meters of colocation area.Customers will benefit as they will be able to securely interconnect with more than 1,000 businesses in London. These comprise capital market participants, insurers and electronic payments firms, in addition to the several network service providers, and cloud and IT service providers.   In an effort to securely transact with ecosystem participants, the Nasdaq capitalizes on Equinix's global interconnection platform, and has deployed with Equinix in LD4 in London and New York City. The private connectivity helps share huge data with multiple stakeholders via private business exchanges and securely dodging the public internet totally.Moreover, in Europe, the interconnection bandwidth is projected to increase, reaching 1450+Tbps by 2020, per the Global Interconnection Index. Further, by 2020, Banking and Insurance is estimated to expand and reach 955+ Tbps of interconnection bandwidth.

Moreover, with the exponential rise in data, resulting from web browsing and e-commerce to streaming video and AI, there is a significant surge in new subsea cable construction.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $4.94. The uptick primarily stemmed from robust top-line growth and strong operating performance, partially offset by an elevated cost of revenues.AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, generally used in the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) industry.Quarter in DetailTotal revenues came in at $1.22 billion, up 28% from the year-ago quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21 billion. This marked the 61st quarter of consecutive revenue growth.Equinix continues to witness solid demand for cloud services from corporations interested in enhancing firms’ networks. The company observed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals. Robust growth in the global Colocation and Interconnection platforms provided a boost to the top line.Moreover, solid performance in MRR (monthly recurring revenues) per cabinet, MRR churn rate (2.4%) and cross-connect additions drove the top line. Recurring revenues came in at $1.15 billion (95% of total revenues), up approximately 28% from the year-ago quarter. Non-recurring revenues climbed 27.7% to $65.2 million (5% of total revenues).Revenues from the three geographic regions increased on a year-over-year basis as well. Revenues from the Americas, EMEA and the Asia Pacific were up 38.1%, 20.6% and 17.9% to $602.6 million, $379.6 million and $233.6 million, respectively.Gross margin was 48.8%, down from 50.6% reported in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to elevated cost of revenues as a percentage of sales. Total operating expenses flared up 17.3% to $367.6 million. Further, operating expenses contracted 280 basis points (bps) as a percentage of revenues to 30.2%.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $579.5 million, up 35.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins came in at 48% as compared with 45% reported in the year-ago quarter. AFFO increased 36.3% to $414.6 million during the reported quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowEquinix exited the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.1 billion. The company’s total debt principal outstanding was $11.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018. It generated cash of $300.9 million from operating activities in the first quarter of 2018.GuidanceEquinix provided an outlook for the second quarter and raised a few full-year 2018 projections. For 2018, the company now anticipates revenues to be in the range of $5.082-$5.122 billion (prior guidance was over $5.010 billion), reflecting an increase of 17% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.04 billion. The company now predicts adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2.395-$2.435 billion (prior guidance was over $2.385 billion).Equinix now anticipates full-year 2018 AFFO to be in the range of $1.595- $1.635 billion, reflecting growth of 12% year over year. Earlier, Equinix expected AFFO to exceed $1.635 billion.The company reiterated its expectation of the cash gross margin for the full year. The company expects it to be approximately 67%. Cash selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are projected to be 19-20% of revenues.Coming to the second quarter, Equinix expects revenues in the range of $1.257-$1.267 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.24 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to lie between $579 million and $589 million.Cash gross margin for the second quarter is anticipated to be 66-67%. Cash selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses are projected be in the range of 19-20% of revenues.Our TakeEquinix reported stellar first-quarter results. Revenues were mainly driven by strong demand for cloud services from corporations and benefits from Equinix's global platform. The company witnessed revenue growth across all three geographic regions and verticals.Additionally, the company’s recurring revenue model and current expansion plans are encouraging. In April 2017, it announced a billion-dollar aggressive expansion plan, which includes unveiling data centers, acquisitions and expansion of existing facilities. Further, the company provided encouraging revenue guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2018.Nevertheless, we are concerned about the company’s growing debt burden, which would adversely affect the operating results as interest expenses would go up. Further, intensifying competition from established Internet data-center operators such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and CenturyLink Inc. (CTL  -  Free Report) might impact product pricing while consequently denting margins. A highly leveraged balance sheet and industry consolidation add to its woes.Equinix carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy and the first quarter usually marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of householdsFurther, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of MAA.
