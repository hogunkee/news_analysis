0,AVY,"Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) has been underperforming the industry of late. Higher debt levels, raw material cost inflation and restructuring charges will dent margins in the near term. Estimates Moving South The estimates for the company for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, have moved south in the past 60 days, reflecting the negative outlook of analysts. For fiscal 2018, the estimate has declined 0.3% to $5.99. For fiscal 2019, the estimate has decreased 0.6% to $6.51 per share. Falling Behind the Industry  Avery Dennison has underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past year. The stock gained 10.6% while the industry rose 12%. Expensive Valuation Avery Dennison’s stretched valuation is a concern. The trailing 12-month price earnings (P/E) ratio is 18.9 for the company while the industry’s average trailing 12-month P/E ratio is lower at 17.3. This implies that the stock is overvalued. Near-Term Headwinds Remain Avery Dennison initiated a restructuring plan associated with the consolidation of the European footprint of its Label and Graphic Materials segment to ensure continued high returns for the segment and improve competitiveness. However, restructuring charges associated with the plan will dent second-quarter margins. Further, higher debt levels following the Yongle and Finesse acquisitions remain a concern. Raw material cost inflation will also dent margins in the near term. Though RFID (Radio-frequency identification) has strong growth potential, sales remain volatile on a quarterly basis as it is driven by timing of customer implementations. Even though the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment is expected to generate strong margins in the long term, its operating margin is currently bearing the brunt of the impact of acquisitions and growth-related investments along with a number of operational challenges. Unfavorable Zacks Rank Avery Dennison currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report), DMC Global Inc. (BOOM  -  Free Report) and Chart Industries, Inc. (GTLS  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Actuant has a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.6%. Its shares have rallied 19% over the past year. DMC Global has a long-term earnings growth rate of 20%. The company’s shares have appreciated 268% in the past year. Chart Industries has a long-term earnings growth rate of 26.9%. The stock has surged 77% in a year’s time. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.  Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1,AVY,"Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price. Earnings acceleration, however, works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price. Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price.Finding Future OutperformersBasically, earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company. In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be referred to as earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. Meanwhile, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.The Winning StrategyLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

2,AVY,"Donaldson Company, Inc. (DCI  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share in third-quarter fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.The reported figure fared better than the prior-year quarter’s tally of 45 cents, reflecting an increase of 17.8%. The bottom line was driven by impressive growth in revenues and favourable market conditions.Inside the HeadlinesDonaldson’s total sales amounted to $700 million, reflecting an improvement of 15.1% on a year-over-year basis. The top line also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $684 million. Solid performance in the company’s Engine Products and Industrial Products segments drove sales.The Engine Products segment’s sales were up 16% year over year to $472.3 million. Three of the four sub-segments under Engine Products — Off-Road, On Road and Aftermarket — recorded stellar increase in sales, leading to the company’s overall strong performance. Sales in Aftermarket, On-road and Off-Road business improved 12.6%, 46.3% and 30.4%, respectively. Sales for the Aerospace and Defense business declined 10.9%, partly due to the timing within the Defense business.Sales in the Industrial Product segment were up 12.4% year over year to $227.7 million. Within the segment, the Industrial Filtration Solutions, Gas Turbine Systems and Special Applications businesses improved 17.7%, 2.9% and 3.3%, respectively.Donaldson Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Donaldson Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Donaldson Company, Inc. QuoteHowever, Donaldson’s adjusted operating margin contracted 10 basis points (bps) year over year to 14.4%, reflecting negative impact from higher raw materials and supply chain costs, along with an adverse product mix. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $123.9 million compared with $107.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Apr 30, 2018, Donaldson had cash and equivalents of $317.3 million compared with $295.9 million a year ago. The company had long-term debt of $687.5 million as on Apr 30, 2018 compared with $537.3 million as on Jul 31, 2017.Share Repurchase ProgramIn the fiscal third quarter, the company returned $23.4 million to shareholders through dividends. Additionally, Donaldson repurchased shares worth $44.9 million, which represented 0.8% of its outstanding shares.2018 GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release, the company revised its guidance for fiscal 2018. Donaldson currently expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings in the range of $1.97-$2.01 per share compared with its earlier projection of $1.93-$2.01. Based on the current market scenario, the company now expects a 15% increase in fiscal sales on a year-over-year basis compared with the prior forecast of 13-15%.Segment wise, Donaldson projects Engine Products sales to increase in the range of 18-19% compared with its earlier projection of 17-19%. Markedly, sales increase in Aftermarket, Off-Road and On-Road is expected to act as a tailwind for growth in the Engine Products segment, partially offset by declining sales in Aerospace and Defense.Donaldson expects Industrial Products sales to increase in the range of 8-9% compared with its earlier guidance of 5-7%, mirroring impressive performance from Industrial Filtration Solutions and Special Applications.ConclusionDonaldson’s Engine Products segment has been exhibiting great momentum backed by benefit from stabilization in market conditions. Overall favorable trends including effects of restocking, commodity prices, decent rig counts and stable industrial production are expected to prove conducive to the company’s results in the upcoming quarters. Also, the company’s strategy of winning first-fit programs, aftermarket growth, constant geographic expansion and fostering innovative technology are likely to act as growth catalysts, going ahead.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is vulnerable to uncertainty related to policy changes, global economic conditions and adverse currency fluctuations as more than half of its revenues comes from outside the United States.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc (AIT  -  Free Report), MSA Safety Incorporated (MSA  -  Free Report) and Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report).

3,AVY,"On May 30, we issued an updated research report on Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report). This premium diversified industrial behemoth provides highly engineered motion control solutions, premium hydraulic solutions and tools in more than 30 countries. Moreover, the company provides specialized services and products in the global energy market.Actuant currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and flaunts a VGM Score of A.Factors Benefiting the StockHigher Engineered Solutions and Industrial segments’ revenues have been bolstering Actuant’s top line. Elevated demand from industrial and off-highway equipment markets will likely drive the company’s revenue growth in the quarters ahead. Based on this, the company currently anticipates to generate revenues of $1.140-$1.160 billion in fiscal 2018 (ending August 2018), higher than the previous forecast of $1.10-$1.13 billion.Moreover, Actuant intends to become a high-performing company on the back of stronger innovation, strategic portfolio-management moves and diligent restructuring initiatives. For instance, expansion of the Enerpac product line is expected to boost the company’s near-term revenues. On the other hand, the ongoing restructuring actions undertaken to drive customer spending activity in the company’s European end-markets will likely prove beneficial.  The company also intends to reinforce its business on the back of strategic acquisitions. For instance, in December 2017, Actuant acquired Mirage Machines, Ltd. from Acteon to broaden its product offerings in the flange facing and hot tapping categories. Specifically, this buyout will complement Actuant’s Energy segment's Hydratight business, and create rental and service business opportunities, going forward.Over the past three months, Actuant’s shares have gained 9.8%, as against the 2.3% loss recorded by the industry.Prevalent SetbacksActuant’s profitability has been tumbling for the past few quarters. In addition, escalating costs have been pulling down the company’s margins. In the fiscal second quarter, its adjusted gross margin and operating margin contracted 110 and 160 basis points, respectively, year over year. The company noted that costs associated with the ongoing heavy lifting projects, warranty issues, negative sales mix and inflation in certain input prices resulted in the downtrend.Furthermore, Actuant believes expedited freight, certain maintenance-related expenses, persistent inflation, as well as the engineering and commercial investments will dampen its near-term margins as well.Actaunt also expects that sustained customer-maintenance deferrals, scope reductions and push-outs from various end-markets will affect its Energy business. In the fiscal second quarter, the segment’s core sales slipped 8% year over year. This primarily resulted from lower revenues secured from its Hydratight business.The company anticipates to report earnings of $1.00-$1.10 per share for fiscal 2018 (ending August 2018), lower than the previous view of $1.05-$1.15 per share.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Industrial Products sector are listed below:Axon Enterprise, Inc (AAXN  -  Free Report) flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 330%, over the last four quarters. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Acco Brands Corporation (ACCO  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

7,AVY,"On May 4, we issued an updated research report on Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report). The company’s results in the near term will bear the brunt of material and other cost inflation. Further, concerns pertaining to the separation of the Electrical business remain. Sound Q1 Results Pentair delivered first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 88 cents per share, up 35% from the year-ago quarter. Earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents as well as management’s guidance of 81-83 cents. Guidance Reflects Electric Business Separation Pentair initiated second-quarter adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 67-69 cents. Sales is expected to be around $0.79 billion, up 4-5% on a reported basis and up 3-4% on a core basis compared with second-quarter 2017. For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $2.25 and $2.30. Sales are projected at $2.96 billion, up 3-4% on a reported and core basis over 2017.  Both the guidance ranges reflect the separation of its Electrical business, nVent Electric plc. Electrical Business Separation Completed, Risks Persist Pentair has completed the separation of its Electrical business, which is now held by nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), a new independent, publicly-traded company.  nVent shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2018, under the symbol ""NVT"". This will create two industry leading pure play companies in Water and Electrical — Pentair plc and nVent Electric plc (""nVent""), respectively.  Both the companies are well-positioned for long-term growth as well as value creation and also possess the scale and strength to flourish as separate entities. Pentair will continue to operate as a leading global water company focused on smart and sustainable solutions. Although the separation of the Electrical business from the Water business will provide financial, operational, managerial and other benefits to the company as well as its shareholders, risks persist in connection with the separation. Pentair will incur certain costs and expenses relating to the spin-off, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees along with ongoing costs in connection with the spin-off, including costs of operating as independent, publicly-traded companies. Those costs may exceed its estimates or could negate some of the expected benefits. If the intended gains are not realized or costs exceed estimates, it would have an adverse effect on the financial condition. Further, each management team's inability to control additional stranded corporate costs or to deliver a smooth transition might affect near-term business performance. Following the spin-off, trading price of Pentair’s shares is likely to decline and may experience greater volatility as it will no longer reflect the value of the Electrical business. Until the market has fully analyzed the company’s value without the Electrical business, the price of shares may experience higher volatility. Moreover, the shares may not match some holders' investment strategies or meet criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios, which could cause investors to sell their shares. Excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of Pentair’s shares to dip. Factors That Might Restrict Results The company has identified attractive opportunities in specific product and geographic markets, both within and outside the United States. The company is reinforcing its businesses to effectively address these opportunities through research & development as well as additional sales and marketing resources. Unless it is successful in its endeavors, the company’s sales growth will likely be limited in the near term or may decline. Sales outside the United States accounted for 40% of net sales in fiscal 2017. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, could have an adverse material effect on the company’s revenues. The company continues to witness inflation in material and other costs. The current economic environment is likely to fuel the persisting price volatility for raw materials.  Pentair underperformed its industry’s performance with respect to share price, over the past year. The stock slumped 33%, while the industry recorded growth of 4%. Zacks Rank and Key Picks Pentair currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Caterpillar Inc.

13,AVY,"Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25 before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company recorded year-over-year improvement in both its top and bottom lines. Further, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.4% in the quarter. It is worth noting that Avery Dennison has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.8%. Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Avery Dennison Corporation price-eps-surprise | Avery Dennison Corporation QuoteLet’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAvery Dennison’s Label and Graphic Materials segment is the largest and highest-return business. The segment will maintain its momentum of strong top-line growth and continued margin expansion, aided by growth in emerging markets, company’s strategic focus on high-value categories (including specialty labels) as well as the ongoing contribution from productivity initiatives.The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment continues to perform well on the back of business model transformation. This has enabled it to gain share market share, while driving significant margin expansion. Avery Dennison has increased the segment’s competitiveness through strategic pricing initiatives. Margins are likely to improve exhibiting the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volume. Growing adoption of RFID (Radio-frequency identification) by retailers due to growth of omni-channel retailing as well as the requirement to locate inventories at all times is fueling demand. Consequently, RFID sales, which increased a 20% year over year in 2017, will continue to boost the segment’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment’s operating margins are currently bearing the brunt of acquisitions and growth-related investments as well as a number of operational challenges. Further, modest sequential raw material inflation will hinder Avery Dennison’s first-quarter performance. Further, higher-debt levels following the Yongle and Finesse acquisitions remain a concern.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is currently pegged at $1.34, reflecting year-over-year growth of 20.7%. The estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, projecting a year-over-year climb of 11.7%. Focus on productivity, acquisitions, aggressive cost control and share repurchases will drive the results.Further, Avery Dennison’s shares have outperformed the industry’s performance in the past year. The stock has gained 31.8%, compared with the industry's growth of 26.3%. Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Our proven model does not conclusively show that Avery Dennison will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat consensus estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. That is not the case here as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -4.66%. Zacks Rank: Avery Dennison is #3 Ranked. Though a Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to Consider Here are a few industrial products stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Axon’s shares have surged 85% in the past year. The Earnings ESP for Alarm.com Holdings, Inc. (ALRM  -  Free Report) is +5.44%. It sports a Zacks Rank #1. Shares of Alarm.com Holdings have gone up 32% in a year’s time. Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.36% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its shares have gone up 34% in a year’s time. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

14,AVY,"In volatile markets, investors look for both growth and income in their portfolios. This can be achieved by zeroing in on companies that not only pay dividends but also have been consistently increasing their payout.  Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a history of enhancing shareholder returns through consistent dividend hikes make an investor’s portfolio immune to large swings in stock prices in turbulent times, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. Simultaneously, these offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis irrespective of the market direction.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appears as a winning strategy when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenues.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five of the 11 stocks that fit the bill:Delaware-based Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) provides performance chemicals in North America, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

15,AVY,"Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) appears a solid bet now with a plethora of positives aiding the stock.  Continued focus on productivity, cost control and acquisitions along with bookings and backlog strength are primary factors driving the company. Further, Avery Dennnison’s consistent execution of strategies positions it well for profitable growth. Let’s delve deeper and find out what are the factors that make this producer of pressure-sensitive materials, and a variety of tickets, tags, labels and other converted products, a lucrative investment option. What’s Working in Favor of Avery Dennison? Solid Rank & VGM Score: Avery Dennison currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company also has a Value Growth Momentum Score (VGM Score) of B. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities. Consequently, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment. Above the Industry: Avery Dennison’s shares have outperformed the industry with respect to price performance in the past year. The company’s shares have gained around 31%, while the industry grew 26%.  Upward Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for 2018 has moved up 8% to $5.88 in the last 60 days. The earnings estimate for 2019 has also gone up 8% to $6.38. Superior Return on Assets (ROA): Avery Dennison’ ROA of 8.9%, as compared with the industry average of 7.2%, highlights the company’s efficiency in generating earnings by effectively managing assets. Upbeat Guidance: For 2018, Avery Dennison guided adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.70-$5.95. The mid-point of the earnings guidance range reflects year-over-year growth of 17%.

It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive earnings surprise of 6.84%. Growth Drivers in Place: Roughly half of Avery Dennison’s sales are now linked to either any or both of its presence in emerging markets and faster-growing high-value categories, such as specialty labels, industrial tapes and Radio-frequency identification (“RFID”).

Focus on productivity, acquisitions, aggressive cost control and share repurchases will be conducive to its results. The Label and Graphic Materials segment is its largest and highest-return business. This segment will maintain strong top-line growth and continued margin expansion, aided by improvement in emerging markets, company’s strategic focus on high-value categories (including specialty labels) and the ongoing contribution from productivity initiatives. The Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment is poised to benefit from the Yongle, Finesse and Mactac acquisitions. Despite a challenging retail environment, the Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment continues to perform well on the back of the business-model transformation that has enabled it to gain market share, while driving significant margin expansion as well as continued strength in RFID. Avery Dennison has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7%. Other Stocks to Consider Some other top-ranked stocks in the sector include Encore Wire Corporation (WIRE  -  Free Report), Capstone Turbine Corporation (CPST  -  Free Report) and Axon Enterprise, Inc.

16,AVY,"TriMas Corporation (TRS  -  Free Report) remains well poised for growth backed by its focus on leveraging the TriMas Business Model, segment restructuring and a booming Aerospace segment. A positive trend in estimate revisions also reflects optimism over the company’s prospects. However, currency volatility and escalating steel prices remain headwinds.The maker of engineered and applied products, with a market capitalization of approximately $1.13 billion, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 5%.Below, we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring TriMasNorthbound EstimatesOver the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and the current quarter has moved up around 5.6% and 11.8%, respectively.Value Growth Momentum (VGM) ScoreTriMas currently has a Zacks VGM Score of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. The VGM Score of A, along with some other key metrics, makes the company a solid choice for investors.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryTriMas surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.78%Price PerformanceTriMas has outperformed its industry with respect to price performance over the past year. The stock has appreciated around 18.2% while the industry has recorded growth of 0.5% during the same time frame.Return on Assets (ROA)TriMas currently has a ROA of 6.1% while the industry's ROA is 3.2%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets.Growth Drivers in PlaceTriMas will gain from its continuous focus on leveraging the TriMas Business Model. Its innovative solutions through product, process or service, as well as extensive resources will help strengthen business.Further, the company remains focused on realignment actions and improvement of cost structure. Accordingly, TriMas will combine the company’s Engineered Components and Energy segments into a single reporting segment — Specialty Products. The company will report results under the new segment structure from first-quarter 2018. TriMas expects the new segment to attain sales growth of nearly 5% in 2018.Moreover, its Aerospace segment benefitted in 2017 from increased production throughput and deliveries as well as solid order demand. Recently, TriMas’ Monogram Aerospace Fasteners business was awarded a 2017 Supply Chain & Quality Improvement award by Airbus due to its significant efforts to improve quality and on-time delivery, and commitment to deliver outstanding service to customers. Thus, the company continues to see more stable order patterns from customers, which will result in further opportunities for improved manufacturing efficiencies over time.HeadwindsA stronger dollar makes TriMas’ product exports more difficult and translation impacts also hamper the company’s packaging and energy businesses sales in Europe and the U.K. Thus, strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies will affect the company’s performance.In addition, steel being the main input material to produce high-pressure cylinders, escalation in its prices has been denting TriMas’ Norris business. Steel prices will continue flaring up through the first and second quarters of 2018 due to seasonal demand. The company expects prices to remain higher on average than the prior year.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Allegion PLC (ALLE  -  Free Report), AptarGroup, Inc. (ATR  -  Free Report) and Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report). While Allegion sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), AptarGroup and Avery Dennison carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

17,AVY,"Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) has been on a bit of a cold streak lately, but there might be light at the end of the tunnel for this overlooked stock. And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at AVY given that, according to its RSI reading of 28.84, it is now in oversold territory.What is RSI? RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Other FactorsYet, AVY’s low RSI value isn’t the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to Avery Dennison’s earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 4 earnings estimate revisions move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for AVY has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $5.46/share two months ago to just $5.88/share right now. If this wasn’t enough, Avery Dennison also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which puts it into rare company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider getting in on this stock now (or holding on), as there are some favorable trends that could bubble up for this stock before long.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes """"All In"""" on This Stock Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

19,AVY,"Volatility and uncertainty in the stock market have raised the appeal of dividend growth stocks. Trump’s massive tax cut is also attracting investors to these stocks. This is because lower corporate taxes would boost companies’ profitability leading to fatty dividends and in turn lead to outperformance of stocks that have a history of year-over-year dividend growth.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future.Moreover, a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields. Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields, they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend-paying stock.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow.

Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Above the Industry: Silgan Holdings’ shares have outperformed the industry with respect to price performance over the past six months. The company’s shares have lost around 0.4%, while the industry incurred a loss of 0.9% during the same time frame. Upward Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for 2018 has moved up 11% to $2.09 in the last 60 days. The same for 2019 has gone up 9% to $2.24 during the same time frame.Superior Return on Assets (ROA): Silgan Holdings’ ROA of 5.3%, as compared with the industry average of 4.1%, highlights the company’s efficiency in generating earnings by effectively managing assets.Upbeat Guidance: For 2018, Silgan Holdings guided adjusted earnings per share in the range of $2.03-$2.13.

For first-quarter 2018, the company initiated a guidance range of 32-36 cents for adjusted earnings per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of around 10%.

21,AVY,"Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) CEO Jeff Bezos topped the recently announced Forbes 2018 Billionaires list for the first time. Per Forbes, Bezos is worth $112 billion, up $39.2 billion from 2017, the biggest one-year gain in the list’s history.Amazon’s strong share price movement driven by impressive performance has been a key catalyst behind the massive rise in Bezos’ wealth. Amazon carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has returned 81.6% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s rally of 66.5%.Growth Prospects RobustAmazon is primarily benefiting from sustained momentum in Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and its ubiquitous presence in retail. AWS generates much higher margins than retail, positively impacting Amazon’s profitability.  Moreover, the retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice and convenience. Moreover, the Whole Foods acquisition has helped the company rapidly penetrate the grocery segment of the brick-and-mortar stores. Further, increasing number of paid Prime members is positive.Additionally, we believe that Amazon’s strategy of diversifying footprint into healthcare and financial services bodes well for its CEO and shareholders in the long haul.Better Choices ExistAlthough entrepreneurship is the best possible way to become a centibillionaire like Jeff Bezos, it is not everyone’s forte.

31,AVY,"Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 31 before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company recorded year-over-year improvement in both its top and bottom lines. Further, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.1% in the last reported quarter. It is worth noting that Avery Dennison has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.9%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Avery Dennison Corporation price-eps-surprise | Avery Dennison Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayAvery Dennison’s Label and Graphic Materials segment is the largest and highest-return business. The segment will benefit from growth in emerging market regions including high-single digit growth in India and China. Moreover, recently announced selling price increases should benefit the profitability in the fourth quarter. In the Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, the company will continue to witness solid organic growth for both the industrial and the health care categories. The segment will also gain from the Yongle, Finesse and Mactac acquisitions. Further, focus on efforts to drive productivity, while continuing to invest to support growth will support margins in the to-be-reported quarter. The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment continues to perform well on the back of business model transformation. This has enabled it to gain share market share, while driving significant margin expansion. Avery Dennison has increased the segment’s competitiveness through strategic pricing initiatives. Margins are likely to improve exhibiting the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volume. Growing adoption of RFID (Radio-frequency identification) by retailers due to growth of omni-channel retailing as well as the requirement to locate inventories at all times is fueling demand. Consequently, RFID sales, which increased a substantial 25% year over year in the third quarter, will continue to boost the segment’s sales in the next quarter as well. Meanwhile, modest sequential raw material inflation will hinder Avery Dennison’s fourth-quarter performance. Further, higher debt levels following the Yongle and Finesse acquisitions remain a concern. Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at $1.25, reflecting year-over-year growth of 26.3%. The estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.7 billion, projecting a 9.8% year-over-year climb. Focus on productivity, acquisitions, aggressive cost control and share repurchases will drive the results. Moreover, its consistent execution of strategies continues to enhance competitive advantage while driving profitable growth.  Further, Avery Dennison’s shares have outperformed the industry’s performance in the past year. The stock has gained 62.7%, compared with the industry's growth of 51.8%. Here’s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Avery Dennison in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.25. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Avery Dennison carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks Worth a Look Here are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.65% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Deere’s shares have surged 58% in the past year. iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its shares have gone up 53% in a year’s time. The Earnings ESP for Graphic Packaging Holding Company (GPK  -  Free Report) is +0.52%. It carries a Zacks Rank #2. Shares of Graphic Packaging have surged 32% in a year’s time. Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read This The most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more. Those gains, however, came with serious volatility and risk. Bitcoin sank 25% or more 3 times in 2017. Zacks’ has just released a new Special Report to help readers capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly. See 4 crypto-related stocks now >>

Deere has also outperformed the industry’s gain of 40.3% during the same time frame with respect to price performance.Favorable Rank & Style ScoreInvestors are optimistic on this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, backed by Deere’s strong order activity, anticipated acquisition of Wirtgen Group and promising U.S. GDP growth.Further, Deere has an impressive VGM Score of B. In this V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score eliminates the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.Our research shows that stocks with Style Scores of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3, offer the best investment opportunities.What Led to the 52-week High?Deere’s shares have gained nearly 7% since it reported fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Nov 22. Its earnings surged around 74% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales of equipment operations also climbed 26% year over year.Notably, Deere’s Agriculture & Turf segment sales, comprising 77% of revenues, rose 22% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, primarily due to higher volumes and a favorable sales mix. In addition, the Construction & Forestry segment’s sales improved 37% year over year attributable to higher volumes, better price realization, and favorable foreign exchange currency hedging.Deere projects total equipment sales to be up nearly 38% year over year in first-quarter fiscal 2018 and 22% in fiscal 2018 compared with the year-ago periods. For fiscal 2018, the company guides net sales to rise roughly 19% year over year, and projects net income of about $2.6 billion.Further, the construction investment is forecast to grow in 2018, led by oil and gas, and residential activity. Oil prices are expected to be above $50, which is important since oil and gas-related activity tends to slow when oil prices are below $50 and picks up when prices are above that level. Additionally, machinery rental utilization rates continue to improve and rental pricing is also gaining traction.Deere’s strong order activity in both early-order programs for seasonal products and order book for large tractors also supports the outlook. Its upbeat outlook is also backed by U.S. GDP, which is anticipated to be up 2.5% in fiscal 2018. Also, crude oil prices are expected to rise, which will encourage crude oil production and improve construction equipment demand.Wirtgen Acquisition to be a Growth DriverDeere expects the acquisition of the Wirtgen Group to close in December 2017. The buyout is expected to contribute about $3.1 billion in net sales in fiscal 2018. Wirtgen is likely to add about 12% to Deere's sales for the fiscal year and about 6% for the fiscal first quarter in comparison with fiscal 2017. After estimating expenses for purchase accounting and transaction costs, Wirtgen is expected to contribute about $75 million to operating profit and about $25 million to net income in fiscal 2018.Upward Estimate RevisionsFurthermore, Deere’s positive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company’s potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead. Estimates for Deere have moved up over the past seven days, reflecting analysts’ bullish sentiments. The earnings estimate for fiscal 2018 has gone up 4.7%, while that of fiscal 2019 moved up 6%.Deere & Company Price and Consensus  Deere & Company Price and Consensus | Deere & Company QuoteThe above-mentioned tailwinds raised investors’ optimism on the stock and are anticipated to boost the company’s share price in the days ahead.Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include Caterpillar Inc.

40,AVY,"The third-quarter earnings season is drawing to an end, with 470 S&P members that represent almost 96.2% of the index’s total market capitalization, having reported their numbers. Of these, 72.3% beat EPS estimates. Earnings are up 6.6% year over year. Among the sectors, Energy, Industrial Products, Technology, Construction, Business Services and Medical sectors fared well in the quarter.The machinery industry falls under Industrial Products sector, which reported 16.7% earnings growth in the quarter. A few companies in the sector are yet to report. Earnings are expected to grow 18.7% in the quarter, almost in line with second quarter’s earnings growth of 18.8%.The sector’s performance in the third quarter was backed by increased infrastructure spending and upbeat economic data. An improving global economy was also a catalyst. Also, investment in equipment continues to rise. However, the sector was adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions arising from factory infrastructure damages caused by two back-to-back hurricanes, Harvey and Irma. We believe that declining unemployment rate, improving consumer spending and stabilizing oil prices will support growth of the industrial sector going forward.Driving Factors in DetailIndustrial production, one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks, rose 0.9% in October. Manufacturing increased 1.3% while mining output fell 1.3%, as Hurricane Nate caused a short-term decline in oil and gas drilling and extraction. Industrial activity rose in October as normal operations resumed after hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit production in September and October. Also, industrial production grew 2.9% over the past 12 months, which bodes well for machinery stocks.Further, the national factory activity index reading of 60.8 in September rose from 58.8 in August. It also exceeded market expectations of 58. A reading above 50 indicates increased factory activity.According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. GDP improved at an annual rate of 3% in third-quarter 2017. An increase in inventory investment and lower trade deficit offset a hurricane-related slowdown in consumer spending and a decline in construction.Also, the U.S Architecture Billings Index (ABI), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to 12 month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 51.7 in October, up from 49.1 in the previous month and representing sustainable growth in architectural activity.According to the ADP National Employment Report, private companies created 235,000 jobs in October, reflecting resurgence in construction jobs. The manufacturing industry created 22,000 jobs, while the construction industry created the highest — 62,000 jobs — in the private sector.Sneak Peek at How Some Machinery Stocks Fared in Q3The world's largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) posted upbeat results for the third quarter led by strong demand for its construction equipment in North America and robust sales in China.Another construction and mining related equipment maker, Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report) recorded a year-over-year surge in sales in the third quarter on improved sales and backlog growth.Leading manufacturer of cranes and lift solutions The Manitowoc Company, Inc. (MTW  -  Free Report) posted earnings in the third quarter, a reversal from its prior-year quarter’s loss driven by order growth backed by improvement in U.S. energy and commercial construction markets.Upbeat ProjectionsPer our projections, the Industrial Products sector’s earnings are expected to further accelerate in the fourth quarter with 20.5% growth. Earnings are expected to grow 12.1% in first-quarter 2018, 12.8% in the second quarter and 9.7% in third-quarter 2018. (Read more: Plenty of Positive Retail Surprises).We note that the sector is currently placed at the top 31% out of the 16 Zacks Sectors. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Sector Rank).This sector has also been outperforming the S&P 500 market in recent times. Year to date, the sector has gained around 54.1%, above the S&P 500 index’s growth of 16.5%.Therefore, we believe investors will benefit by grabbing industrial stocks, as the sector is likely to perform better in the near term.How to Make the Right Choice?Will it be prudent to invest on any industrial stock?

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tetra Tech, Inc.

Per the Navigation Technical Assistance Contract II (“NAVTAC II”), the company will offer technical support services for research, planning, implementation, maintenance as well as decommissioning of the FAA’s landing, navigation and lighting systems.This apart, during the reported quarter, the company acquired leading sustainable infrastructure design firm, Glumac, which would broaden the company’s high-end sustainable infrastructure design capabilities.

Going forward, the company’s robust backlog levels signal bright days ahead. Based on continued execution of its business model, Tetra Tech remains bullish about its growth across all four client sectors, namely, U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, the U.S. commercial work and finally international.The company believes that the solid pipeline of projects in the Department of Defense and development-related services, in the United States will continue to propel growth of its federal business. Going forward, we believe Tetra Tech has a solid base for future growth, driven by its strong backlog levels, plus a robust pipeline with major government organizations like the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Army Corp. of Engineers and U.S. Air Force awarding it billion-dollar deals.However, demand for the company’s services is cyclical, and vulnerable to economic downturns and reductions in the government and private industry spending.Tetra Tech currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering in the same space include Alamo Group, Inc.

The company expects the segment to exhibit strong profitability and solid sales growth in the near term. The segment benefited in the second quarter, driven by acquisitions, offset by timing issues and challenging comparison. The company remains confident to post roughly 4% organic growth for the segment in third-quarter 2017.Avery Dennison completed the acquisitions of Yongle -- an industrial tapes business in China that serves global markets -- in June 2017. Onetime transition costs related to this buyout will have a meaningful impact on margins in the Industrial and Healthcare Materials (IHM) segment in the third quarter.In the Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment (RBIS), Avery Dennison enhanced the segment’s competitiveness through strategic pricing initiatives. The segment’s operating margin improved in the second quarter, indicating the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volume. Avery Dennison anticipates continued margin expansion in the segment in the back half of the year, led by business model transformation and benefit from the reduction in amortization.Moreover, the company anticipates sequentially stronger sales growth, both ex-currency and organically, with healthy profitability into the second half of the year. However, raw material inflation and negative impact of foreign currency translation will thwart Avery Dennison’s third-quarter performance.Further, Avery Dennison’s shares have underperformed the industry’s performance over the past year.

46,AVY,"Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) has an impressive earnings history having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with an average beat of 6.1%. Further, the company is expected to perform well on the bottom-line front in the 2017 backed by aggressive cost cutting and restructuring efforts as part of the current optimization program, despite raw material inflation.The company’s consistent execution of strategies continues to enhance competitive advantage, while driving profitable growth and improving returns. Currently, the producer of pressure-sensitive materials, and a variety of tickets, tags, labels and other converted products, carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Here's why investors should hold on to the stock at present.Earnings Estimate RevisionsPositive estimate revisions reflect optimism in the company’s potential, as earnings growth is often an indication of robust prospects (and stock price gains) ahead. Estimates for Avery Dennison have moved up in the past 60 days, reflecting analysts’ bullish outlook. The earnings estimate for 2017 has gone up 1% for both 2017 and 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for fiscal 2017 reflects a year-over-year growth of 20.2% and for fiscal 2018 projects growth of 8.5%. Further, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 7% holds promise.Price Performance The company outperformed the industry  it belongs to in the past year. The stock has gained 26.0% while the industry rose 24.5%.Return on Assets (ROA)Avery Dennison currently has a ROA of 8.4% while the industry's ROE is 6.9%. An above-average ROA denotes that the company is generating earnings by effectively managing assets.Value Growth Momentum (VGM) ScoreIn aggregate, Avery Dennison currently has a VGM score of A.

In the past four years, the business has consistently generated organic growth within its targeted range of 4-5%. The segment will benefit from growth in emerging market regions including high-single-digit growth in India and China.

Adoption trends remain favorable and RFID (Radio-frequency identification), which should grow more than 20% annually for the next few years. The company will continue to increase the pace of investment to leverage specialty labels, graphics, and reflective solutions business, as demonstrated by recent acquisitions. Avery Dennison’s balance sheet remains strong and has ample capacity to continue funding buyouts, as well as returning cash to shareholders.Bottom LineInvestors might want to hold on to the stock at present as it has ample positive prospects of outperforming peers in the near future.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industrial product space include Lawson Products, Inc. (LAWS  -  Free Report), Komatsu Ltd. (KMTUY  -  Free Report) and AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report).

47,AVY,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with third-quarter 2017 results. Although the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, net sales surpassed the same and grew 9.9% year over year. The company is anticipated to continue the momentum on the back of recent optimistic order trends and recovering end markets. Emerson Electric raised earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 in the last quarterly report, reflecting these  catalysts.We believe an outstanding performance in the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions bode well for growth for rest of the fiscal year. Further, the company, which has a strong foothold in a diversified global manufacturing and technology industry, has several growth drivers working in its favor. Read on to find out the key drivers for this company right now.Existing Business ScenariosEmerson Electric experienced impressive revenue growth in the third quarter, driven by sound performance from the Automation Solutions backed by robust, broad-based demand in power, life sciences and chemical markets. Moreover, the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform experienced 7% increase in net and underlying sales, supported by robust demand in global HVAC and refrigeration markets.In light of the strong momentum, Emerson Electric anticipates net sales for the year to grow about 5% compared with prior projections of flat net sales.Recently, the company has reshuffled and streamlined businesses, which will optimize operational structure and bolster profits. Favorable trends in power and life sciences are expected to boost growth for the company. Emerson Electric’s small bolt-on and strategic acquisitions has also aided it to secure a place in the core market and grab greater market share. In the last few months, the company completed acquisitions of Pentair Valves & Controls, Locus Traxx, Blending & Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies and PakSense. We believe these buyouts will supplement the company’s top-line performance, going forward.However, the company’s operations have been suffering as a result of slow spending in general industrial markets. This has affected the company’s order rates across the related segments and pulled down the sales figure. The company’s Industrial Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging and any improvements that Emerson anticipated did not materialize, consequently creating pressure.The industrial products sector is highly competitive; dominated by several multinational; behemoths like Emerson, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (AIT  -  Free Report), Barnes Group, Inc. (B  -  Free Report) and Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report). In order to boost competency Emerson makes expensive research and development investments. However, this increases its aggregate debt burden moving ahead.Further, the company believes that sluggish economic conditions and prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets may take a turn for the worse due to global economic uncertainty. Such tough economic conditions and dwindling order rates do not bode well for the company, thereby adding to the company’s challenges.Considering the growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we believe its focus on business streamlining along with positive trends in certain business areas offer Emerson Electric modest growth opportunities.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

50,AVY,"The United States was recently devastated by two back-to-back hurricanes — Harvey and Irma — one being Category 4 and the other Category 5. These deadly storms wreaked havoc across Texas and Florida causing widespread damages to life and property, once again proving the vulnerability of human life.To add to the woes, the hurricanes caused incessant rainfall, resulting in severe floods that crippled transportation facilities and inundated vast tracts of agricultural fields. All these events cumulatively eroded significant wealth from the economy and impacted near-term growth momentum of the country.Possible Economic ImpactIt is probably too early to quote the full extent of the collateral damages due to these hurricanes, as the economic costs associated with them are still rolling in and are expected to climb further. However, several experts and analysts have put forth certain estimates based on their individual calculation. According to the preliminary estimates by Moody’s Analytics, Harvey and Irma together caused between $150 billion and $200 billion in damages to homes and furnishings, vehicles, commercial real estate, and public infrastructure. This is comparable to the loss due to Hurricane Katrina — another deadly hurricane that ravaged the country in 2005.Joel Meyers, the President of AccuWeather, however, believes that the hurricanes collectively cost the public exchequer to the tune of $290 billion, which equates to about 1.5% of the gross domestic product of the country. He further opined that the catastrophic storms were likely to contract the growth momentum of the country in the third quarter as subsequent rebuilding consumes further resources.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs pegs the individual losses at $30 billion and $85 billion for Irma and Harvey, respectively. According to Goldman, Hurricane Irma was the 10th most impactful natural disaster in the United States, affecting approximately 6.1% of the populace. With pervasive devastations, the firm currently anticipates third-quarter GDP to contract 0.8 percentage points to about 2%.How to Profit During This Challenging TimeDespite the initial setbacks, the U.S. equity markets scaled near record highs in the aftermath of the hurricanes as investors regained their appetite for riskier bets like equities, courtesy of strengthening dollar and sell-off in global bond markets. As the country focuses on its rebuilding efforts, the Industrial Products sector is likely to immensely benefit from continuous investments in infrastructure related assets.In addition, riding on the government’s proposed $1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement, the Industrial Products sector has gained 11.3% year to date. Other factors like the steadily improving housing, automotive and commercial construction markets as well as uptick in new job additions augur well for the industry. Consequently, investors can expect to profit by focusing on some prized stocks from this sector that are driven by solid fundamentals.4 Industrial Stocks to BenefitIn order to select the best stocks from the sector, we have screened for stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with a VGM Score of A or B and average return on equity for the trailing four quarters in excess of 20. Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Allegion is a leading global provider of security products and solutions for business and domestic purposes. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. With a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.8%, Allegion boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 198.3.Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Perrysburg, OH, Owens-Illinois offers glass containers to food and beverage manufacturers across the world. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. With a modest long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.7%, the firm boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 72.2.Avery Dennison Corp. (AVY  -  Free Report): Headquartered in Glendale, CA, Avery Dennison produces pressure-sensitive materials, and a variety of tickets, tags, labels and other converted products. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. With a decent long-term earnings growth expectation of 7%, Avery Dennison boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 39.3.Ituran Location and Control Ltd. : headquartered in Azor, Israel, Ituran Location provides location-based services and wireless communications products in Israel, Brazil, Argentina, and the United States. This Zacks Rank #2 stock has a VGM Score of B. Ituran Location boasts an average return on equity in the trailing four quarters of 36.1.Moving ForwardSpencer Hill, an economist at Goldman, observed, ""We believe the huge property losses and relatively broad-based societal footprints of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma suggest a relatively large impact on near-term growth."" Amid such a scenario, investors can expect to gain by investing in the above-mentioned industrial products stocks that have a healthy return on investment along with some solid fundamental strength.

51,AVY,"On Sep 8, we issued an updated research report on Greif, Inc. (GEF  -  Free Report) — producer of industrial packaging products and services. The company is likely to benefit from its Transformation plan, sale of non-core assets and improving investment. However, the adverse impact of Hurricane Harvey and inflationary raw-material costs remain major headwinds.Notably, Greif announced its long-term financial targets. The company remains on track to attain its 2017 transformation commitments and is confident about the consistent execution of this strategy. It also anticipates fiscal 2017 results to benefit from the execution of transformation efforts.The company has been successful in fixing its under-performing businesses, as well as divesting non-core assets and closed facilities, which will drive long-term performance. During the nine-month period ended Jul 31, 2017, Greif completed one divestiture, deconsolidated two non-strategic businesses, and liquidated one non-U.S. non-strategic business. The company completed one material divestiture in the Rigid Industrial Packaging & Services segment during third-quarter fiscal 2017.In addition, Greif is investing in the new IBC capabilities in Texas. The company is also building a new steel plant in Russia. Further, it is investing in the new triple wall line in Louisville. Its IBC investment in Germany and Jubail steel plant will likely fuel inorganic growth. Moreover, these investments will boost the company’s overall performance going forward.However, Greif slashed its fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance due to the timing of raw material price adjustment mechanisms in customer contracts and headwind impact related to Hurricane Harvey. Further, Greif remains doubtful about achieving its objective of flat operating working capital dollars year-over-year in fiscal 2017 due to the escalating raw material costs.It should be noted that the company has outperformed the industry in the last year. While shares of the company have gained 19%, the industry has registered 7.5% growth in the same period.Currently, Greif carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the industrial product space are Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) and AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

52,AVY,"Per a Bloomberg report, packaging products-maker Bemis Company Inc. (BMS  -  Free Report) is the takeover target of Australian company, Amcor Limited. Following the report, Bemis’ shares surged 10% to close at $46.90 on Sep 7.  Amcor is working with advisers in order to prepare a bid for Neenah, WI-based Bemis, which has a current market capitalization of $4.47 billion. The company offers multilayer polymer, blown and cast film structures as well as injection molded plastic and folding carton packaging products. Its products are utilized in producing packaging for food, medical, pharmaceutical, personal care, electronics, and industrial applications. It sells its products through direct sales force in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Is Bemis Worth a Takeover Bid? Bemis’s recent results were nothing to write home about. In the first half of 2017, the company’s earnings declined 17%. In both the quarters of 2017, Bemis’ earnings failed to match the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the trailing four quarters, the company has posted a negative average earnings surprise of 5.89%. During second-quarter conference call, Bemis lowered 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $2.35-$2.50 from the prior range of $2.50-$2.60, citing the impact of sharp contraction and tough economic environment in Brazil. The mid-point of the guidance reflects a year-over-year decline of 10%. The estimates for third-quarter 2017, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018, have moved south in the past 30 days, reflecting the negative outlook of analysts. For the third quarter, the estimate has gone down 11% to 64 cents per share. For fiscal 2017, the estimate has dipped 6% to $2.40 in the past 30 days. For fiscal 2018, the estimate has gone down 6% to $2.67 per share.During March, certain of Bemis’ large U.S. core consumer packaged goods customers lowered volume projections for the balance of 2017. These lower volumes, along with the operational inefficiencies associated with the lower volumes, will impact Bemis’ sales and earnings for 2017. Further, the political instability and challenging economic environment in Brazil continues to impact business. In June, Bemis announced details about its restructuring and cost savings plan to improve profitability, primarily in the U.S. and Latin American businesses by reducing manufacturing and administrative cost structure. These efforts are likely to generate total cost savings of $55–$60 million, with savings starting in 2017 and fully realized during 2019. In the past year, its shares have declined 4.5% in contrast with 9.3% rise recorded by the industry. The company continues to bear the brunt of a flat-to-declining U.S. packaged food market. In eight of the past nine years, volumes in the core flexible packaging business have been flat to down as Bemis continues to struggle within a complex supply chain. The stock price underperformance could make shareholders welcome an offer by Amcor. Bemis is currently trading at a forward 12-month Enterprise Value/ EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio of 10.3 while the industry’s 12-month forward EV/EBITDA ratio is pegged higher at 12.4. This implies that the stock is cheap at current levels. Manifold Benefits to Amcor Amcor Limited provides packaging solutions in Western Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and internationally.

53,AVY,"August witnessed the strongest manufacturing activity in more than six years, according to the latest report by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Such an upbeat reading comes at an opportune time when manufacturers have added a record number of jobs, both in the private and public sectors.This boost in jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector, is reflective of one of the Trump administration’s key campaign promises. In fact, Trump’s plan of comprehensive tax reform should help U.S. manufacturers create more jobs. With this in mind, adding stocks from the manufacturing sector could be a lucrative move for your portfolioISM Manufacturing Highest in 6 YearsThe ISM Manufacturing Index by 2.5% to 58.8% in August, up from July's level of 56.3% and representing the highest level recorded since April 2011.Out of the 18 manufacturing industries, 14 have registered growth. Investors should note that the five key indicators that are monitored by the ISM Manufacturing Index are new orders, production, employment, inventories and supplier deliveries. Although the index for new orders decreased 0.1% to 60.3%, the employment index jumped 4.7% to 59.9% — the highest in more than six years; the production index improved 0.4% to 61% as well.The ramping up of manufacturing activity shows increased raw material purchase by managers to meet heightened demand.Index Shows Growth in U.S. EconomyData provided by the Institute for Supply Management clearly shows that the manufacturing index has been well above 50% over the past 12 months. As per the non-profit organization, if the index is more than 43.3% through a length of time, it hints at an expanding economy.The U.S. economy grew at the fastest pace during the April-to-June quarter of 2017 in more than two years. During the second quarter, the market witnessed 3% improvement in gross domestic product (GDP) – revised upward from the first estimate of 2.6% – against only a 1.2% increment in the prior quarter. The improvement in the economy was mainly supported by strong business investments.Further, favorable business spending and retail sales data have led most economists to predict that the U.S. economy will maintain a growth pace of more than 3% in the third quarter.Manufacturing Jobs CreatedAccording to the ADP National Employment Report, private companies created 237,000 jobs in August, marking the best pace since March. The broader manufacturing industry, which created 16,000 jobs, produced record employment in the private sector.Additionally, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that non-firm payroll for the month of August increased by 156,000. Manufacturing firms created 36,000 new jobs in the United States, the highest monthly job addition in five years.Growth in manufacturing sector employment is in line with Trump’s electoral promises and immediate actions on assuming office. During his campaign, the president had promised to improve the manufacturing industry by creating jobs through a combination of higher infrastructure spending, tax cuts, and deregulation. And recently, President Trump asked members of Congress to pass a bill to slash business and personal tax rates in order to do just that.Our ChoicesThe latest reading of the ISM manufacturing index reinforces the view that manufacturing activities are growing at a rapid pace and are likely to expand in the days ahead. Significant job creation by manufacturers, along with Trump’s promises and actions, are likely to support the trend.Picking manufacturing stocks seems to be a smart option at this moment.

54,AVY,"On Aug 24, premium industrial equipment wholesaler Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.  (AIT  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #2 have strong chances of performing better than the broader market, moving ahead.Reasons Behind the UpswingShares of Applied Industrial yielded a return of 16.7%, outperforming 10.4% growth recorded by the sector, in a year’s time.Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable Value Growth Momentum Score ‘A’.Applied Industrial’s revenues and profitability have been improving since the beginning of second-half of fiscal 2017 (January-June 2017). In fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the company’s organic top-line growth came in at 7.9%. This upside was stemmed by elevated sales in the upstream oil and gas segments, as well as robust performance of the fluid power businesses in the United States. The company believes that these positives would continue to bolster its revenues even in fiscal 2018 (ending June 2018). Notably, top-line growth is anticipated to be within the range of 3-5% for the current fiscal.Applied Industrial boosts its financials on the back of strategic acquisitions. For instance, the buyout of Sentinel Fluid Controls (March 2017) would likely reinforce the company’s Fluid Power business, moving ahead. Sentinel Fluid Controls offers non-imitable custom, mobile, standard and industrial, hydraulic and lubrication systems.Apart from strong revenues, Applied Industrial’s near-term margins are anticipated to improve on the back of disciplined cost management, increased productivity and new enterprise resource planning investments. In order to bring down operational costs and align productive resources with existing opportunities, customer demand and market conditions, the company implemented numerous restructuring programs (especially in the upstream oil and gas businesses) in fiscal 2017.Applied Industrial is also highly committed toward returning value to its shareholders through lucrative dividend payments and share buyback offers. Over the last four years, the company repurchased shares worth nearly $159 million and lowered average shares outstanding by more than 8% to 39.4 million common stock as of the end of fiscal 2017. Furthermore, the company intends to buy back shares worth $10-$15 million in each quarter of fiscal 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock has moved north for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, in a month’s time, reflecting positive market sentiments.  Other Stocks to ConsiderOther top-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, generated an average positive earnings surprise of 39.70% over the trailing four quarters.

However, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents and came within management’s guidance range of 67–73 cents.The bottom line was negatively impacted by lower volume/mix, inflated operating costs and higher taxes.

Gross margin contracted 110 basis points (bps) year over year to 19% hurt by lower volume/mix and higher raw material prices, partially offset by manufacturing productivity gains.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $157 million, up 24% year over year, chiefly due to lump sum pension settlements, acquisition and acquisition-related costs and wage inflation. Lower management incentives were a minor neutralizing factor. Sonoco’s adjusted operating income was $78.7 million in the quarter, down 32% from $115 million in the prior-year quarter.

61,AVY,"The producer of pressure-sensitive and functional materials and labeling solutions for the retail apparel market, Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report), is set to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.The company’s financial performance over the last four quarters was impressive, witnessing better-than-expected results in each. Average earnings surprise was a positive 5.53%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.11 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.73%.Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Avery Dennison Corporation QuoteWe believe that its constant focus on execution of strategies, sound financial performance and growth opportunities have lifted investor sentiments for Avery Dennison. In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 29% return, outperforming growth of 22.3% recorded by industry it belongs to.Let us see whether Avery Dennison will be able to maintain its earnings streak this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Avery Dennison is likely to beat estimates in the second quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Avery Dennison has an ESP of +1.68%, with the Most Accurate estimate of $1.21 exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19.Zacks Rank: Avery Dennison’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sellrated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.What’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Avery Dennison’s execution of strategies continues to enhance its competitive advantage, while driving profitable growth and improving returns. The company’s effort to reduce complexity, focus on cost structure, and use of lower-cost locally sourced materials that will support more competitive pricing, will boost its margin performance in the quarter to be reported.Though Avery Dennison anticipates some sequential raw material inflation in second-quarter 2017, consistent focus on productivity will drive results.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Belden Inc.

62,AVY,"iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 25.Over the trailing four quarters, the company recorded a positive average earnings surprise of 61.72%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Existing ScenarioOver the last three months, iRobot’s shares yielded a return of 22.73%, outperforming 8.38% growth recorded by the industry.Increased market penetration of popular home robotic products (like Roomba 900) will likely bolster iRobot’s revenues across all major end-markets located in China, Japan and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Moreover, sturdy market response of wi-fi enabled Roomba 690 and Roomba 890 robots (launched in May 2, 2017) is anticipated to boost sales in the to-be-reported quarter.In addition, the company believes that the capital allocation program which is aimed at enhancing its competency in the field of robotic vacuum cleaning market, tap demand of Chinese robotic floor care market, reinforce the existing business infrastructure, innovate non-floor care home robotic products and lower operational costs will likely drive iRobot’s top- and bottom-line growth in the quarter to be reported.However, we expect that the benefits generated by the aforementioned growth drivers might be offset by certain headwinds within the market. For instance, almost all the contract manufacturers of iRobot’s home robotic products belong to China. These producers provide basic raw inputs, labor resources and several other types of facilities to iRobot. If these dealers suddenly terminate their contract with the company or fail to offer good quality products on time, iRobot would fail to deliver innovative home robotics products in the market.Furthermore, a stronger U.S. dollar, sudden input price inflation or extensive industry rivalry might dent the company’s revenues and profitability in the second quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that iRobot will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.Zacks ESP: iRobot currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate estimate are both pegged at loss of 25 cents.iRobot Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  iRobot Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | iRobot Corporation QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: iRobot carries a favorable Zacks Rank #3. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.

You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  United Technologies Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: United Technologies’ Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a positive ESP makes surprise prediction likely.Note we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Results?On Mar 27, 2017, Automated Logic Corporation, part of a United Technologies unit collaborated with Lucid, to create the next generation of EnergyReports energy analysis and reporting tool. Per the deal, the new EnergyReports tool will combine building data from ALC's powerful WebCTRL building automation system with Lucid's industry-leading BuildingOS cloud-based energy management platform.

This deal highlights the company’s commitment with the defence forces to provide best in class services. It looks forward to retrofit these 12 aircraft and helping the U.S. National Guard accomplish missions without any hindrance.The company continued to secure various deals across all of its segments, which will have a positive impact on its revenues. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and continuous investments in the aerospace segment, the company expects to generate significant cash from operations to reward its shareholders with a risk-adjusted return.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:The CIT Group Inc.

It forms an integral part of the communication industry and is highly competitive in nature. Headwinds in the currency market have left investors a little edgy about what the quarter holds for them.Factors to ConsiderInterpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage. The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the coming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration and integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, it continues to look for strategic investments and acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.Moving ahead, the company plans to focus on de-leveraging and improving its balance sheet and reducing effective cost of debt. The Group’s best-in-industry talent and tools are expected to offer optimal and affordable solutions, thus providing an edge over its peers.  The company’s efforts to reduce costs, improve margin, create stronger balance sheet and better capital structure aid in increasing returns and profitability.During the quarter, the company announced that it had elevated five senior leaders into new roles to deliver more integrated client services across the firm's North America markets. This transformation in the company’s management will help it function more efficiently across North America. In turn, this will help the company augment its revenue turnover using the expertise of its management.However, the company forms part of the communications industry, which is highly competitive in nature. Agencies and media services compete with other agencies and creative or media services providers to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Also, keeping in view the service-oriented nature of the whole industry, it becomes imperative for the company to increase the count of talented employees as well as retain the existing ones.

67,AVY,"Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce second-quarter 2017 earnings report before the opening bell on Jul 25.The company had a stellar first-quarter delivering year-over-year improvement in both the top line and bottom line for the first time in 10 quarters. The better-than-expected results came on the back of its incessant efforts to cut down costs to counter the impact of low-end user demand across many of its businesses.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Caterpillar is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), which have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Zacks ESP: Caterpillar’s Earnings ESP is +4.92% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.28 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22. A positive ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Caterpillar carries a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of the company’s favorable Zacks Rank with a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.Notably, the stocks having a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Surprise HistoryCaterpillar, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseCaterpillar, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Caterpillar, Inc. QuoteIn the last quarter, Caterpillar’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 106.45%. Going by the earnings surprise history, Caterpillar beat estimates in the trailing four quarters, leading to an overall positive average surprise of 40.25%.What's Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?At the end of first-quarter 2017, Caterpillar’s backlog was $14.8 billion, a $2.7 billion improvement driven by improvement across all segments. Notably, this was the first year-over-year expansion in backlog since third-quarter 2014 and at the highest level since second-quarter 2015. This bodes well for second-quarter performance.Caterpillar reported a 1% rise in April sales followed by an 8% growth in May, driven by the continuing improvement in Asia Pacific, particularly in Resource Industries. The Asia Pacific region has delivered consistent growth in sales since Aug 2016. Construction Industries has also shown marked improvement in the region. Asia Pacific sales continue to increase primarily owing to increased infrastructure and residential investment in China.Also in the U.S, leading indicators of non-residential construction signal robust conditions ahead for the domestic construction industry. The ABI has been at 50 or better for 20 of the last 24 months indicating sustainable growth in architectural activity. This will aid Caterpillar’s performance in the second quarter.Additionally, Caterpillar’s ongoing significant restructuring and cost reduction initiative that include consolidation or closure of facilities, laying off employees will help boost margins.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, the Caterpillar stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized Machinery – Construction/Mining industry.

However, this is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Sonoco has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 71 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sonoco carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.Importantly, the Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Surprise HistorySonoco Products Company Price and EPS Surprise  Sonoco Products Company Price and EPS Surprise | Sonoco Products Company QuoteIn the last reported quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.51%. Sonoco has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.79%.Factors at PlayFor second-quarter 2017, the company anticipates earnings per share in the range of 69–73 cents. Compared with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 71 cents per share, the mid-point of the guidance reflects a decline of 3%. This guidance takes into consideration the negative impact of divestitures in 2016, partially offset by the acquisition of Peninsula Packaging and other buyouts completed in 2016.Old Corrugated Cardboard (OCC) and resin prices are on the rise. The company has implemented price increases. These increases, as well as contractual price adjustments, should offset the increased cost for OCC. A stronger dollar, weak results from single corrugated medium machine, and slowdown in manufacturing remain concerns.Price PerformanceSonoco has underperformed Zacks categorized Containers-Paper/Plastic industry in the past three months. The company’s shares gained around 1.2% compared with 9.9% growth recorded by the industry.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #2.

70,AVY,"W.W. Grainger, Inc. (GWW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers before the opening bell on Jul 19. In first-quarter 2017, Grainger posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.32%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Grainger will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below:Zacks ESP: Grainger has an Earnings ESP of -2.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.56 comes below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.62. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Grainger’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further lowers the predictive power of ESP. It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  W.W. Grainger, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | W.W. Grainger, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlayWe expect Grainger’s results to be affected by acceleration in its pricing actions. The company decided to accelerate its pricing actions this year instead of 2018 to gain new customers and grow with existing customers. The price acceleration is a headwind to its 2017 and 2018 gross margins.Grainger, in April, lowered its sales and earnings per share guidance for 2017 due to unfavorable impact of strategic pricing actions in the U.S. The company now sees sales growth of 1–4%, down from the earlier guidance of 2–6%. It also expects earnings per share to be in the range of $10.00–$11.30 compared to the previous view of $11.30–$12.40.Further, the company’s Canada segment continues to be challenged due to escalating expenses. Fluctuation in oil prices are also expected to hamper this segment’s results. Moreover, Grainger’s bottom line is likely to face the brunt of elevated expenses.Share Price PerformanceYear to date, Grainger has underperformed the Zacks classified Industrial Services sub-industry with respect to price performance. The stock lost around 26.8%, while the industry saw a decline of 22.2% over the same time frame.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #1, is slated to release its quarterly numbers on Jul 27.
